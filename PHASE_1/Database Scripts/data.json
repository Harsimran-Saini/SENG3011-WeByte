From 27 Mar 2020 until 1 Nov 2020, 89 children suffering from AES/JE were admitted to Muzaffarpur's Shrikrishna Medical College & Hospital in Bihar.\n\nThe above and previous reports do not indicate how many of the AES cases are due to Japanese encephalitis. As mentioned in many previous ProMED posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis (JE), enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and intoxication from lychee fruit consumption. Dr. T. Jacob John noted that hypoglycemic encephalopathy is triggered by litchi consumption, and Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, East Champaran, and Sitamarhi are litchi-growing districts in Bihar. These 4 are non-Japanese encephalitis districts (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) 20200831.7730992 and Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) corr, comment 20200902.7740196). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.\n\nThe report above does not indicate whether any of the etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of cases will not be possible.

Last year [2019], 642 cases were reported till December [2019], while 161 people died.\n\nMost of the deaths this year [2020] have been reported from Darrang, Barpeta, Sonitpur, Morigaon, Sivasagar, Kamrup, and Golapara districts.\n\n\"The health department has been able to contain the spread of Japanese encephalitis this year [2020] due to rigorous awareness activities; advertisements through newspapers, TV, radio, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter; regular follow up with districts; and community participation by including the Panchayati Raj Institutions, religious leaders, youth, and women. The number of cases has come down, especially in the endemic districts such as Sivasagar, Dibrugarh, and Lakhimpur, and in the districts wherein adult JE vaccination has been conducted in 2020 (Kokrajhar, South Salmara, and Golapara),\" said the report.\n\nAnother health department official, however, said the number of JE cases came down significantly this year [2020] as people remained indoors due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \"JE happens mainly in areas with agricultural activities, but this year, such activities were less due to the coronavirus pandemic. Also, people are more careful about their health this year due to the pandemic,\" he said.\n\nThe department also decided to provide an allowance of Rs 1000 [USD 13.60] to those infected with JE where the government ambulance service was not available. Financial assistance up to Rs 100 000 [USD 1360] is also being provided to patients undergoing treatment in private nursing homes.\n\n\"So far, 19 beneficiaries have been provided the financial assistance of Rs 100 000 [USD 1360] each,\" it said.\n\n[Byline: Sumir Karmakar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases continue to increase this year (2020) in Assam state, from 38 cases and 5 deaths reported on 9 Jul 2020, 184 cases and 24 deaths as of 22 Jul 2020, to at least 199 cases and 29 deaths on 27 Jul 2020, and now 318 cases with 51 deaths mentioned above. Interestingly, there is no mention of cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in the report above, which have been more frequent than JE cases in the previous reports from Assam this year (2020).\n\nAlthough mosquito control is not mentioned in the report above as a JE preventive measure, it is difficult to effectively accomplish in localities where the JE virus vectors -- _Culex_ spp. -- are abundant and widespread. Because the _Culex_ vector mosquitoes also breed in rice paddies, which may be extensive, vector control over large areas is difficult. The reduction in cases and deaths is attributed to vaccination and behavioral changes that have reduced exposure to vector mosquitoes. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection.\n\nMap of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nAssam State, India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20200728.7618995\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20200722.7602461\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (AS) 20200711.7563226\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (AS) 20200525.7373287\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (AS) 20200514.7337503019\n2019\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (27): (AS) 20190914.6673745\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (AS) 20190728.6591689\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (AS) 20190720.6578446\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20190716.6570013\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS, BR) 20190710.6561773\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (AS) 20190705.6552949\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20190703.6549201\n.................................................ty/msp/lm", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7740196", "archive_id": 7740196, "date": "2020-09-02 16:16:11", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) corr, comment", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (12): (BIHAR) CORRECTION, COMMENT\n***********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 1 Sep 2020\nFrom: Dr. T.

This 9 includes the 6 and 2 cases that you refer to in the text, with appropriate news media references. Of these 9, 2 were from neighboring districts (Vaishali and East Champaran) and 7 from Muzaffarpur district, within which is the city with the same name, where the SKMS Medical College Hospital is located.\n\nIt is clearly mentioned in one newspaper report that for one child the doctor did not give the recommended correct treatment of 10% dextrose, and later the child died. Now, the recommended treatment of 10% dextrose is for \"hypoglycemic encephalopathy,\" which is the annually recurring \"AES\" in Muzaffarpur district (see Sarkar A, Datta D, Datta SK, John TJ. Acute encephalopathy in children in Muzaffarpur, India: a review of aetiopathogenesis. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2020; 114: 704-11. https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/traa036).\n\nHypoglycemic encephalopathy is triggered by litchi consumption, and Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, East Champaran and Sitamarhi are litchi-growing districts in Bihar.\n\nThese 4 are non-Japanese encephalitis districts.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDr. T Jacob John\nRetired Professor, Clinical Virology\nChristian Medical College, Vellore\n439 Civil Supplies Godown Lane\nKamalakshipuram\nVellore 632002 India\n\n[ProMED appreciates Dr. John's correction of the misinterpretation of the previous report in ProMED post Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) 20200831.7730992 and regrets any confusion that the post may have caused.\n\nEspecially noteworthy in Dr. John's comments is identification of hypoglycemic encephalopathy as the etiology of cases often referred to as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). The article that Dr. John cites provides useful information about the occurrence of hypoglycemic encephalopathy and the mechanism involved in the pathophysiology. The abstract from that reference by Sarkar et al., cited above, follows:\n\nAbstract\n--------\nThe acute encephalopathy occurring in children in Muzaffarpur, India, also recognised in other litchi-cultivating areas of India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and China, had previously been linked to litchi consumption. Recently, it has been identified as hypoglycaemic encephalopathy of an unusual aetiology with 3 key factors: undernutrition, prolonged fasting and litchi consumption. A 2nd set of investigators has independently reconfirmed the diagnosis and the 3-factor aetiology. Skipping the evening meal with an intake of large amounts of litchi in undernourished children is causative. Early-morning hypoglycaemia with an inadequate glycogen store leads to initiation of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation, but methylene cyclopropyl alanine and glycine present in the litchi aril block the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle. The outcomes are uncorrected hypoglycaemia and encephalopathy due to the entry of metabolic intermediates that cross the blood-brain barrier and affect neuronal function. Suggested measures include early 10% dextrose infusion. Awareness about the disease is of prime importance. The diagnosis and aetiopathogenesis are still under question from a part of the scientific community. This review was undertaken to present a comprehensive view of hypoglycaemic encephalopathy and to remove some of the lingering doubts.\n\n---\nOne hopes that this publication will lead to prompt diagnosis of litchi-related hypoglycemic encephalopathy and the recommended treatment. It would be helpful if this term is used for the disease rather than acute encephalitis syndrome/AES, which does not indicate the etiology involved in these cases. In areas in northeastern India where Japanese encephalitis is endemic, laboratory diagnosis will be important for establishing the correct diagnosis, provision of appropriate treatment and implementation of appropriate preventive measures. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nBihar State, India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/364]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) 20200831.7730992\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (BR) 20200813.7676074\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20200511.7321107\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20200428.7278100\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20200419.7238745\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (BR) 20200331.7163711\n.................................................ml/ty/rd/ml", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7730992", "archive_id": 7730992, "date": "2020-08-31 13:02:50", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (12): (BIHAR)\n***************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[There is a correction of this report: Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) corr, comment 20200902.7740196.

The above report does not indicate if the 2 cases were laboratory confirmed or if the other suspected JE cases were being tested. Although mosquito control is mentioned in the above report as a JE preventive measure, it is difficult to effectively accomplish in localities where the JE virus vectors, _Culex_ spp., are abundant and widespread. The only feasible steps the communities could take are elimination of _Culex_ mosquito breeding sites within the community and avoidance of mosquito bites. Because the _Culex_ vector mosquitoes also breed in rice paddies, which may be extensive, vector control over large areas is difficult. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination campaigns in the affected areas. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nAssam State, India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299]\nSee Also\n2019\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (27): (AS) 20190914.6673745\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (AS) 20190728.6591689\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (AS) 20190720.6578446\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20190716.6570013\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (BR, AR) 20190714.6567249\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS, BR) 20190710.6561773\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (AS) 20190705.6552949\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20190703.6549201\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20190630.6544796\n2018\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (AS) 20181108.6132872\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20180818.5974190\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS) 20180812.5961217\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AS) 20180805.5948662\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (AS) 20180701.5883729\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20180628.5881510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10) 20180620.5866496\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20180618.58623\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20180523.581\n.................................................ty/tw/jh", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7321107", "archive_id": 7321107, "date": "2020-05-11 12:05:37", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (04): (BIHAR)\n***************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 9 May 2020 07:13 PM IST\nSource: Latestly [edited]\nhttps://www.latestly.com/india/news/acute-encephalitis-syndrome-in-bihar-child-dies-due-to-aes-in-muzaffarpur-hospital-fourth-death-recorded-this-year-1741155.html\n\n\nAnother death of a child was confirmed in Muzaffarpur [Bihar] due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).

Bihar was the hotspot for the spread of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in 2019. At this time, the outbreak of AES occurred in as many as 222 blocks of Muzaffarpur and the adjoining districts in Bihar.\n\nIn June last year [2019], an outbreak of AES occurred in Muzaffarpur and the adjoining districts of the state resulting in deaths of more than 150 children. The deaths were mainly due to hypoglycemia. In subsequent months more cases and deaths were reported. The cause of outbreak was however, unclear. The 1st case of AES in Muzaffarpur district was recorded in 1995. There were 143 deaths in 2013, 355 in 2014, 11 in 2015, 4 in 2016, 11 in 2017, and 7 in 2018.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The new cases admitted to the SKMCG indicate that the AES and Japanese encephalitis season is beginning in Bihar state as it has done annually for many years.

A smaller percentage tested positive for _Anaplasma_ and _Babesia_, 2 other causes of common tick-borne diseases.\n\nIn addition to providing information about the prevalence of tick-borne diseases in Maine, the report gives a picture of where and when people are encountering ticks throughout the state.\n\n\"This will serve as a sort of baseline to make comparisons as we move forward, to see how fast [ticks] are spreading and establishing new populations throughout Maine,\" said Griffin Dill, who manages the Tick Lab, located in the new UMaine Cooperative Extension Diagnostic and Research Laboratory in Orono.\n\nThis is a first-of-its-kind study for Maine. With additional data points in future years, it will give researchers a clearer look at the ticks roaming Maine, the types of diseases they carry and how this could impact Maine residents. They will also be able to see how tick populations and risks vary from year to year, allowing for better predictions of tick season outcomes.\n\nThe new report summarizes information that was gathered by the lab in 2019, which is the 1st year that the lab accepted tick samples from the public to test for tick-borne pathogens. It's free to send in ticks for identification. For USD 15, Maine residents could have deer ticks tested for causative agents of Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis -- the 3 most common tick-borne diseases in Maine.\n\nA total of 2697 ticks were submitted to the lab in 2019. The samples came from 358 towns, including ones from each of the state's 16 counties.\n\nThe majority of the submissions -- 2056 specimens -- were identified as deer ticks, and these were tested for disease. According to the report, 759 (38.8%) of the deer ticks tested positive for Lyme disease. About 8% tested positive for _Anaplasma_. And about 6% tested positive for _Babesia_.\n\nAmerican dog ticks also made up a significant portion of the submissions, with 585 specimens. In addition, 37 woodchuck ticks, 10 lone star ticks, one squirrel tick and one mouse tick were sent to the lab in 2019.\n\nThese species were not tested for diseases in 2019. But in 2020, the lab plans to expand the program and start testing American dog ticks and lone star ticks for the causative agents of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis and tularemia. The lab also plans to start testing deer ticks for _Borrelia miyamotoi_, which is similar to Lyme disease and has been diagnosed in Maine residents.\n\n\"The woodchuck tick is a little bit of an issue in that it's known to transmit Powassan virus,\" Dill said. \"Unfortunately we aren't going to be testing for Powassan virus this coming year. It's an entirely different type of testing that needs to be done for that.\"\n\nCollecting information from the public in this way is called \"passive surveillance\" and can potentially result in a bias toward certain geographic locations.\n\n\"We're relying on people to actually find the ticks and send them in. We're not actually going out and systematically searching the entire state,\" Dill said. \"That can lead to some biases in the information itself. For example, you'll notice there is some clustering around Bangor and the Orono area. That's where our lab is located, so it's easier to bring in a tick around there.\"\n\nNevertheless, Dill said that the maps generated for the report give a fairly good representation of where ticks and tick-borne diseases are found in Maine.\n\nThe report also includes information gathered from the survey that people fill out before sending in a tick for testing. This survey includes questions about where the ticks are found (often on a human body) and under what circumstances.\n\n\"We wanted to know a little bit about how ticks are behaving on the body,\" Dill said. \"That generated some interesting information about the difference of how ticks attach on adults versus children, which we somewhat expected.\"\n\nThe data show that ticks were more frequently found higher on the bodies of children than adults. Dill believes this is because children are shorter, so ticks have less of a distance to travel to reach areas like the neck and head.\n\nIn addition, the report includes what activities people were engaged in when they encountered ticks. \"Gardening-yard work\" was the most common activity by far, accounting for about 38% of the ticks sent to the lab. \"Walking\" came in second, accounting for about 20% of the ticks.\n\nFurthermore, the report showed when people encountered ticks in Maine in 2019. The data showed that Maine residents found the most adult deer ticks in late October and early November, with a smaller peak in April and May. Nymph deer ticks, which are smaller and younger than adult deer ticks, peaked in June and early July. And the number of American dog ticks found peaked in early summer, then dropped off.\n\nThe full report can be found at https://extension.umaine.edu/ticks/, where you can also learn how to submit a tick for testing.\n\nThe USD 15 test for tick-borne pathogens will continue to be available to the public for 2020. In addition, the public can send ticks to the lab for free identification, a service that the lab has offered for several years. The lab also plans to increase field monitoring for disease-carrying ticks throughout Maine.\n\n[Byline: Aislinn Sarnacki]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When a larva of the tick _Ixodes scapularis_ feeds on an infected rodent, after molting to nymph it can transmit the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the causative agent of Lyme disease) to the next host it feeds on. Adult ticks can also transmit the pathogen if they fed on infected rodents at an earlier stage. A prevalence near 40% is high, and it means that there are many infected white-footed mice (_Peromyscus leucopus_) on which ticks fed in their prior life stage. White-footed mice are the reservoir of _B. burgdorferi_. If ticks feed predominantly on that host, infection rates in ticks are to rise. When the rodent community is richer (i.e., it is composed by more rodent species), ticks are less likely to feed on infected white-footed mice and the prevalence may decrease. This is known as the \"dilution\" effect. It would be interesting to link these surveillance efforts to studies on the community of mammals that are hosts to _I. scapularis_. - Mod.PMB\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106\nMaine, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/222]\nSee Also\n2019\n----\nLyme disease - USA: (WV) dogs 20190505.6455719\n2018\n----\nLyme disease - USA: (WV) increased cases, 2017 20180730.5935492\n2017\n----\nAnaplasmosis, Lyme disease, babesiosis - USA: (ME) increased cases 20171114.5443131\nLyme disease - USA (05): (OH) increase cases 20171111.5438018\nLyme disease - USA (04): (NYC) 20170901.5288835\nLyme disease - USA (03): (WV) canine 20170523.5055389\nLyme disease - USA (02): (WV) canine 20170521.5050998\nLyme disease - USA: (AR) 20170228.4869049\n2016\n----\nLyme disease - USA (04): (PA) increased incidence 20161229.4731028\nLyme disease, anaplasmosis - USA (02): (ME) comment 20161216.4702583\nLyme disease, anaplasmosis - USA: (ME) incr. cases 20161214.4697848\nAnaplasmosis, babesiosis, Lyme disease - USA: (ME) increased incidence 20160825.4442433\nLyme disease - USA (03): (AL) increase cases 20160729.4379837\nLyme disease - USA (02): (upper Midwest region) new Borrelia species 20160222.4040006\nLyme disease - USA: (OH) increased incidence 20160106.3915628\n2015\n----\nLyme disease - USA (02): (PA) increased incidence 20150616.3443029\n.................................................sb/pmb/rd/jh", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6869668", "archive_id": 6869668, "date": "2020-01-03 16:23:59", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Undiagnosed pneumonia - China (HU) (02): updates, other country responses, RFI", "main_text": "UNDIAGNOSED PNEUMONIA - CHINA (HUBEI) (02): UPDATES, OTHER COUNTRY RESPONSES, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*****************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] China (Wuhan city), increase in cases, etiology pending - media report\n[2] Hong Kong letter to physicians - Center for Health Protection\n[3] Singapore, Taiwan screening - media report\n[4] Vietnam response to outbreak - media report\n\n******\n[1] China (Wuhan city), increase in cases, etiology pending\nDate: Fri 3 Jan 2020\nSource: Globe and Mail/Reuters [edited]\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-health-authorities-seek-to-identify-cause-of-pneumonia-outbreak-in/\n\n\nChinese health authorities are trying to identify what is causing an outbreak of pneumonia in the central city of Wuhan, officials said on Friday [3 Jan 2020], as the tally of cases rose to 44 and Singapore said it would screen arrivals on flights from there.\n\nAuthorities this week said they were investigating 27 cases of infection after rumours on social media suggested the outbreak could be linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said it was aware of the reports, is monitoring the situation and is in contact with the Chinese government about it. \"Investigations are still being carried out and authorities cannot yet confirm what pathogen is causing this illness,\" said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic. He added that there are several potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than SARS.\n\nChinese municipal health officials in Wuhan said in a statement on their website on Friday [3 Jan 2020] that they had ruled out common respiratory diseases, such as influenza, bird flu and adenovirus infection, as the cause.\n\nEleven of those infected were in critical condition and the rest stable, they said, adding that all had been isolated and doctors were observing 121 people with whom they had been in close contact.\n\nCleanup efforts at a seafood market where some victims were vendors have been completed, the city officials said, adding that no obvious human-to-human transmission had been seen and no medical staff had been infected.\n\nOn Friday [3 Jan 2020], Singapore's health ministry said it would begin temperature screening on passengers arriving on flights from Wuhan.\n\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic, apologize and vow full candour regarding future outbreaks.\n\nThe disease, which emerged in southern China late in 2002, spread rapidly to other cities and countries in 2003.

Among them, 11 cases (25%) were in serious condition and the remaining cases were in stable condition. Symptoms were mainly fever while a few had presented with shortness of breath. All patients have been isolated and receiving treatment. Contact tracing has identified 121 close contacts and medical surveillance by the Wuhan health authority is ongoing. Epidemiological investigations revealed that some cases were persons working in the market called \"South China Seafood City\" [machine translation]. It remained unknown whether the other cases had epidemiological linkage to this market.\n\nHowever, the NHC reported that no obvious human-to-human transmission has been observed and no healthcare workers have been infected for the time being. Influenza viruses, avian influenza viruses and other common respiratory pathogens like adenovirus have been excluded as the cause. The causative pathogen and cause of infection are still under investigation.\n\nIn light of the latest situation, the CHP has revised the reporting criteria today [3 Jan 2020] in order to widen the scope of surveillance. Please kindly report cases fulfilling the following updated reporting criteria to the CHP for prompt investigation:\n- Patient presented with fever and acute respiratory illness, or with pneumonia; and\n- Travel history to Wuhan within 14 days before onset of symptom (irrespective of any exposure to wet market or seafood market).\n\nIt is very important to obtain travel and exposure history from all patients presenting with fever and acute respiratory symptoms. If you identify any cases fulfilling the above criteria, please report to the Central Notification Office (CENO) of the CHP via fax (2477 2770), phone (2477 2772) or CENO On-line (https://cdis.chp.gov.hk/CDIS_CENO_ONLINE/ceno.html). Please use the attached form (see Annex) for reporting.\n\nPrivate doctors should call the Medical Control Officer (MCO) of the Department of Health at Pager 7116 3300 call 9179 when reporting any case. The CHP will make arrangement to transfer the patient to a public hospital for isolation, testing and treatment. While waiting for transfer, please isolate the patient to minimise contact/exposure to staff and other patients, and advise the patient to wear a surgical mask.\n\nThe CHP has set up a designated webpage (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/102465.html) to provide updated information and health advice. Information of the cases reported under the above enhanced surveillance will be updated on a daily basis on the above webpage.\n\nWe would also like to seek your assistance in providing health advice on personal and environmental hygiene to your patients. In particular, patients with respiratory symptoms are reminded to wear surgical masks.\n\nWe will closely monitor the situation and review the reporting criteria as appropriate. Please draw the attention of the healthcare professionals and supporting staff in your institution/working with you to the above. Thank you for your ongoing support in combating communicable diseases.\n\nYours faithfully,\n(Dr. SK Chuang)\nfor Controller, Centre for Health Protection\nDepartment of Health\n\n[The reporting form is available at the source URL (see Annex). - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[3] Singapore, Taiwan screening - media report\nDate: Thu 2 Jan 2020; updated Fri 3 Jan 2020 at 06:20 EST\nSource: Bloomberg News [edited]\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-03/pneumonia-outbreak-spurs-fever-checks-from-singapore-to-taiwan\n\n\nThe cause of a mysterious lung infection in China continues to elude disease-trackers as the number of reported cases in the outbreak climbs. As of Friday [3 Jan 2020], 44 people have been diagnosed with pneumonia, the cause of which is unknown, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement. That's up from 27 three days ago. Eleven are in serious condition.\n\nThe World Health Organization has been in touch the Chinese government and investigations are underway, though officials cannot yet confirm which pathogen is responsible, said spokesman Tarik Jasarevic in Geneva.\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Health said temperature screening will be implemented at Changi Airport for all travelers arriving from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. In Hong Kong, thermal imaging systems will be deployed as part of increased fever surveillance at boundary check points, authorities said. Taiwan has implemented similar measures, its Centers for Disease Control said Tuesday [31 Dec 2019].\n\nPathogen studies have ruled out common respiratory diseases, including influenza, avian flu and adenovirus infections, Wuhan health authorities said. Some of those with pneumonia worked at a fresh seafood and produce market in the city. All the patients are being treated under quarantine, according to the commission.\n\nThe market, which has since been closed, sold birds, pheasants, and snakes, along with organs of rabbits and other wildlife, the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy said Thursday [2 Jan 2020], citing media reports. That's triggered worries about the potential jump of an unknown virus to humans -- reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which killed almost 800 people about 17 years ago. The Wuhan Institute of Virology didn't respond to an emailed request for comment on the infectious source.\n\nSeveral people were arrested for circulating fake news online about the viral spread of pneumonia, provincial authorities said, adding that rumors on social media alleging that there had been an outbreak of SARS are untrue, and no person-to-person transmission has been found so far.\n\nThree travelers from Wuhan were admitted to hospitals in Hong Kong, though 2 were subsequently released, the South China Morning Post reported late Thursday [2 Jan 2020]. The city hasn't received any Wuhan-related severe pneumonia cases, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan told reporters Thursday.\n\nSingapore asked doctors to look out for suspected cases of pneumonia among people who have recently returned from Wuhan. \"Suspect cases with fever and acute respiratory illness or pneumonia and with travel history to Wuhan within 14 days before onset of symptoms will be isolated as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission,\" the city-state's Ministry of Health said in a Facebook post.\n\n[Byline: Jason Gale]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] Vietnam response to outbreak - media report\nDate: Fri 3 Jan 2020\nSource: VN Express [edited]\nhttps://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-wary-as-china-pneumonia-outbreak-could-be-linked-to-sars-4036786.html\n\n\nThe Vietnamese Ministry of Health is closely monitoring the situation on the China border following news of a pneumonia outbreak in that country.\n\nChina has reported several cases of acute pneumonia in Hubei Province's Wuhan City, 1500 km (932 mi) northeast of the border, since December [2019], according to the ministry's General Department of Preventative Medicine.\n\nAs of Tuesday [31 Dec 2019], 27 cases have been confirmed, with 7 people reportedly in critical condition, it added. The Chinese Ministry of Health is investigating the source of the infection and seeks to contain the outbreak.\n\nThere is no clear evidence yet that it has been transmitted between humans, with preliminary tests indicating it is an outbreak of viral pneumonia, according to the Vietnamese department. The Vietnamese Ministry of Health is collaborating with the World Health Organization to keep its citizens updated on the situation and devise preventive measures.\n\nThe outbreak is suspected to be linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China in 2002 and spread to other countries, including Vietnam, in 2003, Chinese media reported.

We do know that there are more cases that have been identified, but we do not know how many of these individuals have known contact/time spent in the seafood market. We also now know that avian influenza, influenza, and adenovirus have been eliminated. We do not know if a SARS-like coronavirus has been identified, albeit there have been numerous unsubstantiated reports mentioning a novel coronavirus that is SARS-like. A Twitter thread mentioned a report from the lab in Wuhan saying such a virus had been identified. We also heard from a reliable source that there was a SARS-like coronavirus identified, and most recently a Hong Kong media report (in Chinese/machine translated) mentions a novel coronavirus has been identified (see https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20200103/60448286).

Everything is being made available from medicines to doctors. We have even called doctors and nurses from AIIMS in Patna,\" he said. \"There is a protocol regarding what kind of medicines and facilities should be given and we are doing the same. We are monitoring things regularly and trying to save our children.\"\n\nRecalling the situation that prevailed 5 years ago, Pandey said a team that was formed to ascertain the cause of this disease concluded that sleeping empty stomach at night, dehydration due to humidity and eating lychee on empty stomach were some of the causes of encephalitis.\n\n\"Our government has tried to spread awareness which will be beneficial as well. Advertisement in newspapers, radio jingles, pamphlets and mic [microphone] announcements are going to spread awareness regarding the disease. Health ministry is also working on it,\" he said.\n\nOn being asked about spread of ASE in Gorakhpur last year [2018], he said, \"From Gorakhpur to Muzaffarpur region, this disease had spread last year and the Union government had worked on this and we will continue to fight it now.\"\n\n\"This incident in Muzaffarpur is very saddening and we also feel bad when children of our nation die like this. Not the whole district is affected but a large part is suffering from it,\" he added.\n\nFrom [1 Jan 2019], until now [5 Dec 2019], 220 children were admitted in Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital in Muzaffarpur due to AES, out of which 62 lost their lives.\n\nAs per the data of SKMCH hospital, 235 children were admitted, of which 89 died; in 2013 - 90 children were admitted, of which 35 died; in 2014 - 334 children were admitted, of which 117 died; in 2015 - 37 children were admitted, of which 15 died; in 2016 - 31 children were admitted, of which 6 died; in 2017 - 44 children were admitted, of which 18 died; and in 2018 - 43 children were admitted, of which 12 died.\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of State for Union ministry for home affairs, Nityanand Rai, visited Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital to review the situation after the outbreak of AES.\n\nEncephalitis is a viral disease, which causes mild flu-like symptoms such as high fever, convulsions and headaches and has been claiming lives in the district for the past few weeks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The dates within which these AES cases have occurred is not stated. The urgency that has prompted Behar health officials to request the aid of physicians and nurses from adjoining Patna suggests that the AES outbreak is going on currently. The uncertainty about the etiology of AES continues. It is curious that the above report makes no mention of negative or positive tests for Japanese encephalitis among the AES patients, although that virus is endemic in northeastern India, including Bihar state. Neighboring Uttar Pradesh state has had JE cases as well this summer (2019) but has intensified its JE vaccination program.\n\nThe issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. Lychee fruit contain toxins. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit contains phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, the current cases cannot be due to lychee consumption, since the season for that fruit has passed.\n\nAES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication (reference below) states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible.\n\nReference:\nRavi V, Hameed SKS, Desai A, et al.

Powassan virus encephalitis, severe babesiosis and Lyme carditis in a single patient.\n--------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n_Ixodes scapularis_ is responsible for transmission of _Borrelia burgdorferi_, _B. miyamotoi_, _Babesia microti_, _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and Powassan virus to humans. We present a case of an 87-year-old man who presented with fever and altered mental status. Initial workup revealed haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, mild hepatitis and acute kidney injury. Patient tested positive for _B. burgdorferi_ and _Babesia microti_, and was started on doxycycline, atovaquone and azithromycin. He also underwent exchange transfusion twice. After some initial improvement, patient had acute deterioration of mental status and appearance of neurological findings like myoclonus and tremors. Therefore, testing for arboviruses was done, and results were positive for Powassan virus. During a protracted course of hospitalisation, patient required intubation for respiratory failure and temporary pacemaker for unstable arrythmias from Lyme carditis. Patient developed permanent neurological deficits even after recovery from the acute illness.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[Infection with 3 tick-borne pathogens simultaneously is unusual. _Ixodes scapulars_ is a vector for all 3 pathogens involved in this case. One does not know whether one individual tick delivered all 3 pathogens in this case or more than one individual tick was involved.

There is an alarming increase in the number of viral encephalitis cases being reported across city hospitals. This is ironic as October is medically termed as 'fair-weather' season. The rise in the number of cases has been worrisome and those getting inflicted include children and elders.\n\nMany are complaining of fever of the brain with body temperature touching [106-107 deg F/41.1-41.6 deg C].\n\nAccording to doctors, at least 3 cases are reported each week in the tertiary hospitals of which 7 major ones are in the city.\n\nDr Shyam Jaiswal, neurologist at Care Hospitals, explains, \"Of late, we have been admitting viral encephalitis-affected children in the hospital. Most fall sick because of the body's low immunity. Immediate hospital care is a must as most complain of severe headache, delirium, and in some cases even loss of memory. The treatment takes between 2-3 days.\"\n\nIt is a medical nightmare that some elders are suffering from both chikungunya and viral encephalitis.\n\nDr Hari Kishan B, general physician with Apollo Hospitals, explains, \"The combination of chikungunya and viral encephalitis has been noted earlier too. These are rare cases but do occur from time to time. The viral infections have been very high this year [2019] and those suffering from diabetes, hypertension, and other cardiovascular ailments, will suffer more when infected with these viruses.\"\n\n[Byline: Kaniza Garari]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report does not provide total case numbers, nor indicate how long 2-3 cases per week have been occurring.

However, its sudden outbreak in September [2019], when the litchi season had been long over, has confused and confounded them.\n\n\"Hypoglycemia, excessive heat and malnutrition could be the reasons behind the AES strike, but we can't give the exact reason. Research is on,\" Shahi said.\n\nHe added: \"At present, 12 children are admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit of the SKMCH. They suffer from convulsions and sudden bouts of high fever, which are similar to the AES. While tests have confirmed 3 of them are suffering from AES, the pathological tests of other children are being conducted to ascertain the cause.\"\n\nAccording to him, 30 cases were reported in July [2019], 18 in August 2019, while at least 12 cases have been reported this month [September 2019]. In all, 647 cases have been reported from this year [2019] out of which 161 children died.\n\nMeanwhile, media reports have claimed that the number of children who have died is 8.\n\nDirector of the National Research Centre on Litchi Vishal Nath said litchis had never been the reason behind the AES epidemic, and the sudden outbreak of this disease at this time had proved that.\n\n\"It's the health experts who have to find out what are the exact causes of this mystery disease, but it is now very much confirmed that litchis have no connection with this disease,\" Nath said on 20 Sep [2019], asserting that he had been saying this for a long time.\n\n\"Litchis contain no elements that could harm the children; rather it is a nutrient,\" he said, adding that the fruit has been grown in Muzaffarpur for the past 200-300 years, but this disease had come to light only recently.\n\nMuzaffarpur civil surgeon Shailesh Prasad Singh said the local administration had launched a massive awareness campaign in the district to make the people aware of this disease and its preventive measures.\n\n\"Through the campaign, the villagers are being constantly told not to allow their children to play under the sun, to save them from humidity and make sure their children take their food before going to bed at night,\" Singh said.\n\nAccording to him, one of the major causes of AES outbreaks could be malnutrition. \"We have opened a 20-bed Nutrition and Rehabilitation Centre at the Sadar hospital and regularly admitted children suffering from malnutrition for their treatment. Currently, 16 children are undergoing treatment there,\" Singh said.\n\nHealth officials said the suspected encephalitis has been striking the region since 1995, but in the past 9 years, it had claimed 474 lives in the state, and yet it was still to be fully identified and brought under control.\n\n[Byline: C K Manoj]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The uncertainty about the etiology of AES continues. It is curious that the above report makes no mention of negative or positive tests for Japanese encephalitis among the AES patients, although that virus is endemic in northeastern India, including Bihar state. There has been active JE transmission in Assam state up to the present time that indicates that the season for transmission of this virus in the region is still underway. Neighboring Uttar Pradesh state has had JE cases as well this summer (2019) but has intensified its JE vaccination program.\n\nThe issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. The statement that lychee fruit does not contain toxins is not correct. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, it is correct that the current cases cannot be due to lychee consumption, since the season for that fruit has passed.\n\nAES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication (reference below) states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. - Mod.TY\n\nReference:\nRavi V, Hameed SKS, Desai A, et al.

Uttar Pradesh reported a total of 2871 cases of AES in 2019, out of which 83% (2389 cases) were from districts in the Gorakhpur region. The regional ecosystem in Gorakhpur comprises rivers, lakes, irrigation canals, reservoirs and rice fields and the flood-prone region is endemic for AES.\n\nThe Tata Trusts' initiative to combat AES, named Project Prayaas, aims to effectively prevent and control the spread of AES in this region. The intervention is focused on the 2 most vulnerable blocks in the district, and covers a population of over 200 000 people. An estimated 20 000 children will undergo tracking for fever or any kind of symptom.\n\nProject Prayaas, which covers water and sanitation along with health care, performs the following health-specific interventions in this region:\n- Track children (0-5 years) to ensure 100% coverage of Japanese encephalitis immunisation.\n- Deploy well-equipped mobile medical units to strengthen the primary healthcare delivery system.\n- Manage childhood illness by early identification, and prompt referral of AES cases, so as to prevent potential complications.\n- Collaborate with the district National Vector Borne Diseases Control Project (NVBDCP) department and Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC), Pune, to execute vector control strategies.\n- Execute community-based communication strategies to prevent AES.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although ProMED-mail has not received a report of Japanese encephalitis (JE) or AES in Uttar Pradesh state since 4 Jul 2019, it is evident that cases have continued to occur there. JE and AES cases with fatalities are reported in Uttar Pradesh every year. It is not clear from the report above the proportion of cases that are due to JE and what proportion are attributed to AES of unidentified etiology, although the inclusion of tracking children (0-5 years) to ensure 100% coverage of JE immunisation in the list of initiatives implies that a significant proportion of these cases are due to JE virus infections. Also, AES above is attributed to an unnamed virus. Interestingly, there have been cases of AES attributed by some to consumption of lychee fruit by malnourished children in neighboring Behar state. As noted in comments on previous posts, although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent Behar reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus, is responsible for some of the cases.\n\nThe determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. One hopes that now by sending each sample to the National Institute of Virology, the presence of dengue and enteroviruses can be included or ruled out in AES cases. - Mod.TY\n\nReference:\nRavi V, Hameed SKS, Desai A, et al.

We plan to conclude it by [15 Mar 2020]. The Centre has agreed to provide around 57 lakh vaccines. We will procure the rest on our own if there is a shortfall,\" Samir Sinha, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department said. The campaign is likely to be announced in a week.\n\nOn Thursday [12 Sep 2019], while no fresh JE cases were reported, one person from Kamrup (Rural) succumbed to the disease that is spread by _Culex_ mosquitoes, according to the daily bulletin from the office of JVN Subramanyam, Director, National Health Mission (NHM), Assam.\n\nThe state recorded 614 JE positive cases in 2015, 427 in 2016, 605 in 2017 and 509 in 2018. In 2015, the number of deaths due to JE stood at 135; in 2016 the number came down to 92 and further decreased to 87 in 2017. In 2018, the state saw 94 deaths due to the vector-borne disease. In 2014, the state recorded 165 deaths due to JE.\n\nThe bulletin from NHM said till 12 Sep [2019], the total number of persons who have been affected by JE stood at 630, out of which 154 people have died. While 13 persons who died belonged to Goalpara, 11 came from Kamrup (Rural), the 2 neighbouring districts in lower Assam where maximum fatalities have been recorded this year [2019]. Kokrajhar, in Bodo Territorial Administrative District, has not reported any JE positive case for the 1st time in the last 6 years, even as the rest of the state has been affected in [the] 2019 outbreak.\n\n\"Since the last 4, 5 years were relatively calm and quiet, this year [2019] the peripheral workers seemed to be reluctant to perform their field duties properly. During my visit to Goalpara, I found that peripheral workers did not attend to cases of fever initially,\" said CR Pathak, State Programme Officer of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, explaining how the lax attitude of the ground staff may have added to the late detection and higher fatalities.\n\nPathak pointed out another reason and explained how a lot of ground staff, the multipurpose workers were involved in National Register of Citizens (NRC) duty. \"I am sure the NRC authorities also did not know that the outbreak would be severe this year. We recalled the workers in July [2019],\" he said.\n\nHealth officials also introduced urgent measures like fogging, blood sample collection of all cases of fever and sending all suspected JE cases for proper tests, treatment at civil hospitals and medical colleges, among others.\n\n\"Post July [2019] the number of fresh cases have been on a decline,\" said Pathak.\n\nSinha said, \"The last 10 deaths are all old cases.\" In September [2019], only 4 fresh cases have been recorded in the state. Unlike previous years when the disease was mostly confined to Upper Assam and North Assam, the whole state was affected this time, he said.\n\nHe said analysis also showed that the adults constituted almost 80% of the casualties. \"The writing on the wall is clear. Vaccination of persons in the age group of 15-65 is the way forward to contain it,\" Sinha said.\n\nWhile the entire state has been covered under the JE vaccination campaign for children, 14 have been covered under the adult vaccination campaign in a phased manner. Officials point out the coverage [of the] latter has not been satisfactory for a multitude of reasons, including rumours about the effects of the vaccine.\n\nRecords show even vaccination is not a foolproof way to stop the outbreak. \"This year [2019], too, 15%-20% of the casualties would be from the section which had been given JE vaccination. We know that JE vaccine is effective in around 85% of the cases and depends on immunity of the persons among other factors,\" said Pathak.\n\n[Byline: Sadiq Naqvi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[All the above cases are attributed to Japanese encephalitis (JE), with no mention of non-JE acute encephalitis syndrome that was mentioned in the previous Assam report (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (AS) 20190728.6591689). It is not stated if the vaccine used is inactivated or a live modified one. The immunity of inactivated vaccine likely is of considerably shorter duration than a live vaccine would be. It is unfortunate to learn that the rumor that the vaccine is not safe reduces coverage of the population at risk of infection. The price paid for this rumor is a population of increased susceptibility with more cases and deaths.

Of the ill people, 60 (46%) are female, and of 110 ill people with information available, 33 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nPredicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 92 isolates: 87 from ill people and 5 from pig ears. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for 2 human isolates; the remaining 90 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Testing of 9 clinical isolates using standard antibacterial susceptibility testing methods by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications and may require a different choice.\n\nInvestigation of the outbreak\n--------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. Of 100 ill people, 88 (88%) reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 80 people with available information, 56 (70%) reported contact with pig ear treats or with dogs who were fed pig ears. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.\n\nHealth and regulatory officials from Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and the FDA collected pig ears from ill people's homes, retail locations where ill people reported buying the products, or from suppliers and distributors to those locations. Testing identified _Salmonella_ in over 90 samples, with many different strains. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _Salmonella_ Infantis, _Salmonella_ London, and _Salmonella_ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation. Additional _Salmonella_ serotypes Anatum, Brandenburg, Give, Livingstone, Panama, Seftenberg, Typhimurium, Uganda, and Worthington were identified. Investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to these strains.\n\nSome of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was another issue that led to contamination.\n\nSeveral firms have recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with one or more of the outbreak strains. On 3 Jul 2019, Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins. On 26 Jul 2019, Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears. On 30 Jul 2019, Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. On 16 Aug 2019, Dog Goods USA LLC recalled bulk and packaged Chef Toby Pig Ears. On 3 Sep 2019, Dog Goods USA LLC recalled all 30-packs of Berkley & Jensen brand pig ears sold at BJ's Wholesale Club stores. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.\n\nInformation collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. The CDC and FDA recommend that people do not buy pig ear pet treats or feed them to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. The CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing. The CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\nPet owners can take steps to keep their families healthy while feeding pets (https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/publications/pet-food-safety.html).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.\n\nThe designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:\n- the \"I\" reflects subspecies _enterica_;\n- the \"4, [5], 12\" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;\n- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\nSee Also\nSalmonellosis - USA (05): live poultry, multiple serotypes, fatal 20190905.6659617\nSalmonellosis - USA (04): (WI) natural food facility 20190904.6657402\nSalmonellosis, st.

Of the 35 from Upper Subansiri 2 samples, 4 out of the 15 from West Siang and one out of the 14 from Longding district have tested positive, it said.\n\n\"The test was done with single dilution antigen pre-coated indirect ELISA kits in the disease investigation laboratory in Nirjuli in Papum Pare district,\" it said.\n\nDr. Gyamnya Baki Garam, a veterinary microbiologist working in the disease investigation laboratory, said there are more than 200 zoonotic diseases and JE is one of them. \"There is no need to panic. The case fatality rate of JE is the same as dengue fever, chikungunya and yellow fever diseases, which are also transmitted by mosquitoes. Migratory birds like egret and herons play an important role in spreading JE from one place to another,\" Dr. Garam said.\n\nAnimal Health Joint Director Dr. Tachi Taku urged pig owners to cooperate with the department's field staffs in collecting blood samples. He said the details of the test report have been sent to the district authority, the NVBDCP in-charge, and the animal owners, so that the vector control programme can be intensified.\n\nStating that the department is now capable of performing any ELISA-based testing, Dr. Taku instructed field veterinary officers to collect blood samples, especially before the onset of monsoon, \"so that the potential area can be identified for intensifying the vector/mosquitoes control programme.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There has been active transmission of JE virus in Arunchal Pradesh state this year with several human cases. Although birds such as herons are reservoir hosts of JE virus, pigs are amplifying hosts of the virus and can serve as sentinels that are useful in indicating that active JE virus transmission in occurring in the area. Although mosquito vector control is difficult, an indication that virus transmission is occurring can be useful as a basis for providing public education about the need to avoid mosquito bites or indication about where vaccination campaigns for humans can be focused. Use of serially sampled sentinel herds of susceptible domestic animals has been a useful surveillance tool for arboviruses. JE virus infections are not a serious cause of disease in adult pigs but can elicit still births and cause mortality among piglets. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/364.\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nArunachal Pradesh State, India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/298]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (AR) 20190717.6571909\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (BR, AR) 20190714.6567249\n.................................................sb/lxl/ty/ao/lxl", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6619171", "archive_id": 6619171, "date": "2019-08-13 13:28:07", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (NL,AS,BR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (25): (NAGALAND, ASSAM, BIHAR)\n********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Nagaland\n[2] Assam\n[3] Bihar (Muzaffarpur): children\n[4] Bihar: malnutrition\n\n******\n[1] Nagaland\nDate: Wed 7 Aug 2019 12:10:43 PM IST\nSource: Nagaland Post [edited]\nhttp://www.nagalandpost.com/13-test-positive-for-je-2-dead/201342.html\n\n\nOut of 57 individuals, 13 have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis (JE) in [Nagaland] State, with reports of 2 dying till date due to the vector-borne disease.\n\nStating this, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) programme officer and Health & Family Welfare deputy director, Dr Neisakho Kere told Nagaland Post over telephone on [Wed 7 Aug 2019] that out of the 13 positive JE cases, 4 hailed from Assam and 9 from Nagaland, mainly from Dimapur and Mokokchung.\n\nAnd out of the 2 deaths reported so far, one was from Dimapur and another from Mokokchung, while the rest had been discharged after treatment, he added.\n\nDr Kere claimed that the Health department had been able to contain the disease till date with various preventive measures. In this regard, he explained that as soon as a JE positive case was reported, health workers were sent to find out the history of where the person got infection and check whether the person had gone out of the State. Entomological teams were also being sent out for vector study and detect presence of _Culex_ mosquitoes, after which fogging was carried out in high risks areas, he added.\n\nHe said workers were also sent to control larvae cycle of mosquitoes mostly present in stagnant water.\n\nReferring to introduction of larvivorous fish in paddy fields and other stagnant bodies to eat mosquito larvae, the deputy director said larvivorous fish was available under Urban Malaria Scheme at Dimapur chief medical officer's office and was distributed every month.\n\nHe claimed that many other preventive measures were being carried out to curb the disease.\n\nEmphasising on the importance of community participation and cooperation that were vital to reduce source reduction, the deputy director appealed to the community to extend support as the department alone could not control JE, dengue or any other vector borne disease in Dimapur district. He explained that source reduction could be achieved by keeping the surroundings clean, removing objects that could collect stagnant water around homes and using mosquito repellents during the day and sleeping under LLIN [mosquito net impregnated with insecticide] bed nets at night.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of JE cases continues to grow in Nagaland. On 19 Jul 2019 officials reported 30 suspected and 9 positive JE cases. The numbers are now 57 suspected cases and 13 positives, with 2 deaths. As noted in the previous post, it is not surprising that JE cases are occurring in Nagaland. It is adjacent to Assam state, where a JE outbreak with additional cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) are occurring. In these Nagaland reports, however, no AES cases are mentioned. Since this is still the JE virus transmission season it is likely that there will be more cases over the next 2 months. Although JE vaccine is available, neither this or previous reports say if there have been recent JE vaccination campaigns in the affected areas, or if any are planned. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142]\n\n******\n[2] Assam\nDate: Sun 11 Aug 2019 9:07 IST\nSource: The Times of India [edited]\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/japanese-encephalitis-cases-on-the-decline-in-assam/articleshow/70627892.cms\n\n\nAfter having claimed 142 lives in Assam this year [2019], cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) are finally on the decline. According to the latest figures available with the National Health Mission (NHM), Assam, no fresh JE deaths and positive cases have been reported in the last 2 days\n\nThough official said that the possibility of new JE cases persist till September, this year [2019], the decline in the number of deaths from the deadly viral disease in the 1st half of August itself has shown that the efforts and sincerity of the health officials have yielded a positive outcome. Alarmed over the JE menace, central teams visited Assam during 30 Jun-1 Jul [2019] and 8-10 Jul [2019] to review the situation and provide technical assistance to the state.\n\n\"June-July is the peak season for JE outbreak.

But this year [2019], eventually the administrative system took immediate measures after the JE menace set alarm bells ringing in the state this monsoon,\" said an NHM official.\n\nWhile on an average, 25-35 fresh cases of JE were reported on a daily basis during the peak period in mid-July [2019], this week (from Sunday to Friday [4-9 Aug 2019]) a total of 13 JE-positive cases were reported on [Wed 7 Aug 2019] -- the highest number of deaths in a day in that period of time. From Sunday to Friday, a total of 4 JE death cases have been confirmed by NHM.\n\nFrom January, a total of 606 JE-positive cases were reported from various parts of the state, while the death toll due to the viral disease has touched 142 in Assam.\n\nHealth experts say mosquito-borne diseases are usually prevalent in Assam mainly due to wet weather conditions and dense vegetation. But this year [2019], JE has spread out from the upper Assam region to across the state, with pig-rearing for earning livelihood gaining popularity across the state. Pigs and wild birds are the main carriers of the JE virus mainly during the monsoon season, when stagnant water creates conducive atmosphere for breeding of the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito -- the primary vector.\n\n[Byline: Kangkan Kalita]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Interestingly, no mention is made above of cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) whereas the previous report stated that according to the National Health Mission (NHM) 23 Jul 2019 report, a total of 222 deaths have occurred in the state since January [2019] due to JE and AES. The number of deaths due to JE alone in that earlier report is not given. Currently, the number of JE deaths has now increased to 142. The earlier NHM report further stated that the total number of JE/AES positive cases during this period was 1569. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] Bihar (Muzaffarpur): children\nDate: Fri 9 Aug 2019 16:26:18 IST\nSource: Firstpost, Asian News International report [edited]\nhttps://www.firstpost.com/health/54-children-dead-in-bihars-muzaffarpur-due-to-acute-encephalitis-syndrome-137-hospitalised-with-symptoms-6810571.html\n\n\nAs many as 54 children have died over the past few weeks due to the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and over 130 have been hospitalised till now in Bihar's Muzaffarpur.\n\nA total of 46 patients died at Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), while 8 succumbed at the private Kejriwal Hospital in Muzaffarpur.\n\nEarlier on [Thu 8 Aug 2019], Civil Surgeon Shailesh Kumar Singh said, \"47 children have died due to AES and 137 are admitted in hospitals with high fever and other symptoms of the infection. 137 people were admitted in SKMCH hospital out of whom 40 causalities were reported.\"\n\nApart from this, Singh had said: \"41 people were admitted in Kejriwal Hospital where 7 causalities were reported, taking the death toll to 47.\"\n\nEncephalitis is a viral infection which causes mild flu-like symptoms such as high fever, convulsions, and headaches.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of reported fatal AES cases in Bihar was 142 in Muzaffarpur district as of 8 Jul 2019; the report above indicates that there are 47 deaths and the report below indicates that at least 109 children have died.

In the city of Muzaffarpur, there are reports of at least 109 children that have died after \"inflammation and infection\" that targets the brain.\n\nAccording to a CNN report, 2 hospitals in the region alone have more than 400 children complaining of fever, dizziness, and delirium have been admitted since the start of 2019. \"Between 2008 and 2014, there have been more than 44 000 cases and nearly 6000 deaths from encephalitis in India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh [UP] and Bihar, according to a research paper published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2017,\" the report reads.\n\nHowever, there has been a lot of confusion and misinformation about the outbreak itself -- its cause, what makes children unusually vulnerable, and that strange connection to litchis [lychee], in news reports about the outbreak.\n\nWe spoke to Prof Dr Kishore Kumar, Chairman & Managing Director of Cloudnine Hospitals in Bangalore to clarify some of the piling misinformation about the outbreak in Bihar.\n\nConsidering the confusion and doubts as to what this outbreak really is, can you clarify?\nWhat happened in Uttar Pradesh 2 years ago was an infection and that infection is a fairly extreme medical condition. However, the breakout that is happening in Bihar right now is something called acute encephalitis syndrome -- this is an \"encephalopathy\" not technically an infection, that is, \"encephalitis\".\n\nAn encephalopathy, simply put, is an umbrella term for a disease, damage, or malfunction in the brain, ranging in symptoms that are mild (like memory loss or subtle personality changes) to severe (like dementia, seizures, coma, or even death). In a case of acute encephalitis syndrome however, there is no bacterium or virus involved. An epidemic of AES would typically happen around mid-April to mid-June, at the start of monsoon and litchi season.\n\nJust last year [2018], there was a study looking into what the issue is here. It's quite clear that while the infection itself (encephalitis) also affects UP, this particular outbreak isn't an infection -- it has to do with malnutrition and access to a lot of litchis.\n\nSo, if it's not an infection, what's causing it?\nThe vast majority of AES victims in Bihar were undernourished children, who didn't eat a meal at night before falling asleep. When people -- particularly children, who have considerably lower levels of body fat than adults -- sleep without eating dinner, their body depends on reserves of glycogen released by the liver, the organ in which fat is also broken down in our body. Glucose, which is the main currency of energy in the body, is stored in the form of glycogen in the liver. In undernourished kids more so than adults, these stores are low -- sometimes dangerously so.\n\nWhen glycogen reserves are depleted in the liver, the body draws energy from less-ideal sources like muscle and connective tissue. This reaction -- which also takes place in the liver -- produces many products like ketones and amino acids that can be neurotoxic at above-average levels, that is, they can have damaging effects on the brain or peripheral nervous system if their levels are \"high\" in the bloodstream. We're seeing symptoms of this damage in the children in Bihar.\n\nHow are AES and litchis connected?\nIn undernourished people, the body turns to sources like lactate or proteins to produce glucose (the only natural energy currency powering normal brain function) in a process called gluconeogenesis. With litchis widely-farmed in UP, children may consume litchis in abundance simply because it is readily available in their farms and homes. There's a very simple reason AES affects undernourished children and not healthy ones. A series of studies from similar incidents of AES in the past by Jacob Jon, a senior paediatrician in Vellore, proves there's a link between an enzyme in litchis and instances of AES.\n\nThe enzyme methylenecyclopropylglycine (mercifully called 'MCPG') in litchis can trigger a stark overnight dip in sugar levels (a condition called hypoglycaemia) because it blocks a key enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis. In malnourished kids, this cut-off from sources of energy other than glycogen can cause fever, convulsions and at times, a loss of consciousness.\n\nHealth experts have attributed heat and humidity to the large number of AES cases as well. Is this possible?\nHeat waves can contribute to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, but a glucose imbalance points to something else being the cause.\n\n[Byline: Kavya Narayanan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As noted in comments on several previous posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to JE, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption as noted above, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined and the etiologies mentioned ruled in or out, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (ML) 20190729.6593137\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (AS) 20190728.6591689\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (NL) 20190722.6579447\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (AS) 20190720.6578446\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS, BR) 20190710.6561773\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AS) 20190708.6557798\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20190703.6549201\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20190630.6544796\nand other items in the archives\n.................................................sb/jh/ty/mj/lxl", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6600332", "archive_id": 6600332, "date": "2019-08-01 17:10:32", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Salmonellosis, st I 4,[5],12:i:- - USA (03): pig ear dog treats, other serotypes", "main_text": "SALMONELLOSIS, SEROTYPE I 4,[5],12:I:- - USA (03): PIG EAR DOG TREATS, OTHER SEROTYPES\n**************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 31 Jul 2019\nSource: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, salmonella homepage, [edited]\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/pet-treats-07-19/index.html\n\n\nOutbreak of multidrug-resistant Salmonella infections linked to contact with pig ear dog treats\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ serotypes I 4,[5],12:i:-, Infantis, Newport, and London infections linked to contact with pig ear dog treats. As of [31 Jul 2019], a total of 127 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 33 states.\n\nState / Ill People\n----------------------\nAlabama / 1\nArizona / 1\nCalifornia / 1\nColorado / 3\nConnecticut / 1\nFlorida / 3\nGeorgia / 2\nHawaii / 1\nIllinois / 7\nIndiana / 5\nIowa / 23\nKansas / 3\nKentucky / 6\nLouisiana / 1\nMaine / 1\nMassachusetts / 4\nMichigan / 12\nMinnesota / 1\nMissouri / 6\nNew Hampshire / 1\nNew Jersey / 2\nNew Mexico / 1\nNew York / 15\nNorth Carolina / 2\nNorth Dakota / 1\nOhio / 5\nOregon / 2\nPennsylvania / 6\nSouth Carolina / 2\nTexas / 2\nUtah / 1\nWashington / 1\nWisconsin / 4\n-------------\nTotal / 127\n\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Jun 2015] to [6 Jul 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 40 years. A total of 55 (45%) ill people are female. Of 88 ill people with information available, 26 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nPredicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 71 isolates from ill people. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for one isolate; the remaining 70 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications, and may require a different choice.\n\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. A total of 76 (89%) of 85 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 62 people with available information, 45 (73%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.\n\nDuring the investigation, health and regulatory officials from Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and FDA collected pig ears at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products or their suppliers and distributors. Testing identified many different strains of _Salmonella_. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _S._ Infantis, _S._ London, and _S._ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation.\n\nAdditional _Salmonella_ strains were isolated from pig ears, and investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to those strains. Those strains include _S._ Panama, _S._ Brandenburg, _S._ Anatum, and _S._ Livingstone.\n\nSome of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, and Brazil. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was a another issue that led to _Salmonella_ contamination.\n\nOn [3 Jul 2019], Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [26 Jul 2019], Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [30 Jul 2019] Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.\n\nInformation collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. CDC and FDA recommend that people do not purchase or feed any pig ear pet treats to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A handful of the newly added cases seem to be from infections occurring between 2015-2017.\n\nAs a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.\n\nThe designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:\n- the \"I\" reflects subspecies _enterica_;\n- the \"4, [5] 12\" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism.

It is a viral disease, which causes mild flu-like symptoms such as high fever and headache. Maharashtra's public health department had managed to keep the number of deaths as low as one dead in 2017 and 2018 and zero deaths in 2019.\n\nLooking at the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) data from 2013 till April 2019, there have been only 2 deaths due to AES.\n\nAccording to Maharashtra's health department, good medical facilities and routine check-ups have reduced the number of Japanese encephalitis (JE+ve) and Chandipura virus cases in the state which constitutes encephalitis illness.\n\nState entomologist Mahendra Jagtap, said, \"AES cases are diagnosed as AES known and AES unknown. It can be spread because of different viruses mainly JE+ve. If undetected viruses are diagnosed, we consider to report it in AES unknown category, due to which we can see the number of patients diagnosed have increased in AES.\" The entomologist rules out consuming litchi as a cause for AES.\n\n[Byline: Anagha Sawant]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Frequently, in other reports from northeastern states in India, AES is often a mixture of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and other, usually undetermined, etiologies. We do not know what proportion of the 74 AES cases so far this year (2019) are due to JE nor the proportion of cases that are children. There continues to be an increase in cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) reported above. There is no indication of what the etiology of those AES cases might be. As noted previously, many times the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Some cases of AES are frequently attributed to JE, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible.\n\nThe very low case fatality rate is remarkable and a good indication that patients are receiving effective medical care. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/310]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (MN) 20190722.6582013\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (NL) 20190722.6579447\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (AS) 20190720.6578446\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (AR) 20190717.6571909\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20190716.6570013\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (BR, AR) 20190714.6567249\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS, BR) 20190710.6561773\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (AS) 20190705.6552949\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20190703.6549201\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20190630.6544796\n.................................................sb/ml/ty/mj/ml", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6582013", "archive_id": 6582013, "date": "2019-07-22 18:13:05", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (MN)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (21): (MANIPUR)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 21 Jul 2019\nSource: E-Pao [abridged, edited]\nhttp://e-pao.net/GP.asp?src=27..220719.jul19\n\n\nThere are 10 positive cases of JE [Japanese encephalitis] in Churachandpur [distict], according to officials of the District Surveillance Office [DSO].\n\nDr Ngahneikim Haokip, DSO IDSP [Integrated Disease Surveillance Program], said 16 samples from the district were tested for JE, of which 10 were found positive.

PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using standardized laboratory and data analysis techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.\n\nAs of [17 Jul 2019], a total of 93 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 27 states.\n\nState / Ill People\n------------------\nAlabama / 1\nArizona / 1\nCalifornia / 1\nColorado / 2\nFlorida / 2\nGeorgia / 1\nHawaii / 1\nIllinois / 6\nIndiana / 4\nIowa / 18\nKansas / 3\nKentucky / 4\nLouisiana / 1\nMassachusetts / 4\nMichigan / 9\nMinnesota / 1\nMissouri / 5\nNew York / 11\nNorth Carolina / 1\nNorth Dakota / 1\nOhio / 5\nOregon / 2\nPennsylvania / 3\nSouth Carolina / 1\nUtah / 1\nWashington / 1\nWisconsin / 3\n-------------\nTotal / 93\n\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from [1 Oct 2018 to 20 Jun 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 38 years. A total of 43 (46%) ill people are female. Of 67 ill people with information available, 20 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nWhole genome sequencing analysis of _Salmonella_ isolates from 33 ill people predicted antimicrobial resistance or decreased susceptibility to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results. If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended antibacterials, and may require a different choice.\n\nInvestigation of the outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about animal contact in the week before they became ill. As many as 63 (90%) of 70 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 49 people with available information, 34 (69%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats, such as pig ears (16%), in the week before interview.\n\nDuring the investigation, officials from the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development gathered pig ear dog treats at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products. They sampled pig ears for _Salmonella_. As additional strains of _Salmonella_ were identified in pig ear products, a search of the CDC PulseNet database identified ill people infected with some of these strains, including _S._ Infantis, _S._ London, and _S._ Newport. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation.\n\nOn 3 Jul 2019, Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. Consumers should not feed recalled pig ears to their dog. Throw them away in a secure container so that your pets and other animals can't eat them. Even if some of the recalled pig ears were fed to dogs and no one got sick, do not continue to feed them to pets. Wash containers, shelves, and areas that held the recalled pig ear dog treats with hot, soapy water.\n\nA common supplier of pig ear dog treats has not been identified. Pet owners can take steps to keep their families healthy while feeding pets.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[More cases and more serotypes have been identified.\n\n_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.\n\nThe designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:\n- the \"I\" reflects subspecies _enterica_;\n- the \"4, [5] 12\" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism.

The confirmatory result was received in the evening on [17 Jul 2019], she said. \"As soon as the result was out, investigation started in all the hospitals where the patients were admitted,\" she said\n\nAn entomological team has been on the move since [18 Jul 2019] to detect prevalence of the JE virus. Fogging operations have already started in Dimapur at Supply colony, Forest colony, Nepali Basti, 7th Mile, Industrial Estate, and Chumoukedima area.\n\nIt was informed that there is no cure for the virus so preventive measures remain the only option. The JE virus attacks the central nervous system, which makes it more severe than dengue. She urged the public to prevent mosquitoes from breeding.\n\nSigns and symptoms:\n- headache, fever, disorientation, coma, tremors, paralysis, and loss of coordination;\n- it is associated with neurological complications leading to death.\n\nTransmission of JE:\n- JE [virus] is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes;\n- JE virus remains in the water birds like pond herons and cattle egrets in nature;\n- pigs play an important role in JE, as JE virus multiplies in pigs without them suffering from the disease and [carry] the virus for a long time;\n- mosquitoes while biting pigs pick up the infection easily and pass it on to humans when they bite again;\n- JE is not transmitted from human to human like malaria and other vector borne diseases.\n\nIs there a vaccine for JE?\n- Yes, vaccine is available for JE;\n- government provides this vaccine for children in JE affected areas.\n\nHow do we prevent JE?\n- The best way to prevent JE is through control of mosquito vectors;\n- stagnant water bodies should be drained or filled up, and surroundings kept clean and dry;\n- rice fields can cover wide areas and chemical control may not be feasible. In such situations, water management measures like alternate wetting and drying may be applied to reduce vector population;\n- during pre-monsoon when water bodies are confined to small ponds and tanks, vector control measures can be planned;\n- personal protection through use of repellents and mosquito nets are effective control measures;\n- introduce larvivorous fish in the paddy fields and other stagnant water bodies to eat up the mosquito larvae;\n- larvivorous fish are available at Urban Malaria Scheme at Chief Medical Officer office, Dimapur;\n- it is discouraged to rear pigs near human dwellings as the virus gets multiplied and amplified in the pigs, and can then be transmitted to humans;\n- spread of awareness is important for prevention and also to detect and treat patients early to increase chance of survival and reduce long term deficits after recovery.\n\nIn case of any illness [with symptoms which resemble those] of JE, visit your nearest health centre/district hospital for investigation and treatment of cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is not surprising that JE cases are occurring in Nagaland. It is adjacent to Assam state, where a JE outbreak with additional cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) are occurring. In these Nagaland reports, however, no AES cases are mentioned. Since this is still the JE virus transmission season it is likely that there will be more cases over the next 2 months.

State health department officials said special measures are being taken in flood-affected areas to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nOn Friday [19 Jul 2019], the daily report from the National Health Mission (NHM) Assam noted 4 more JE deaths. It showed a total of 1569 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome cases, including 439 JE cases, since April this year [2019]. Last year [2018], there were 509 cases and 94 deaths in Assam as a result of JE [virus], which is transmitted by mosquitoes.\n\n\"Kamrup (Rural) district, in the vicinity of Guwahati, has recorded 11 deaths, the highest in the state,\" said Chittaranjan Pathak, state programme officer, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. Information furnished by NHM showed Lakhimpur has recorded 37 JE-positive cases, the highest in the state. Pathak said the transmission of JE showed a downward trend and [the] situation has improved. \"In flood-affected areas, our colleagues are trying their level best. In all flood relief camps extensive fogging is done and awareness campaigns are being held,\" he said adding so far there were no reports of any infections in the camps.\n\nAs [of] Friday [19 Jul 2019], as many as 4.88 million people have been affected by the floods while another 147 833 people have taken shelter in relief camps across the state. A large number of flood-affected people are living in shanties on high grounds with their animals, including pigs, in immediate vicinity. \"Pigs are the carriers of the JE virus,\" said SM Sarmah, joint director, health, Kamrup (Rural). He, however, hoped that the floods would have washed away the mosquito larvae, thereby reducing the chances of transmission of the disease.\n\n\"We hope the situation will improve due to floods and mosquito breeding will go down,\" he said. In his district, a part of which is reeling under floods, no new JE infection has been reported since 13 Jul [2019].\n\n[byline: Sadiq Naqvi]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The numbers of Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases had been accelerating in Assam state over the first 2 weeks of July [2019]. Now, it will be interesting to see if the numbers of JE cases continue to go down after the floods. It is reasonable to assume that the larvae of the vector culex mosquitoes have been washed away by the flood waters. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination campaigns in the affected areas. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection.\n\nThere continues to be an increase in cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) as well. There is no indication of what the etiology of those AES cases might be. As noted previously, many times the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Some cases of AES are frequently attributed to JE, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299.]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20190716.6570013\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (BR, AR) 20190714.6567249\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS, BR) 20190710.6561773\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (AS) 20190705.6552949\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20190703.6549201\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20190630.6544796\n2018\n---\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (AS) 20181108.6132872\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20180818.5974190\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS) 20180812.5961217\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AS) 20180805.5948662\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (AS) 20180701.5883729\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20180628.5881510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10) 20180620.5866496\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20180618.58623\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20180523.581\n.................................................ty/rd/sh", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6571909", "archive_id": 6571909, "date": "2019-07-17 02:38:06", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (AR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (18): (ARUNACHAL PRADESH)\n*****************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 16 Jul 2019\nSource: Northeast Now [edited]\nhttps://nenow.in/health/11-positive-cases-of-japanese-encephalitis-detected-in-arunachal.html\n\n\nAs many as 11 positive cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been detected in Arunachal Pradesh, a statement from the health department said on Monday [15 Jul 2019].\n\nJE is a flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses, and is spread by mosquitoes. JE is the main cause of viral encephalitis in many countries of Asia with an estimated 68 000 clinical cases every year.\n\nLobsang Jampa, the state's senior statistical officer for integrated disease surveillance programme said that 5 positive cases have been detected in East Siang district and 3 from the Papum Pare district. He also said 3 other patients, each from Upper Subansiri, Lohit and Kra Daadi districts, have tested positive for the viral disease. However, no deaths have reported from anywhere in the state till date due to JE. All the 11 patients who have tested positive with JE virus are under treatment in various hospitals, Jampa said.\n\n\"There is no cause of alarm. Any cases of fever with stiffness of body, drowsiness, etc. should be reported to health facilities for confirmation and treatment,\" Jampa said. He said the state's department of health and family welfare has initiated all preventive measures and other necessary steps in the wake of the rising cases of the mosquitoborne disease in neighboring Assam. Meanwhile, the medical officers of all the districts have been alerted and asked to step up their surveillance, anti-vectors measures and information, education and communication (IEC) activities.\n\n[byline: Damien Lepcha]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the number of JE cases in Arunachal Pradesh state is not increasing as much as in neighboring Assam state, nevertheless, cases have increased from 7 reported 2 days ago to the 11 reported above.

The registered positive JE cases across the state also increased to 348 from 334 on Friday [12 Jul 2019]. The 5 deaths were reported from Darrang, Nalbari, Tinsukia, Kamrup and Udalguri districts, the bulletin said.\n\nGiving the cumulative figures for JE/AES (acute encephalitis syndrome), the bulletin said there [had been] 1350 such cases since January this year [2019], with 177 deaths.\n\nMeasures to control the mosquitoborne disease that affects the brain continued to be taken across the state, which is currently undergoing a transmission season for JE, NHM sources said. Health minister Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma has said the emergency measures taken to combat the JE/AES situation would exist till 30 Sep [2019]. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had on [30 Jun 2019] dispatched a central team to review the situation in the state. The health minister also said that his ministry is providing all logistical and technical support to the state government in terms of surveillance and diagnostic kits to strengthen their efforts in addressing JE.\n\nNoting that community participation and empowerment are the most crucial in JE prevention, Vardhan urged all the stakeholders to start rigorous awareness campaigns regarding the preventive steps to be taken by the communities. For rehabilitation of JE-disabled patients, the central government has provided funds for the strengthening of 2 physical medicine and rehabilitation departments at Dibrugarh Medical College and Guwahati Medical College.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases has been accelerating in Assam state over the past 2 weeks.

The only feasible steps that the communities could take are elimination of culex mosquito breeding sites within the community and avoidance of mosquito bites. Because the culex vector mosquitoes also breed in rice paddies, which may be extensive, vector control over large areas is difficult. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination campaigns in the affected areas. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection.

While 5 cases have been detected in East Siang district alone, one patient each from Upper Subansiri and Papum Pare districts have also tested positive with JE, state epidemiologist Dr Lobsang Jampa informed.\n\nThe 5 cases -- 4 adult males and a 15-year-old female patient -- have been identified with JE at Pasighat, the headquarters of East Siang district, as per available reports with the medical authorities here, while a 2.5-year-old girl was admitted with JE at Tomo Riba Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (TRIHMS) at Naharlagun near here.\n\nThe girl hails from Dumporijo in Upper Subansiri district, Dr Jampa informed, adding that another case of JE was also reported from Heema Hospital here, who had been referred to GNRC Hospital at Guwahati in neighbouring Assam.\n\n\"The 57-year-old person is from the Chandranagar area in the state capital,\" Dr Jampa disclosed.\n\nHe, however, added that the cases of JE in the state may rise as reports from vulnerable districts like Tirap, Changlang, Longding, Namsai, and Lohit were not available with the health authorities here.\n\n\"The state government has issued an advisory to all the districts to contain the spread of the disease and has instructed [them] to take adequate measures like fogging and focal insecticide spray to stop further spreading of the disease,\" he informed.\n\nDr Jampa added that the disease is prone to the areas where people rear pigs, ducks, swans, heron, and egrets. Encephalitis is transmitted through the bite of infected _Culex_ mosquitoes, and the JE virus is harboured in pigs and other domestic animals.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Arunachal Pradesh state adjoins Assam state, so the occurrence of Japanese encephalitis cases at this time is not surprising. JE cases have been reported in that state before. Although pigs can serve as amplifying hosts, the virus reservoirs are wetland-frequenting birds such as herons. Other domestic animals are not epidemiologically important. Vector control is difficult. House fogging is of limited effectiveness.

Apparently, the 189 encephalitis cases are attributed to a combination of AES of unspecified etiology other than an unidentified virus and JE virus. Of the 14 deaths mentioned above, 5 are due to JE virus infections and 9 from AES. Previous recent reports from Assam in June and July 2019 attribute all the encephalitis cases to JE, without mentioning AES (see archived posts below).

The state saw a larger share of JE cases in the total AES figure, said officials.\n\nJE, which is a mosquito-borne viral infection of the brain, was said to be in check till last year [2018] owing to mass vaccination programmes and awareness drives. Also, the water-borne enterovirus encephalitis, which is caused by virus found in pigs and birds [JE virus is found in pigs and birds, not unidentified enteroviruses of people. - Mod.TY], used to be the highest reported kind of encephalitis [not according to the reports that ProMED-mail has received and posted over recent years. - Mod.TY].\n\nWhile every year JE cases used to be 4-7% of the total AES cases, this time they have risen to 25%, which is more than a 3-fold increase, said an official from Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College in Gorakhpur that sees patients from various districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Nepal and Bihar. The official, who did not wish to be named, did not give an exact figure.\n\nChief minister Yogi Adityanath was also told about this increase during a visit to the hospital on 22 Jun 2019. However, the officials had not mentioned any specific number even then.\n\nDoctors and experts are unsure what could have caused [the increase in proportion of JE cases].\n\n\"The share of JE cases has increased this year [2019],\" confirmed SK Tiwari, chief medical officer, District Hospital, Gorakhpur. \"It could be due to 2 reasons. One, the sampling and testing facility has been strengthened. The National Institute of Virology, Pune, is checking each sample, so the diagnosis has increased. Two, cases of JE are mostly coming from areas with poor sanitation practices and where children are undernourished. We have asked ICDS (Integrated Child Development Services) to pay special attention to this.\"\n\nThe district hospital, which maintains data only for Gorakhpur division, has recorded 6 encephalitis deaths between 1 Jan and 28 Jun 2019. Of these, one death was due to JE.\n\nInadequate vaccination dose during the mass JE vaccination programme in 2006 and 2010 is one of the main reasons for the rise in JE cases, said RN Singh, private paediatrician, who was earlier with BRD Medical College.\n\nAccording to World Health Organization guidelines, 2 primary doses are administered to prevent JE. But, only one dosage was given to one-year-olds, said Singh, who is also a campaigner for eradication of encephalitis.\n\n\"The 2 doses -- one when the child is 9 months old and the other at 16 months -- were only started in 2012-2013 in the government's National Immunisation Programme (NIP). So, many children were left out. Those who were not one year old in 2010 became over-age, and so they neither got vaccine in the mass drive nor under NIP. These left-out children could be the ones contracting JE now,\" he said.\n\nThe overall AES figures, however, have come down since 2017, when more than 62 children died in August due to encephalitis at BRD Medical College. Of these, 31 died in just 2 days due to lack of oxygen cylinders at the hospital.\n\nSince then, the state administration has claimed that the district has seen a sharp fall in AES and JE cases. In the last 2 years, the deaths due to AES in Uttar Pradesh dropped to 230 in 2018 from 654 in 2017. The number of AES cases reported also dropped to 3080 in 2018 from 4724 in 2017, according to the directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, Delhi.\n\nSo far [in 2019], the hospital has recorded 16 deaths and 440 AES cases. It is still a cause of worry, as the season for the disease has not yet started in full force. The cases for AES, which subsumes JE and water-borne enterovirus encephalitis, mostly shoot up during monsoon.\n\nBesides poor sanitation, other reasons for the cases could be inadequate fogging, anti-mosquito measures, and failure of the administration in keeping pigs away from human habitats. JE is caused due to mosquitoes and pigs, with pigs acting as an amplifying host after a male [sic. female] mosquito bites it.\n\n\"There was a drive launched to segregate pigs from human habitation; it has not been done successfully, but it would be wrong to say that nothing has been done,\" said Rajesh Mani, an activist with non-profit Manav Seva Sansthan and the chief petitioner in the high court on the issue. \"Dastak, an awareness campaign, was launched in February 2018. It focused on training doctors, nurses, malaria officers, auxiliary nurse midwives, and teachers and included a door-to-door campaign,\" added Mani.\n\nA fresh Dastak campaign was launched on 1 Jul [2019] in 18 districts in eastern Uttar Pradesh. However, after the deaths within a week in 2017, release of data has been hampered by the Gorakhpur hospital and health authorities, said the activist.\n\n\"Earlier a health bulletin used to be issued by the BRD hospital, but they have stopped doing it since 2017. The cases and deaths have reduced in the last 2 years, but we cannot completely know what the exact situation is,\" he said.\n\n[Byline: Shagun Kapil]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[JE and AES cases with fatalities are reported in Uttar Pradesh every year. It is not clear from the report above what the official JE vaccination strategy is or the type of vaccine used in Uttar Pradesh, nor has the identification of the enteroviruses reported to cause encephalitis been indicated. In neighboring Behar state, the main hospital has been overwhelmed with cases of AES attributed by some to consumption of lychee fruit by malnutritioned children. As noted in comments on early posts, although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent Behar reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is responsible for some of the cases.\n\nThe determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. One hopes that now sending each sample to the National Institute of Virology, the presence of dengue and enteroviruses can be confirmed or ruled out. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/364]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20190703.6549201\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20190630.6544796\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (BR) 20190625.6536300\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (UP) 20190623.6534700\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) 20190623.6534477\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20190620.6530974\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) 20190619.6527331\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20190614.6519707\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20190612.6515634\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20190609.6510811\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01) 20190112.6255835\n.................................................sb/dk/ty/tw/dk", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6549201", "archive_id": 6549201, "date": "2019-07-03 10:43:44", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (11): (ASSAM)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\nDate: Tue 2 Jul 2019 20:55 GMT+10\nSource: Big New Network, ANI (Asian News International) report [edited]\nhttps://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/261600924/28-japanese-encephalitis-deaths-reported-in-assam\n\n\nJapanese encephalitis has claimed 28 lives and 100 patients are being treated in different hospitals in Assam, said a senior official on [Tue 2 Jul 2019].\n\nDr Umesh Phangcho, Joint Director of health service and state program officer, said: \"A 4-member team has been formed with Ministry of Home Affairs Secretary Sanjeev Kumar heading it.

The fatalities have occurred in 20 of the state's 38 districts.\n\nThe outbreak has been exacerbated by a heatwave, with temperatures in Patna, Bihar's capital, reaching a high of 45.8 C (114.5 F).\n\n\"We're hoping with the onset of the monsoon, the epidemic will ease further,\" Kumar said.\n\nMore than 700 cases of encephalitis have been registered since the outbreak began on 1 Jun [2019], officials said. Young children are particularly vulnerable to the illness, which can cause swelling of the brain, fever, and vomiting.\n\nThe Supreme Court was responding to a petition filed by a lawyer. \"The deaths of children are a direct result of negligence and inaction\" on part of authorities, said Manohar Pratap, the petitioner.\n\nThe court expressed concern over the deaths and asked the governments to respond within 7 days with details on medical facilities, nutrition, sanitation and hygiene conditions in the state.\n\nThousands of Indians suffer from encephalitis, malaria, typhoid and other mosquito-borne diseases each year during the summer monsoon season.\n\nIndia's central government has sent medical experts to Bihar to help doctors treat the patients.\n\nThe Bihar authorities have been sharply criticized because patients were sharing beds in crowded hospital wards with too few doctors. The families who could afford it transferred their children to private hospitals in Patna and other larger cities.\n\nThe Press Trust of India news agency on Mon 24 Jun 2019 reported that about 6000 deaths from encephalitis occurred in India between 2008 and 2014.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of cases has increased rapidly from 142 on 22 Jun 2019, to 152 in 2 days in the report above.

There is no indication in the above report of the etiological agent(s) involved in these cases. Japanese encephalitis is one possibility. The majority of cases have been classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption (especially in recent reports), and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

All 4 are in east Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAdityanath, who held a meeting with officials at BRD Medical College on Saturday [22 Jun 2019] to review the situation, called for fresh initiatives to eradicate the disease from the region.\n\n\"The death rate has reduced drastically in recent years, but we need to chalk out a new strategy to eradicate it completely,\" a health officer quoted Adityanath as saying.\n\nThe chief minister also hoped that the treatment would be more effective once the under-construction AIIMS in Gorakhpur starts functioning by the end of next year [2020].\n\n\"It (the disease) is spreading because of unhygienic conditions, open defecation and contaminated drinking water,\" the BJP leader said while speaking to reporters later.\n\n\"We have got good results from our strategy of the previous years and managed to control JE and AES to a large extent. It is a continuous process,\" he added, but refused to answer any questions.\n\nThe affected areas are considered Adityanath's fief. He had claimed recently that encephalitis had almost been eradicated in Gorakhpur, the epicentre of the disease for over 2 decades, and surrounding districts where thousands of children have died since 1998.\n\nAdityanath, also the mahant of Gorakhnath temple, represented Gorakhpur in Parliament from 1998 to 2017 before he took over as chief minister.\n\nAccording to the latest report of the health department in Gorakhpur district, 130 JE and AES patients were admitted to the hospital between 1 May-19 Jun 2019. \"The [2019] patients started dying from 5 May [2019]. We have yet to count the deaths after 19 Jun [2019],\" said a health department officer who didn't want to be named.\n\n\"Adityanath has launched the Dastak programme, which would be started from 1 Jul [2019] to create awareness among people about encephalitis in Gorakhpur and adjoining districts. We will also conduct an encephalitis vaccination programme [presumably for JE - Mod.TY] till 25 Jul [2019]. But the fact remains that most encephalitis deaths take place in the month of June, when there is rain,\" the officer said, adding that a vaccination drive should have been conducted in January and February [2019].\n\nFor the record, parents of most patients in Bihar, including Muzaffarpur, where the AES outbreak has taken a heavy toll, would earlier rush to the medical college in Gorakhpur, around 300 km [186 mi] away, because the BRD Medical College has a dedicated encephalitis ward.\n\nThis year [2019], however, the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital in Muzaffarpur has been admitting most of the local patients.\n\nSome parents in Muzaffarpur have alleged that the Gorakhpur hospital refused admission to their children this year [2019]. An official at BRD Medical College denied the allegation.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above report does not specify how many of the encephalitis fatalities were due to JE and how many to AES.\n\nEastern Uttar Pradesh state has been an important locality for JE and AES cases over recent years. JE vaccination campaigns likely are responsible for fewer JE cases this year (2019). As noted in many ProMED-mail posts reporting JE and AES in India, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Cases in neighboring Bihar state over the past 2 months have been attributed to the consumption of lychees.\n\nThe above report refers to the spread of the disease as due to \"unhygienic conditions, open defecation and contaminated drinking water,\" which suggests enterovirus infections. Laboratory testing of these cases is essential to determine the etiologies of these cases that, in turn, are necessary to develop effective control measures. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/364.]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) 20190623.6534477\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20190620.6530974\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) 20190619.6527331\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20190614.6519707\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20190612.6515634\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20190609.6510811\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01) 20190112.6255835\n2018\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (MH) 20181220.6216363\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (MP) 20181112.6141152\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (AS) 20181108.6132872\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (MP) 20180827.5991109\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (BR) 20180823.5981659\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20180818.5974190\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (UP) 20180814.5964023\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS) 20180812.5961217\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AS) 20180805.5948662\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (UP) 20180711.5900435\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (AS) 20180701.5883729\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20180628.5881510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10) 20180620.5866496\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20180618.5862346\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20180618.5860635\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MP) 20180614.5855342\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (HP) 20180607.5844658\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (KL) 20180605.5840545\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (KL) 20180530.5827153\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20180523.5812921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP), typhus 20180416.5749050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.55507\n.................................................ty/msp/jh", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6534477", "archive_id": 6534477, "date": "2019-06-23 18:36:15", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (07): (BIHAR)\n***************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 22 Jun 2019\nSource: India Today [edited]\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/programme/the-long-story/video/bihar-encephalitis-kills-more-than-142-children-1554039-2019-06-22\n\n\n[The following report includes a video and a brief text. - Mod.TY]\n\nEncephalitis in Bihar [state] has killed more than 142 children. Muztaffurpur has born the maximum brunt of this deadly disease, accounting for 117 deaths so far.\n\nAccording to data released by the [Bihar Health] Department, the total number of affected people due to encephalitis in the state is more than 600.\n\nVictims of this disease mostly come from a downtrodden socioeconomic background.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The video reports that cases occur in this area annually but case numbers have varied from 4 in 2016 to 355 in 2014, but far fewer than this year (2019). Lychee fruit consumption is again mentioned as an etiological cause of acute encephalitis syndrome. Japanese encephalitis is mentioned also. The video shows the overcrowded conditions in the Muztaffurpur hospital's ICU and criticism of these conditions by parents and local politicians. Clearly, the conditions and staff are overwhelmed with the number of patients that are coming in for treatment.\n\nThe current case numbers vary in several current reports. Uttar Pradesh state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath stated that at least 1349 children had died of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in neighbouring Bihar (https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/up-effectively-controlled-spread-of-japanese-encephalitis-acute-encephalitis-syndrome-adityanath-119062200610_1.html). Another report indicates that there have been 145 deaths in Bihar and 127 deaths in Muztaffurpur (https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/bihar-encephalitis-horror-death-toll-touches-145-1554208-2019-06-22). Still another report states that there are 170 deaths in Bihar (https://www.timesnownews.com/videos/mirror-now/society/bihars-healthcare-crisis-intensifies-encephalitis-claims-over-170-lives/34851). Because the number of cases continues to grow quickly, the discrepancy in case numbers may be due to the day and time that those numbers were obtained.\n\nAs noted in comments on early posts, although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is responsible for some of the cases. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive.

At least 200 patients, many of whom are below the age of 10, are still being treated at 2 hospitals. State officials have said that many victims had died due to hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar.\n\nThousands of children have died of encephalitis in Bihar and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh since the 1st case was detected in the late 1970s.\n\nThe state has announced that it will bear the cost of treatment for all those affected. The Indian government has said that it will \"extend all possible support\" to the state and affected families.\n\nThe outbreak since the beginning of June [2019] has seen the most deaths in the city of Muzaffarpur.\n\nThe disease usually occurs during the monsoon season, and children are the worst affected. Until 2005, doctors say that the majority of deaths were caused by Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus. But in the past decade or so, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear.\n\nThe disease causes headaches and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunction, seizure, and inflammation of the heart and kidney. Doctors say children between the age of 6 months and 15 years are the worst affected, and 1/5 of the children who survive have to live with neurological weaknesses.\n\n\"It is difficult to say with certainty if children are dying due to encephalitis, because there could be a number of reasons behind these deaths,\" Dr Mala Kaneria told BBC Hindi's Priyanka Dubey. \"It could also be due to malnutrition, insufficient levels of sugar and sodium, or electrolyte imbalances.\"\n\nDr Kaneria added that some of these deaths could also be caused by eating lychees on an empty stomach. Lychees contain toxins that inhibit the body's ability to produce glucose, which could affect young children whose blood sugar levels were already low because they were not eating dinner.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRaman Mahajan\nMedecins Sans Frontieres\n<msfe-delhi-epidem@barcelona.msf.org>\n\n[The number of cases of AES in the area continues to grow. A 19 Jun 2019 report indicates that the death toll has increased to 114 with more than 500 cases of AES registered since the outbreak began 1 Jun 2019, according to a government health bulletin released Wednesday [19 Jun 2019]. The outbreak has been exacerbated by a heatwave, with temperatures in Patna, Bihar's capital, reaching a high of 45.8 deg C / 114.5 deg F (https://federalnewsnetwork.com/health-news/2019/06/death-toll-rises-in-eastern-india-in-encephalitis-outbreak/). As noted in comments on early posts, although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is responsible for some of the cases. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.\n\nIt has been proposed previously that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, Dr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the northwestern region of Bihar state, and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES. Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified, and in June 2014, children were treated by 10% dextrose infusion and many lives were saved [dextrose administration is not mentioned in the above report]. Other etiologies have been proposed by clinicians. A published article in a pediatric journal proposed that some cases are due to heat stroke. A 16 Jun 2019 report stated that the Bihar state health department in a press release said maximum deaths have occurred this year due to hypoglycemia resulting from high heat, humidity, and no rain (http://en.rfi.fr/asia-pacific/20190616-heatwave-encephalitis-deaths-skyrocket-bihar-northern-india).

Muzaffarpur, India's \"land of litchis,\" supplies the bulk of the country's litchi harvest and the classiest varieties. Now reporters are writing on how certain chemicals in the fruit cause fatal brain inflammation in undernourished children below age 15 years.\n\nThis litchi scare has hit sales, making prices tumble and affecting the very children whose families depend on the fruit for [their] livelihood. Hypotheses and theories are being reviewed. Experts admit that for 50% of the cases no one knows what the triggers are. And 50% remain undiagnosed and untreated.\n\nScientists now suggest that the litchi may not be a root cause of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Increasingly, a viral explanation for the fatal illness AES in children is gaining ground.\n\nAES strikes early in the morning, with high fever, convulsions, disorientation, coma, seizures -- signs of brain inflammation. Tests reveal very low blood glucose levels, caused by high concentrations of unusual amino acids (hypoglycin A and MCPG) that are also found in litchis.\n\nExperts also point to the human-animal-environment interface as the source of the disease. Given that Indians interact closely with livestock and wildlife, they map various other ways of transmission of AES. For instance, children gorging on litchis can easily pick up fruits contaminated by the saliva, urine, or guano of bats. Bats host more than 60 human-infecting viruses, including the Ebola and Nipah viruses, which cause deadly brain fevers in people.\n\nRegardless, according to outlookindia.com\u00b8 it is really time to figure out exactly why such a fruit is being associated with the deaths of children in Muzaffarpur.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nand\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Mon 17 Jun 2019\nSource: India Today [edited]\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/encephalitis-meaning-symptoms-causes-treatment-bihar-deaths-muzaffarpur-1550412-2019-06-17\n\n\nThe death toll due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) has reached 100 in Muzaffarpur and the adjoining districts in Bihar. Most of the casualties are between the age-group of 1 and 10 years. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has advocated setting up of a research institute to identify the reason behind the outbreak of the epidemic, colloquially known as \"chamki bukhar\" (chamki = seizure).\n\nAs per the reports, AES has taken around 12 districts of the state in its grip, including Muzaffarpur, Vaishali and East Champaran. However, Muzaffarpur has been declared as the worst hit zone.\n\nAES is a serious public health problem in India. It is characterized as acute onset of fever and a change in mental status (mental confusion, disorientation, delirium, or coma) and/or new onset of seizures in a person of any age at any time of the year. The disease most commonly affects children and young adults and can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality. The AES cases in Muzaffarpur, Bihar and adjoining litchi-producing districts have been observed mostly during April to June, particularly in children who are undernourished with a history of visiting litchi orchards.\n\nCausative agents of AES\n- Viruses are the main causative agents in AES cases, although other sources such as bacteria, fungus, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals, toxins, and noninfectious agents have also been reported over the past few decades.\n- Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the major cause of AES in India (ranging from 5%-35%). Nipah virus and Zika virus are also found as causative agents for AES.\n- Herpes simplex virus, influenza A virus, West Nile virus, Chandipura virus, mumps, measles, dengue, parvovirus B4, enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus and scrub typhus, _S. pneumoniae_ are the other causes of AES in sporadic and outbreak form in India.\n\nSymptoms of AES include high fever, headache, sensitivity to light, stiff neck and back, vomiting and confusion. In severe cases, seizures, paralysis and coma occur.\n\nAs mentioned above, JEV is the major cause of AES in India. It is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and belongs to the same genus as dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses.\n\nThere is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving severe clinical signs and supporting the patient to overcome the infection.\n\nTreatment for encephalitis\n- Children suffering from encephalitis should be kept in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid any major mishap.\n- They can be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen sodium, to reduce headaches and temperature.\n- Most cases of encephalitis are resolved in a few days. In case of a severe condition, it may take a few weeks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of cases of AES in the area continues to grow.

He said, \"A team of doctors and medical experts have been sent to Muzaffarpur to monitor the situation and also speed up the awareness drive about complexities and preventive measures about AES.\"\n\n\"Till last night [10 Jun 2019], 28 children have lost their lives... we've started 2 separate intensive care units (ICU) along with other makeshift wards in the government hospital\", Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr Shailendera Prasad Singh told The Hindu over phone.\n\nEarlier on [Mon 10 Jun 2019], Principal Secretary of the Health Department Sanajy Kumar said the deaths were caused by hypoglycemia (deficiency of glucose or sugar in the blood stream), and not by the fever. He, however, added that \"48 suspected AES cases have been recorded so far in the district.\"\n\nOn [Tue 11 Jun 2019] Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Ashwani Kumar Choubey said in Patna that \"since state government officials were engaged in election-related works in the recent past months they could not make the awareness drive as it should have been... we're careful and taking all measures to tackle the situation of death of children in Muzaffarpur.\"\n\nMeanwhile, unofficial records said that 130 cases of suspected AES had come in at the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) and private Kejriwal hospital in Muzaffarpur in the last 9 days. \"Totally, 81 children with suspected AES are admitted in these 2 hospitals and over 3 dozen have already died... these days the ICUs, pediatrics ICU and other makeshift separate wards of SKMCH and Kejriwal hospital are crammed with children having symptoms of suspected AES...if not contained soon, the death toll may go up to 50 in the coming days\", said a doctor of the SKMCH on the condition of anonymity.\n\nEvery year during summer time, especially in the season of luscious fruit litchi, AES outbreak gets reported and takes the lives of children in the district, which is India's largest litchi cultivation region. In 2014, when altogether 90 children died in the district due to suspected AES, a research carried by the Lancet Global Health established the connection between litchi consumption and encephalitis deaths.\n\nMr Nitish Kumar had said, \"It generally hits those children who go to sleep empty stomach at night and eat litchis fallen on the ground. Earlier, 3 different teams of doctors had reached 3 different conclusions about the reason of children's deaths in summer season in Muzaffarpur... last year [2018], very few deaths were reported because an extensive awareness drive was launched.\"\n\nFormer Union Health Minister Dr Harshvardhan had visited the SKMCH and made several announcements, including the setting up of a virology lab at the hospital to study the nature of diseases, but nothing happened thereafter.\n\nAccording to doctors, high temperatures during summer, along with humidity more than the normal, is considered to be an ideal situation for the outbreak of AES, which has symptoms of high fever, vomiting, nausea and unconsciousness. Since 2010, 398 children have died in Muzaffarpur due to suspected AES.\n\n[Byline: Amarnath Tewary]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The etiology of the cases is not confirmed, but the majority are reported as hypoglycemic and lychee fruit consumption is implicated. As noted previously, frequently some cases of AES are attributed to Japanese encephalitis but many are of undefined etiology. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.\n\nIt has been proposed previously that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, Dr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the north western region of Bihar state and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES. Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified and in June 2014 children were treated by 10 per cent dextrose infusion and many lives were saved. Other etiologies have been proposed by clinicians.

People and animals are typically capable of carrying viruses, bacteria, and fungi, but a scientist from Korea University has called for stricter monitoring of dogs and other companion animals because they could be carriers of human influenza strains.\n\n\"Until now, dogs were considered neglected hosts in the field of flu research,\" said Dr. Daesub Song, an associate professor at Korea University. Song explained after the 1st report of interspecies transmission, dogs should be monitored for surveillance.\n\nIn a study spanning 10 years, Song found several cases were recorded of viruses that crossed the host barrier, which was an animal. Most particularly, the H3N2 bird flu crossed over from [birds to] dogs and developed into the canine influenza virus (CIV). Such a case was found in a dog 7 years ago.\n\nIn his research, Song said the H3N2 CIV could combine with H1N1/2009 to form a new virus called CIVmv. The H1N1/2009 virus is known for causing the 2009-2010 swine flu pandemic.\n\nThe emergence of a new virus is concerning, said Song. Because this is a new virus, those who come into 1st contact with it will not be immune, and if the virus spreads from dogs to humans, it could potentially spread quickly to the population.\n\nIn the study, Song and his colleagues tested the CIVmv strain in ferrets and found that because ferrets and humans have similar flu receptors, the virus can spread quickly. Because of this, ferrets are considered to be the most reliable model for predicting and evaluating the risk of human influenza viruses. Song said the virus spread between ferrets more quickly compared with other influenza viruses.\n\nSong found that dogs and ferrets that were infected by CIVmv strains displayed typical symptoms of respiratory disease, such as breathing difficulties, congestion, runny eyes, coughing, lethargy, sneezing, and appetite loss.\n\nSome experts say dogs can transfer the flu to humans simply by sneezing, although some believe the virus is not deadly. Animal influenza expert Dr. Janet Daly from University of Nottingham said the odds are slim dogs will transfer a canine virus to humans, but it is still a possibility. \"We do need to keep an eye out for occasions when both a dog and their owner have flu-like signs/symptoms,\" said Daly.\n\nThe CIVmv virus not only affects dogs and ferrets, but it also affects cats, the study revealed. Song investigated an outbreak that happened in an animal shelter, where 100% of cats were infected and 40% of them died.\n\nThe development of the virus in cats is also worrisome because this means CIV can spread to different animal species. This is the reason why researchers are raising concerns for the virus, as it can spread to companion animals, which are very close to humans. The potential risk for a new strain to develop is high, the researchers said.\n\nSong and his colleagues are trying to develop a vaccine against the CIVmv strain, but because of the high level of mutations, such vaccines are still very hard to develop.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Influenza viruses usually need a particular receptor within the host to replicate. It is one reason when avian flu passes to swine that researchers get excited. Swine have receptors of both avian and human forms of flu virus that makes them an ideal host to have strains mingle. Swine are also great shedders of virus so, consequently, can easily pass a virus to humans.\n\nThis article raises concern, but I am uncertain it goes far enough. There is minimal mention of receptors. While contact with someone having a flu virus can of course spread it, it is within the same species. Very close contact with our pets, kissing them, and letting them be \"in our face\" or humans \"being in their face\" may facilitate spread of a virus not normally able to spread between pets and humans.\n\nViruses are survivors! Mutation of the virus is a survival mechanism and a mechanism for potential spread. So while the research looks interesting, it seems there is more to be done. - Mod.TG]\n\n.................................................sb/tg/rd/mpp", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6255835", "archive_id": 6255835, "date": "2019-01-12 20:35:35", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (01)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (01)\n********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 11 Jan 2019 [in press]\nSource: International Journal of Infectious Diseases [edited]\nhttps://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(19)30019-0/fulltext\n\n\nCitation: Vasanthapuram Ravi, Shafeeq Keeran Shahul Hameed, Anita Desai, Reeta Subramaniam Mani, Vijayalakshmi Reddy, et al.: Dengue virus is an under-recognised causative agent of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES): Results from a 4-year AES surveillance study of Japanese encephalitis in selected states of India. International Journal of Infectious Diseases. 2019. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2019.01.008.\n\nHighlights\n- Dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).\n- Existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.\n- Dengue accounts for 5% of AES cases in India, especially in the absence of laboratory evidence for other pathogens tested.\n- Testing for dengue in AES cases must be included in routine surveillance.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nAES surveillance in India has indicated that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) accounts for 5-35% of AES cases annually; the etiology remains unknown in the remaining cases. We implemented comprehensive AES surveillance to identify other etiological agents of AES, with emphasis on dengue virus.\n\nMethods\nSerum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were collected from patients enrolled prospectively in AES surveillance from 2014-2017 at selected sites of 3 high-burden states of India. All samples were initially tested for JEV IgM. Specimens negative for JEV by serology were tested for IgM to scrub typhus, dengue virus (DEN), and West Nile virus; all JEV IgM-negative CSF samples were tested by PCR for _S. pneumoniae_, _N. meningitidis_, _H. influenzae_, herpes simplex virus type 1, enteroviruses, and DEN.\n\nResults\nOf 10 107 AES patients, an etiology could be established in 49.2% of patients, including JEV (16%), scrub typhus (16%), and DEN (5.2%) as the top 3 agents. Among the DEN-positive cases (359/6892), 7 (2%) were positive only for dengue virus RNA: one in serum and 6 in CSF.\n\nConclusion\nAmong the pathogens identified, dengue accounted for 5% of all AES cases and was one of the 3 common etiological agents. These results underscore the importance of including dengue virus in routine testing of AES cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Frequently, in reports of JE cases in India, acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of undefined etiology is often mentioned with JE cases, a minority of those hospitalized.

Dengue, as the authors state, should be included in testing of AES cases.\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/310. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\n2018\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (MH) 20181220.6216363\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (MP) 20181112.6141152\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (AS) 20181108.6132872\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (MP) 20180827.5991109\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (BR) 20180823.5981659\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20180818.5974190\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (UP) 20180814.5964023\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS) 20180812.5961217\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AS) 20180805.5948662\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (UP) 20180711.5900435\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (AS) 20180701.5883729\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20180628.5881510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10) 20180620.5866496\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20180618.5862346\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20180618.5860635\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MP) 20180614.5855342\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (HP) 20180607.5844658\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (KL) 20180605.5840545\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (KL) 20180530.5827153\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20180523.5812921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP), typhus 20180416.5749050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.55507\n.................................................ty/tw/mpp", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6216363", "archive_id": 6216363, "date": "2018-12-20 06:29:58", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (MH)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (23): (MAHARASHTRA)\n***********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 15 Dec 2018\nSource: The Moveefy [edited]\nhttp://moveefy.com/2018/12/15/japanese-encephalitis-goes-beyond-endemic-zone/\n\n\n[Maharashtra] has recorded 108 cases [of Japanese encephalitis], mainly in endemic districts, in the past 11 months, as against 30 recorded throughout 2017. Culex mosquitoes, which feed on animal blood, especially pigs [and ardeid birds (herons, egrets and bitterns)], are the main vector of the disease [virus].\n\n\"Of the 108 Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases diagnosed in Maharashtra so far this year [2018], 6 were symptomatic and needed immediate treatment. The remaining 102 cases were detected during fever surveillance undertaken in the affected areas. But these patients were not symptomatic and didn't need treatment,\" state entomologist Mahendra Jagtap told TOI.\n\nThe 6 patients reporting severe illness were from the endemic region of Vidarbha, including Gadchiroli and Wardha. Out of the endemic belt of Vidarbha, health officials detected one JE case each in Aurangabad and Thane this year [2018].\n\nThe other 102 patients in whose blood samples the JE virus [or antibodies?] was picked up during door-to-door fever surveillance did not develop any illness despite being exposed to the virus. They were from Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Chandrapur and Thane districts. \"Of them, Gadchiroli reported the maximum 43 JE cases,\" Jagtap said. Officials conduct door-to-door visits and rapid fever survey in areas where patients with JE are detected.\n\nExperts claimed that the mosquitoborne virus seems to have adapted and spread to areas outside its endemic zone. \"The detection of a JE patient in Aurangabad and Thane underlined the spread of the virus. It is a cause for concern and indicates that the virus is circulating in a wider geographical area,\" said another state health official, requesting anonymity.\n\nIn addition to the 11 districts in the Vidarbha region where JE is endemic, the state had for the 1st time reported cases in Pune in 2016 and 2017. A 9 year old boy died of the disease in Solapur in 2017. This was the 1st time in western Maharashtra that cases of JE were detected.\n\nMedical experts stressed the emergence of JE virus should be looked upon as a warning sign and doctors should keep a high index of suspicion to identify the viral disease. Paediatrician Jayant Joshi, former president of IAP, Pune, said, \"Every case of fever with encephalopathy (brain inflammation) should be probed for JE. Screening of patients visiting the endemic areas also needs to be done to rule out the possibility of the disease.\" An infectious disease expert said, \"Cases of viral encephalitis occur all year round, but we may be underdiagnosing JE as the test availability is not widespread.\"\n\nClinically, signs and symptoms of JE cases are similar to those of viral encephalitis. Symptoms, depending on the severity, can include headache, fever, disorientation, meningeal signs, coma, tremors, paralysis (generalized), hypertonia and loss of coordination. The JE surveillance system, experts say, should be improved to better understand the drivers of the disease expansion for instituting a robust control programme.\n\n[byline: Edward Rupert]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[With 6 clinical cases of encephalitis due to Japanese encephalitis virus infection, it is not surprising that there were 102 individuals with positive tests for JE virus or antibody but with inapparent or mild febrile infections. In those individuals, the type of test used is not mentioned, so one does not know if JE virus or antibody was detected. Interestingly, no mention is made about a vaccination campaign in the endemic areas to which virus has spread. Although this is the end of the usual Japanese encephalitis virus transmission season in India, plans for surveillance and vaccination should be made soon.\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/310. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (MP) 20181112.6141152\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (AS) 20181108.6132872\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (MP) 20180827.5991109\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (BR) 20180823.5981659\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20180818.5974190\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (UP) 20180814.5964023\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS) 20180812.5961217\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AS) 20180805.5948662\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (UP) 20180711.5900435\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (AS) 20180701.5883729\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20180628.5881510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10) 20180620.5866496\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20180618.5862346\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20180618.5860635\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MP) 20180614.5855342\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (HP) 20180607.5844658\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (KL) 20180605.5840545\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (KL) 20180530.5827153\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20180523.5812921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP), typhus 20180416.5749050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.55507\n.................................................ty/msp/sh", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6141152", "archive_id": 6141152, "date": "2018-11-12 18:06:41", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (MP)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (22): (MADHYA PRADESH)\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 11 Nov 2018, 11:10 AM\nSource: The Hitavada [edited]\nhttp://thehitavada.com/Encyc/2018/11/11/8-Japanese-Encephalitis-patients-found-so-far.aspx\n\n\nGradually, hazardous diseases like Japanese encephalitis (JE) spreading its wings over the State [of Madhya Pradesh].

The districts are Baksa, Chirang, Dhubri, Goalpara, Hailakandi, Karimganj, Dima Hasao, and Karbi Anglong. The situation is no better either in 9 other districts which registered below 70 percent JE vaccination.

However, according to sources in the National Vector-borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), Assam, the state can never attain 100 per cent JE vaccination in any of its districts.\n\nThe sources have further said that for the past 2 years, no central expert/observer has visited the state to take stock of the situation of vector-borne diseases here so far. According to the sources, JE has been detected among a few people who have been given vaccination.\n\nIn 2018, till [26 Oct 2018] as many as 488 cases have been detected in the state, and 94 of the patients have lost their lives. The highest toll by JE in the state is in Dibrugarh and Sonitpur districts -- registering 15 deaths each.

There were JE cases reported earlier in June of this year (2018) in the state. However, cases are much more frequent in northeastern states in India, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Assam.\n\nAvoidance of mosquito bites, as is usually recommended, is prudent, but vaccination is the best protective measure.

Cases of the latter have been variously ascribed to Chandipura, enteroviral infection, scrub typhus, and lychee fruit intoxication [1,2]. In 1963, 22 percent of individuals in Assam (Lakhimpur and Darrang districts) were seropositive toward JE virus. Surveys conducted during 2006 to 2014 found that Japanese encephalitis was responsible for 30 percent to 78 percent of acute encephalitis cases in Assam. A study published in 2007 found that 19.3 percent of patients with Japanese encephalitis in Assam state have concurrent neurocysticercosis (primary references available from author).

This has been frequently mentioned in comments of other ProMED-mail posts, and it is nice to have the corresponding information from Dr. Berger. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive.

A retrospective study by Murhekar M et al (https://academic.oup.com/jme/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jme/tjy042/4955586) indicates that scrub typhus may be responsible for the majority of AES cases.\n\nOne hopes that the prospective studies with collaboration of Assam state medical investigators and the USA CDC, as the season for occurrence of encephalitis cases in children progresses, will provide additional information about the etiology of AES.\n\nThe JE and AES season is now underway in northeastern India, and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year (2018). - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/309.]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20180618.5862346\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (KL) 20180530.5827153\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20180523.5812921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP), typhus 20180416.5749050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.5550774\n2017\n---\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (RJ) 20171113.5441846\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (UP) 20171106.54263192011\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (UP) 20171010.5369812\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP), RFI 20170916.5320148\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (UP) 20170902.5290553\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): comment 20170830.5283261\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to scrub typhus 20170817.5255252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14) 20170816.5252801\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20170807.5234297\n.................................................mpp/ty/msp/mpp", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5862346", "archive_id": 5862346, "date": "2018-06-18 22:47:59", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (09): (ASSAM)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 19 Jun 2018\nSource: The Telegraph [edited]\nhttps://www.telegraphindia.com/states/north-east/60-aes-cases-undetected-238656\n\n\nThe etiologies for at least 60 percent of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases in Assam are still undiagnosed, according to an ongoing research project.\n\nAccording to an expert involved with the project, around 30 percent of AES cases are likely to be those suffering from Japanese encephalitis (JE).\n\nNearly 178 people, of the 2077 diagnosed with AES in Assam in 2017, died.\n\nAssam has reported 60 AES cases this year till 30 Apr [2018] but no casualties so far.\n\nThe project was started in 2016 in collaboration with US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) so that AES cases can be treated or diagnosed effectively. \"We are trying to diagnose AES cases with the help of this project at Gauhati Medical College Hospital and Assam Medical College Hospital [AMCH],\" the expert said.\n\nThe main symptoms of AES are acute onset of fever, confusion, disorientation, inability to talk and seizures.

Under the ongoing project, all AES cases need to be reported and studied. We need to strengthen our AES surveillance system,\" the expert said.\n\nBlood samples of some undiagnosed AES cases in 2017 were sent to Atlanta-based CDC for 3rd generation genome testing to find the presence of unknown virus.

The JE and AES season is now underway in northeastern India, and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year (2018).\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299; an Assam district map at can be accessed at https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/assam/assam-district.htm. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/309.]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20180618.5860635\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MP) 20180614.5855342\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (HP) 20180618.5860635\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (KL) 20180605.5840545\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (KL) 20180530.5827153\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20180523.5812921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP), typhus 20180416.5749050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.5550774\n.................................................ty/msp/mpp", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5860635", "archive_id": 5860635, "date": "2018-06-18 10:40:45", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (08): (BIHAR)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 15 Jun 2018 00:00 IST\nSource: The Telegraph [edited]\nhttps://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/encephalitis-alarm-as-six-children-die-237756\n\n\nThe deaths of 6 children suspected to be suffering from symptoms of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis [JE] in a span of 48 hours has set off alarms in the [Bihar] health department.\n\n[In Muzaffarpur], 4 deaths from the Kejriwal Maternity Clinic and 2 from SKMCH [Shri Krishna Medical College And Hospital] have been reported from the intensive care unit (ICU) of the paediatrics wards. Currently, 11 children suspected to be afflicted with AES are undergoing treatment at Kejriwal Maternity Clinic. Blood samples of these children are being sent to the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMI) in Patna for proper investigation.\n\nThis summer [2018], 35 kids suspected to be suffering from AES and JE were admitted to SKMCH and Kejriwal Maternity Clinic. Most of the children hailed from Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, and Motihari. They had complained of trembling and heavy bouts of fever. They are being treated accordingly following the line of treatment suggested by the health department, said Lalita Singh, the chief medical officer of Muzaffarpur.\n\nThe deputy superintendent of SKMCH, Sunil Kumar Shahi, said: \"This summer [2018], 17 kids suspected to be suffering from AES and JE were admitted and 13 children were confirmed of carrying the AES virus. Till Thursday afternoon [14 Jun 2018], 4 deaths have occurred. The rest have been treated and discharged.\"\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent added, \"4 kids with suspected AES are undergoing treatment in the ICU of SKMCH.\"\n\nLalita said she has alerted all PHCs [primary health centers] in the rural areas to refer suspected cases of AES to SKMCH and Kejriwal Maternity Clinic.\n\nAnganwadi [help provide basic education for children under 6 and enroll women to undertake prenatal care] and Asha [accredited social health activist] workers have already advised people residing in countryside areas to look after the health and hygiene of their children properly. These activists have already conducted door-to-door visits in vulnerable villages to spread awareness about the virus. Parents have been advised not to let children sleep on an empty stomach and provide kids with sweets and glucose drinks at night to keep the AES virus at bay.\n\n[Byline: Najmus Shear]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is not clear how many of these cases are Japanese encephalitis (JE), if they are laboratory confirmed, and how many are AES. Bihar state is into the transmission season for JE virus and the occurrence of AES cases of undetermined etiology.\n\nThe deputy superintendent of SKMCH stated that 13 children were confirmed of carrying the AES virus. There is no virus classified as AES virus although unnamed enteroviruses have been suspected, raising the question of what was confirmed. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, and lychee fruit consumption. Scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_) has recently been implicated in many AES cases. A retrospective study by Murhekar M et al (https://academic.oup.com/jme/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jme/tjy042/4955586) indicates that scrub typhus may be responsible for the majority of AES cases.\n\nAvoidance of mosquito bites as is usually recommended is prudent, but vaccination is the best protective measure. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. Vector control is difficult. Control of vector mosquitoes is logistically difficult and expensive.

One, a 3 year old boy from Dharampur is critical and on ventilator support. The other, a 6 year old boy from Dhalli is also under intensive care. Altogether, 7 Solan kids were referred to the IGMC, Shimla, with symptoms of viral infection, but 5 were discharged.\n\nHealth secretary Preeti Sudan told The Tribune that she had spoken to the state's principal health secretary, and directed teams from the National Centre for Disease Control and the National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme to be sent to Himachal for detailed investigations into the cause of the infection.\n\nThe state surveillance officer under the Integrated Disease Control Programme had spotted symptoms of febrile illness in 7 children of Solan district and referred them to the IGMC, Shimla, suspecting Nipah virus. Their samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, to rule out Nipah and 2 of these instead tested positive for JE. \"Blood samples of these 2 children have tested positive for JE. We have now sent their cerebrospinal fluid samples to the NIV, Pune, for further investigation,\" a Health Ministry official said.\n\nHimachal has never reported JE. This is the 1st time the state has seen cases of the virus which kills 220 children under 15 pan-India every year on an average. The highest mortality rate from JE is in Uttar Pradesh where children's deaths in Gorakhpur recently sent shock waves all over the country. These deaths were primarily attributed to JE aggravated by poor healthcare facilities.\n\nSince 2010, India has seen 10 893 JE cases and 1756 deaths, a mortality rate of 17 per cent.\n\nJE has no cure. There's a preventive vaccine the government now offers under routine immunisation plan. The management of JE-infected children to minimise chances of death is the main line of care.\n\nA central multi-sectoral team rushed to Himachal will now determine whether JE infection in the state is indigenous or imported. Domestic pigs and wild birds carry the JE virus mostly transmitted by mosquitoes found around paddy fields. Mosquitoes get the infection by feeding on diseased domestic pigs and wild birds. They then further transmit the JE virus to humans.\n\n\"Central experts will have to trace the virus host and its vector -- the mosquito -- in Solan for the infection to be notified as endemic. They will also interview the local population to rule out more cases. If the virus and vector are not traced, the virus could have been imported. That possibility will then have to be determined,\" a ministry official said.\n\nHimachal, the home state of health minister JP Nadda, is the 23rd state to be affected by the deadly JE virus now. Others are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Delhi, Goa, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashta, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Bengal.\n\n[byline: Aditi Tandon]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Himachal, in far and mountainous northern India, has not been a state that has reported JE virus infections previously.

It is difficult to diagnose the disease.\"\n\nIn Assam, 10 districts, namely Dhemaji, Tinsukia, Golaghat, Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Jorhat, Lakhimpur, Sonitpur, Barpeta, and Odalguri have a high prevalence of JE and AES.\n\n\"The Dibrugarh-based Regional Medical Research Centre this year [2018] named 5 districts from the 10 \"most prevalent\" ones.\n\nThose 5 districts are Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sivsagar, Jorhat, and Lakhimpur. We have given more stress in those 5 districts to control the disease,\" Phangso said.\n\nAmong the 3 deaths due to Japanese encephalitis, 2 persons, including a minor, had been vaccinated. Phangso said the 2 persons who died in Dibrugarh were vaccinated in 2016.\n\n\"We have ordered an inquiry. It could be that the vaccination was not carried out properly,\" Phangso said.\n\nIn 2017, nearly 17 percent of the deaths in the state was because of Japanese encephalitis. Of the 604 cases of confirmed last year [2017], 87 patients died.\n\nPhangso said according to experts, all those cases may not be Japanese encephalitis but could be some other disease. Japanese encephalitis is most prevalent from May to September.\n\n[Byline: Manash Pratim Dutta]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season is just beginning in northeastern India, including Assam state. As is often the case, a minority of AES cases are due to JEV infections. It is difficult to explain the deaths of individuals vaccinated against JEV in 2016. If the vaccine is killed virus, protective immunity may be of shorter duration than live, attenuated vaccines would provide. The etiology of AES has been unclear but debated in the past decade. A recent publication of investigations conducted during the 2014 and 2015 AES outbreaks indicated that scrub typhus, caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, was the etiology in about 60 percent of those AES cases. In the report above, there is just one case of scrub typhus.\n\nAs noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption and scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_). Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. One hopes that these findings may stimulate prospective studies by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) and other scientists as the season for occurrence of encephalitis cases in children is now beginning in northeastern India and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year (2018).\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299; an Assam district map at can be accessed at https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/assam/assam-district.htm - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP), typhus 20180416.5749050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.5550774\n2017\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (RJ) 20171113.5441846\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (UP) 20171106.54263192011\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (UP) 20171010.5369812\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP), RFI 20170916.5320148\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (UP) 20170902.5290553\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): comment 20170830.5283261\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to scrub typhus 20170817.5255252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14) 20170816.5252801\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20170807.5234297\n.................................................ty/mj/lm", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5749050", "archive_id": 5749050, "date": "2018-04-16 13:15:31", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP), typhus", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (02): (UTTAR PRUDISH), TYPHUS\n*********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 4 Apr 2018\nSource: Journal of Medical Entomology [edited]\nhttps://academic.oup.com/jme/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jme/tjy042/4955586\n\n\nManoj Murhekar, Jeromie Wesley, Vivian Thangaraj, Mahima Mittal, Nivedita Gupta. Acute Encephalitis Syndrome in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India: Changing Etiological Understanding.\n\nAbstract\nSeasonal outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with high case fatality have been occurring in Gorakhpur division in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India, for more than 3 decades. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) accounted for less than 10 percent of AES cases, while the etiology of the remaining cases remained largely unknown. Investigations conducted during the 2014 and 2015 outbreaks indicated _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ (Haruo Hayashi 1920) (Norio Ogata 1929) Tamura et al. 1995 (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae) as the etiology in about 60 percent of AES cases. Hospital-based surveillance studies indicated that about 1/5th of the patients with acute febrile illness [AFI] were due to scrub typhus. Further studies are required to identify the etiology of about 1/3rd of AES cases that test negative for scrub typhus, JEV, or dengue.\n\nConclusions and way forward\nThe evidence available since 2014 indicates _O. tustsugamushi_ as the leading etiology of AES cases, accounting for over 60 percent of AES cases. In contrast, during this period, JEV accounted for only about 10 percent AES cases. The key strategies for AES control in the region needs to include 1) reducing incidence by maintaining high coverage of JEV vaccine as well as removing the misconception of vaccinators about simultaneous administration of vaccines, 2) administering doxycycline/Azithromycin to suspected scrub typhus patients attending peripheral health facilities, thereby preventing the progression of AFI to AES, and 3) reducing mortality by administering Azithromycin to all hospitalized AES patients. ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] has initiated several studies in the region to understand the epidemiology of scrub typhus. These include 1) entomological studies to characterize mite species present on rodents, 2) serological and molecular studies on rodent sera and mite pools for documenting _O. tsutsugamushi_ infection, 3) surveys to estimate the sero-prevalence of antibodies against _O. tsutsugamushi_ in human population, 4) studies to identify risk factors for acquiring scrub typhus, and 5) studies to identify factors associated with the progression of febrile illness to AES.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Occurrence of encephalitis cases in northeastern India, and especially in Uttar Pradesh state, has been a significant public health problem for many years. A report cited in an earlier ProMED-mail post (Japanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.5550774) stated that in 2017, there were 4759 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases with 595 deaths. JE cases in 2017 were 677 with 81 deaths. This came after the health department claimed it had carried out a mass immunization campaign in 38 AES-JE endemic districts in May and June [2017], covering over 9.1 million children in the age group of 1-15 years.\n\nAlthough Japanese encephalitis virus is endemic in Uttar Pradesh state and other areas in eastern India, it is frequently shown to be responsible for a minor proportion of encephalitis cases in children, the majority being classified as AES of undetermined etiology.\n\nThe determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. The above retrospective study indicates that scrub typhus may be responsible for the majority of AES cases.

Seattle-King County Public Health is investigating outbreaks of Group A _Streptococcus_, _Shigella_, and a rare group of infections transmitted by body lice among people who are homeless, as well as monitoring a potential outbreak of hepatitis A, a potentially fatal disease that spread in San Diego.\n\n\"The fact that we're seeing multiple, different infections now increasing in the homeless population is an indicator of the sheer increase in the number of homeless people (in King County) and the fact that they're in crowded conditions with poor hygiene and sanitation,\" said Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for Public Health -- Seattle & King County.\n\nAt a King County Board of Health meeting on [Thu 15 Mar 2018], Dr. John Lynch, medical director of infection prevention and control at Harborview Medical Center, said at least 2 people have died since January 2018 when group A strep [_Streptococcus_], which can be spread through open wounds, become necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as \"flesh eating disease\". It is unclear if those cases were among people who are homeless; case reviews are ongoing. But strep A cases at Harborview nearly doubled between 2016 and 2017, to 219 cases in 2017, and \"almost all are happening among homeless people,\" Lynch said. \"It's incredibly concerning. We're seeing it on the front lines at Harborview,\" said Lynch.\n\nThe county board of health passed a resolution on [Thu 15 Mar 2018] urging more sanitation and hygiene services for unsheltered homeless people. At the meeting, Seattle officials described their efforts to increase toilets, hot water and hand-washing stations at the city's 6 sanctioned encampments, and to bring hand-washing kits to the city's many unsanctioned camps. But Seattle City Councilmember Sally Bagshaw urged more such services. \"This is what happens to people if you don't have places where you can wash, get cleaned up,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to strep A, public health officials issued an advisory in February 2018 about outbreaks of shigellosis, a highly contagious diarrheal illness, and from _Bartonella quintana_, an infection known as \"trench fever\" when it spread among World War I soldiers. It is spread by body lice and can result in fevers and rashes or more serious infections of the heart or blood vessels.\n\nThere has been an average of 89 cases a year of shigellosis in King County since 2013, but the number of reported rose to 164 cases in 2017. Most of the cases are among people who are housed, and have been uncommon among homeless people, but there have been 8 cases of among homeless people in King County since December 2017, compared to an average of 3 cases per year over the past 5 years, according to public health data.\n\nA total of 3 cases of _Bartonella quintana_ have been identified among people who are homeless since mid-2017.\n\nIn addition, Lynch said the winter flu outbreak arrived a month early and hit homeless people unusually hard, and a particular strain of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a highly contagious virus, had spread through homeless people.\n\nDuchin, the public health officer, emphasized that the county's homeless population was already experiencing a health crisis, even before the uptick in these illnesses. Homeless people have life spans that are decades shorter than housed people. \"That's alarming,\" Duchin said. \"Homeless people suffer from poor health across every health condition that you can imagine.\"\n\nThe public health advisories in February [2018] were issued just as homeless advocates protested Seattle's decision to reduce funding for some hygiene and emergency services for that population, as part of a structural shift in Seattle's homeless spending. As part of that restructuring, more emergency shelters are offering hygiene and shower facilities, but funding for stand-alone hygiene centers for homeless people was reduced until the Seattle City Council restored 1 million USD in funding in February 2018.\n\nAccording to 2017's one-night count, more than 5485 homeless people were unsheltered in King County, which has doubled since 2013.\n\nThe city's Navigation Team, which does outreach to people living in the city's unauthorized homeless encampments, often look for conditions that could spread infectious diseases -- and it is one of the reasons the city can justify removing a camp. Needles and human waste are common in some of these camps.\n\nDuchin noted that _shigella_ is spread in the same ways as hepatitis A, and it remains a concern in Seattle since a massive outbreak of the disease spread through California's homeless population in the fall of 2017, killing at least 21 people. At least one case of hepatitis A has been reported in a homeless person in Seattle, but officials believe the patient had no context with homeless encampments or shelters in the region. \"The fact that we are seeing a shigellosis outbreak in our population is a reminder that hepatitis A could spread just as easily if it's introduced,\" he said.\n\n[Byline: Vianna Davila and Jonathan Martin]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[\"Sanctioning\" encampments of the homeless should certainly come with providing basic hygienic services to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases which can spread from person-to-person by direct contact, by fecal-oral transmission or by the respiratory route depending on the specific organism. As was done by San Diego county in dealing with the large hepatitis A outbreak in southern California, it can be necessary to change the paradigm in addressing the problems of these disenfranchised people. Often, only when the infection spills over from a underserved population into the general [voting] public will politicians get involved.\n\nHuman infections with _Bartonella quintana_, spread by the body louse, perhaps more correctly referred to as the clothing louse since it lives primarily on clothing and transfers itself to the human body for blood meals, are being increasingly recognized, especially in the homeless.\n\nThe problem of louse-borne infections in the homeless is addressed in the following publication:\nLeibler JH, Zakhour CM, Gadhoke P and Gaeta JM: Zoonotic and vector-borne infections among urban homeless and marginalized people in the United States and Europe, 1990-2014. Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2016 Jul;16(7):435-44.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\"Introduction: In high-income countries, homeless individuals in urban areas often live in crowded conditions with limited sanitation and personal hygiene. The environment of homelessness in high-income countries may result in intensified exposure to ectoparasites and urban wildlife, which can transmit infections. To date, there have been no systematic evaluations of the published literature to assess vector-borne and zoonotic disease risk to these populations.\n\n\"Objectives: The primary objectives of this study were to identify diversity, prevalence, and risk factors for vector-borne and zoonotic infections among people experiencing homelessness and extreme poverty in urban areas of high-income countries.\n\n\"Methods: We conducted a systematic review and narrative synthesis of published epidemiologic studies of zoonotic and vector-borne infections among urban homeless and very poor people in the United States and Europe from 1990 to 2014.\n\n\"Results: 31 observational studies and 14 case studies were identified (n\u2009=\u200945). Seroprevalence to the human louse-borne pathogen _Bartonella quintana_ (seroprevalence range: 0-37.5 percent) was identified most frequently, with clinical disease specifically observed among HIV-positive individuals. Seropositivity to _Bartonella henselae_ (range: 0-10.3 percent) and _Rickettsia akari_ (range: 0-16.2 percent) was noted in multiple studies. Serological evidence of exposure to _Rickettsia typhi_, _Rickettsia prowazekii_, _Bartonella elizabethae_, West Nile virus, _Borellia recurrentis_, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, _Wohlfartiimonas chitiniclastica_, Seoul hantavirus (SEOV), and _Leptospira_ species was also identified in published studies, with SEOV associated with chronic renal disease later in life. HIV infection, injection drug use, and heavy drinking were noted across multiple studies as risk factors for infection with vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens.\n\n\"Conclusions:: _B. quintana_ was the most frequently reported vector-borne infection identified in our article. Delousing efforts and active surveillance among HIV-positive individuals, who are at elevated risk of complication from _B. quintana_ infection, are advised to reduce morbidity. Given documented exposure to rodent-borne zoonoses among urban homeless and marginalized people, reducing human contact with rodents remains an important public health priority.\"\n\nOf the organisms mentioned, only _B. quintana_ and _R. prowazekii_ are classically spread by body lice. The organisms are excreted in the \"dust-like\" feces of the lice and can be inoculated into the skin feeding site by excoriation caused by scratching of pruritic lesions. Well shown in _R. prowazekii_, the etiologic agent of epidemic typhus, humans can be infected via the respiratory route through aerolization of the organization's feces without being exposed directly to the infected louse.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nWashington State, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248]\nSee Also\n1999\n----\nBartonellosis, homeless persons - France 19990122.0102\n.................................................ll/ao/dk", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5550774", "archive_id": 5550774, "date": "2018-01-10 23:41:01", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA: (KARNATAKA, UTTAR PRADESH)\n*******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this report:\n[1] Karnataka\n[2] Uttar Pradesh\n\n******\n[1] Karnataka\nDate: Tue 9 Jan 2018\nSource: The Times of India [edited]\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/dk-district-records-its-first-japanese-encephalitis-fatality/articleshow/62427388.cms\n\n\nJapanese encephalitis (JE), an infection of the brain caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), has claimed its 1st victim in the district this year [2018]. This is also the 1st ever death due to JE in the district.\n\nThe victim is a man, 55, a resident of Puttur. He was admitted for fever on 4 Dec [2017] in Puttur and later was shifted to a hospital in Mangaluru as the fever did not subside. He went back home a few days in January [2018], and the infection recurred. He died at a hospital in Puttur on Monday [8 Jan 2018].\n\nDr BV Rajesh, District Surveillance Officer, confirmed that the patient died due to JEV, saying the test results came back positive for the virus infection from Manipal Centre for Virus Research (MCVR), Manipal.\n\nDr Arun Kumar, District Malaria Officer said though there have been JV infections, this is the 1st JE death in the district. While there were 3 JV infections reported in 2015, 2 were reported in 2017 in the district in December month [2017], and one of them died. Another case was reported in Pudu PHC of Bantwal taluk. The year 2016 had no JV cases reported.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization website, the infection is caused by JEV, a flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses, and is spread by _Culex_ mosquitoes. JEV is the main cause of viral encephalitis in many countries of Asia with an estimated 68 000 clinical cases every year. There is no cure for the disease. The treatment is focused on relieving severe clinical signs and supporting the patient to overcome the infection. WHO has recommended integrating JV vaccine into national immunization schedules in all areas where JE disease is recognized as public health issue.\n\nIn the neighbouring district of Udupi, after 4 JE cases were reported, health officials were mulling on making the vaccine compulsory. In 2017, Udupi reported 3 cases of JV and one this year [2018].\n\nWHO states most JEV infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms, but approximately one in 250 infections results in severe clinical illness. Severe disease is characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and ultimately death. The case-fatality rate can be as high as 30 percent among those with disease symptoms. Of those who survive, 20-30 percent suffer permanent intellectual, behavioural or neurological problems such as paralysis, recurrent seizures or the inability to speak.\n\nJEV is transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species (mainly _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_). Humans, once infected, do not develop sufficient viraemia to infect feeding mosquitoes. The virus exists in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and/or water birds (enzootic cycle).\n\n[Byline: Stanley Pinto]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A few, sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been reported in Karnataka state over the years.

Data from the health department has revealed that from 2008 to 2017, the maximum number of AES and JE cases came in the past year. Both diseases manifest in the form of brain fever.\n\nThe highest number of JE deaths in UP was also recorded in 2017. In August 2017, around 30 children affected by JE admitted at Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College had died over shortage of oxygen supply.\n\nAccording to the health department's own analysis, AES is a disease of significant magnitude in the state. Though 38 districts are endemic for AES, the predominant disease and mortality burden is carried by 7 districts of eastern UP, in Gorakhpur and Basti divisions.\n\nIn 2017, there were 4759 AES cases with 595 deaths. JE cases in 2017 were 677 with 81 deaths. This came after the health department claimed it had carried out a mass immunization campaign in 38 AES-JE endemic districts in May and June [2017], covering over 9.1 million children in the age group of 1-15 years.\n\nAES cases between 2006 and 2007 were recorded at 2075 and 2675, with deaths at 476 and 577, respectively. JE cases in 2006 and 2007 were 170 and 235, with 49 and 29 deaths, respectively.\n\nOn the spike in cases and deaths, director for communicable diseases and the vector borne diseases unit of the health department Dr Mithilesh Chaturvedi said: \"The number of cases has increased, but the case fatality rate (CFR) has gone down in the past 10 years. This means that cases are being reported, but fatality has decreased.\"\n\nShe added: \"The CFR [case fatality rate] in 2017 for AES cases was 12.5 percent and that for JE was 11.9 percent. This in 2016 was 16.3 percent for AES and 16.7 percent for JE.\" Officials also reasoned that it was because of the awareness created around brain fever by ASHA workers on the ground that cases had increased. More people were aware that the fever affecting their child was AES or JE.\n\n[Byline: Yusra Husain]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The report does not state whether the vaccine being administered is a killed (inactivated) one with limited duration of immunity or a live, attenuated one that would provide much longer protection. It is interesting that the above report clearly differentiates acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) from JE cases. In previous reports, this differentiation often has not been made. The etiological agent or conditions responsible for AES are not mentioned above. Previous reports indicate that JE is a minor cause of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh state. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases but is very unlikely for infants. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nUttar Pradesh State, India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/322]\nSee Also\n2017\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (RJ) 20171113.5441846\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (UP) 20171106.54263192011\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (UP) 20171010.5369812\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP), RFI 20170916.5320148\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (UP) 20170902.5290553\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): comment 20170830.5283261\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to scrub typhus 20170817.5255252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14) 20170816.5252801\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20170807.5234297\n2011\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (27) 20111012.3054\n.................................................sb/ml/ty/msp/ml", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5487872", "archive_id": 5487872, "date": "2017-12-06 20:43:02", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (27): (RJ)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (27): (RAJASTHAN)\n*********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 6 Dec 2017\nSource: Hindustan Times [edited]\nhttp://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/two-more-cases-of-japanese-encephalitis-detected-in-bundi/story-bwhMduArtD1u6X0hHT70dL.html\n\n\nWith 2 more patients of Japanese encephalitis (JE) detected at Keshoraipatan town in Bundi district recently, the number of patients suffering from the disease has reached 3 in the district this year [2017], officials said on Wednesday [6 Dec 2017].\n\nA rural woman of Keshoraipatan, age 30, had died of Japanese encephalitis at the Government Maharao Bhim Singh Hospital in Kota on 31 Oct [2017] [see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (RJ) 20171113.5441846].\n\nGiving information about the 2 new cases, Dr Ravi Prakash Mathur, additional director, rural health, Rajasthan, said that following the Keshoraipatan resident's death, a health department team was sent in the 1st half of November [2017] from Jaipur to assess the situation in Keshoraipatan region.\n\nThe team had collected larvae samples of _Culex_ mosquitoes, besides collecting blood samples of 6 human beings. \"The blood samples of an 80-year-old and 35-year-old individual, along with other samples, were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, last month. Their reports have arrived now, and the 2 people have been tested positive for JE,\" he said.\n\nWhile one has recovered now, one person has been referred to the Government Medical College in Kota for further treatment,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, another team of the medical and health department visited Keshoraipatan and Arnetha regions of Bundi district on Tuesday [5 Dec 2017] and took samples of 6 people, including 4 people of Keshoraipatan and 2 people of Arnetha. The team also collected several larvae samples.\n\nMathur said that Japanese encephalitis usually spreads in the areas where flood irrigation happens. \"Since Keshoraipatan is known for rice cultivation in canal fed agricultural fields, so it could be the reason for emergence of the disease in the area,\" he said. He said guidelines for surveillance and diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis have been issued to the local health officials in Bundi.\n\nJapanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, which primarily affects children and also elderly people above 60 years whose immunity remains low. \"Most JE infections are characterised by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and others,\" he said.\n\nJapanese encephalitis is transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species (mainly _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_). The virus exists in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and water birds. There is no specific treatment for Japanese encephalitis and has only supportive treatment, but there is an effective vaccine available to prevent the disease, said the doctor.\n\nOne of the affected people, who suffered from Japanese encephalitis, had to spend hours for hospital admission at the New Government Medical Hospital in Kota. \"When I showed my father in OPD, doctors initially prescribed medicines for him instead of admitting him, but finally admitted him,\" alleged the man's son.\n\nWhen confronted with the patient's complaint, the government hospital physician, Dr Manoj Saluja, said, \"The patient did not exhibit any symptoms of JE, so he was not admitted initially, but since he was referred for diagnosis and tested positive for JE, he was admitted for observation for a day,\" he said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As noted in the previous post, Rajasthan state in northwestern India is far away from the usual Japanese encephalitis (JE) endemic areas in the northeast of the country, making these 3 cases geographically unusual. However, these may not be the 1st cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Rajasthan. A child was referred to J K Lon hospital from the Bansur area, Alwar and died on 15 Oct 2012. It is suspected that the child was suffering from viral encephalitis. He, along with 6 other children, were admitted to J K Lon hospital and were clinically suspected cases of viral encephalitis.

What is more worrying, the virus seems to have adapted and spread to areas outside its endemic zone. In fact, along with dengue and chikungunya, JE has emerged as a potential threat this year.\n\nTill recently, JE cases were mostly confined to the state's eastern districts. However, most of the cases now are being reported from outside of the endemic zone. \"Maharashtra has recorded a total of 26 Japanese encephalitis cases so far this year [2017]. Of these, 21 cases were recorded from outside the endemic areas, including Pune, Jalna, Raigad, Parbhani, Osmanabad, and Solapur,\" said MS Diggikar, the joint commissioner (vector-borne diseases) of the state health department.\n\nThis shift in transmission base of the virus is being observed for the 1st time in Maharashtra, indicating the virus's greater adaptability. Understandably, this has set the alarm bells ringing. State surveillance officer Pradip Awate said, \"We have been diagnosing the virus outside the endemic areas, mainly western Maharashtra and the Marathwada region, for the last one-and-a-half years. This means that the virus's endemic areas are expanding. It sure warrants a close watch.\"\n\nThe JE surveillance system, experts say, should be improved to better understand the drivers of the disease expansion for instituting a robust control programme. Awate also underlined the need for an in-depth study to gauge the virus's adaptability to different environs and vectors.\n\n[Byline: Umesh Isalkar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Historically, JE cases have been relatively uncommon in this area. This year (2017) things are different, with 26 cases. The reasons for the increased case numbers and expansion into areas not considered endemic is undefined \"virus adaptability\". More likely, it is due to an increase in vector mosquito populations, or increases in numbers of reservoir bird hosts, or of pigs, the amplifying hosts. Studies of field conditions are needed. Avoidance of mosquito bites as is usually recommended is prudent, but vaccination is the best protective measure. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. Vector control is difficult.\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/310\n- Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (MP) 20171119.5452732\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (RJ) 20171113.5441846\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (UP) 20171106.5426319\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (UP) 20171010.5369812\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (MH) 20170928.5347400\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP), RFI 20170916.5320148\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (UP) 20170902.5290553\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): comment 20170830.5283261\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (OR) 20170820.5263062\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to scrub typhus 20170817.5255252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14) 20170816.5252801\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (MN) 20170811.5244526\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20170807.5234297\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20170805.5229244\nJapanese encephalitis & other - Asia: India (MN) Bangladesh (RP) 20170801.5216309\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20170717.5183403\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (BR) 20170713.5170870\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (AS) 20170710.5162050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (JH) susp. 20170705.5151252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (MH) 20170622.5124128\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (OR) 20170620.5119632\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (OR) 20170604.5082374\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (PB) 20170421.4984702\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20170402.4942606\nAcute toxic encephalopathy - India: (BR) lychee fruit, 2014 20170202.4809638\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (AS) 20170101.4733821\n.................................................ty/mj/ml", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5452732", "archive_id": 5452732, "date": "2017-11-19 10:53:51", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (MP)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (25): (MADHYA PRADESH)\n**************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 15 Nov 2017\nSource: Nyoooz [edited]\nhttps://www.nyoooz.com/news/bhopal/960871/beware-encephalitis-lurks-in-bhopal/\n\n\nThe dreaded Japanese encephalitis [JE] virus is lurking in Bhopal, adding an ominous threat to a city reeling from unprecedented spread of dengue, chikungunya and swine flu this year [2017].\n\nThere, 2 persons have tested positive for JE [virus] infection, where the mortality rate is as high as 30 percent, triggering vector-control drives in 4 localities. \"JE has been confirmed in 2 cases.

Although the state government had denied the reports, the then college principal, the in-charge of the neo-natal ward as well as clerks and the pharmacist were sacked for negligence.

This was disclosed by the Secretary, Health and Human Services Secretariat (HHSS) of FCTA, Amanda Pam, while briefing newsmen on Thursday [12 Oct 2017].\n\nIt has in the meantime denied rumours that there is an outbreak of monkeypox in Abuja in the nation's capital. According to the Secretary, \"3 suspected cases were recorded in National Hospital, 2 in Gwarinpa Hospital, one each in University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada and Nyanya General Hospital.\"\n\nShe said the recorded cases were that of chickenpox, which shares a similar appearance to monkeypox. On Wednesday [11 Oct 2017], there were a rumoured 2 cases of monkeypox at Gwarinpa General Hospital, Abuja.\n\n\"Though we have some suspected cases, samples were collected and sent to the lab, so we are waiting for the results, but from all indications, it is not monkeypox. But I think I like the suspicion, because it's better to suspect than to ignore it and it later turns out to be positive. The truth now is that there is no confirmed case of monkeypox disease in FCT,\" she stressed.\n\nExplaining further, Acting Director, Public Health, FCT Humphrey Okoroukwu disclosed that he had already visited the said hospital on Wednesday [11 Oct 2017], reaffirming that no case of the virus was found.\n\nHe said surveillance officers from the public health department of the FCTA are being deployed to the 62 wards of the territory, as a precautionary measure against threatening health issues.\n\nThe federal government had, through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Monday [9 Oct 2017], confirmed a suspected outbreak of monkeypox in 7 states in Nigeria, which included Bayelsa, Rivers, Ekiti, Akwa Ibom, Lagos, Ogun and Cross River states.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Coordinator, National Centre For Disease Control (NCDC) Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu on Thursday [12 Oct 2017] informed lawmakers that 33 cases of monkeypox infection had been reported in 7 states of the federation. The NCDC scribe said that 17 out of the number manifested in Bayelsa state alone. According to him, other states where the disease has manifested are Rivers, Ekiti, Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Lagos, and Ogun. He, however, pointed out that it was not certain whether all the victims reported to have been afflicted by monkeypox were actually infected by the virus or by other diseases with similar symptoms.\n\nSenators have also described as a national embarrassment and shame the lack of a public diagnostic centre for detection of the current outbreak in some states of the federation.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Secretary, Health and Human Services Secretariat indicated that the 7 cases in the 4 hospitals were chickenpox, not monkeypox. The diagnosis of chickenpox apparently was made on the basis of clinical presentation. She pointed out that the clinical picture of chickenpox and monkeypox were similar but she implied are differentiable. The status of the other cases in the 7 states reported as monkeypox have not been laboratory confirmed yet.\n\nAs noted in comments in the previous posts, laboratory confirmation of the 31 suspected monkeypox cases is essential. Rapid appearance of the disease across 7 states in less than 3 weeks is unusual for monkeypox. Isolated and scattered cases are more common. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Although not determined, the main reservoirs of monkeypox are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). The current outbreak appears to be more characteristic of direct transmission between individuals rather than spillover from a wild rodent reservoir, raising the question about involvement of some other transmissible pathogen such as varicella (chickenpox).\n\nMaps of Nigeria can be accessed at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nMonkeypox - Africa (08): Nigeria 20171010.5369514\nMonkeypox - Africa (07): Nigeria 20171009.5368881\nMonkeypox - Africa (06): Nigeria 20171007.5366637\n.................................................sb/dk/ty/msp/dk", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5369812", "archive_id": 5369812, "date": "2017-10-10 16:50:56", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (UP)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (22): (UTTAR PRADESH)\n*************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Vaccination campaign\n[2] More deaths\n\n******\n[1] Vaccination campaign\nDate: Mon 9 Oct 2017, 3:33 PM IST\nSource: Hindustan Times [edited]\nhttp://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/je-aes-vaccination-to-begin-from-jan-in-up-health-minister/story-KdDmF0uMFAHX6SmaqQATSK.html\n\n\nTo protect children from Japanese encephalitis (JE), Uttar Pradesh Health and Family Welfare Department has planned to organise vaccination of children from January next year [2018].\n\nThe department has also sought assistance of Bihar government in tackling the flow of patients to BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur as well as district hospitals located in bordering districts.\n\nTalking to HT, health minister Siddharth Nath Singh said, earlier vaccination was launched before the onset of monsoon in April and May [2017] in 20 districts. This year 9.3 million children were vaccinated. Though the number of JE cases came down, the flow of the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) patients multiplied. \"Learning lessons from the past we have decided to launch the vaccination programme earlier this year. The state government has written to the central government to supply the vaccine early,\" he said.\n\nThe department has also planned to increase 10 beds in the JE/AES wards established in the district hospitals and 100 beds in Mother and Child Hospital in Gorakhpur, he said.\n\nSecretary, health and family welfare V Hekali Zhimomi said there is large flow of JE/AES patients to Gorakhpur and adjoining districts from bordering districts in Bihar each year. \"Hospitals are overburdened due to sudden increase of patients during monsoon. We have urged Bihar government to provide facilities to such patients in their state. We have also invited doctors from Bihar for a training programme organised by the state health department,\" she said.\n\nThe health department has also hired the services of CMC Vellore and PATH Foundation to train the government doctors managing the critical care units in the hospital. The PATH Foundation will also submit a report on the gaps in the health services in the JE/AES sensitive districts. The aim is to strengthen the health service and provide better facilities to the patients, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Auxiliary Nursing Midwives (ANM), Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) and Anganwari [also termed Anganwadi; a type of rural mother and child care centre in India] workers posted in villages are also being trained to raise awareness among people.\n\nThe health department has also decided to deploy health education officers for awareness programme. The focus will be on early admission of the patients to nearby primary health centres and community health centres. The officers will also raise awareness among villagers through information-education-communication (IEC) regarding preventive measures, symptom of the disease and early examination by the medical practitioner.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The vaccination campaign carried out before the monsoon transmission season will be helpful in preventing cases of JE. The type of vaccine to be employed is not stated. If it's an inactivated vaccine, the duration of immunity will be relatively short and revaccination, perhaps annually, will be necessary to maintain good immunity. If the vaccine is live attenuated, immunity will be longer, perhaps life-long. Previous reports indicate that JE is a minor cause of encephalitis in northeastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption.

Though pigs and wild birds are the primary carriers of the JE virus, it is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nRecently, the doctors at D Y Patil hospital in Pimpri had sent the blood sample of a 49-year-old woman to National Institute of Virology (NIV) for tests, and the sample tested positive for Japanese encephalitis. The patient is a resident of village Bhose (Khed taluka), in Pune district.\n\nThis is the 4th JE case recorded in Pune in the last 11 months. On [16 Jun 2017], a 10-month-old child from Kondhwa had tested positive for JE. Prior to that, 2 students in Pune had tested positive for JE in November and December last year [2016].\n\n\"The woman suffered from fever and convulsions. She was admitted to D Y Patil Medical College and hospital on [4 Sep 2017]. Her blood sample tested positive for JE antibodies (IgM) at NIV on [20 Sep 2017]. She is currently undergoing treatment at the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU),\" said district malaria officer Suresh Dhekle. The woman belongs to the family of ironsmiths. \"She has 3 children and a husband. All other family members are healthy. We have carried out fever surveillance in the village and have not found any other fever patient,\" Dhekle added.\n\nState surveillance officer Pradip Awate said, \"This is the 2nd case in Pune this year [2017] and 4th since November 2016. We have stepped up surveillance in and around the patient's home.\"\n\nExperts said the spread of the disease was a cause for concern as it indicates that the virus was circulating in a wider geographical area. In the past, JE cases were mainly reported from the state's eastern districts, including Chandrapur, Gondia, Bhandara, Nagpur and Gadchiroli.\n\n[Byline: Umesh Isalkar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[JE cases are relatively uncommon in this area. There were 2 JE cases confirmed in Pune in December 2016 (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (39): (MA) 20161223.4720235). Avoidance of mosquito bites as is usually recommended is prudent, but vaccination is the best protective measure. The virus is endemic in north western India with birds as reservoir hosts and pigs as amplifiers. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands.

Though the number of JE patients came down, AES cases continued to grow.

The officers will also create awareness among villagers through information-education-communication (IEC) regarding preventive measures, symptom of the disease and early examination by medical practitioners.\n\n\"The department has identified 676 high-risk villages in Gorakhpur region where maximum cases of JE/AES have been reported. The district magistrates have been directed to launch sanitation drive in villages, organise awareness campaigns and carry out fogging to eliminate mosquitoes and mites which are the carriers of the virus [Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-transmitted virus, scrub typhus is a mite-transmitted rickettsial bacterium. - Mod.TY],\" she said.\n\nServices of Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore and PATH Foundation will be taken to train government doctors managing critical care units at the hospital.\n\nThe health department is also working to build confidence of government doctors at PHCs and CHCs.\n\nIt was found during the study that instead of handling patients, the doctors at health centres referred them to BRD Medical College. The aim is to reduce the burden of medical college which receives huge number of patients from Bihar and Nepal as well. The state government is improving facilities at district hospitals and CHCs.\n\n\"The doctors have been asked to admit JE/AES patients to the hospital rather than referring them to medical college,\" she said.\n\nTalking to HT, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the state government had decided to seek the assistance of private doctors and members of the Indian Medical Association to check AES.\n\nThe unit of National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, located in Gorakhpur, will be strengthened to conduct research work.\n\n[Byline: Rajesh Kumar Singh]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive.

However, 97 of 1527 childhood deaths between 1 Jul-14 Aug 2017 are attributed to JE and AES, and since then 2/3 of childhood deaths are due to JE and AES. [These apparently contradictory statistics are being explained (rightly or wrongly) on the assumption that the 2/3 proportion refers to deaths since 14 Aug 2017. Clarification would be appreciated. - Mods.TY/SH]\n\nThe report above also indicates that since children have been vaccinated against JE virus infections, deaths have gone down. The proportions of these deaths due to JE and to AES are not indicated. AES continues to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. Clearly, prospective studies are needed to define the causes of AES. Until the etiologies are known, prevention and effective treatment will not be possible.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and a http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1307. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (OR) 20170820.5263062\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to scrub typhus 20170817.5255252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14) 20170816.5252801\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (MN) 20170811.5244526\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20170807.5234297\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20170805.5229244\nJapanese encephalitis & other - Asia: India (MN) Bangladesh (RP) 20170801.5216309\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20170717.5183403\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (BR) 20170713.5170870\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (AS) 20170710.5162050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (JH) susp. 20170705.5151252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (MH) 20170622.5124128\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (OR) 20170620.5119632\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (OR) 20170604.5082374\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (PB) 20170421.4984702\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20170402.4942606\nAcute toxic encephalopathy - India: (BR) lychee fruit, 2014 20170202.4809638\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (AS) 20170101.4733821\nScrub typhus - India (02): (HP) 20170629.5138780\nScrub typhus - India: increasing recognition 20170615.5107234\n.................................................ty/mj/sh", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5263062", "archive_id": 5263062, "date": "2017-08-20 22:35:19", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (OR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (16): (ODISHA)\n******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 19 Aug 2017, 2:24 AM IST\nSource: The New Indian Express, Press Trust of India (PTI) [edited]\nhttp://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/aug/19/odisha-government-blames-consumption-of-cassia-seeds-for-encephalitis-outbreak-1645232.html\n\n\nMonsoon fevers are de rigueur in Odisha. While swine flu and dengue are spreading in the urban areas, the tribal hinterland has been beset with outbreaks of encephalitis since 2012. Though no Japanese encephalitis (JE) mortalities have been registered as yet in the official records, 473 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have been diagnosed so far. Odisha stands 5th in AES mortality after Uttar Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal and Bihar.\n\nAccording to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, AES had taken 13 lives by the 1st week of August [2017].\n\nBoth AES and JE have been regular in Odisha since 2012. Last year, the state grabbed the national headlines when 115 children died of AES and 42 fell to JE. Most of the deaths were reported from Malkangiri district.\n\nBut the state government has been equivocating on the incidence of AES. It went to the extent of claiming that consumption of seeds of a plant called _Cassia occidentalis_, locally known as Bada Chakunda, caused death of a 3rd of the children who fell to encephalitis in Malkangiri district.\n\nAn expert committee suggested that JE could not be blamed for all the deaths because \"encephalopathy\" was the culprit. Encephalopathy, it said, is a non-infectious biochemical syndrome that can be aggravated by the consumption of _Cassia_ seeds. The fact is the Naveen Patnaik government remained aloof to the spread of AES, which is caused by a vector-borne virus hosted by pigs.\n\nThe Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar, carried out a study on the outbreak of AES in Malkangiri in 2015 but its findings were not paid heed to. From 38 deaths in 2012 to 115 in 2016, the AES surge was waiting to happen.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of the end of May [2017], there were 313 cases of AES with 10 deaths in Odisha and now the case count is 473 with 13 deaths in the 1st week of August [2017]. Odisha state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and cases occur there frequently. As with cases of encephalitis mentioned above and in other states in northeastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus and are classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with undetermined etiology.\n\nAs noted in previous ProMED-mail comments, AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_) and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed.\n\nHowever, in November 2016 the Odisha state government formed the 6-member panel, led by eminent virologist Dr Jacob John from Vellore's Christian Medical College. In the interim report, Dr John said that anthraquinone, a toxin found in the plant [_Cassia occidentalis_], was found in the urine sample of 5 deceased children. \"This indicates that the children (had) consumed the seeds of the plant,\" he said. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and for Odisha state at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315. - Mod.TY]\n\n[_Cassia occidentalis_, also called _Senna occidentalis_, produces seeds, in long seed pods that are sometimes roasted and made into a coffee-like beverage, Its roots, leaves, flowers, and seeds have been used medicinally as, for example, a laxative (attributed to the actions of anthraquinones found in the plant), an antipyretic, a tonic , and a diuretic (http://www.rain-tree.com/fedegosa.htm#.WZoIOsaZPjA). - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to scrub typhus 20170817.5255252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14) 20170816.5252801\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (MN) 20170811.5244526\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20170807.5234297\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20170805.5229244\nJapanese encephalitis & other - Asia: India (MN) Bangladesh (RP) 20170801.5216309\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20170717.5183403\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (BR) 20170713.5170870\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (AS) 20170710.5162050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (JH) susp. 20170705.5151252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (MH) 20170622.5124128\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (OR) 20170620.5119632\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (OR) 20170604.5082374\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (PB) 20170421.4984702\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20170402.4942606\nAcute toxic encephalopathy - India: (BR) lychee fruit, 2014 20170202.4809638\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (AS) 20170101.4733821\nScrub typhus - India (02): (HP) 20170629.5138780\nScrub typhus - India: increasing recognition 20170615.5107234\n.................................................ty/ao/ml", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5255252", "archive_id": 5255252, "date": "2017-08-17 20:16:49", "headline": "PRO/AH> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to scrub typhus", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (15): (UTTAR PRADESH) ACUTE ENCEPHALITIS SYNDROME DUE TO SCRUB TYPHUS\n************************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 16 Aug 2017\nSource: The Hindu [edited]\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/only-some-children-with-fever-progress-to-aes-says-doctor/article19499880.ece\n\n\nBased on a study carried out in 2015, a team led by Dr Manoj V Murhekar, Director of the Chennai-based National Institute of Epidemiology, found scrub typhus to be responsible for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in 63 percent of patients admitted to the Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur [Uttar Pradesh state, UP].\n\nThe study was repeated last year [2016] by the same team by comparing children with AES and healthy children who are siblings of the patients or living in the same village.\n\nIt found that AES patients had 35 times greater possibility of having antibodies against scrub typhus compared with healthy children thereby confirming that AES was caused by scrub typhus.\n\nExcerpts from an interview with Dr Manoj Murhekar:\n- Have you carried out any studies this year [2017] on children admitted to BRD hospital with AES? How likely is scrub typhus to have caused AES this year as well?\nThe causation of the disease or etiology will not change from year to year. In 2015 and 2016 we have seen that scrub typhus was responsible for over 60 percent of AES and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes less than 10 percent of AES in children below 15 years. Scrub typhus was responsible for over 60 percent of AES even in 2014. There is vaccination for JE virus but no intervention has been implemented widely for scrub typhus. So the etiology wouldn't have changed compared with last year.\n\n- Besides BRD hospital, is there any other referral hospital in that region? What is the extent of population that BRD hospital caters to?\nExcept BRD hospital, there is no referral hospital in the Gorakhpur Division in Uttar Pradesh. The hospital caters to people living in Gorakhpur Division (4 districts) and Basti division in UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and even Nepal.\n\n- Why do we see a large number of children with AES each year at BRD hospital?\nThere is a lot of scrub typhus fever in the community. Between 20-25 percent of fever in children being attended to at PHCs [primary health centres] is caused by scrub typhus. Only a small percentage of these children progress to AES. Most of the cases in the community are sub-clinical with no symptoms or very mild fever. Only some children with fever will progress to AES. The hospital sees 1500-2000 cases each year and 80 percent of these cases are during July to October.\n\nAbout 1/4 of patients with AES are adults. Generally, adults develop immunity against scrub typhus, so only those who have not been exposed to scrub typhus will progress to AES.\n\n- Is there any specific reason why scrub typhus is found only in this region?\nIt is not correct to say it is restricted only to this region. Scrub typhus is found even in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu it is found in Vellore and Thiruvallur districts. About 7-10 percent of fever in these 2 districts is caused by scrub typhus. The reason why it is found only in these 2 districts in Tamil Nadu is because researchers have investigated for scrub typhus in these 2 districts.\n\n- Is it possible to treat scrub typhus and prevent the infection from progressing to AES?\nIn the beginning of this year [2017], the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommended to the Uttar Pradesh government to use doxycycline antibiotic to treat children with fever for 5 days. The ICMR shared an algorithm with the Uttar Pradesh government which tells which fever should be treated with doxycycline and the dosage. If treated early with doxycycline, then children will not progress to AES. This prevention strategy has to be implemented widely and even by doctors in the private sector before we see results. In July [2017], ICMR and doctors from the Christian Medical College, Vellore went to Gorakhpur and conducted awareness campaign for Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Indian Association of Paediatrics (IAP) doctors, chief medical officers, and programme officers.\n\n- Why is the death rate high at 20 percent in children with AES?\nAt BRD hospital, we have observed patients with AES. The mortality is about 20 percent due to multi-organ involvement. In the case of AES caused by scrub typhus, the mortality is about 15-17 percent compared with AES caused by JE. This is because treatment started early with azithromycin can treat AES caused by scrub typhus. Azithromycin is in the class of medicines as doxycycline but easy to administer in sick children as it is given intravenously.\n\n- What is vaccine coverage for Japanese encephalitis and why don't we see herd immunity with this vaccine?\nIn 2012, the vaccine coverage for Japanese encephalitis was only 50 percent but has improved to 75 percent now. A study we carried out in 2015 found 75 percent coverage for the 1st dose and only 42 percent for the 2nd dose. 3 of the 4 children aged 25-36 months in Gorakhpur region had received at least one dose of the vaccine. We need 2 doses of the vaccine -- during 9-12 months for the 1st dose and 16-24 months for the 2nd dose -- for optimal protection. With just one dose, the efficacy is over 80 percent. No studies have been done to find the duration of protection. With increasing vaccine coverage the incidence of JE has dropped from about 20 percent a few years ago to less than 10 percent now.\n\nIn the case of mosquito-borne diseases, herd immunity will not play a major role. So increasing the vaccine coverage should be a priority.\n\n[Byline: R Prasad]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As with cases of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh and other states in northeastern India, as noted in the report above, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The report above implicates scrub typhus as a major cause of AES. It is not clear why most of the AES cases are in children, but scrub typhus infections occur in people of all ages.\n\nScrub typhus in India has been receiving additional attention in recent years. a 2013 review article indicated that scrub typhus is seriously neglected and under-reported (http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.13-0064). ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past, especially since 2011. For background information, see ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (05): background 20111208.3546.\n\nThe report above indicates that JE vaccination campaigns have been active there this year (2017) but have not provided complete coverage. Other etiologies for AES, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), lychee fruit consumption, and agricultural-related toxicants have been proposed. The above report is another implicating scrub typhus as an important etiology of the AES cases. However, getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing. Prospective studies are required to confirm the degree of scrub typhus involvement in AES cases.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm.

ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states, especially since 2011 (3), so that it is not surprising that scrub typhus could account for many cases of acute encephalitis in other Indian states (4). However, I noted at the time in the moderator comments (2) that although headache is a common part of the symptom complex of scrub typhus, acute encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, with a history of altered sensorium, seizures or neck stiffness, and abnormal neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid findings, complicates a minority of scrub typhus cases (5-7).\n\nPlease also see prior ProMED-mail posts that have discussed the occurrence of acute encephalitis complicating scrub typhus (Acute encephalitis syndrome - India (03): (UP) comment 20151011.3707371 and Acute encephalitis syndrome - India (02): (UP) 20151008.3698951).\n\n1.

The state reported 482 cases of JE of which 67 resulted in death, as per the data.\n\nAccording to the additional director (health), Dr Pushkar Anand, 139 deaths that mostly included children have been reported from the paediatric ward of State-run Baba Raghav Das Medical College this year [2017] in UP; 6 cases of deaths were reported from [12-14 Aug 2017], he added.\n\nIn UP, the most severely affected districts are Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Basti, Siddharthanagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Deoria, and Mau.\n\nNVBDCP data reveals that in 2010, UP reported 3540 cases of AES, which claimed 494 lives. JE saw 325 cases being reported in that year, and 59 lives were lost. Similarly in 2011, 579 deaths in 3492 cases of AES were reported, while JE claimed 27 lives out of 224 cases.\n\nIn 2012, a year that saw a change of government in the state, 3484 cases of AES were reported and 557 patients died, while 139 cases of JE and 23 deaths were also reported. The AES death toll breached the 600 mark for the 1st time in 2013. 609 out of 3096 cases reported resulted in deaths. JE deaths too crossed the 40-figure-mark in the same year with 47 deaths reported in 281 cases.\n\nIn 2014, out of the 3329 AES cases reported, there were deaths, while for JE it was 34 deaths out of 191 cases. In 2015, as many as 479 lives were lost due to AES of which 2894 cases were reported. JE claimed 42 lives from the 351 reported cases, according to the official data.\n\nIn 2016, 3919 cases of AES were reported in which 621 lives were lost. The death toll due to JE stood at an all time high of 73 out of 410 cases reported.\n\nApart from UP, this year [2017], AES and JE deaths were reported from Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Odisha, and West Bengal. In Bihar, 29 AES deaths were reported from 66 cases reported, while 7 JE deaths were reported out of 19 cases. Manipur saw 6 AES and 6 JE deaths. As many as 690 AES cases were reported, while 141 JE cases were reported in the state.\n\nIn Odisha, 10 AES deaths out of 473 cases were reported. However no death due to JE took place in the state, although 13 cases were reported. In West Bengal, 81 AES deaths took place out of 826 cases reported this year, while 10 JE deaths were reported out of 37 cases reported.\n\nOverall, 5926 cases of AES have been reported in the country till [13 Aug 2017], of which 406 deaths have been reported.

At least 13 cases have been detected in the last 2 months in the block. In Ouguri revenue circle, 11 villages with a population of slightly more than 10 000, has accounted for almost all of them.\n\nAcute encephalitis syndrome is a condition of brain inflammation caused by both bacterial and viral infections [and possibly toxicants]. It is accompanied by fever, headaches, seizures, disorientation and vomiting in people, and if not treated quickly can result in death. The Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV] has been responsible for most cases of acute encephalitis syndrome in India and South Asia [in many instances, JEV infections have comprised a minor part of AES cases. - Mod.TY]\n\nThe outbreak in Jorhat is part of a larger outbreak in the state. As of [Mon 31 Jul 2017], 1404 people in Assam have been diagnosed with acute encephalitis syndrome in Assam this year [2017], 424 among them have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis. About 119 people have died of acute encephalitis syndrome of which 58 had Japanese encephalitis [virus] infections.\n\nIn fact, out of the 12 people who were detected to be infected by Japanese encephalitis in Bhogamukh, 11 had been vaccinated. And they are not the only ones. Almost 28 per cent of people in the state who have been infected by Japanese encephalitis had been vaccinated, said Dr Parashee Choudhury, senior medical and health officer at the state's Infectious Disease Surveillance Program. \"There is definitely a problem there too. We need more research to say what exactly is wrong.\"\n\nAssam is the only state where children in all its districts are being given the Japanese encephalitis vaccine as routine immunisation, which is part of India's universal immunisation program. The state began administering the vaccine to children for the 1st time in 2006 in Sibsagar district, and has since gradually expanded the coverage to other districts. According to state government data, almost 80 per cent of all children under 15 had been vaccinated as of December, 2016.\n\nIn 2014, Assam also became the 1st state to administer the Japanese encephalitis vaccine to adults. The adult vaccination programme has covered 18 districts as of now, according to state government data reviewed by Scroll.in. However, the exact number of people vaccinated has yet to be compiled.\n\nWhile there is consensus among doctors that the immunisation intervention has been crucial, most acknowledge that there are gaps in the vaccination system. Those who have received vaccinations should not succumb to infections. However, the government's own data over the years confirms that is not the case.\n\nDoctors in the region suspect that the cold chain to transport the vaccines to remote areas may have been compromised at some places. \"By the time, the vaccine reaches a remote village in Sibasagar and Jorhat, where there are practically no roads, it is possible that their efficacy decreases because it is difficult to maintain a cold chain for such a long time,\" said a government doctor who did not want to be identified.\n\nThe doctor added that the vaccine provided immunity only against Japanese encephalitis. She said: \"There are so many other viruses that can be responsible for acute encephalitis syndrome like the West Nile, but more often and then they don't even get detected and we never get to know what actually caused the symptoms.\"\n\nHowever, Assam's extensive vaccination drive, doctors and public health experts contend, has at least brought down the case fatality rate in patients suffering from Japanese encephalitis. The death toll from Japanese encephalitis, data suggests, has come down marginally since 2014.\n\nOuguri, which is part of the Bhogamukh administrative block, has been at the centre of an acute encephalitis syndrome outbreak. At least 13 cases have been detected in the last 2 months in the block. The Ouguri revenue circle, with 11 villages and a population of slightly more than 10 000, has accounted for almost all of them.\n\nAcute encephalitis syndrome is a condition of brain inflammation caused by both bacterial and viral infections [and possibly toxicants]. It is accompanied by fever, headaches, seizures, disorientation and vomiting in people, and if not treated quickly can result in death. The Japanese encephalitis virus has been responsible for most cases of acute encephalitis syndrome in India and South Asia.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for Japanese encephalitis, but given the high fatality rate, patients require hospitalisation, supportive care and treatment of symptoms by ensuring rest and administering fluids, pain relievers and medication to reduce fever.\n\nWhile immunisation interventions in the encephalitis endemic districts of Dibrugarh, Jorhat and Sibasagar have helped arrest the spread of the virus to a large extent, most doctors and health workers in the region admit there is a long way to go.\n\nThe adult vaccination program introduced in 2014, in particular, has suffered many setbacks because of widespread rumours that the Japanese encephalitis vaccine led to impotency. \"This is primarily because there is very little faith in the public health system\", said Suneel Kaul, a public health professional who operates out of rural lower Assam. \"In many tribal areas here, teams that come to administer the vaccine were almost lynched. Any immunisation drive has to be preceded by a lot of communication.\"\n\nThe failure is evident in areas where the outbreak has been severe. For example, the Baghchung administrative block in Jorhat district, has had 20 acute encephalitis syndrome cases, out of which 15 have been Japanese encephalitis. Five people with Japanese encephalitis and one person with acute encephalitis syndrome not caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus have died - all adults who had never been vaccinated.\n\nAreas like Sibasagar, Jorhat and Dibrugarh are vulnerable to Japanese encephalitis due to their geography. \"Just look around the area,\" said Baruah. \"There are all these wetlands, plus so many people breed pigs. And then there are egrets everywhere. The whole area is like a heaven for mosquitoes to breed. No vaccination drive can offset all of these factors.\" Pigs and wild water birds like egrets, which abound in upper Assam, are known to act as hosts to the culex mosquito - the vector that transmits the Japanese encephalitis virus to humans. But while, the animals and birds are hosts for the mosquitoes, stagnant water helps them breed.\n\nWith geographical peculiarities working against the local population, there is very little in terms of a 2nd line of defense when the vaccination fails to immunise people. Assam's health infrastructure in remote areas is almost non-existent. Disease surveillance can help pre-empt outbreaks but the state surveillance system [what does it consist of] is also not adequate, claim public health professionals. \"The entire surveillance system has been weak for a while now,\" said a person with an international health non-profit organisation that works closely with the Assam government. \"So, irrespective of vaccination programs, cases of JE will keep emerging from time to time.\"\n\nChoudhury of the Infectious Disease Surveillance Program countered claims of the encephalitis surveillance program being not sturdy enough, even as she admitted that the programme did not have enough manpower. \"Every district reports each case of JE to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme office in Guwahati,\" she explained. \"And if there is a new case in any area with no history, our people go there immediately, collect blood samples, and are always on alert.\"\n\nMeanwhile, community health workers have alleged that the government has been complacent about mosquito control measures because the outbreak in 2016 was less severe than the preceding years. In both Baghchung and Bhogamukh -- the most severely affected areas in Jorhat -- the government did not spray mosquito repellents. Such spraying or fogging is important in areas prone to mosquitoborne infections. \"Whatever [fogging] has happened has happened after people started dying,\" claimed a health worker. \"By then, the damage was already done. There seems to be a shortage of even DDT this year [2017].\" Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane or DDT is still used as to control mosquitoes in many parts of the country.\n\n[byline: Arunabh Saikia]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although there are many cases of acue encephalitis syndrome (AES) without an etiological diagnosis, clearly there are many cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) occurring in these areas in Assam state. The reason or reasons for the lack of protection from the vaccine is not clear. The type of vaccine, inactivated or live attenuated, is not stated. Certainly, difficulty in maintaining a cold chain could be an important factor, especially for a live vaccine. The duration of an inactivated vaccine is likely to be relatively short, and require annual boosters. The affected areas in Assam have all the conditions favorable fot JE virus transmission: ardeid birds (herons and their relatives) as reservoirs, pigs as amplifying hosts and wetlands suitable for breeding of culex vector mosquitoes. Vector control over wide-spread wetlands is very difficult and expensive. Use of insecticides over long periods of time is likely to result in resistant mosquito populations.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm.

Eating lychee on an empty stomach did not trigger encephalitis-like symptoms in hundreds of malnourished children in Muzaffarpur, Bihar in 2014, resulting in deaths. So, a January paper in Lancet Global Health (Association of acute toxic encephalopathy with litchi consumption in an outbreak in Muzaffarpur, India, 2014: A case-control study; http://goo.gl/2Z93Ha) [see Acute toxic encephalopathy - India: (BR) lychee fruit, 2014 20170202.4809638] that pointed to a naturally occurring toxin in the fruit as the prima facie cause for death has been proved wrong.\n\nNew research from Bangladesh, published in the July 2017 edition of The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (Outbreak of sudden death with acute encephalitis syndrome [AES] among children associated with exposure to lychee orchards in Northern Bangladesh, 2012; http://goo.gl/F9VRMC), has proved that it is not the fruit but a banned pesticide that is the actual culprit. It may appear as though the last word on the issue has been spoken. But that is not the case. [See cited reference below]\n\nIn fact, the latest scientific paper on the issue lays bare the very process of scientific progress. In a recent public talk, astrophysicist and science TV host Neil deGrasse Tyson told the audience that scientists can think up of a lot of stuff, even publish them in research journals. But much of it is 'wrong'. Modern science discovers 'truths' through a simple process -- float a hypothesis and wait for someone to confirm or prove it wrong. Falsification is the cornerstone of science through which truth emerges.\n\nTo understand the nature of the debate, let us first focus on the Lancet paper, published by an Indo-US team of scientists from the National Centre for Disease Control in India (NCDC) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USCDC). Acute neurological illness had been reported from Muzaffarpur, a region famous for its lychee crop, for more than 20 years.\n\nThe illness peaked during the lychee season among children of people closely connected to the cultivation of the fruit crop. In 2014, there were 122 deaths. Hypotheses, death from Japanese encephalitis virus to pesticides, have been floated.\n\nBefore the Lancet paper, the illness had a 'mystery' tag attached to it. Though immediately after its publication, a medical scientist from Vellore claimed that the central idea of linking a naturally occurring lychee toxin to encephalitis-like symptoms among the dead children from Muzaffarpur had already been published in the Indian journal, Current Science (Acute encephalitis syndrome in children in Muzaffarpur: Hypothesis, May 2014, http://goo.gl/Sb89JG). That 'plagiarism' [duplicate publication?] charge is yet to be settled.\n\nThe Lancet paper researchers claim that they had done an exhaustive 'PubMed' search on all published papers linking \"hypoglycin A or methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), naturally occurring fruit-based toxins [found in lychees] that cause hypoglycaemia and metabolic derangement\" with the unexplained neurological illness that killed Muzaffarpur's children.\n\nWhile the controversy raged, the Bangladesh researchers claimed this month [July 2017]: \"Eating lychees was not associated with illness in the case control study. The outbreak was linked to lychee orchard exposures where agrochemicals were routinely used, but not to consumption of lychees. Lack of acute specimens was a major limitation.\"\n\nThe difference in location notwithstanding, it appears that the authors of the paper are negating the Lancet findings -- or, those published in Current Science. If exposure to pesticides, such as the banned endosulfan, is indeed the cause of the deaths, then the Muzaffarpur case needs to be reopened.\n\nCan there be a case that both pesticides and MCPG are the cause of the deaths?

There is also a possibility that the killer in Bangladesh is not the same as that in Muzaffarpur. Or, that both hypotheses are wrong. As with cases of encephalitis in other states in north eastern India and Bangladesh, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. Other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed. The report below adds intoxication from exposure to agrochemicals as another possibility.

Outbreak of sudden death with acute encephalitis syndrome among children associated with exposure to lychee orchards in Northern Bangladesh, 2012. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2017; doi:10.4269/ajtmh.16-0856; available on line 24 Jul 2017\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\nRecurrent outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) among children in lychee growing areas in Asia highlight the need to better understand the etiology and the context. We conducted a mixed-methods study to identify risk factors for disease, and behaviors and practices around lychee cultivation in an AES outbreak community in northern Bangladesh in 2012. The outbreak affected 14 children; 13 died. The major symptoms included unconsciousness, convulsion, excessive sweating, and frothy discharge. The median time from illness onset to unconsciousness was 2.5 hours. The outbreak corresponded with lychee harvesting season. Multiple pesticides including some banned in Bangladesh were frequently used in the orchards. Visiting a lychee orchard within 24 hours before onset (age-adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 11.6 [1.02-109.8]) and 3 days (aOR = 7.2 [1.4-37.6]), and family members working in a lychee orchard (aOR = 7.2 [1.7-29.4]) and visiting any garden while pesticides were being applied (aOR = 4.9 [1.0-19.4]) in 3 days preceding illness onset were associated with illness in nearby village analysis. In neighborhood analysis, visiting an orchard that used pesticides (aOR = 8.4 [1.4-49.9]) within 3 days preceding illness onset was associated with illness. Eating lychees was not associated with illness in the case-control study. The outbreak was linked to lychee orchard exposures where agrochemicals were routinely used, but not to consumption of lychees. Lack of acute specimens was a major limitation. Future studies should target collection of environmental and food samples, acute specimens, and rigorous assessment of community use of pesticides to determine etiology.\n\nDiscussion\nThe clinical manifestations in case-patients including sudden onset without a prodromal phase, becoming unconscious within a median of 2.5 hours of illness onset, and the short duration between onset of illness to death all suggest that the outbreak was more likely due to a toxic poisoning than an infection. The outbreak was restricted to the lychee season and to a geographic area in which lychees are grown, which suggests that this outbreak of AES may be linked to exposure to lychees or lychee orchards.\n\nIn India, the leading hypothesis of AES etiology among children living near lychee orchards was the ingestion of phytotoxins, specifically methylenecyclopropylglycine that is present in lychee seeds and pulp, which can lead to hypoglycemia among malnourished children. Without acute biological specimens, and therefore, lack of measured blood glucose levels from children in this outbreak in Bangladesh, we were unable to investigate this hypothesis directly. However, our epidemiologic and clinical findings suggest that methylenecyclopropyl-glycine alone may not explain this AES outbreak among children. There are multiple lines of evidence that agrochemical poisoning may also have contributed.\n\nIn our study, the signs and symptoms are also consistent with acute pesticide poisoning in children reported in different countries of the world.\n\nThe outbreak ended following the onset of the monsoon rains, which suggest that the toxin associated with the lychees was on their surface, rather than contained in the fruit. In India, a similar pattern was observed, where the number of cases peaked in mid-June and declined immediately after the onset of monsoon rains. Moreover, the findings of washing fruits and vegetables protective against lychee-associated illness in India further supports our assertion that toxin associated with the lychees may be on the surface.\n\nFinally, in India, mortality decline among AES case-patients after rapid correction of hypoglycemia with intravenous dextrose. Although we were unable to measure blood glucose level among the case-patients, however, distribution of blood glucose meter among clinician may help identifying patients with hypoglycemia and rapid correction of hypoglycemia with intravenous glucose may reduce mortality in children in Bangladesh.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The authors indicate that studies based on hospital records and retrospective interviews have significant limitations in confirming the etiology of AES and establishing agrochemical intoxication as the causative factor. One hopes that this study will stimulate prospective studies of AES that will include laboratory supported toxicology confirming exposure to specific, identified agrochemicals, and the clinical details following exposure, including incidence of hypoglycemia, a frequently mentioned condition in AES cases in India.\n\nA report based on this publication was posted on 27 Jul 2017 [see Undiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh: (RP), pesticide identified, 2012 20170728.5212796]. However the original published report (above) provides additional detail. In the previous report, Mod.TG provided relevant toxicological information that follows. - Mod.TY\n\n\"Endosulfan, a commercial product of 2 isomers, is a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide. As such, it may be used as wood preservative, but is also a contact poison for many insects and mites. Therefore it has been used on food crops, such as vegetables, grains, fruits and teas to rid these crops of damaging pests.\n\n\"Endosulfan is a highly toxic substance whose toxicity is partly dependent upon how the pesticide is applied. The body absorption is rapid in the presence of alcohols, oils or other emulsifiers (on the skin or in the preparation), but otherwise is slowly and incompletely absorbed by the body.\n\n\"Generally endosulfan appears to affect the central nervous system. Acute symptoms include incoordination, agitation, convulsion and even loss of consciousness. Other symptoms include vomiting, and diarrhea. In cattle grazing fields sprayed with endosulfan blindness has been documented. Furthermore, these animals may recover when removed from the exposure and given time, perhaps of a month or more. Likewise sheep and pigs grazing on treated fields have been reported with incoordination and blindness.\n\n\"Chronic toxicities may affect kidneys, liver, blood chemistry, and the parathyroid gland. There may be other chronic effects such as reproductive effects, teratogenic, mutagenic and/or carcinogenic effects.\n\n\"While endosulfans can and do affect a number of body systems chronically, the case of the children in the fruit orchards is an acute case.\n\n\"It seems that despite the age of the original case, we at least have an answer regarding the poisoning of the children. - Mod.TG\"]\nSee Also\nUndiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh: (RP), pesticide identified, 2012 20170728.5212796\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20170717.5183403\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (BR) 20170713.5170870\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (AS) 20170710.5162050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (JH) susp. 20170705.5151252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (MH) 20170622.5124128\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (OR) 20170620.5119632\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (OR) 20170604.5082374\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (PB) 20170421.4984702\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20170402.4942606\nAcute toxic encephalopathy - India: (BR) lychee fruit, 2014 20170202.4809638\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (AS) 20170101.4733821\n.................................................ty/mj/sh", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5183403", "archive_id": 5183403, "date": "2017-07-17 19:03:44", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (10): (ASSAM)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 16 Jul 2017\nSource: The Assam Tribune [edited]\nhttp://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=jul1717/city057\n\n\nState Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma today [16 Jul 2017] reported that 131 Japanese encephalitis [JE] acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) related deaths have been reported in the state this year [2017] till Saturday [15 Jul 2017].\n\n\"Till yesterday [14 Jul 2017], 305 positive cases of JE have been reported, of which 44 have died.

Suspecting that the kid might have contracted Japanese encephalitis (JE) -- an infection that corrodes brain cells -- the doctors sent his blood samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), which confirmed their suspicion.\n\nThe diagnosis, a 1st in the city and 2nd in the state [this year, 2017], has got government officials on their toes. The state epidemiology cell and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) epidemiology cell have been keeping a close watch on the situation to ensure that it does not go out of control.\n\nInamdar Multispecialty Hospital in Kondhwa communicated the diagnosis to the civic officials after the 10-month-old infant's week-long struggle in the intensive care unit. After NIV's confirmation, the doctors conveyed results that showed severe inflammation of the brain caused by Japanese encephalitis virus that is transmitted by the bite of infected _Culex vishnui_ [group] mosquitoes. The baby is currently stable and out of danger. He has been shifted to the general ward.\n\nOfficials at the PMC's health department claim that the infant contracted the disease when he and his family were in Vile Parle, Mumbai, 2 weeks earlier.\n\nMukund Diggikar, joint director of malaria, filaria, water-borne and vector-borne diseases at the health department, said, \"Ever since the blood samples turned out to be positive, we have issued orders among officials to immediately survey the area. The need of the hour is to avoid further outbreaks.\"\n\nHe added that the district malaria officer along with the state epidemiology and PMC epidemiology cell have been asked to visit the areas along with insect collectors. \"We are on high alert as this is the 1st case of JE in Pune and 2nd in the state. The 1st case in the state was reported in Raigad,\" Diggikar said.\n\nPMC epidemiology cell chief, Dr Kalpana Baliwant, said that they quickly got into action after the orders. They visited Kondhwa for a survey and to eradicate _Culex vishnui_ breeding spots. However, they found none. \"We even checked houses and societies for breeding spots. This survey will continue for a couple of days,\" she said.\n\nWith the intensive survey in motion, Dr Vikram Padbidri, infectious disease expert at Jehangir Hospital, Pune told Pune Mirror of the measures one can take on a personal level to avoid JE, cases of which are diagnosed mostly during [the] monsoon.\n\n\"JE commonly affects children. Most of the cases tend to be asymptomatic. Some might suffer from mild symptoms like fever and headache. About 1 in 250 cases may land up with severe manifestations like high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures and paralysis which could ultimately result in death,\" he said.\n\nPadbidri added that JE can be prevented by simply avoiding mosquito bites, use of repellents, mosquito nets and eliminating breeding places of the mosquito. \"Nowadays JE vaccine is also available in the market,\" he said.\n\nIn 2015, 7 JE cases were diagnosed in the state. In the following year, the number spiked to 12.\n\n[Byline: Vicky Pathare]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There were 2 JE cases confirmed in the city in December 2016 (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (39): (MA) 20161223.4720235). Although avoidance of mosquito bites as recommended above is prudent, vaccination is the best protective measure. JE cases are relatively uncommon in this area, and in addition to a very young age, may account for the infant not having been vaccinated. The virus is endemic in north western India with birds as reservoir hosts and pigs as amplifiers. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. Vector control is difficult. - Mod.

It has affected 313 persons, mostly children, and claimed 10 lives in Odisha till the end of May this year [2017].\n\nWhile 3 deaths have been reported from Khurda district and 2 from Balasore, one each has died in Kendrapara, Jajpur, Nayagarh, Puri and Sambalpur.\n\nAs per the statistics available from the directorate of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), no deaths have been reported from Japanese encephalitis (JE); though 313 AES cases have been diagnosed so far, 2 have been found to be JE positive.\n\nOdisha is, in fact, the 4th state -- after Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam -- which has recorded the maximum number of deaths due to AES. Uttar Pradesh has registered the highest number, 56 deaths, followed by 49 in WB and 32 in Assam. Though Tamil Nadu has registered the highest at 401 cases, no deaths have been reported in the southern state this year [2017].\n\nJoint Director of Health Services (NVBDCP) Dr MM Pradhan said AES is a growing concern in the country, as it is a clinical neurologic manifestation caused by a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals and toxins.\n\n\"Management of AES including JE is essentially symptomatic. It is important to identify early warning signs and refer patients to health facilities for treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Health workers have been educated for 1st line management of such cases at the grassroots level,\" he said.\n\nThere are many AES-causing viruses for which neither vaccines nor medicines are available. In many cases, people affected with AES suffer from brain aspiration [meaning unclear - Mod.JH] and edema, which develop as a result of an inflammatory reaction in brain. It is difficult to survive if such cases are not treated early.\n\nThe Health Department has alerted people to remain cautious, as early detection and treatment are 2 possible methods to put a check on AES. \"Since there is no particular medicine for the disease, we are adopting symptomatic treatment. Awareness activities have also been increased and health workers deployed at the periphery to spread awareness,\" Dr Pradhan said.\n\nAfter the spurt in AES and JE cases last year [2016], 10 sentinel laboratories were set up in the state for immediate diagnosis of blood samples. These laboratories have been provided with JE kits supplied by the Pune-based National Institute of Virology.\n\nThe Health authorities have also planned to train all treating paediatric specialists to deal with encephalitis cases. They will be imparted training at AIIMS next month [June 2017].\n\nLast year [2016], out of 1096 AES cases, 115 persons died of AES, and 42 children died of JE. Most of the cases were reported from Malkangiri district. Along with Malkangiri, mass vaccination was carried out in Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar and Jajpur districts in campaign mode. The state government has written to the Centre for Vaccination in the rest of the 13 districts that have reported AES cases in the past.\n\n[Byline: Hemant Kumar Rout]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The JE virus transmission season is beginning in northeastern India.

Association of acute toxic encephalopathy with litchi consumption in an outbreak in Muzaffarpur, India, 2014: a case-control study.\n---------------------------------------------------\nSummary\nBackground\nOutbreaks of unexplained illness frequently remain under-investigated. In India, outbreaks of an acute neurological illness with high mortality among children occur annually in Muzaffarpur, the country's largest litchi cultivation region. In 2014, we aimed to investigate the cause and risk factors for this illness.\n\nMethods\nIn this hospital-based surveillance and nested age-matched case-control study, we did laboratory investigations to assess potential infectious and non-infectious causes of this acute neurological illness. Cases were children aged 15 years or younger who were admitted to 2 hospitals in Muzaffarpur with new-onset seizures or altered sensorium. Age-matched controls were residents of Muzaffarpur who were admitted to the same 2 hospitals for a non-neurologic illness within 7 days of the date of admission of the case. Clinical specimens (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine) and environmental specimens (litchis) were tested for evidence of infectious pathogens, pesticides, toxic metals, and other non-infectious causes, including presence of hypoglycin A or methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), naturally-occurring fruit-based toxins that cause hypoglycaemia and metabolic derangement. Matched and unmatched (controlling for age) bivariate analyses were done and risk factors for illness were expressed as matched odds ratios and odds ratios (unmatched analyses).\n\nFindings\nBetween 26 May-17 Jul 2014, 390 patients meeting the case definition were admitted to the 2 referral hospitals in Muzaffarpur, of whom 122 (31 percent) died. On admission, 204 (62 percent) of 327 had blood glucose concentration of 70 mg/dL or less. 104 cases were compared with 104 age-matched hospital controls. Litchi consumption (matched odds ratio [mOR] 9.6 [95 percent CI 3.6 - 24]) and absence of an evening meal (2.2 [1.2-4.3]) in the 24 [hours] preceding illness onset were associated with illness. The absence of an evening meal significantly modified the effect of eating litchis on illness (odds ratio [OR] 7.8 [95 percent CI 3.3-18.8], without evening meal; OR 3.6 [1.1-11.1] with an evening meal). Tests for infectious agents and pesticides were negative. Metabolites of hypoglycin A, MCPG, or both were detected in 48 [66 percent] of 73 urine specimens from case-patients and none from 15 controls; 72 (90 percent) of 80 case-patient specimens had abnormal plasma acylcarnitine profiles, consistent with severe disruption of fatty acid metabolism. In 36 litchi arils tested from Muzaffarpur, hypoglycin A concentrations ranged from 12.4 ug/g to 152.0 ug/g and MCPG ranged from 44.9 ug/g to 220.0 ug/g.\n\nInterpretation\nOur investigation suggests an outbreak of acute encephalopathy in Muzaffarpur associated with both hypoglycin A and MCPG toxicity. To prevent illness and reduce mortality in the region, we recommended minimising litchi consumption, ensuring receipt of an evening meal and implementing rapid glucose correction for suspected illness. A comprehensive investigative approach in Muzaffarpur led to timely public health recommendations, underscoring the importance of using systematic methods in other unexplained illness outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[At last, we have a convincing diagnosis, lychee fruit intoxication, for some of the previously undiagnosed cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) not attributed to Japanese encephalitis (JE). Cases of JE, as well as the undetermined AES, occur in Behar and northeastern India every year, mainly from March-August.\n\nAES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. As mentioned in many previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus ( _O. tsutsugamushi_) and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed. One hopes that the information in the above report will be widely disseminated among health care professionals so that timely diagnosis and effective treatment can be provided and many children's lives saved.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299, and a district map of Bihar can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/bihar/bihar-district.htm. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (AS) 20170101.4733821\n2016\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (40): (TN) 20161230.4731796\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (39): (MA) 20161223.4720235\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (38): (OR) 20161218.4706272\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (37): (OR) 20161211.4690188\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (36): (AS) 20161207.4681756\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (35): (OR) 20161202.4672510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (34): (OR) 20161130.4663950\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (33): (OR) 20161119.4641400\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (32): (OR) 20161112.4623814\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (31): (OR) 20161111.4621162\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (30): (OR,TR) 20161107.4611260\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (29): (OR) 20161103.4603728\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (28): (OR), human, porcine 20161029.4594738\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (27): (OR) 20161026.4585027\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (26): (OR) RFI 20161024.4579882\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (OR) 20161020.4572206\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (OR,UP) 20161014.4558708\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (OR) 20161007.4544425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (OR) 20161006.4539552\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (OR) 20161005.4537043\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (OR) 20161003.4533613\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (OR) 20160929.4525723\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (OR) 20160927.4517725\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (JH) confirmation 20160926.4516189\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16) 20160926.4514686\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (JH), RFI 20160921.4503861\nJapanese encephalitis (02): India, Nepal 20160905.4467223\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (TR) 20160903.4462527\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (12): (BR,UP) 20160902.4459866\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (UP) 20160824.4438801\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20160820.4430470\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (09): (AS) 20160803.4390885\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (MN) 20160801.4383765\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN, OR) 20160725.4368952\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (JH) susp 20160721.4361308\nJapanese encephalitis: Philippines (DR), Viet Nam, India (KL,BR) 20160716.4350209\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) fatal 20160627.4312442\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (04): (AS) 20160618.4295497\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20160614.4287590\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (AS) 20160613.4283791\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (UP) 20160103.3908735\n.................................................ty/msp/jh", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4733821", "archive_id": 4733821, "date": "2017-01-01 11:40:44", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (AS)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (01): (ASSAM)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 29 Dec 2016\nSource: Scroll [edited]\nhttps://scroll.in/pulse/825471/lab-notes-the-scrub-typhus-bacterium-may-be-causing-in-many-of-assams-encephalitis-deaths\n\n\nThe scrub typhus bacterium may be causing in many of Assam's encephalitis deaths\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis source of the disease has been ignored because of the high prevalence of the Japanese encephalitis virus.\n\nThe bacterium that causes the mite-borne disease scrub typhus could be responsible for a large number of cases of the often fatal acute encephalitis syndrome or AES in Assam, according to a new study from the north east Regional Medical Research Centre in Dibrugarh, a branch of the Indian Council of Medical Research.\n\nScrub typhus is a disease characterised by fever, headache, muscle pain, cough and gastrointestinal disruptions. More acute attacks involve haemorraging, rashes, pneumonitis and encephalitis among other symptoms. Scrub typhus is caused by the bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ which is picked up from scrub-like vegetation.\n\nAssam is an endemic zone for AES, especially that caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus of which there has been a severe outbreak this year in Odisha's Malkangiri district. However, more than 50 percent of AES cases in Assam are not due to the Japanese encephalitis virus and the causes remain unrecognised.\n\nIn the new study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, researchers enrolled 511 AES patients, of whom 104 showed signs of recent infection with the bacterium _O. tsutsugamushi_. These 104 patients showed symptoms of fever, inability to think clearly or concentrate, headache, unconsciousness, and nausea.\n\nOnly 13 patients showed signs of infection from the Japanese encephalitis virus. The research team followed up with 53 of the 104 patients and discovered that 26 died after discharge, including 4 of 9 patients in whom the _Orientia_ DNA was detected.\n\nThe study attributes the high rates of illness and death from scrub typhus to the fact that because the Japanese encephalitis virus is the predominant agent of AES in the north east, health providers generally look for other sources of the disease. Furthermore, the nonspecific symptoms of scrub typhus makes it difficult to diagnose accurately. The study records the highest numbers of scrub typhus cases in July through to September, the peak season for Japanese encephalitis transmission.\n\nThe researchers recommend recording occupation details and ecologic background of patients from those in rural areas as an important source for identifying those with scrub typhus, as well as increasing awareness among clinicians for prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Assam state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus and cases occur there every year. As with cases of encephalitis in other states in north eastern India, not all cases are due to JE virus and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. A variety of etiological agents have been proposed as causal for AES. Now we have another agent -- _O. tsutsugamushi_ -- as a cause of AES in Assam state. One hopes that future cases of non-JE will be tested for this pathogen.\n\nReference\nKhan SA, Bora T, Laskar B, Khan AM, Dutta P. Scrub Typhus Leading to Acute Encephalitis Syndrome, Assam, India.

The entire data for this year [2016] is not available, but the number of cases collected from different districts so far is 36.\n\n\"What is more worrying is the number of people with acute encephalitis syndrome being tested positive for JE, despite the massive vaccination programme,\" pointed out a senior public health official refusing to be named.\n\nAcute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a group of neurological diseases caused by a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, chemicals and toxins. Those tested for AES are also tested for JE. In 2010, 2.3 percent of people with AES tested positive for JE; in 2016, it is 6 percent, he said.\n\nThe number is worrying because the disease, which causes mental disturbances, paralysis, seizures, coma and death, can be prevented by vaccines. JE occurs across many countries in Asia, where about 68 000 cases are reported annually, according to the World Health Organization, though the number of cases is thought to be vastly underreported. In India, the virus is concentrated in Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.\n\nThere is no cure, and health officials can only try easing the symptoms, providing drugs to treat fevers and convulsions or inserting feeding tubes when children become unconscious. In 2013, the Union health ministry launched a mass vaccination drive in select districts of the 5 states. In Tamil Nadu, 13 districts, including Tiruvallur, Tiruvannamalai, Trichy, Madurai and Virudhunagar, were chosen. While all children between 9 months and 15 years get the vaccine at the launch, follow-up vaccines are given to those under 2 years. \"The vaccination programme is working well,\" said state director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy. \"We have been reporting an increase only because our quality of surveillance is better than many other states. We are aware of the increasing numbers. In a large state like ours, it is not unusual. What is important is that the state and several other agencies are continuously monitoring it,\" he said.\n\nIn high-prevalence districts, health officials test people with symptoms. \"The mosquitoes are ground and tested for viral content. Besides JE, we are working on controlling other encephalitic and waterborne diseases such as hepatitis,\" he said.\n\nBut doctors, particularly paediatricians, say it is important to ensure that every case of AES is notified. \"We see a lot of AES cases, but many aren't sent for testing for JE because it is not treatable,\" said Dr S Balasubramanian, head of the department of paediatrics at Kanchi Kamakoti Childs Trust Hospital. \"It is not mandatory to report this, but it is certainly underreported. If we make reporting of this disease mandatory, we will be able to increase surveillance.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is important that as many cases of AES as possible are tested for JE. Even though the percent attributable to JE virus infection may be low, knowing when and where these cases occur provides guidance for JE vaccination campaigns. JE virus vector mosquito control is difficult and likely to be ineffective, making vaccination the best measure to prevent cases. As the above report indicates, determining the etiological agents responsible for AES is challenging because so many agents have been implicated. However, until those agents are identified, prevention and appropriate AES treatment will be difficult.\n\nMaps of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170. - Mod.TY\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/319.]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (39): (MA) 20161223.4720235\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (38): (OR) 20161218.4706272\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (37): (OR) 20161211.4690188\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (36): (AS) 20161207.4681756\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (35): (OR) 20161202.4672510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (34): (OR) 20161130.4663950\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (33): (OR) 20161119.4641400\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (32): (OR) 20161112.4623814\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (31): (OR) 20161111.4621162\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (30): (OR,TR) 20161107.4611260\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (29): (OR) 20161103.4603728\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (28): (OR), human, porcine 20161029.4594738\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (27): (OR) 20161026.4585027\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (26): (OR) RFI 20161024.4579882\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (OR) 20161020.4572206\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (OR,UP) 20161014.4558708\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (OR) 20161007.4544425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (OR) 20161006.4539552\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (OR) 20161005.4537043\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (OR) 20161003.4533613\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (OR) 20160929.4525723\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (OR) 20160927.4517725\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (JH) confirmation 20160926.4516189\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16) 20160926.4514686\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (JH), RFI 20160921.4503861\nJapanese encephalitis (02): India, Nepal 20160905.4467223\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (TR) 20160903.4462527\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (12): (BR,UP) 20160902.4459866\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (UP) 20160824.4438801\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20160820.4430470\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (09): (AS) 20160803.4390885\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (MN) 20160801.4383765\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN, OR) 20160725.4368952\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (JH) susp 20160721.4361308\nJapanese encephalitis: Philippines (DR), Viet Nam, India (KL,BR) 20160716.4350209\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) fatal 20160627.4312442\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (04): (AS) 20160618.4295497\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20160614.4287590\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (AS) 20160613.4283791\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (UP) 20160103.3908735\n.................................................ty/msp/lm", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4720235", "archive_id": 4720235, "date": "2016-12-23 15:39:31", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (39): (MA)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (39): (MAHARASHTRA)\n***********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 23 Dec 2016\nSource: Times of India [edited]\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Another-student-diagnosed-with-Japanese-encephalitis/articleshow/56128522.cms\n\n\nAnother case of Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne viral disease, has emerged in the city [Pune], just weeks after health authorities confirmed the 1st case of the infection. A 21-year-old student from Hadapsar tested positive for the disease at the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) on 12 Dec [2016].\n\nThe 2 cases within days have put health authorities on their toes, leading them to increase surveillance in the patients' neighborhoods. TOI [Times of India] reported the 1st case of JE [Japanese encephalitis] in the city on 10 Dec [2016] after an 18-year-old agriculture science student in the city, originally from Satara, was diagnosed with the infection at NIV on 30 Nov [2016]. His condition was initially critical, and he is currently undergoing treatment at Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital (DMH).\n\nThis is the 1st time in Pune and western Maharashtra that cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been detected, as the disease is usually seen in the state's eastern districts.\n\nExperts say the spread of the disease is a cause for concern as it indicates the virus is circulating in a wider geographical area.\n\n\"The infected person is a student who stays in Kalepadal in Hadapsar. His blood sample, sent to NIV, tested positive for JE on 12 Dec [2016],\" a doctor from Sassoon hospital, where the patient underwent treatment, said.\n\n\"We have directed health officials to conduct entomological surveillance in the areas where both the patients stayed to curb the spread of the vector. Besides, we have also directed health officials to conduct fever surveillance in these areas and send blood samples of suspected patients to NIV for testing,\" joint director (vector-borne diseases) of the state health department Kanchan Jagtap said.\n\nWhen contacted, state surveillance officer Pradeep Awate of the state health department said: \"Such cases were never seen in Pune earlier. Barring a lone outbreak recorded in Sangli district's village Budhgaon in 1999, the JE virus was never reported in western Maharashtra.\" Awate added that it was important to find out the epidemiological linkage of both the Japanese encephalitis cases recorded in the city. \"An entomological study is warranted to see if the virus has undergone any change in its genetic makeup or if there is any change in the vector mosquito itself,\" Awate said.\n\nThe _Culex_ type of mosquito, which feeds on animal blood, especially pigs, is the main vector [amplifying host] of the disease in Maharashtra. \"Prevention and containment are key, as there is no specific drug, and treatment of JE is symptomatic. People should keep their surroundings clean. Besides, those living in proximity of animals or piggeries should take extra precautions. Larvicides must be used periodically in ponds with vegetation as they provide a conducive atmosphere for the vector to breed and propagate. Regular cutting of water hyacinth is also very important,\" Awate said.\n\nA health official from the Pune Municipal Corporation said the civic body has taken up fogging as well as spraying of insecticide and larvicide around the patients' neighborhoods. \"We are also cutting hyacinth regularly,\" the official added.\n\n[Byline: Umesh Isalkar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Detection of JE cases in a new locality, such as Pune, raises epidemiologically important questions. Pigs may certainly serve as amplifying hosts, but the reservoir species are avian species, including ardeid birds (such as herons and egrets), which may have been the species responsible for movement of the virus into the area. The current situation in Pune presents an opportunity to take a \"one health\" approach and examine whether subclinical human cases are occurring and determine the role of both birds and pigs in transmission, maintenance, and movement of the virus in the area. Meanwhile, mosquito vector control efforts are prudent, and vector surveillance over several weeks will be necessary to quantify the effectiveness of the measures applied.\n\nMaps of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (38): (OR) 20161218.4706272\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (37): (OR) 20161211.4690188\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (36): (AS) 20161207.4681756\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (35): (OR) 20161202.4672510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (34): (OR) 20161130.4663950\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (33): (OR) 20161119.4641400\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (32): (OR) 20161112.4623814\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (31): (OR) 20161111.4621162\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (30): (OR,TR) 20161107.4611260\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (29): (OR) 20161103.4603728\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (28): (OR), human, porcine 20161029.4594738\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (27): (OR) 20161026.4585027\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (26): (OR) RFI 20161024.4579882\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (OR) 20161020.4572206\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (OR,UP) 20161014.4558708\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (OR) 20161007.4544425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (OR) 20161006.4539552\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (OR) 20161005.4537043\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (OR) 20161003.4533613\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (OR) 20160929.4525723\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (OR) 20160927.4517725\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN, OR) 20160725.4368952\n.................................................sb/mpp/ty/ec/msp/mpp", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4706272", "archive_id": 4706272, "date": "2016-12-18 11:58:28", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (38): (OR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (38): (ODISHA)\n******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 16 Dec 2016\nSource: The Times of India [edited]\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/japanese-encephalitis-vaccination-time-period-extended-in-malkangiri/articleshow/56011761.cms\n\n\nThe Malkangiri district administration extended the programme of vaccinating children in the age group of 1-15 against Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus till 24 Dec [2016].\n\nEarlier, the administration had declared to continue the special vaccination programme, which was launched on 5 Dec-15 Dec [2015].\n\nAs many as 18 027 children aged between 1-15 have been identified for vaccination from across the district during the 3-day door-to-door survey conducted by the administration from 21 Nov [2016].\n\nTill 14 Dec [2016], around 90 percent of the children were vaccinated against JE.

Anthraquinone, a toxin found in _Cassia occidentalis_ was also alleged to be cause of encephalopathy and deaths among children.\n\nTo prevent deaths of children, the administration had decided to transport any child suffering from encephalitis syndrome to the district hospital as early as possible. For the 1st time in the last 3 months, no new patient with such syndrome has been admitted in the district hospital. \"It is surely a spark of hope for all in the district including government officials, physicians, health workers, teachers, anganwadi [government sponsored child-care and mother-care centers] workers, ASHA [foundation] volunteers, panchayat bodies [system of local governance], social workers, and even security personnel, who have worked relentless since September [2016] to check encephalitis deaths of innocent children in the district,\" said Malkangiri collector K Sudarshan Chakravarthy.\n\nAs per the office of Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO), Malkangiri, the 15-day-long mass vaccination of children is continuing successfully in the district since [5 Dec 2016]. Initially, children of all major schools in the district are being vaccinated.\n\nIn the next phase, all other children would be vaccinated through grassroot level community approach. A total of 218 027 children are to be vaccinated against JE in the district.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[An 8 Dec 2016 report stated that about 84 percent of children had already been vaccinated by [Wed 7 Dec 2016], with 175 vaccination centres currently functioning in the district. Until now, the total deaths due to JE, acute encephalitis syndrome, and encephalopathy reached 103, which is below that of the most afflicted states like Uttar Pradesh with the highest (538 cases), West Bengal (229), and Assam (183). Confirmed reports said that JE alone accounted for 37 deaths (http://pragativadi.com/je-outbreak-control-govt/).\n\nThe absence of new cases is good news indeed. It is also good to learn that the childhood JE vaccination program has begun and will continue. An earlier report also indicated that the local populace is being advised to avoid consumption of _Cassia occidentalis_ seeds by children, although some local health officials doubted that the seeds were responsible for the acute encephalitis syndrome (non-JE but without specific diagnosis).

Uttar Pradesh recorded the 2nd highest number with 68 JE deaths, followed by Odisha with 39 JE deaths.\n\nFrom 1 Jan-27 Nov [2016], as many as 183 persons died of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), while 85 persons succumbed to Japanese encephalitis (JE) -- as per the table drawn up by the directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) under NHM. Further, during this period, total 416 JE cases and 1668 AES cases were confirmed in the State.\n\nOverall, in the last 6 years, Assam stood 2nd only to Uttar Pradesh in the total numbers of JE and AES cases recorded.\n\nIn 2010, Assam recorded 142 JE cases with 40 deaths, and 469 AES cases with 117 deaths. In 2011, there were 1319 AES and 489 JE cases in the State, with 250 dying of AES and 113 of JE.\n\nIn 2012, the numbers rose to 1343 AES with 229 deaths, and 463 JE cases with 100 deaths in the State. In 2013, there were 1,338 AES cases with 272 deaths, and 495 JE cases with 134 deaths.\n\nIn 2014, Assam recorded 2194 AES cases with 360 deaths, and 761 cases with 165 deaths. The next year in 2015, there were 1409 AES cases with 260 deaths recorded in Assam, along with 641 JE cases with 135 deaths.\n\nSources have pointed out that despite the Centre pumping huge amounts of funds into Assam to keep vector-borne diseases at bay, such diseases are far from being controlled.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of fatalities in Assam have increased from 66 as of 2 Aug 2016, to 78 fatal cases as of 18 Aug 2016, to the 85 fatal cases to date. As mentioned in previous posts, Assam is probably concluding its usual JE virus transmission season currently. JE virus is endemic in northeastern India and more cases can be expected next year (2017). It seems odd that no mention is made of JE vaccination either in the recent past or plans for a campaign in Assam.\n\nThe encephalitis situation in northeastern India has been confusing for many years. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. Recent reports from Odisha indicate that only 1/3 of the reported encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections. The remaining 2/3 have been classified as AES with no specific etiology. At last, AES is being addressed there, but no mention is made of similar investigations into the etiologies associated with AES in the above report. The cause of AES has been speculative with other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, having been proposed. Possible etiologies of AES are discussed in a previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20161111.4621162). The team investigating the outbreak in Odisha has come up with a reliable diagnoses for at least 5 of the dead children as due to consumption of the seeds of _Cassia occidentalis_ (known commonly as coffee senna, negro coffee, rubbish cassia, stinking weed), with folk medicine uses of leaves and roots (see http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S025462990500044X). Until the specific etiologies of AES are determined, measures to prevent additional cases and to optimise treatment for those affected will not be possible.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (35): (OR) 20161202.4672510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (34): (OR) 20161130.4663950\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (33): (OR) 20161119.4641400\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (32): (OR) 20161112.4623814\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (31): (OR) 20161111.4621162\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (30): (OR,TR) 20161107.4611260\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (29): (OR) 20161103.4603728\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (28): (OR), human, porcine 20161029.4594738\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (27): (OR) 20161026.4585027\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (26): (OR) RFI 20161024.4579882\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (OR) 20161020.4572206\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (OR,UP) 20161014.4558708\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (OR) 20161007.4544425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (OR) 20161006.4539552\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (OR) 20161005.4537043\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (OR) 20161003.4533613\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (OR) 20160929.4525723\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (OR) 20160927.4517725\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN, OR) 20160725.4368952\n.................................................ty/mj/ml", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4672510", "archive_id": 4672510, "date": "2016-12-02 17:50:48", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (35): (OR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (35): (ODISHA)\n******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 1 Dec 2016\nSource: Firstpost [edited]\nhttp://www.firstpost.com/india/102-deaths-in-two-months-what-mystery-disease-is-preying-on-children-of-odishas-malkangiri-3134526.html\n\n\nDistrict magistrate K Sudarshan Chakrabarty had the ailing child under medical care soon enough. It has become a part of his administration's daily battle against the unknown disease, that is now spreading among the tribals.\n\n\"The district administration is dealing with the abrupt rise in child death cases in the tribal villages of Malkangiri [district, Odisha state] for the last 3 months. Despite the administration's efforts, however, fear still persists among the people,\" says R Srinivasan Rao, a social activist from the region. \"The 1st child death was reported on 9 Sep [2016]. Though only 102 deaths have been reported till now, the actual toll could be higher,\" said Debabrat Sana, a journalist from the region.\n\nIf there is a mismatch between the official government figures and actual deaths in the region, it's because several tribals rely on traditional medicine to meet with their health requirements, said Rao. \"Most of the people in the village don't go to hospitals. Rather, they visit the local ojhas who purportedly treat them with mantras. Deaths occurring during such treatment are seldom reported,\" he said.\n\nDr Kalyan Kumar Sarkar, additional district medical officer, added that several patients are being admitted with symptoms similar to Japanese encephalitis. \"Among patients admitted to the hospital, 36 were found to be Japanese encephalitis positive,\" Sarkar said. \"But strangely, even patients who were not Japanese encephalitis positive were showing similar symptoms. The cause of their ailments was not found,\" the doctor added.\n\nThese patients who are suffering symptoms similar to Japanese encephalitis are said to be ailing from the \"acute encephalitis syndrome\". Malkangiri has become the hotspot for acute encephalitis syndrome as well. \"Scientists from across the country and abroad as well visited the district to enquire into the new health condition,\" Sana said.\n\nBut a team of scientists, led by Dr E Jacob James [sic; Dr E Jacob John] from a hospital in Tamil Nadu, came up with a novel interpretation of the riddle that said a seed that Malkangiri villagers pluck from the wilderness and eat might have caused the unexplained symptoms. \"The seed is known as Chakunda among the people here, and is found to have toxic properties. Eating this may result in Japanese encephalitis-like symptoms and also cause abrupt glucose deficiency, which could be fatal,\" Sarkar said.\n\nBut very few villagers believe in this interpretation, instead saying that Chakunda seeds have been a part of the food habit of local tribes for a very long time and nobody ever discovered it to be lethal. \"Chakunda seeds are used as pulses by the tribes here for a long time and are known to have medicinal properties. How can it be toxic all of a sudden?\" Rao asked.\n\nRao said this explanation is only meant to cover up the government's failure in providing health facilities to the poor tribals of the district. \"If Chakunda seeds are indeed causing these deaths, then why are only malnourished tribal children dying?\" he asked, adding that it's actually a \"classic case of the government's neglect of Odisha's tribals\".\n\nEven Sana, himself a resident of the district, admitted that he'd never heard of people dying because they ate Chakunda seeds.\n\nBut Sarkar has a possible answer. \"Chakunda seeds grow in the wilderness after September every year and people eat it. Deaths have been happening this time of the year for a long time. But this is the 1st time cause of these deaths have been ascertained,\" he said.\n\nDalit Camera, a website that provides data about issues affecting villagers, said 7493 children have died in the area since the year 2012, including 128 in the last 2 months. But locals take this figure with a pinch of salt.\n\nWhatever be the interpretations of the spate of child deaths rocking this remote village in Odisha, fact remains that the district administration has taken a 2-pronged approach to face this challenge. \"Since Japanese encephalitis [JE] has also been detected in a number of patients, we are trying our best to create awareness among the people to prevent spreading of this virus. Apart from that, other interventions have also been initiated. In the 2nd approach, for instance, we have publicised the ills of Chakunda seeds, and warned people against ingesting them,\" Sarkar said.\n\nMoreover, there are many who refuse to have their children admitted to hospitals given a mistrust of medicine and also considering the many number of deaths that have taken place. However, for some who survived because of timely medical intervention, medicine can also be a boon.\n\n[Byline: Kangkan Acharyya]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although there are conflicting fatal case counts in the above report, 102 versus 128, the numbers of deaths among children in this area continue to climb. Vaccination against JE will be more effective at prevention of that disease than cautioning local residents to avoid spreading the virus. The virus is maintained in wild birds, amplified in pigs and transmitted by mosquitoes. A previous post indicated that a vaccination campaign is being planned. Controversy continues over the role of Chakunda seeds as a cause of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). A team of experts led by Dr. E. Jacob John found the toxicant anthraquinone in the urine of all 5 AES patients tested. Anthraquinone is present in Chakunda seeds. Additionally, these AES patients suffered from liver and muscle damage, an effect compatible with anthraquinone intoxication. The district administration is prudent to advise local people, especially children, to avoid eating the seeds. The previous report indicated that the affected children were malnourished and that may have contributed to the toxic effects. Avoidance of consumption of the seeds may be difficult if there is a food shortage in the area and seed consumption does not appear to have an adverse effect on adults.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of the affected area can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (34): (OR) 20161130.4663950\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (33): (OR) 20161119.4641400\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (32): (OR) 20161112.4623814\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (31): (OR) 20161111.4621162\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (30): (OR,TR) 20161107.4611260\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (29): (OR) 20161103.4603728\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (28): (OR), human, porcine 20161029.4594738\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (27): (OR) 20161026.4585027\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (26): (OR) RFI 20161024.4579882\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (OR) 20161020.4572206\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (OR,UP) 20161014.4558708\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (OR) 20161007.4544425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (OR) 20161006.4539552\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (OR) 20161005.4537043\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (OR) 20161003.4533613\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (OR) 20160929.4525723\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (OR) 20160927.4517725\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN, OR) 20160725.4368952\n.................................................sb/dk/ty/je/dk", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4663950", "archive_id": 4663950, "date": "2016-11-30 05:47:19", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (34): (OR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (34): (ODISHA)\n******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this posting:\n[1] Case count\n[2] Other etiology\n\n******\n[1] Case count\nDate: Sat 26 Nov 2016\nSource: Odisha News Insight [edited]\nhttp://www.odishanewsinsight.com/odisha/japanese-encephalitis-claims-119-lives-malkangiri-dist/\n\n\nThe death toll due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Malkangiri district [Odisha] climbed to 119 on Saturday morning [26 Nov 2016].

Based on the clinical symptoms of high fever and seizures, doctors suspected the children had died of acute encephalitis syndrome, or brain inflammation, caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus. Acute encephalitis syndrome is a group of conditions that affect the brain and can be triggered by a range of agents including bacterial and viral infections.\n\nOf the 97 children, the blood samples of 77 were tested in a laboratory in the state capital Bhubaneswar. Antibodies to the Japanese encephalitis virus were found in the blood samples of 33 children.\n\nWhat about the other children who died? What had caused their deaths?\n\nA team of researchers appointed by the state government to investigate these deaths believes they may have resulted from the consumption of anthroquinone, a toxin found in the bean-like seeds of a wild plant called bada chakunda [_Senna hirsuta_, wooly wild sensitive plant]. At a press conference held by the Odisha health department in Bhubaneswar on [18 Nov 2016] the head of the team, Dr T Jacob John, emeritus professor of Christian Medical College, Vellore, explained how they had arrived at the findings.\n\nThe team observed that some of the children who had survived the bout of brain inflammation did not show signs of neurological impairment, which is common among those infected with the Japanese encephalitis virus. John also noticed the presence of the bada chakunda plant in the area. In 2005, while investigating an outbreak of acute encephalitis syndrome that killed 175 children in Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh, John had isolated the toxin in the seeds of the plant. The toxin, anthroquinone, acts as a biochemical agent and causes hepatomyoencephalopathy, a medical condition where the brain is damaged [According to WHO, hepatomyoencephalopathy is one of many conditions that fall under the broader term of acute encephalitis syndrome. It also results in damage of liver and muscle cells.].\n\nIn Malkangiri, John's team took urine samples of 5 children whose blood samples did not show the presence of antibodies against Japanese encephalitis virus. The urine samples were sent to Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research in Lucknow. In all 5 cases, the samples showed the presence of the anthroquinone compound. A battery of investigations had already confirmed liver and muscle damage in the 5 children, who later succumbed to the disease.\n\nFor John, this was enough to confirm his hypothesis that the toxin in the bada chakunda plant was responsible for the deaths of the children who had not tested positive for Japanese encephalitis. In his view, the district was seeing not one but \"2 diseases occurring as outbreaks.\"\n\nRushed findings?\nSome government doctors in Odisha and public health experts, however, are sceptical of the findings.\n\nThey point out that the team has linked the deaths to toxin consumption on the basis of just 5 samples. In 2012, the Regional Medical Research Centre in Bhubaneshwar had identified Japanese encephalitis virus in the blood samples of 11 children who had died from brain inflammation. Its report was labelled \"inconclusive\" by officials at the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program...\n\nDr Veena Shatrugna, former deputy director, National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, said presence of the toxin in urine samples does not establish anything. \"If they had looked for pesticides or any other toxin in the urine sample, they might have also found that,\" she said.\n\nDr Mukul Das who conducted the tests at the Lucknow laboratory admitted that blood or serum is a better sample to look for the toxin, but he defended the results. \"These children were so lean and thin, it was extremely difficult to draw a blood sample from them,\" he said. The test which routinely takes 3 weeks was completed in just 4-5 days in the laboratory. \"We usually take longer to run these tests but this was an emergency situation so we conducted the tests faster,\" he said.\n\nA senior doctor working to control the Malkangiri outbreak said 3 other teams had visited the district but none had investigated the dietary habits of the Adivasi community that has accounted for the bulk of the deaths. John's team \"has applied its findings from Saharanpur to Malkangiri because the same plant is found in both places,\" he said. \"I am not an expert in plants but there are geographical variations and inferring that the toxin killed the children just on the mere presence of the toxin in the urine sample is not good science.\"\n\nThe criticism of the report isn't limited to its findings. Public health experts have questioned the manner in which it was released by the Odisha health department. \"It is an incomplete report and therefore irresponsible that it was released to the press,\" said Dr Veena Shatrugna.\n\nLocal activists working with the government to control the outbreak in Malkangiri were also wary of the report. They claimed it was \"a diversionary tactic of the government\", arguing, as Scroll.in has reported, that the district failed to put in place measures which could have prevented the spread of mosquitoes that transmit the Japanese encephalitis virus [and that there were delays] over the introduction of a vaccine that could have protected children from the Japanese encephalitis. The report linking the deaths to the plant toxin shifts the focus [of responsibility] to the dietary and living habits of the Adivasis, said activists. \"It is as simple as saying that it is a stupid community feeding poisonous seed to its own children,\" said Dr Sylvia Karpagam, a public health specialist from Bangalore.\n\n\"This was useful public health information and we are not supposed to hide it,\" said Dr Arun Kumar who was a part of Jacob's team. \"We can't wait for the final proof. We are only saying that children below 10 years of age should not be allowed to consume bada chakunda. We are not recommending the removal of the plant. It is a part of the biodiversity.\"\n\nExcess consumption leads to toxicity\n\nThe seeds of the bada chakunda plant are eaten routinely by the Adivasis of Malkangiri. \"Children eat it raw and it is also used in dal preparation by mothers,\" said Dr KK Sarkar, joint director, health department of Malkangiri. The Adivasis believe the seeds have medicinal value and administer them to children for de-worming or when they get fever, Sarkar added.\n\nDoctors do not dispute the medicinal value of the plant. \"It is used in some liver tonics available in the market,\" said Vashishtha, who was the part of the team that investigated the Saharanpur deaths. \"The problem is when it is consumed in excess it can lead to disease.\" He claimed that Saharanpur had a situation similar to Malkangiri. The number of deaths did not drop even after vaccination against Japanese encephalitis. \"Once awareness against the consumption of the seed was done, the deaths started going down,\" he said.\n\nSarkar said the Malkangiri administration has started an awareness campaign in the villages asking mothers to \"not allow their children to eat these poisonous seeds\".\n\nBut some public health experts questioned the move. A study with 5 samples was not enough, they said, to establish the link between the consumption of the seeds and the child deaths in Malkangiri. Odisha government needs to first assess the toxicity levels of the seeds before asking Adivasis to stop consuming it. \"The community has been consuming these seeds for years and today you say that the seeds are causing deaths,\" said Dr Karpagam. \"You are stopping them from eating their natural diet without having any evidence that it is the cause for the death of their children.\"\n\nActivists pointed out that the Adivasis consume the seeds partly because of the crisis of food in the area. Doctors in Malkangiri said that most of the children who died in the district hospital were malnourished. Hunger was one of the underlying causes of the deaths.\n\nMembers of John's team did not deny the role of factors such as malnutrition. \"The risk of developing the disease depends on the ratio of the [bada chakunda] seeds consumed to the body weight of the child,\" said Kumar. \"If the child is well nourished, he may have some bouts of vomiting and nothing severe. But a malnourished child may not be able to fight the toxin.\" He added: \"After all, we all consume natural toxins and our body filters them out. It is only when the body can't filter them out, that it leads to [organ] damage.\"\n\n[byline: Priyanka Vora]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report does not conclusively establish the etiology of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). What the team headed by Dr John established was that not all AES fatalities were due to JE virus infections. Only less than a third were. Children consumed the seeds of the bada chakunda plant that is known to contain the toxicant anthroquinone which was found in their urine, but it is not known if it was consumed in fatal quantities. However, the report indicates that a battery of investigations had already confirmed liver and muscle damage in the 5 children, who later succumbed to the disease, a finding compatible with anthroquinone intoxication. Critics of the team's report indicated that testing 5 sample was not sufficient for drawing conclusions. Obviously, the case would be much stronger if all the non-JE cases had been tested for presence of anthroquinone in blood. Nevertheless, 5 of 5 with anthroquinone in urine should establish a sufficient index of suspicion that further studies should be done when new cases occur, which seems likely. The critics offer no alternative etiologies for AES that might be ruled in or out. Certainly, a JE vaccination campaign is worthwhile to prevent future cases due to infection with that virus, but it is not likely to prevent the majority of AES cases. - Mod.TY]\n\n[\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170.]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (33): (OR) 20161119.4641400\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (32): (OR) 20161112.4623814\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (31): (OR) 20161111.4621162\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (30): (OR,TR) 20161107.4611260\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (29): (OR) 20161103.4603728\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (28): (OR), human, porcine 20161029.4594738\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (27): (OR) 20161026.4585027\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (26): (OR) RFI 20161024.4579882\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (OR) 20161020.4572206\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (OR,UP) 20161014.4558708\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (OR) 20161007.4544425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (OR) 20161006.4539552\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (OR) 20161005.4537043\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (OR) 20161003.4533613\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (OR) 20160929.4525723\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (OR) 20160927.4517725\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN, OR) 20160725.4368952\n.................................................ty/mj/sh", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4641400", "archive_id": 4641400, "date": "2016-11-19 20:24:23", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (33): (OR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (33): (ODISHA)\n******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] New cases\n[2] New AES diagnosis\n\n******\n[1] New cases\nDate: Thu 17 Nov 2016\nSource: The Times of India [edited]\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/japanese-encephalitis-toll-touches-114-in-69-days/articleshow/55469081.cms\n\n\nJapanese encephalitis toll [of fatalities] touches 114 in 69 days\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nThe authorities in Malkangiri district [Odisha state] are finding it difficult to arrest the outbreak of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and the mystery disease, which the administration is suspecting to be acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), even as droves of children are being rushed to the hospitals and wails of anguish from relatives of victims fill the district headquarters hospital every day.\n\nTwo separate expert teams have investigated the mysterious deaths, ministers, secretaries of various departments and specialist doctors have made numerous visits to the tribal-dominated district in the past few weeks but all their promises and attempts have failed in controlling the killer disease.\n\nWith 4 deaths on Wednesday [16 Nov 2016], the unofficial toll has risen to 114 in 69 days.

In its interim report, the panel said on Friday [18 Nov 2016] that the children may have died of encephalopathy, which is caused due to consumption of a plant, 'bana chakunda' (_Cassia occidentalis_).\n\nThe state government had formed the 6-member panel, led by eminent virologist Dr Jacob John from Vellore's Christian Medical College, earlier this month [November 2016]. In the interim report, Dr John said that anthraquinone, a toxin found in the plant, was found in the urine sample of 5 deceased children. \"This indicates that the children (had) consumed the seeds of the plant,\" he said.\n\nAround 100 children have died in Malkangiri since September [2016].

Possible etiologies of AES are discussed in a previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20161111.4621162). The team investigating the outbreak has come up with a reliable diagnoses for at least 5 of the dead children as due to consumption of the seeds of _Cassia occidentalis_ (known commonly as coffee senna, negro coffee, rubbish cassia, stinking weed), with folk medicine uses of leaves and roots (see http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S025462990500044X).

The vaccination, which is likely to be started from 1st week of December [2016], is to prevent only the vectorborne Japanese encephalitis (JE) and will have no impact on the soaring acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases.\n\nIt is not JE but the deadly AES which has claimed more lives in the tribal dominated district. Unfortunately, neither any vaccine nor medicine is available for AES, which is a group of clinical neurologic manifestations caused by wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.\n\nSo far, of 85 deaths registered in Malkangiri [now up to 90 - Mod.TY], JE accounts for only 30 while 55 children have died of AES in the past 61 days. The reports indicate that of total 313 cases, 161 children have been diagnosed with AES and the rest with JE. Sources said 33 children, mostly affected with AES, are undergoing treatment at the district headquarters hospital.\n\nOn the other hand, non-availability of vaccine and medicine for AES, the major cause of child deaths, has put the health administration in a fix. Director of health services Dr Kailash Chandra Dash admitted that a spurt in AES cases is a global concern: \"There are many AES causing viruses for which no vaccine or medicine is available. Medicine for only herpes virus is available and several affected children in Malkangiri have been treated for the disease,\" he said.\n\nIn many cases, children affected with AES suffer from brain aspiration and edema which develops due to an inflammatory reaction. Both are life threatening and if such cases are not treated early and properly, the chance of survival of the patient is remote. \"That's why we are alerting people to be cautious. Early detection and treatment are 2 possible methods to put a check on it. Since there is no particular medicine for the disease, we are adopting symptomatic treatment with supportive ventilator and regular monitoring of glucose level of patients,\" Dash said.\n\nThe health officials, however, claimed that JE vaccine is also not foolproof as it fails to provide 100 per cent protection. The states which were covered under the vaccine in the last few years have achieved 60 to 70 per cent results. \"We have no other option but to rely on it and focus on treatment,\" they said.

However, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, have been proposed.\n\nIn a previous comment (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20151117.3798363), Dr Jacob John has again called for an integrated approach for surveillance with adequate laboratory support and dissemination of information that emerges to clinicians and to public health authorities as guidance for patient treatment and JE vaccination efforts. He also reiterates the need for more specific diagnosis of the etiology or etiologies of AES, since JE virus infections have been excluded in many cases, as noted in his comments and previous ProMED-mail posts. Those previous ProMED-mail posts have implicated Reye syndrome, consumption of lychees, and heat stroke, as well as JE virus infections, as responsible for AES. Dr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the north western region of Bihar state and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES (acute encephalitis syndrome). Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified and in June 2014 children were treated by 10 per cent dextrose infusion and many lives were saved (under publication). However, the current outbreak began at the end of the monsoon season and has continued. Other etiologies have been proposed by clinicians. A published article in a pediatric journal proposed that some cases are due to heat stroke. It has been proposed that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). Several reports have associated AES with contaminated water, suggesting enterovirus etiology.\n\nThe leadership of Dr Jacob John in the group investigating the outbreak is good news. Perhaps they will be able to come up with the etiology or etiologies of these AES cases. Until the etiological agents responsible for the cases are definitively identified, these unfortunate cases will continue and prevention or optimal treatment will not be possible.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (30): (OR,TR) 20161107.4611260\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (29): (OR) 20161103.4603728\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (28): (OR), human, porcine 20161029.4594738\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (27): (OR) 20161026.4585027\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (26): (OR) RFI 20161024.4579882\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (OR) 20161020.4572206\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (OR,UP) 20161014.4558708\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (OR) 20161007.4544425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (OR) 20161006.4539552\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (OR) 20161005.4537043\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (OR) 20161003.4533613\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (OR) 20160929.4525723\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (OR) 20160927.4517725\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (TR) 20160903.4462527\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN, OR) 20160725.4368952\n2015\n---\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): comment 20151117.3798363\nEncephalopathy, hypoglycemia - India: (BR) litchi, methylenecyclopropylglycine 20150201.3132842\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20150909.3633134\n.................................................ty/je/sh", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4611260", "archive_id": 4611260, "date": "2016-11-07 16:29:25", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (30): (OR,TR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (30): (ODISHA, TRIPURA)\n***************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this post:\n[1] Odisha state\n[2] Tripura state\n\n******\n[1] Odisha state\nDate: Mon 7 Nov 2016\nSource: The Asian Age [edited]\nhttp://www.asianage.com/india/odisha-encephalitis-toll-hits-97-59-days-173\n\n\nAt the district hospital of Odisha's Malkangiri [district], 2 more children succumbed to Japanese encephalitis while undergoing treatment on Sunday [6 Nov 2016], taking the death toll in the dreaded vectorborne disease to 97 in 59 days.\n\nThe deceased were identified as a 2 year old of Tulibeda village of Korukonda block and another 2 year old of Kumutiguda in the district, reports said.\n\nA 12-member team, including 7 experts of the state health department and the Centre, has been visiting the district since Saturday [5 Nov 2016] to take stock of the situation.

Encephalitis is marked by inflammation of the brain's membrane that causes rapidly rising fever, headache, stiffness of the neck, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and even death.\n\nOdisha first reported encephalitis cases in 2015, when 660 AES cases and 33 JE cases were detected.

Immunity from vaccination provides the best barrier to JE virus infection.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (26): (OR) RFI 20161024.4579882\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (OR) 20161020.4572206\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (OR,UP) 20161014.4558708\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (OR) 20161007.4544425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (OR) 20161006.4539552\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (OR) 20161005.4537043\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (OR) 20161003.4533613\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (OR) 20160929.4525723\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (OR) 20160927.4517725\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN, OR) 20160725.4368952\n.................................................ty/mj/mpp", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4579882", "archive_id": 4579882, "date": "2016-10-24 11:14:09", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (26): (OR) RFI", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (26): (ODISHA) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n******************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 23 Oct 2016 10:02 IST\nSource: The Times of India, Times News Network (TNN) [edited]\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/JE-toll-rises-to-68-in-Malkangiri/articleshow/55008338.cms\n\n\nThe unofficial death toll due to Japanese encephalitis [JE] touched 68 with the death of a 4-year old girl at the Malkangiri district [Odisha] headquarters hospital late on [Fri 21 Oct 2016].\n\nAkash Srivastava, the joint director (Epidemiology), National Centre for Disease Control, who is in Malkangiri, said the administration has taken many steps to contain the disease.

Though another 4-year-old girl also died at the hospital [Mon 17 Oct 2016], hospital sources claimed that to be a case of pneumonia.\n\nUnofficial sources have pegged the toll above 60.\n\nAccording to official sources, of the 184 children admitted to the hospital, 119 have been discharged so far. At present 9 children are undergoing treatment at the DHH [District Headquarter Hospital] -- one in the ICU and the rest in the JE ward, collector K Sudarshan Chakraborty told media persons.\n\nThe collector further said of the 56 children who died at the hospital, only 20 tested positive for JE. In the last 2 days, the DHH has not registered any fresh JE cases, it was learnt.\n\nOn the other hand, 11 697 bed nets have already been distributed in 110 villages while fogging operations were conducted in 203 villages. Besides, DDT and DTI have been sprayed in 103 and 136 villages respectively.\n\nProviding more details on the casualties, the collector revealed that a total of 54 children tested positive of which 34 were discharged after treatment.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Nruparaj Sahoo, deputy secretary of panchayati raj [decentralized form of government] who has been appointed as officer on special duty (OSD), visited the DHH [Mon 17 Oct 2016] and spoke to officials. Future course of action would be decided following a meeting with the collector, Sahoo said.\n\nHealth director Dr Kailash Chandra Das said the number of JE-affected cases has been on the decline after massive awareness drives were launched by the health workers following the visit of the minister and secretary of the department. He hailed the efforts put in by the doctors of other districts to control the outbreak.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of deaths attributable to Japanese encephalitis (JE) has increased from 48 on 13 Oct 2016 to 59 on Tue 18 Oct 2016. The bed nets should be helpful in preventing mosquito bites. Single-time village fogging is unlikely to provide long-term vector mosquito population reduction, especially if there are extensive wetlands or rice fields around the village where the _Culex_ vector mosquitoes breed.

At least 61 affected children are undergoing treatment in the hospital.\n\nA mosquito-control drive has been intensified in most regions of Malkangiri district where children have fallen victims to JE. While more than 12 000 mosquito nets had been distributed in the affected areas, fogging has been intensified to check the culex mosquitoes that transmit Japanese encephalitis virus. Hordes of pigs that carry the killer virus have been kept in enclosures and hundreds of pigs have been killed by the villagers to stop spread of the virus. Cooked food is being provided to pregnant and lactating women and malnourished ailing children.\n\nThe district collector of Malkangiri served a show-cause notice to 22 nodal officers of the district for alleged dereliction of duty in tackling Japanese encephalitis. Health secretary Arti Ahuja visited the affected region to take stock of the situation. The department was taking every possible step to control of the spread of JE, she told reporters.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org >\n\n[The number of fatalities in this area continues to increase. A 13 Oct 2016 report indicated that there are 2 more fatalities, bringing the total to 50. The report added that a total of 9454 pigs have been kept inside the enclosures away from the affected villages of which 7040 pigs are kept in 104 government enclosures and 2414 pigs in 36 private enclosures (http://odishatv.in/odisha/body-slider/encephalitis-outbreak-admn-steps-up-sanitation-measures-in-malkangiri-170560/). As noted in recent posts, health officials are becoming concerned with this trend and have focused preventive efforts on village pigs and mosquito control. The presence of pigs in villages of the district is a reasonable worry, since pigs are amplifying hosts of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus. Mosquito vector control is difficult in areas of extensive wetland breeding sites. Fogging provides only temporary reduction in vector mosquito numbers. Bed nets will be helpful in preventing mosquito bites. As noted earlier, again it seems curious that in all these recent reports no mention is made of vaccination. That would be the most effective measure for prevention of JE in this susceptible population.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Poorvanchal region, Uttar Pradesh state\nDate: Sun 9 Oct 2016\nSource: The Times of India [edited]\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/Encephalitis-widens-its-net-112-new-cases-reported/articleshow/54762305.cms\n\n\nThe spike in cases of encephalitis in Poorvanchal region has put district administration on tenterhooks. 112 new cases of encephalitis were reported in the region, putting a question mark on the administration's vaccination programme.\n\nAfter mass vaccination drives in 2006 and 2010, the proportion of mosquitoborne encephalitis cases had fallen to 2-3 per cent but the rise in mosquitoborne encephalitis cases in last 2 months has raised left health officials red-faced.\n\n\"The district administration needs to monitor the encephalitis vaccination program as has been done in the case of polio vaccination,\" said Dr KP Kushwaha, former principal of BRD Medical College.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although according to a 6 Sep 2016 ProMED-mail post, the number of deaths from encephalitis in the BRD Medical College Hospital had risen from 224 on 4 Sep 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160905.4467223) to 254 as reported above, apparently not all were from the Poorvanchal region. Cases in that region are increasing, adding 112 new cases to the number. The above report mentions mosquitoborne encephalitis, doubtless referring to Japanese encephalitis.\n\nCases of encephalitis are common in Uttar Pradesh state at this time of the year. Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic in north eastern India and more cases can be expected over the remainder of the transmission season, which one hopes is drawing to a close. The Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh state has been an active focus of JE cases annually. The above report does not indicate if the new cases had been tested for JE or had been vaccinated for it previously. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] Climate change effects\nDate: Wed 12 Oct 2016\nSource: India Climate Dialogue [edited]\nhttp://indiaclimatedialogue.net/2016/10/12/japanese-encephalitis-surges-changing-climate/\n\n\nIn July this year [2016], the death of a 4 year old girl in Manipur [state] due to Japanese encephalitis unleashed panic in the state. This was the 1st death from the deadly viral brain infection, transmitted by the culex mosquito, since 2010. Manipur has seen a surge in the virus this year, recording 45 cases this season, leading to 2 deaths, Sasheekumar Mangang, head of epidemiology in the Manipur health department, told indiaclimatedialogue.net.\n\nJapanese encephalitis is characterised by the inflammation of the brain and high fever. There is no medical treatment for the disease, and as with other viruses, patients are treated for the symptoms they develop. Fatality rates for severe [neurological] infections hover between 20-30 per cent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAssam, an Indian state that neighbours Manipur, has also had a deluge of Japanese encephalitis cases -- 304 cases so far this year [2016] with 1256 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (which doctors say is linked to the virus) -- leading to over 200 deaths, according to data from the health department.\n\nAs the central government declared Japanese encephalitis (JE) a notifiable disease last month [September 2016] -- which means all cases have to be reported to local authorities in order to halt further spread of the virus -- experts blame climate change as one of the main reasons for the surge.\n\nManifold increase\nIn Assam, the number of annual cases has risen almost 5-fold from 154 in 2010 to 744 in 2014; deaths rose from 41 to 160 in the same period.\n\nPatowary, a senior official in the Assam health department, said, \"Climate change is one of the reasons for vector-borne diseases like JE becoming a threat for longer periods in the year. Erratic rainfall and warmer months extending up to October-November is resulting in mosquitoes like the culex finding an ideal environment to breed.\" The disease, which was earlier reported in the months of May-July, is now claiming a large number of victims until much later in the year.\"\n\nMangang from the Manipur health department agrees. \"Change in climatic conditions -- extended periods of warm days, erratic rainfall causing flash floods, and thereby water stagnation -- are contributing towards suitable breeding environment for the JE vector.\"\n\nThe virus has also spread from a few \"endemic\" places in upper Assam, to all 27 districts in recent years.\n\nNearby western Myanmar is also facing a Japanese encephalitis outbreak. So far 45 cases have been reported among children in Rakhine state, resulting in 6 deaths. Cases have been reported in 4 of its townships -- Sittwe, Ponnagyun, Pawktau, Kyauktaw. Authorities have launched a vaccination drive only in Sittwe because a lack of resources. Sittwe, as the most densely populated city, is considered a priority area -- with 80 000 children being inoculated against the deadly virus. A public health official said that 5 of the 7 children who had contracted JE in Sittwe has been discharged from the hospital but had not regained their ability to speak.\n\nSimilar patterns across Asia\nResearchers across Asia are finding similar links between changing climate and mosquitoborne diseases. A 2013 research paper on 'Climate change and mosquito-borne diseases in China' also links variability in temperature, precipitation, wind, and extreme weather events with the transmission of mosquitoborne diseases [including JE] in some parts of China. The paper co-authored by Li Bai, Lindsay Carol Morton and Liu Qiyong, says, \"Global warming might change temperature and rainfall patterns which may affect the development and infection capacity of both the mosquito and the virus (that causes JE). Relative humidity is also important in the transmission of JE because mosquitoes can survive longer and disperse further in areas with suitable humidity...\" The paper notes that JE has spread to new parts of China, including high altitude areas of Tibet.\n\nAnother research paper on climate change and JE in Taiwan says, \"From a socio-ecological viewpoint, an outbreak of JE may be facilitated by 2 factors -- that is, global climate change and modulation of agriculture (such as adoption of paddy agriculture, use of pesticides, and creation of modern pig farms).\" Pigs are one of the main carriers [amplifiers] of the disease.\n\nShifts in farming patterns\nShifts in cropping or agriculture patterns -- again because of climate change -- is further aiding the spread of JE. Both Assam and Manipur, like the other Indian north eastern states, mostly cultivate rice. With changing climate patterns, paddy farmers here have realised that they can grow their crop until much later in the year.\n\nTalukdar, a senior official in the Assam health department said, \"The culex mosquito breeds in the water in the agricultural land. Since warmer months for longer periods of the year have enabled farmers to grow more crops of rice each year, it gives more time and space for mosquitoes to breed.\"\n\nLalit Kant, senior advisor on infectious diseases at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) adds, \"Studies from Assam show that the practices of paddy cultivation, domiciliary surroundings with adjacent water bodies, and high temperature and humidity were influencing the abundance of the potential mosquito vectors responsible for transmission of the virus in the rural community.\"\n\nFloods and pigs increase risks\nFloods have made the situation worse. This year, Assam faced what experts said was the worst floods in 20 years. It came in 3 waves and affected 4.1 million people, destroying crops and property. After the rains and the immediate destruction end, the threat of disease grows -- both waterborne and vectorborne. Standing water, yet again, makes for a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes, and cases of malaria and JE surge.\n\n\"A similar situation exists in Nepal, and studies have been undertaken to assess the link between the increase in JE cases and climate change,\" Kant said. He also mentions the correlation between pig farms and JE, since pigs (and birds) are the main host for the virus.\n\nAn increase in pig rearing in Assam -- a lucrative option for farmers -- could therefore be another contributing factor. \"Pig rearing in close quarters to domestic households, because of lack of space, is another reason for the rise in JE in Manipur,\" said Mangang.\n\nTaking action\nTo tackle the growing problem, states facing outbreaks are encouraging people to get vaccinated. Although children are said to be more vulnerable, with children aged 1-5 being vaccinated, JE seems to be striking adults with equal ferocity. In Manipur, according to the state health department, 75 per cent of the JE cases were found in adults above the age of 20. \"There are ample reasons to suspect that there are new strains of JE,\" Mangang said.\n\nThis puts the focus on awareness campaigns on adult vaccinations. In Assam, a study said that adults were more vulnerable to JE -- possibly because of exposure in paddy fields.\n\nAccording to Pradeep Haldar, deputy commissioner of immunisation at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, adult vaccination campaigns have been launched in 21 \"high-burden\" districts in Assam, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh, identified by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.\n\n\"Climate change is a reality. So the only way to protect against vector-borne diseases is vaccination and more awareness about how to prevent mosquitoes from breeding,\" Patowary said.\n\n[byline: Azera Parveen Rahman ]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[References:\nLi Bai, Lindsay Carol Morton, Qiyong Liu.

While the deaths have taken place in about 25 days, around 5 patients are now undergoing treatment in a hospital, he said.\n\nNayak, who visited the district along with Secretary to Health Department, Arti Ahuja, and Secretary to Animal Resources Department, Bishnupad Sethi, said measures required to deal with the situation are being taken.\n\nSince mosquitoes are the vectors for the disease, which spreads from pigs to humans, mostly children, the immediate task is to isolate the animals and relocate the pig farms away from the villages. Necessary steps in this regard are being taken, he said.\n\nWhile a team of doctors and experts had been sent earlier to the affected areas to take stock of the situation, another expert team was sent there on [Sun 2 Oct 2016]. They would camp there and plan various measures required to deal with the situation, he added.\n\nA team of veterinary doctors are also being sent to the disease affected areas to identity the infected pigs.\n\nHealth assistance booths have been opened in the affected areas, while fogging work was intensified to control mosquitoes, official sources said.\n\nBlood samples of pigs are also being sent to laboratory for thorough examination, they added.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of JE fatalities in this area has increased to 27.

The deaths have been reported from Manasa, Goreiguda, Baliapari, Koimetla, Sangel, Anlaguda, Palkonda, Sindhiguda, Siadimal, Chitapari, Golaguda and Kopeguda villages under Malkangiri Sadar, Kalimela, Korukunda, Podia and Kudumuluguma blocks [Malkangiri district, Odisha state].\n\nAll deceased children were aged between 2 and 8 years, with blood and cerebral fluid samples confirming 3 deaths as caused by Japanese encephalitis [JE]. The results for other samples are still awaited, though symptoms clearly indicated encephalitis.\n\n\"This is the 1st time Japanese encephalitis has been confirmed in the district. So we are collecting more samples from villages in the periphery,\" said Malkangiri Chief Medical Officer Uday Shankar Mishra.\n\nWith just one paediatric specialist in the entire district and less than half the sanctioned strength of doctors, the latest epidemic has posed a huge challenge to the health establishment here.\n\n\"The problem is there is no particular course of treatment for encephalitis. All that we are giving is supportive treatment. We are hoping that the children may just survive,\" Mishra said.\n\nHealth officials said the main reason of deaths due to JE and AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] in Malkangiri villages was due to rearing of pigs by villagers. \"The tribals live close to pig and cattle sheds. The outbreak of AES and JE starts during post-monsoon period when the density of the _Culex vishnui_ mosquitoes increases. As the pigs are carriers [amplifiers] of the virus the villagers are at greater risk,\" said District Vector Disease Consultant Ajit Dalai.\n\nHe said medical relief centres have been set up in the affected villages and measures, including fogging, for vector control and larvicidal application are being done.\n\nA farmer whose daughter died Wednesday said there were 10 or 12 families in his village Sudhiguda who reared pigs.\n\nOfficials said from next financial year, the vaccine for JE is likely to be administered to the children.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of children dying of encephalitis in the district has increased from 14 reported 3 days ago on 26 Sep 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160927.4517725) to 19 in the above report. Apparently, some of these deaths are confirmed as due to JE virus infections and the remainder are suspected to be due to the virus also, but this report also mentions acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). The report goes on to describe the importance of _Culex vishnui_ mosquitoes and pigs -- all key actors in the transmission of JE virus. Vector control is mentioned, but is difficult to achieve long-term. The vector mosquito breeds in extensive wetlands such as rice paddies that are difficult to treat with insecticides. Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and undiagnosed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) occur frequently each year in this part of north eastern India. Vaccination campaigns are needed in areas where the virus is endemic.\n\nUnfortunately, AES is an imprecise category and includes JE and other possible but unconfirmed etiologies. As noted in previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated.

While it is suspected that the children might have died in Japanese encephalitis (JE), health officials claimed they were suffering from acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).\n\nThe deaths have been reported from Kalimela, Pandripani, and Korkunda blocks of the district, which had first witnessed the incidence of AES and JE in 2012. At least 4 children have died in Koimetla village in one week spreading panic among the residents.\n\nSources said of the 15 children who were undergoing treatment in district headquarters hospital (DHH), 6 have been shifted to MKCG Medical College and Hospital at Berhampur. The children showed symptoms of AES like fever, vomiting, and fatigue.\n\nHospital authorities have started precautionary measures to check the menace. Blood samples of these children have been sent to Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) for tests to ascertain whether they were infected by JE.\n\nMeanwhile, a team of health officials has visited the affected villages in 3 blocks of the tribal-dominated district. The team comprised Director (Public Health) Dr Kailas Chandra Dash, Joint Director of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) Dr MM Pradhan and experts from Animal Disease Research Institute (ADRI).\n\nDeputy Director of NVBDCP Dr Rajendra Mallick said population in the affected villages belonged to tribal communities with low socio-economic status who lived on cultivation and daily wages. \"They live in unhygienic condition and raise pigs which are major carrier [amplifier] of the virus,\" he said.\n\nThe outbreak of AES and JE usually coincides with the monsoon and post-monsoon period when the density of mosquitoes increases. As precautionary measure, awareness drive as well as measures to curb mosquito menace has been started in all affected areas of the district.\n\nPaddy fields close to houses, high pig to cattle ratio, high density of _Culex vishnui_ mosquitoes, low socio-economic status, and low health awareness in tribal population have been cited as reasons behind the spurt in AES cases.\n\nDr Mallick said house-to-house survey was undertaken to record the suspected cases and information on clinical presentations. \"The blood samples have also been collected by the ADRI team. The reports are awaited,\" he added.\n\nSudden deaths in children due to AES were first reported in the district during September-November 2012 when 272 suspected cases with 24 deaths were observed.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Apparently, some of these deaths are suspected to be due to JE, but health official attributed them to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). The report goes on to describe the importance of _Culex vishnui_ mosquitoes and pigs -- all key actors in the transmission of JE virus. Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and undiagnosed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) occur frequently each year in this part of north eastern India.\n\nUnfortunately, AES is an imprecise category and includes JE and other possible but unconfirmed etiologies. As noted in previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed or JE virus infection is ruled out and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, lychee consumption, sun stroke, and enterovirus infection have been proposed.

As per Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) of Malkangiri, Uday Shankar Mishra, till now around 14 children between the age of 2-8 years have been identified to be suffering from symptoms of encephalitis. Some of them are being treated in Malkangiri district hospital and 6 have been referred to MKCG medical college and hospital in Berhampur. All these children had developed symptoms related to encephalitis that includes fever, lethargy and vomiting.\n\nThis time the suspected encephalitis cases are being reported from Korkunda, Kalimela, Pandripani blocks of the district, the CDMO added. Blood samples of these children have also been sent to the Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) for tests to ascertain whether they have been infected by JE [virus] or any other form of encephalitis. Remote pockets of Malkangiri district have history of encephalitis infection, especially among children. In 2012 during monsoon months, several children had died in the district allegedly due to encephalitis. Some suspected cases of the disease were also reported from the district in 2013. In 2014 it was alleged that around 10 children had died in the district because of it.\n\nSo, as precautionary measure, awareness drive as well as measures to curb mosquito menace has been started in all rural areas of the district. Medical teams are visiting most prone areas. The virus causing JE is transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ and _Culex vishnui_ groups, which breed particularly in flooded rice fields. Bodies of pigs are its major breeding points [amplifying hosts]. All these factors are prevalent in rural areas of Malkangiri district. So, there is extra watch on areas where pig population is high.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A 23 Sep 2016 report stated that at least 12 infants have died of Japanese encephalitis, 6 in the past week in Odisha's Malkangiri district.

We have the blood samples of these patents to the medical college for the test,\" said Pall, adding that all the patients suffering from suspected JE are out of danger and are improving fast.\n\nJapanese encephalitis (JE) is a disease [virus] spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms usually take 5-15 days to develop and include fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and difficulty moving. Symptoms that develop later include swelling around the brain. It is a serious disease that may even cause death.\n\nThe civil surgeon's office said that some suspected JE cases in considerable number have come to the notice, here. \"We are looking at the cases and steps are being taken to increase the surveillance across the district. Awareness is the best medicine to prevent the spread of any form of viral infection and we urge upon the people to practice, among other things, storing water scientifically in their respective places,\" said a medical officer at the malaria department.\n\nAccording to experts, drastic change in weather conditions and fast depleting forest cover may have let the virus that hitherto confined to wild animals, prey on the human beings. Unusual weather conditions seem to have triggered viral fevers on a large scale with scores of children and adult being admitted to the hospital with such complaints.\n\n\"Jusco [Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company] had been carrying out spraying of anti-larvicidal chemicals and fogging under its command areas while the local urban bodies along with District Filaria Department have been spraying anti-larvicidal and also distributing pamphlets informing masses not to let water accumulate in unused containers and complain about clogging of drains,\" said the official.\n\nFrom district health department records, in the year 2010, over 10 000 viral cases were reported in the district in the monsoon period.

So far, as many as 8 cases have already been confirmed by the health officials. Out of these cases, one patient has died while the others are being treated either at the district hospital in Lakhimpur or higher centres in Lucknow.\n\nHealth officials suspect that some patients may have succumbed to JE before their samples were sent to Lucknow for tests. There are no facilities to test JE in the district and samples have to be sent elsewhere for diagnosis. Most of the patients of encephalitis are children below 15 years of age. They are being kept under medical observation.\n\nThe health officials recently sent 19 samples to Lucknow and 8 tested positive for JE while the results of 2 samples are awaited. After detecting such a high number of JE cases in the district, a separate ward has been set up for JE patients. Those whose condition is critical have been referred to higher centres in Lucknow.\n\nAll the hospitals have been alerted in the district to provide details of suspected JE cases so that their samples can be sent to Lucknow for testing.\n\nDr IB Tripathi, who is in charge of the district hospital of Lakhimpur in the absence of CMS Dr Manoj Kumar, told TOI, \"Most of the cases are being reported from rural areas, where there is poor hygiene and sanitation.

Rainfall increases relative humidity in atmosphere, which raises the lifespan of adult mosquitoes. \"Temperature and rainfall have been reported to be associated with the density of mosquito population and highly related to the occurrence of JE.

He, however, clarified that the outbreak has not taken the form of an epidemic. The positive cases are reported from the districts of Thoubal, Imphal West, Churachandpur, Chandel, Ukhrul and Imphal East. One of the patients resides on the outskirts of Imphal city.\n\nOf the 9 patients, 8 are undergoing treatment at Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences and Regional Institute of Medical Sciences here free of cost, while the other patient is undergoing treatment at a hospital outside the state. Official sources said there are more suspected cases. The exact number of positive cases would be known after the laboratory test of the blood samples.\n\nIbomcha said it was not wise for Japanese encephalitis patients to seek treatment at private hospitals.\n\n\"All possible steps have been taken to control the spread of the virus causing the disease. There is no reason for panic. We are fighting the outbreak on a war footing,\" Ibomcha Singh said.\n\nThe official said that 3000 vials or 15 000 doses of anti-Japanese encephalitis vaccine are in stock at present and 75 000 doses would be arriving in a few days to increase the stock.\n\nFogging has already been initiated to kill mosquitoes within a 2-km radius of the localities from where the positive cases were reported.\n\nManipur has experienced an outbreak of the disease in the past. According to official records, there were 200 cases in 1995; 50 affected people died that year. Out of 100 positive cases in 2010, 10 patients died. There were 9 positive cases last year [2015].\n\nHealth minister D.K. Korungthan, accompanied by the health director, visited primary health centres yesterday [22 Jul 2016] located in Chandel district, one of the affected districts, and distributed anti-Japanese encephalitis vaccines. The team also supervised the ongoing fogging activities in the district.\n\nThe health minister appealed to the people not to panic, assuring them the state government had taken all possible measures.

In fact, pigs as well as certain wild birds (Heron) act as the carriers of JEV. There is no mortality in adult pigs except of reproductive symptoms like abortion, mummified foetus and still births, but in piglets, mortality may go up to 100 percent. From these carriers, the disease is transmitted not by contact but by the vector mosquitoes (species in the genus _Culex_ and _Aedes_), which are usually active during dusk and dawn.\n\n\"That's why vector control has much importance to prevent the transmission of virus from pig to pig and pig to human. Pigs may be reared away from human habitation to minimise the chance of human infection,\" stated an ADRI official.\n\nJapanese encephalitis is caused by a mosquito-borne virus. This disease is mostly seen in humans during the mosquitoes' breeding season. Now nearly 18 states have recorded JEV and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), which have high mortality and morbidity rates.\n\nIn Odisha, the 1st outbreak was reported in 2012 in Malkangiri district. At least 24 children had died in Potrel and Uskapalli villages under Chitrakonda tehsil and Pradhaniguda and Charkiguda villages under Malkangiri tehsil.\n\nThere is no vaccine [not accurate; there is a JEV vaccine that is widely used in India. - Mod.TY] and specific anti-viral medicine available against JEV in humans. The cases are managed symptomatically. Clinical management is supportive, and acute care is directed at maintaining fluid, electrolyte balance and control of convulsions, if present. Maintenance of airway is crucial.\n\nThe preventive measures are directed at reducing the vector density and in taking personal protection against mosquito bites using insecticide treated mosquito nets. The reduction in mosquito breeding requires eco-management, as the role of insecticides is limited.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[JE virus is endemic in northeastern India, where the JE virus transmission season is beginning. Fogging is not an effective long-term approach to JE prevention; vaccination is.\n\nIt is odd that Manipur has an active JE vaccination initiative yet the Odisha health authorities indicate incorrectly that there is no vaccine. Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure. Vector control may provide short-term mosquito population reduction but is not a long-term preventive measure. Extensive rice fields and other wetlands offer ample breeding sites. The Odisha report mentions acute encephalitis syndrome, some cases of which are due to JE virus infections, and several other etiologies have been proposed for other AES cases.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/306. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMaps:\nManipur State, India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/311\nOdisha State, India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (JH) susp 20160721.4361308\nJapanese encephalitis: Philippines (DR), Viet Nam, India (KL,BR) 20160716.4350209\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) fatal 20160627.4312442\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (04): (AS) 20160618.4295497\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20160614.4287590\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (AS) 20160613.4283791\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (UP) 20160103.3908735\n.................................................sb/ml/lm/ty/msp/lm", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4361308", "archive_id": 4361308, "date": "2016-07-21 19:56:38", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (JH) susp", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (06): (JHARKHAND) SUSPECTED\n*******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 20 Jul 2016\nSource: The Telegraph [edited]\nhttp://www.telegraphindia.com/1160720/jsp/jharkhand/story_97616.jsp\n\n\nThe monsoon nightmare is back to haunt Jamshedpur [Jharkhand state] and its neighbours.\n\nThe East Singhbhum civil surgeon's office on Tuesday [19 Jul 2016] issued a double alert for dengue and Japanese encephalitis in the steel city after 18 suspected cases of the vector-borne diseases were reported from Tata Main Hospital (TMH) on Monday [18 Jul 2016].\n\n\"A general alert has been sounded to all hospitals, nursing homes and health centres in and around Jamshedpur.

Nalbari district accounts for 3 of the deaths, while Dibrugarh accounts for one. Sivasagar district alone has reported 6 JE-positive cases so far.\n\nLast year [2015], the maximum number of JE-positive cases were reported from upper Assam districts, all of which are prone to floods. A total of 565 JE cases was reported from Assam last year and 132 of them proved fatal.\n\nJE experts said mosquitoes breed more during the rainy season and consequently, vector-borne diseases spread rapidly during the months of June to August. \"Temperature and rainfall are associated with the density of mosquitoes and occurrence of JE. Floods wash away the breeding grounds of mosquitoes, but JE cases could rise if the water stagnates,\" said a researcher.\n\nThe ambitious JE vaccination programme for children, which was launched in 11 districts a couple of years ago, has also taken a hit. Thanks to lack of awareness, many did not bother to immunize themselves against JE. \"The situation is not alarming yet, but we are working towards continuation of awareness programmes,\" said Rathindra Bhuyan, director of health services.\n\n\"We are trying to fight against JE and AES through measures like fogging in affected areas,\" said Dibrugarh DC Manivannan.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[JE virus is endemic in northeastern India, including Assam, where the JE virus transmission season is beginning.

Entomological and serological investigation of Japanese encephalitis in endemic area of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\nAbstract\nBACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES:\nJapanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito borne pathogen, is one of the major causes of viral encephalitis in eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. The objective of this work was to evaluate the entomologically based virological surveillance of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in the highly endemic area of eastern Uttar Pradesh.\n\nMETHODS:\nThe study was carried out during September 2010 - March 2013 in Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh. A total of 251 adult mosquito pools and 64 water samples containing larvae were collected from the District of Gorakhpur. Water pH, turbidity, and oxygen level were analyzed for vector breeding index (BI). In addition, 393 serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) suspected cases were collected from the district hospital.\n\nRESULTS:\nThe various _Culex_ species found included, _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ (26 percent), _Cx. vishnui_ (22 percent), _Cx. pseudovishnui_ (21 percent), _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ (13 percent), _Cx. whitmorei_ (9 percent), and _Cx. gelidus_ (8 percent). Highest minimum infection rate (MIR) was calculated for _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ (2.32), followed by _Cx. vishnui_ (1.98) and _Cx. pseudovishnu_i (0.71). All the larvae samples were negative for JEV. The mean number larvae of _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ and _Cx. pseudovishnui_ was negatively correlated with pH (r = - 0.45 and r = - 0.63) and turbidity (r = - 0.30 and r = - 0.37). In contrast, positive correlation was observed in case of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. A total of 41 clinical samples were found positive for JEV by IgM ELISA. The rainfall was significantly associated with Japanese encephalitis incidence and showed positive correlation to disease transmission (p = 0.02, r = 0.66).\n\nINTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION:\nThe findings showed the rapid dissemination of JEV within a population, facilitated by different species of _Culex_ in the region. As JE is a vaccine-preventable disease, an immunization programme, an effective vector control strategy, and application of standard hygiene practices in these endemic areas could result in a considerable reduction in morbidity and mortality due to JE.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh state has been an active focus of JE cases annually. The above study identifies the major mosquitoes involved in transmission of the virus in this region. Vaccination is an effective measure for prevention of JEV, as the above report indicates. Vector control is more difficult, and the report does not indicate which approaches might be effective.\n\nThe report indicates that of the 393 CSF samples tested, presumably from encephalitis cases, only 41 were positive for JEV. That raises the same question that has arisen in many previous reports about the etiology of the non-JE cases. The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, lychee consumption, sun stroke, and enterovirus infection have been proposed. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts.\n\nMaps of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/images2/india-map.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/306.\nMap of Uttar Pradesh State is at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/322. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (WB) 20151130.3830275\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (UP) 20151128.3824598\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): comment 20151117.3798363\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (BR) 20151116.3794161\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15) 20150930.3681239\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (BR) 20150917.3651976\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (UP) susp. 20150914.3642980\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India, Nepal 20150912.3641072\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20150909.3633134\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (ML) 20150819.3590146\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (ML,AS) 20150815.3581103\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (TN) 20150808.3566596\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (AS) 20150729.3545979\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (AS) vaccine 20150724.3534646\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS) 20150722.3529096\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (WB) 20150715.3513485\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (AS) RFI 20150714.3510678\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (WB): 20150710.3499921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (JH) susp. 20150409.3287355\nEncephalopathy, hypoglycemia - India (02): Methlyenecyclopropylglycine, commentary 20150225.3183897\nEncephalopathy, hypoglycemia - India: (BR) litchi, methylenecyclopropylglycine 20150201.3132842\n.................................................ty/msp/jw", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3830275", "archive_id": 3830275, "date": "2015-11-30 21:52:04", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (WB)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (19): (WEST BENGAL)\n***********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 27 Nov 2015\nSource: The Echo of India [edited]\nhttp://echoofindia.com/jalpaiguri-anti-encephalitis-vaccination-jalpaiguridist-start-nov-30-99084\n\n\nIn a bid to stop the spread of Japanese encephalitis disease in Jalpaiguri, the district health department is all set to start an anti-encephalitis vaccination drive across the region from 30 Nov [2015]. The department aims to vaccinate 13 lakh [1 300 000] people across the district during the month-long campaign. The vaccination will be given to people within the ages of 15-65 years.\n\nNotably, acute encephalitis or Japanese encephalitis disease have taken 30 lives in 2014 in Jalpaiguri District, while more than 300 people were diagnosed with the disease. This year [2015], the district has recorded 20 deaths so far, with 100 registered cases. Last year [2014], the department had provided anti-encephalitis vaccine to children below the age of 15 years and elderly above 65 years in Mal Subdivision and Nagarkatta. This year [2015], the department will set up camps in Raiganj, Jalpaiguri Sadar, Mainagudi, Mateli Block, Jalpaiguri, Dhoopgudi Municipality and Siliguri Municipality areas.\n\nDistrict chief medical officer Dr. Prakash Mrigha said that the anti-encephalitis vaccination campaign will be started from Jalpaiguri DM's office this coming Monday [30 Nov 2015]. \"It will take an entire month to reach the target of vaccinating 13 lakh [1 300 000] people in the district. The vaccines cost anywhere between Rs. 1500-2200 [USD 23-33] in the market, but we are providing it free of cost,\" he explained.\n\nDr. Mrigha further stated that the department would send each house a vaccination card with information including the date and place of vaccination. People will have to carry the card along with them to the venue.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above report does not indicate how many of the 20 deaths and 100 registered encephalitis cases are due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infection or how many are classified as non-JE acute encephalitis.\n\nJE virus is endemic in northeastern India, including West Bengal.

Jacob John <tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in> [edited]\n\n\nThe media report cited in the posting [Japanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (BR) 20151116.3794161] describes cases diagnosed as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Of 123 AES cases, only 35 were laboratory confirmed as Japanese encephalitis (JE). Of 23 deaths, 8 had JE, and 15 had other diseases. I quote from the report: \"Health officials claim to have undertaken [a] massive immunization drive in the district to prevent [spread of] the deadly disease. But the claims have fallen flat after the outbreak of the disease, which took almost epidemic form.\"\n\nChurchill's statement on the war situation fits the AES situation perfectly: \"It is a riddle wrapped in mystery inside an enigma, but perhaps there is a key.\" I know that immunization against JE had been on a very large scale. Disturbingly, several JE-vaccinated children have had laboratory confirmed JE. Some among them have died. The outbreak, in spite of widespread immunization, does not disprove the claim of immunization, as there are genuine vaccine failure cases. However, in the absence of public health surveillance, quantified and validated data are not available. Moreover, the great majority of AES cases were not JE.\n\nTwo very relevant questions have been raised in the most recent issue of Lancet Infectious Diseases. One (DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00402-8) is that counterfeit drugs and vaccines are prevalent; I hope that the national immunization programme has adequate quality checks, but it is quite possible that spurious vaccine could enter the supply chain. This needs careful study and supervision. A colleague from Nepal tells me that vaccine failure is virtually zero there.\n\nThe 2nd (DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00405-3) is that all so-called laboratory-proven JE may not be JE at all. The positive predictive value of some of the currently recommended confirmatory tests, particularly detection of anti-IgM antibody, even in cerebrospinal fluid, may be false positive, as many cases have other infections with bacteria, fungi, or viruses.\n\nThere is a key to the riddle: where JE is prevalent, health management must be modernized with quality assurance of medical care, reliable laboratory support service, public health surveillance, and problem-solving research in medical colleges. The very tendency to club any and all brain disease as AES, even in medical colleges, illustrates the need for professionalism in public health and medical care.\n\n--\nT. Jacob John\nRetired Professor of Clinical Virology,\nChristian Medical College,\nVellore, India\n<tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>\n\n[ProMED thanks Dr. John for his comments.\n\nDr. John has again called for an integrated approach for surveillance with adequate laboratory support and dissemination of information that emerges to clinicians and to public health authorities as guidance for patient treatment and JE vaccination efforts. He also reiterates the need for more specific diagnosis of the etiology or etiologies of AES, since JE virus infections have been excluded in many cases, as noted in his comments and previous ProMED-mail posts. Those previous ProMED-mail posts have implicated Reye syndrome, consumption of lychees, and heat stroke, as well as JE virus infections, as responsible for AES.

Altogether, 123 AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] patients were admitted to the children's ward of the ANMMCH with AES symptoms. Of these, 35 of the patients were found suffering from Japanese encephalitis, the more deadly form of the disease.\n\nConfirming 24 deaths due to AES this season, ANMMCH superintendent Dr SK Sinha said that 35 of the 123 AES patients admitted to the hospital this season tested JE positive. Giving a further breakdown, the superintendent said that of the 23 deaths reported this season, 8 suffered from Japanese encephalitis while the other 15 died due to AES.\n\nNow that the temperature has come down and winter is beginning to set in, there was little likelihood of the disease spreading any further. Altogether 96 encephalitis patients have been discharged while another 4 were undergoing treatment in the children's ward of the hospital; 2 of the patients were discharged on Friday [13 Nov 2015] after satisfactory recovery.\n\nThe encephalitis survivors have suffered mild to severe mental retardation and physical infirmities, particularly weakening of the upper and lower limbs. Facilities for the rehabilitation of the AES survivors are not available in the hospital and as such the discharged patients have to fend for themselves. According to activist Brajnandan Pathak, the affected patients -- being very poor (almost all of them belong to the Mahadalit social group) -- cannot afford rehabilitation at centres outside the district.\n\nAs per available statistics, the maximum number of AES deaths were reported in 2011 when no fewer than 70 children died of encephalitis in ANMMCH alone. In 2009 too, 46 AES deaths took place. The numbers of affected children in 2011 and 2009 were 321 and 151 respectively.\n\nHealth officials claim to have undertaken a massive immunisation drive in the district to prevent [spread of] the deadly disease.

Another 21 patients suffering from the deadly disease are undergoing treatment in the children ward of the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College and Hospital [ANMMCH, in Gaya, Bihar].\n\nWith encephalitis cases reported from Fatehpur, Atri, and Manpur areas of the district [Gaya], the deadly disease threatens to take an epidemic form. Almost all the victims belong to the marginalised sections of the society. More deaths cannot be ruled out, as being poor, a sizeable number of affected people die at the hands of the quacks and faith healers.\n\nConfirming 6 deaths, civil surgeon Dr Krishna Mohan Purvey said that 3 of the victims hail from Gaya district while the other 3 are from neighbouring areas including Aurangabad. The civil surgeon claimed that preventive steps have been taken in the affected areas through fogging and awareness creation. Surveillance has been stepped up and Asha workers have been galvanised to maintain surveillance and counsel affected families.\n\nGiving break up of the encephalitis patients undergoing treatment in the ANMMCH, the civil surgeon said that of the 21 cases testing positive [for what? - Mod.TY], 2 cases have been confirmed as those of Japanese encephalitis [virus infections].\n\nThe remaining 19 are cases of acute encephalitis syndrome. Symptoms for both AES and Japanese encephalitis are more or less the same and as such, clinical diagnosis was not possible. The cases are confirmed only after proper [laboratory] test. The civil surgeon claimed that test kits were available in adequate numbers.\n\nRTI [Right to Information Act] activist Brajnandan Pathak has demanded development of specialised infrastructure for encephalitis management and rehabilitation. Even the survivors, in many cases suffer permanent physical disability and mental retardation necessitating rehabilitation.\n\nEncephalitis, it may be recalled, has been hitting the area with annual frequency and as such, a comprehensive solution is required.

Though immunisation against the disease was carried out in the area, health authorities said even those who were vaccinated against the ailment may suffer from the disease in some cases.\n\nAccording to health workers, the disease is transmitted from infected animals including pigs, wild boars and ducks to humans by mosquitoes belonging to _Culex_ species.

If the inactivated virus vaccine was used, the duration of immunity would not have been long lasting.\n\nPigs are mentioned in the above report because they can serve as amplifying hosts for JEV.

All the dead were children in the age group of 5-15 years, the official in Gorakhpur said.\n\nBaba Raghav Das Medical College Superintendent NN Shukla said, \"Since January [2015], 693 children suffering from encephalitis were admitted to the Baba Raghav Das Medical College [in Gorakhpur], of which 147 died.\" Patients admitted to the hospital who were suffering from encephalitis belonged to the districts of Gorakhpur, Deoria, Gonda, Basti, Sidharthnagar, Sankabrinagar, Kushinagar, Balrampur, Ghazipur, Azamgarh, while some patients came from Nepal and Bihar.\n\nThe area is endemic for Japanese encephalitis but in the past 6 years, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear. One possibility is that the water-borne virus was present in contaminated water, doctors said.\n\nThe diseases cause headache and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunction, seizures, and inflammations of the heart and kidney.\n\nDoctors say children between the age of 6 months-15 years are the worst affected and most of the victims are poor people from rural areas.\n\nWith this disease taking epidemic propositions every year, Convener of the National Encephalitis Eradication Program (NEEP) RN Singh has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to declare encephalitis eradication programme as national programme. \"The need of the hour is to make encephalitis eradication programme a national programme.\n\nThe issue has been raised more than 20 times in the Lok Sabha by MP from Gorakhpur Yogi Aditanath. \"A National Programme for Prevention and Control of Encephalitis was made twice -- first in 2011 and then in 2014. But it is very unfortunate that it is yet to come out of the drawing board,\" he wrote in his letter, which was released to the media today. He said, \"The disease is 100 per cent preventable but does not have any specific treatment. Till now, government's major stress has been on the treatment only, but what is important is that the government should look after the prevention part too.\"\n\n\"Many countries where it was a major problem have almost eradicated it. Some decades back, countries like China, Japan, and Korea were ravaged by encephalitis. Now these countries are encephalitis-free. If these countries can do it, so can we,\" he said. The disease is predictable and preventable. The annual monsoon fills parched paddy fields, which bear the mosquitoes that spread Japanese encephalitis from pigs to humans, devastating malnourished children with low immunity.\n\nAnother strain of the disease acute encephalitis syndrome spreads through contaminated water. Residents defecate in the fields, contaminating the ground water.\n\nA vaccine has long been available, but the disease killed more than 1500 children in 2005 and 431 in 2006. In 2006, a vaccination drive was launched. The government vowed to immunise every child in the worst-affected areas and to launch a massive drive to improve sanitation. For a couple of years, the numbers dropped also.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Outbreaks of encephalitis occur regularly in north eastern India, where these cases occurred. Before an effective prevention program can be launched, it is necessary to know the etiologies responsible for these cases. Japanese encephalitis virus is responsible for some, but not all cases. Many reports associate contaminated water, presumably carrying enteroviruses, with these outbreaks.\n\nDr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the northwestern region of Bihar state and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES (acute encephalitis syndrome). Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified and in June 2014 children were treated by 10 per cent dextrose infusion and many lives were saved (under publication). A published article in a pediatric journal proposed that some cases are due to heat stroke. It has been proposed that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine. Until the etiological agents responsible for the cases are definitively identified, these unfortunate cases will continue.\n\nMaps of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/images2/india-map.jpg\nand of Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1307. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (ML) 20150819.3590146\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (ML,AS) 20150815.3581103\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (TN) 20150808.3566596\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (AS) 20150729.3545979\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (AS) vaccine 20150724.3534646\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS) 20150722.3529096\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (WB) 20150715.3513485\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (AS) RFI 20150714.3510678\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (WB): 20150710.3499921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (JH) susp. 20150409.3287355\nEncephalopathy, hypoglycemia - India (02): Methlyenecyclopropylglycine, commentary 20150225.3183897\nEncephalopathy, hypoglycemia - India: (BR) litchi, methylenecyclopropylglycine 20150201.3132842\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (AS) 20150128.3126931\n2014\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (MH) 20141121.2978346\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (BR) 20140930.2818512\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (UP) 20140924.2799733\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP) 20140910.2764597\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (ML) 20140830.2736957\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (WB) 20140815.2691972\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS, WB) Viet Nam 20140807.2669178\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): comment, Reye-like encephalopathy 20140804.2656983\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS,WB) 20140801.2652476\n.................................................ty/mj/jw", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3590146", "archive_id": 3590146, "date": "2015-08-19 20:14:24", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (ML)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (11): (MEGHALAYA)\n*********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 18 Aug 2015\nSource: Mid Day via Google Alerts [edited]\nhttp://www.mid-day.com/articles/japanese-encephalitis-alert-in-meghalaya/16465160\n\n\nMeghalaya has sounded an alert for Japanese encephalitis [JE] after 3 people died of the disease and another 6 were tested positive for the virus, an official said on Tuesday [18 Aug 2015].\n\n\"We have sounded a health alert in the state after 3 people died of Japanese encephalitis and 6 people were tested for the virus,\" Director of Health Services R.

The vaccine is administered to people between 1-65 years of age.\n\nThe 5 cases were reported from Dhemaji, Dibrugarh, Golaghat and Tinsukia districts. Tinsukia reported 2 cases: a 9-year-old girl from the tea garden community and a 54-year-old man.\n\nIn March [2015], the state government launched the vaccination programme for kids in 11 districts and that for adults in 3 districts. Tinsukia district joint director of health Jyoti Bhuyan said the 9-year-old girl from the tea garden community was vaccinated earlier as part of the district's routine immunization programme, but her surroundings were unhygienic, and she was not properly nourished.\n\n\"Even after being vaccinated, there are chances that a person might fall ill. When we investigated the girl's case, we found that there were pigs in the area where she was staying,\" said Bhuyan.\n\nTinsukia district reported 7 cases of JE. No casualty has been reported so far. The 54-year-old man was administered the vaccine during the 1st phase of the adult vaccination programme last year [2014].\n\n\"The immunity cannot be 100 percent.

We have intensified awareness and fogging programmes in an effort to combat the JE scourge.\"\n\nHe added that the health department also planned to conduct a survey to study the fever cases. \"We are planning a door-to-door survey to study the fever cases. The positive JE cases are fewer compared to last year [2014]. It could be that this is the new JE strain that we are encountering, and it is possible that the virus has gained more virulence,\" said Borpujari.\n\nMore than 200 JE positive cases are being treated at different hospitals across the state. Till [Sat 18 Jul 2015], 38 persons have died, with the highest number of deaths reported from Sivasagar district.\n\nIn 2014, Sivasagar district had reported 128 positive cases, and, with the peak season for JE set to continue for 2 more months, Sivasagar district remains vulnerable. This year [2015] so far, 24 confirmed cases have been reported from the district. 14 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have also been reported.\n\nExperts also fear that with its sprawling paddy fields and large pig population in the oil-rich Sivasagar district, there could be further positive and confirmed JE cases across the district.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-SoAs\n<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to the 1st news report, Japanese encephalitis (JE) developed among 5 people who were vaccinated with SA 14-14-2 vaccine. Among them, a 9-year-old girl was malnourished and had exposure to pigs at her home. The local health officials have stated that the vaccine does not confer 100 percent immunity and that various environmental and host factors, including nutritional status, affect the level of immune response following vaccination. Of note, SA 14-14-2 vaccine is a live-attenuated vaccine using the SA 14-14-2 JE virus strain. Vaccine efficacy following a single-dose of vaccine has been reported to vary between 80 to 99.3 percent from different studies (http://www.path.org/publications/files/SA14142-fact-sheet-1013.pdf). The vaccine has been shown to confer immunity for up to 5 years with 96.2 percent efficacy.\n\nAccording to the 2nd news report, 38 JE deaths have been reported from the state of Assam as of 18 Jul 2015. The state health officials suspect that a new vaccine-resistant strain of JE virus has become virulent and is causing outbreaks among the vaccinated people in the state. However, it is not clear whether the suspicion is based on virus isolation and sequencing from cases. Since the vaccine does not confer 100 percent immunity, the residents in the affected areas need to be advised to take personal protective measures against mosquito bites.\n\nFor the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Assam state, India, see http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299. - Mod.SN]\n\n[If the vaccine provides 96 per cent immunity, then one might expect vaccine failure in 6 of the 175 JE cases mentioned in the 1st report. There were 5 vaccine failures. Proof of \"vaccine-resistant\" JE virus or a gain in virulence requires further information and study to answer several critical questions. Has there been a demonstrable change in antigenicity in the field (wild) strains of JE virus that are in circulation? Do the vaccinated individuals have JE virus antibody, and if so, does that antibody neutralize current JE virus field isolates as well as it does the vaccine strain of the virus, indicating a change in antigenicity? Is a greater proportion of JE virus-infected individuals developing neurological disease than is typical for JE virus infections indicating an increase in neurovirulence? Changes in virulence would have to be determined in animal studies comparing current fields strains of the virus with standard or reference virus strains. Apparently, not all cases of encephalitis in Assam (and other areas in northeast India) are due to JE virus infections, further complicating the situation. Other etiologies have been suggested as a cause of non-JE virus acute encephalitis syndrome (see ProMED-mail archive nos. 20150225.3183897 and 20140801.2652476), for which JE vaccines would provide no protection. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS) 20150722.3529096\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (WB) 20150715.3513485\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (AS) RFI 20150714.3510678\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (WB): 20150710.3499921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (JH) susp. 20150409.3287355\nEncephalopathy, hypoglycemia - India (02): Methlyenecyclopropylglycine, commentary 20150225.3183897\nEncephalopathy, hypoglycemia - India: (BR) litchi, methylenecyclopropylglycine 20150201.3132842\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (AS) 20150128.3126931\n2014\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (MH) 20141121.2978346\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (BR) 20140930.2818512\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (UP) 20140924.2799733\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP) 20140910.2764597\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (ML) 20140830.2736957\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (WB) 20140815.2691972\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS, WB) Viet Nam 20140807.2669178\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): comment, Reye-like encephalopathy 20140804.2656983\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS,WB) 20140801.2652476\n.................................................sn/jw/ty/je/jw", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3529096", "archive_id": 3529096, "date": "2015-07-22 17:38:02", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (06): (ASSAM)\n***************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 21 Jul 2015\nSource: The New Indian Express [edited]\nhttp://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/13-Dead-22-Affected-By-Japanese-Encephalitis-in-Assam/2015/07/21/article2932688.ece\n\n\nAltogether, 13 persons have died, and 22 have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam's Jorhat district during the last 10 days, Joint Director of Health and Family Welfare Dr Mobibur Rahman said here today [21 Jul 2015].

Doctors say climate change has played a major role in the spread of the disease, which once appeared largely from May to July but now is seen as late in the year as November, as mosquitoes survive longer in warmer conditions (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150128.3126931).\n\nIt is curious that no mention is made of an Assam-wide vaccination campaign, nor is there mention of campaigns in previous years. No mention is made of the JE virus vaccination status of the cases above or of the population in the affected area. Vaccination is more likely to be effective for prevention of JE cases than vector control, particularly in the areas of paddy rice cultivation that provide abundant _Culex_ vector mosquito breeding sites. The virus doubtless is endemic in northeastern India. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts.\n\nMaps of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/images2/india-map.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/306,\nWest Bengal state at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/323, and\nAssam state at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (WB) 20150715.3513485\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (AS) RFI 20150714.3510678\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (WB): 20150710.3499921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (JH) susp. 20150409.3287355\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (AS) 20150128.3126931\n2014\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (MH) 20141121.2978346\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (BR) 20140930.2818512\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (UP) 20140924.2799733\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP) 20140910.2764597\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (ML) 20140830.2736957\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (WB) 20140815.2691972\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS, WB) Viet Nam 20140807.2669178\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): comment, Reye-like encephalopathy 20140804.2656983\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS,WB) 20140801.2652476\n.................................................sb/jw/ty/msp/jw", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3513485", "archive_id": 3513485, "date": "2015-07-15 18:25:13", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (WB)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (05): (WEST BENGAL)\n***********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 14 Jul 2015\nSource: Business Standard [edited]\nhttp://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/child-dies-of-japanese-encephalitis-in-wb-115071400913_1.html\n\n\nA child suffering from Japanese encephalitis died today [14 Jul 2015] at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital [NBMCH], taking the death toll from the dreaded disease to 24 in North Bengal since January [2015].\n\nThe boy, under treatment at the hospital in Siliguri for the past several days, died at the hospital, NBMCH acting Superintendent Nirmal Bera said.\n\nHe said 14 persons have died of the mosquito-borne disease since 1 Jul [2015] at the hospital.

As part of the campaign, huge hording educating the people will be placed at strategic locations in the city.\n\nConsidering the high number of Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases detected in the city so far, the department has also decided to take out hordings specifically for JE. JE is a vector borne viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes after feeding on infected animals such as pigs and wild birds in the agriculture fields.\n\nThe department, which earlier used to only spray larvicidal, apart from undertaking cleanliness exercise will be opting for destroying unused containers (identified vector breeding centers) in the affected areas and educating people on not allowing water to stagnate in residential areas. This exercise would be held simultaneously with routine methods of spraying larvicidal in the area.\n\nFrom district health department records, in the year 2010, over 10 000 viral cases were reported in the district in the monsoon period. The figure rose to 16 000 in 2011, mostly from chikungunya and dengue. In 2012 there were around 8000 viral cases in the city.\n\nThe local residents said that though the district health department took initiative to curb the menace, again the diseases have shot up, making life difficult for the people.\n\nManoj Hansda, a social worker, said that the administration lacks will to work in the fringe areas due to [the fact that] the situation is far from safe.\n\n\"I think immediate steps need to be taken to control the menace.

Warmer conditions have allowed farmers to grow more crops of rice each year, which means rice paddies with standing water offer a breeding ground for mosquitoes for a larger part of each year. \"The _Culex_ mosquito breeds on water in the agricultural land, and now since there is water on the field for several more months than before, it gives more time and space for the mosquito to breed,\" Talukdar said.\n\nFaced with a surge in Japanese encephalitis cases, the Assam government has announced measures to tackle the problem, including more careful monitoring of cases. Assam Health Minister Nazrul Islam described the situation as \"a huge concern. I have asked the senior officials of the health department to monitor the situation carefully and to report to me on a regular basis,\" he said.\n\nFaced with a growing public outcry over the disease's rapid spread, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has ordered officials of the Assam health department to develop a plan to control the disease.\n\nPlans should include \"setting up of an intensive care unit in each district hospital for treatment of emergency cases, along with laboratory testing units,\" Gogoi said. As well, \"I have already asked the health department to procure laboratory testing kits for quick diagnosis of the disease, adequate vaccines and medicines for the hospitals, and also to carry out intensive fogging in the affected areas,\" he said.\n\nCivil society groups and activists have, however, questioned why such steps were not taken earlier. \"The data from the state health department itself shows that the disease has taken a deadly turn over the years in the state. Unfortunately, the state machinery waited for the disease to go out of control, whereas it should have taken steps to control the disease much earlier,\" said Sankar Prasad Rai, of the All Assam Students Union (AASU).\n\nSeveral influential student groups of the state, including the All Assam Students Union and the Assam Jatiyatibadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), have staged protests over the government's failure to control the spread of Japanese encephalitis.\n\n[Byline: Amarjyoti Borah]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated.

Increased surveillance, coupled with timely laboratory support, is very important for any control efforts to be successful. Although delivery of JE virus vaccine to hospitals is mentioned, it is curious that no mention is made of an Assam-wide vaccination campaign, nor is there mention of campaigns in previous years.

The patients usually die within a day or 2,\" said Ghenu Madhi from Patrel village.\n\nHealth Department Odisha specialist medical teams from Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Berhampur have now reached the affected villages, such as Materu, Patrel, Aerbanpalli, Rangamatiguda, Chimtapali, Buduri and Chintalwada to collect blood samples.\n\nSpeaking to Oisha Sun Times, Irma Kabasi of Aerbanpalli said: \"The villagers are really scared and have sent the kids away to their relatives. The entire village is now deserted. There are only 33 doctors in different community health centres out of 97 granted positions. The villagers have no choice but to turn to the local priests and herbal doctors, which makes matters worse,\" added Bhakta Madhi of Rangamatiguda.\n\n\"Mobile medical teams have reached the spot and are treating the patients in the affected villages. Blood samples of infected children have also been sent to the laboratory, and the test report is awaited. However, from the primary symptoms, we suspect it to be Japanese encephalitis,\" said Uday Shankar Mishra, CDMO of Malkangiri.\n\n[Byline: Rajan Rath]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Because Japanese encephalitis is suspected from the primary symptoms noted (presumably encephalitis), ProMED requests information concerning the results of the laboratory tests on the blood of the children when they become available.\n\nPrevious reports from northeastern India have indicated that only a small proportion of encephalitis cases are due to infections with Japanese encephalitis virus. Others have associated some encephalitis cases with contaminated water. However, in revisiting the comments made by Dr T Jacob John, he mentioned that cases in this area early in the year may be due to a Reye-like syndrome. In a 24 Jun 2014 comment (ProMED-mail archive no 20140625.2563561) concerning the Reye-like syndrome, he stated that \"the disease is undoubtedly hypoglycemic encephalopathy (with blood glucose levels below 40 in about half the children in whom testing was done), and lower than 80 in 80-85 percent. The lesson was to give 10 percent dextrose infusion as soon as possible after drawing blood for glucose measurement. Pediatricians who did this tell me that children given 10 percent dextrose within a short period of onset tend to recover within a few hours and are well to go home the next day.\"\n\nIn another comment on 3 Aug 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140804.2656983), he noted, \"I understand that West Nile virus is also present in that region, and some AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] may indeed be West Nile encephalitis.\" He indicated that JEV cases occur later in the year during the typical JEV transmission season.\n\nA 7 May 2014 report of a recent study from Odisha and Jharkhand states (ProMED-mail archive no 20140508.2459977) indicated that cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) were caused by infections with viruses of dengue and measles. However, this study indicated that although herpes simplex virus (HSV) was a dominant agent for acute encephalitis, in some cases the viral agents were those of dengue and measles. Over 16 per cent of cases were found to be caused by viral agents identified to be either HSV I or II, while another 2.6 per cent of cases were due to measles virus infections. Similarly, Japanese encephalitis virus caused 1.5 per cent of cases, followed by 0.57 per cent by dengue virus. This still leaves nearly 80 per cent of the cases without a diagnosis.\n\nThe report above provides no information about the JEV vaccination status of the population in the affected areas or the specific dates of occurrence of these cases.\n\nMaps of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/images2/india-map.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/22405. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (MH) 20141121.2978346\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (BR) 20140930.2818512\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (UP) 20140924.2799733\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP) 20140910.2764597\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (ML) 20140830.2736957\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (WB) 20140815.2691972\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS, WB) Viet Nam 20140807.2669178\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): comment, Reye-like encephalopathy 20140804.2656983\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS,WB) 20140801.2652476\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AR) susp 20140727.2638359\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (WB) 20140722.2628448\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (WB) RFI 20140722.2628044\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (WB) RFI 20140717.2616015\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (BR) 20140701.2580069\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (BR) Reye-like synd. susp. 20140625.2563561\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20140623.2558283\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) 20140619.2553037\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20140616.2544699\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) 20140615.2540893\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20140613.2536936\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR,UP) 20140611.2532425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20140609.2527999\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20140508.2459977\n.................................................sb/lm/ty/msp/lm", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2978346", "archive_id": 2978346, "date": "2014-11-21 12:34:25", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (MH)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER- INDIA (23): (MAHARASHTRA)\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 4 Nov 2014\nSource: The Hindustan Times [edited]\nhttp://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai/japanese-encephalitis-case-rings-alarm-bells-for-civic-body/article1-1282236.aspx\n\n\nAfter Pune's National Institute of Virology (NIV) confirmed the presence of _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ -- a mosquito which spreads Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus], the Brihanmumbai [Greater Mumbai] Municipal Corporation [BMC] said it would study the report and then take preventive measures.\n\n\"This is the 1st reported case of JE in the city [Mumbai]. We are yet to receive the NIV report and only after we study it, we can decide further preventive actions,\" said Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of epidemiology cell, BMC.\n\nAfter a 9-year-old Santacruz [Mumbai] girl tested positive for JE in September [2014], municipal health officials had claimed that the JE [virus]-spreading mosquito is not present in Mumbai.\n\nAccording to National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP), this year [2014], 1316 cases and 242 deaths from JE [virus] infection were recorded in the country. Assam has reported the highest number of cases (756) and deaths (163) in the country, according to NVBDCP.\n\nDoctors said the detection of the vector or carrier increases the possibility of transmission of the JE [virus] infection. \"Though it is relatively uncommon infection, JE has a high morbidity and mortality.\n\nDr Neelu Desai, the paediatric neurologist who treated the Santacruz girl, said that she has been treating patients with JE symptoms. \"It is just that we must have not tested all patients for the infection. The laboratory test is not vital in most cases as the patient only needs symptomatic treatment,\" she said.\n\nSenior state health officials plan to ask BMC's insecticide department to regularly collect and test _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito and larvae. \"It is better we prevent the possibility of an outbreak,\" said an official.\n\n[Byline: Priyanka Vora]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is endemic in many parts of India, and cases occur there annually, especially in the north east part of the country. The case above is the 1st one that ProMED has posted for Maharashtra state this year (2014). There was an outbreak of encephalitis in Maharashtra state in 2011 and JEV was the suspected cause, but was not laboratory confirmed (see ProMED-mail archive no 20111106.3302). Presumably, the 1316 cases nationally reported above for this year (2014) were laboratory confirmed, and West Nile virus (WNV) cases were excluded. WNV, a close relative of JEV, also occurs in India. Without reliable laboratory diagnosis, the number of reported cases can be confusing, as many are reported in India as acute encephalitis syndrome cases and sometimes presumed to be due to JEV infections when, in fact, they are not.\n\nIt is not clear why the detection of _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ in Mumbai, Maharashtra state is reported to be surprising. This mosquito species is widely distributed over south and south eastern Asia, including India (see http://www.mosquitocatalog.org/taxon_descr.aspx?ID=18465.

BRD Medical College statistics reveal that 991 encephalitis cases have been reported since January this year [2014], among which 291 have died and 184 are undergoing treatment in the encephalitis ward of the medical college. The mortality rate this year is the highest in 3 years. At present, the rate is 29.4 per cent. In the year 2011, only 18 per cent of encephalitis patients died; in 2012, the mortality rate was 20.9 per cent; whereas in 2013, it was 29.3 per cent. The increase in the last 3 years raises question on the claims made by the government.\n\nThe government is not following Holiya village model formula where the mortality rate came to zero. The chief campaigner of Encephalitis Eradication Movement (EEM) said: \"In order to eradicate encephalitis, we have been demanding implementation of 10-point programme of NEEP in the country but till 2009. To show effectiveness of programme, we adopted a village of Kushinagar district [Uttar Pradesh state] which was badly hit by encephalitis with 5 deaths and 4 handicapped encephalitis victims and no one vaccinated till 2009. From 1 Jan 2010, we adopted Holiya village and implemented 10-point programme of NEEP, with a resolution that we'll make the village encephalitis free by 31 Dec 2010.\"\n\n\"Every year, more than 500 people die of encephalitis, and I'm sure this year [2014] will not be an exception. The government is spending so much money on vaccination program of JE [Japanese encephalitis] which is only 4 per cent left and not focusing on prevention of enteroviral encephalitis,\" he said.\n\nThe Holiya village formula is based on 100 per cent prevention programme, where pigs were kept out of the residential area and drinking water and hand washing water was disinfected by keeping it in plastic bottles under the sun for 6 hours, proper sanitation arrangements, use of mosquito net and arrangement of vehicles for taking the patients to hospital. Early vaccination programme is also the part of the Holiya village formula.\n\n[Byline: Arjumand Bano]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[No data are presented in the above report on the proposition of the 991 encephalitis cases in the area due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections or from other causes.

Pediatricians who did this tell me that children given 10 percent dextrose within a short period of onset tend to recover within a few hours and are well to go home the next day.\" In another comment, he noted on 3 Aug 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140804.2656983), \"I understand that West Nile virus is also present in that region, and some AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] may indeed be West Nile encephalitis.\" He indicated that JEV cases occur later in the year during the typical JEV transmission season.

Based on the fact that the infected mosquito simply does not ask: \"How long are you already here?\" or \"Is it your 1st visit to this area?\" before she bites and infects I would really ask the travel medicine community for support to impact national and international bodies responsible for official trail medicine advice with the goal of having a harmonized approach, which \"allows\" vaccination of those who want the shots no matter how long the stay, as well as taking the risk without vaccination in those who stay longer (for example, by applying the principle of guided self-responsibility).\n\n--\nProf Dr Martin Haditsch, MD, PhD\nMicrobiology, Virology, Epidemiology/ID (specialist)\nInfectology and Tropical Medicine (specialist/diploma by the Austrian Medical Chamber)\n\nMedical Director TravelMedCenter Leonding and Medical Head Labor\nHannover MVZ GmbH\nTravelMedCenter Leonding\nHochstrasse 6a\nA-4060 Leonding\nAustria\n<leonding@travelmed.at>\n\nLabor Hannover MVZ GmbH\nNikolaistrasse 14-16\nD-30159 Hannover\nGermany\n<m_haditsch@syscomp.de>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Haditsch for his thought-stimulating comments.

The recommendation for vaccination a month or more before travel is not clear, since an immune response will occur before that time.

He was noted to have confused speech and seizures on 1 Aug [2014] and was taken to the AED of TMH again. He was admitted for further management on the same day. The patient is now afebrile in stable condition.\n\nHis cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens tested positive for antibodies against JE [virus antigens] today [6 Aug 2014] upon laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch.\n\nInitial enquiries revealed that the patient lives in the quarters of Crossroads Foundation near Gold Coast, Tuen Mun, and had no recent travel history during the incubation period.\n\nHe could not recall any recent mosquito bites. His family contact has remained asymptomatic and will be put under medical surveillance. The CHP's investigations are ongoing.\n\nOfficers of the CHP will conduct home visits and surveys among neighbours of the patient's residence for active case finding and arranging of blood tests.\n\nThe CHP's hotline (2125 1122), set up for public enquiries since the 1st local confirmed JE case, will operate till 9 pm today and from 9 am to 6 pm from tomorrow (7 Aug 2014] onwards.\n\nA health talk will be held at Crossroads Foundation this evening to deliver health advice to the public. Residents of Tuen Mun District with JE symptoms are also advised to promptly seek medical attention.\n\nThe CHP will issue letters to doctors and hospitals to draw their attention to the case and enlist their support in early diagnosis, control and prevention of JE.\n\nThis is the 4th JE case (3 local, one imported) reported to the CHP this year. In 2013, 6 cases (2 local, 3 imported, one unclassified) were reported in 2013 while 3 (one local, 2 imported) were filed in 2012.\n\n\"JE is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ (culicine mosquito) is the principal vector of JE and is nocturnal. It mainly breeds in waterlogged fields, marshes, ditches, and small stagnant collections of water around cultivated fields. The mosquitoes become infected by feeding on pigs and wild birds infected with the JE virus, and then transmit the virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. JE is endemic on the Mainland and in Southeast Asia,\" a spokesman for the CHP explained.\n\nMost JE virus infections are mild without apparent symptoms other than fever with headache. More severe infections are clinically characterised by the quick onset of headache, high fever, neck stiffness, impaired mental state, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions (especially in infants) and paralysis.\n\nTo avoid contracting JE, members of the public, particularly those living in rural areas, are reminded to take heed of the following preventive measures, especially after dark:\n- wear loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved clothes and trousers;\n- use effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body and clothing when outdoors; and\n- use mosquito screens or nets in rooms which are not air-conditioned.\n\nTravellers to endemic areas of JE should take the following precautions:\n- avoid outdoor exposure to mosquito bites at dusk and dawn, especially in rural areas, when mosquitoes spreading this virus are most active;\n- apply effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body and clothes; and\n- consider vaccination and arrange a travel health consultation with a doctor to determine the need for vaccination and vector preventive measures at least 6 weeks before departure to endemic areas in Asia or the Western Pacific for stays of over one month, particularly in high-risk rural areas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As the report above indicates, there have been sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection in Hong Kong (see ProMED-mail archives listed below). There have been 3 cases previously reported this year (2014) in Hong Kong. The virus is endemic in large areas of Asia, including Japan and China. Because Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JEV, it would not be surprising to see additional cases occur occasionally. Individuals living in, or traveling to, JEV endemic areas are well advised to follow precautions to avoid mosquito bites. JEV vaccine is available in China, but there is no mention about the immunization status of the above 2014 cases, although there is a recommendation for people to be vaccinated if they are going to be in a high risk area for a month or more. The CHP has responded to this case with vigorous neighborhood action to detect and prevent additional cases.\n\nMaps of Hong Kong can be seen at http://www.travelchinaguide.com/images/map/hongkong/hongkong-map.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS, WB) Viet Nam 20140807.2669178\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): comment, Reye-like encephalopathy 20140804.2656983\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS,WB) 20140801.2652476\nJapanese encephalitis - China (02): (HK) 20140730.2645282\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AR) susp 20140727.2638359\nJapanese encephalitis - China: (HK) 20140722.2628554\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (WB) 20140722.2628448\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (WB) RFI 20140722.2628044\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (WB) RFI 20140717.2616015\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (BR) 20140701.2580069\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (BR) Reye-like synd. susp. 20140625.2563561\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20140623.2558283\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) 20140619.2553037\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20140616.2544699\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) 20140615.2540893\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20140613.2536936\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR,UP) 20140611.2532425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20140609.2527999\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20140508.2459977\n.................................................sb/lm/ml/ty/mj/ml", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2691972", "archive_id": 2691972, "date": "2014-08-15 15:49:06", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (WB)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (18): (WEST BENGAL)\n***********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 13 Aug 2014\nSource: Sify News, Indo Asian News Service (IANS) report [edited]\nhttp://www.sify.com/news/212-encephalitis-deaths-in-bengal-news-others-oinuu1fgdejcj.html\n\n\nThe encephalitis outbreak in northern West Bengal has claimed one more life, taking the death toll in the entire state this year to 212, an official said Wednesday [13 Aug 2014].\n\nAccording to BR Satpathi, director of state health services, 693 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases were reported this year [2014] in the state. \"As many as 212 deaths due to AES have occurred in Bengal since January.

Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome outbreaks have affected 21 districts of Assam, with Sivasagar being the worst affected area.\n\nMore than 45 people have succumbed to the disease in Sivasagar alone this year [2014], despite it being the headquarters of the JE vaccination programme, which was started in 2011.\n\nAccording to doctors, after the commencement of the programme, there was a shortage of vaccines for 2 consecutive years. There was insufficient supply to meet the demands, as the vaccines are produced only in China.\n\nThe state could not meet the demands sufficiently, despite receiving a grant of 910.4 crore [Rs 9 104 000 000, equal to USD 148 371 000] from the National Rural Health Mission in 2013. Out of the grant money, 57.41 crore [Rs 574 100 000, equal to USD 148 371 000] was specifically allotted to tackle vector-borne diseases, with a major part to be spent on encephalitis outbreak prevention.\n\nLack of special care units, laboratories and shortage of medicines for the treatment of encephalitis in district hospitals also reportedly played a part in the massive outbreak of the disease, killing hundreds in the last few weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, 9 districts remained shielded from the encephalitis outbreak because of the vaccination programme in February [2014], according to NDTV.\n\nMosquitoes, the carriers of the virus, breed in stagnant water pits and paddy fields, areas most prone to JE. Having a moist climate, deep forests, and a dense network of water streams, Assam is highly prone to the disease.\n\n[Byline: Neha Singh]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] India, West Bengal\nDate: Tue 5 Aug 2014\nSource: The Hindu [edited]\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/encephalitis-deaths-touch-206-govt-seeks-approval-for-adult-vaccination/article6283003.ece?homepage=true\n\n\nWith over 200 deaths reported because of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis (JE) in West Bengal, the State government has urged the Centre to allow it to go in for an adult vaccination programme to arrest the disease. So far, vaccine has been administered only to children, and according to senior officials of the State Health Department, the cases of vaccinated children affected by the disease is almost nil.\n\n\"We have requested the Centre to enlighten us about the pilot project on the adult vaccination conducted in Assam. If the Centre allows us to go ahead, we are ready to vaccinate people,\" BR Satpathy, Director of Health Services, told The Hindu on Monday [4 Aug 2014].\n\nAccording to the latest figures available with the Health Department, so far 206 persons have died of AES and JE in the State since January 2014. Of the 206 deaths, 37 are because of JE.\n\nDr. Satpathy said 92 deaths have occurred in the State in less than a month since 7 Jul 2014, after the outbreak was reported in north Bengal. Of the 92 deaths, 28 are because of JE, he said.\n\nDespite attempts by the State government to contain the spread of encephalitis in north Bengal over the past few days, there have been reports of the mosquito-borne disease spreading to districts of south Bengal as well.\n\nSenior health officials admitted that at least 2 deaths have been reported in the districts of south Bengal. While a child died of acute encephalitis syndrome in Bankura district on Sunday [3 Aug 2014], days ago, a person had died of Japanese encephalitis in Murshidabad district.\n\nThe State unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the State government of not taking any help from the Centre to tackle the disease despite the Union Health Ministry extending all its support in the matter.\n\nThe BJP MP from Darjeeling, SS Ahulwalia, and Congress MP from Berhampore Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury raised the issue of encephalitis deaths in Parliament on Sunday [3 Aug 2014] and pointed out that the State government has done little to contain the disease.\n\nMeanwhile, another senior health official faced the State government's ire in connection with the outbreak. Anup Roy, Principal of North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH), which is dealing with a bulk of patients affected by AES and JE, was suspended on Monday [4 Aug 2014].\n\nEarlier, 3 senior health officials -- medical superintendent of NBMCH and chief medical officer of health of Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts -- were suspended by the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who holds the health portfolio.\n\n[Byline: Shiv Sahay Singh]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In his 3 Aug 2014 comment (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140804.2656983), Dr. T. Jacob John indicated that Assam and the northern part of West Bengal are contiguous and traditionally Japanese encephalitis virus-enzootic areas. He continued, adding that, \"the term acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is used in the context of JE epidemics to denote encephalitis cases that are not laboratory confirmed for one reason or another. Thus, in Assam and West Bengal, the cases of JE and AES should be added up to see the real magnitude of the JE outbreak.

Of these 31 kids, 3 had been vaccinated against JE [virus], Hien added.\n\nChu warned that JE symptoms include high fever, headache, feeling sick, vomiting, seizures, conscious disorder, and coma. JE virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the Western Pacific, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.\n\nIn preventing JE, the National Extended Vaccination Program and the local Health Department have decided to vaccinate all the children under 15 that have yet to receive vaccination against the 2 diseases in the province, Hien said.\n\nWhen asked why many children have now contracted the deadly disease despite the provincial health authorities launching a vaccination drive against JE in 2007, Hien explained that, in that year, only 50 percent of local children were given vaccination due to a shortage of vaccine shots.\n\n[The 2 Jul 2014 edition of Tuoitre News (http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/20720/viral-encephalitis-affects-325-people-kills-5-in-vietnam) reported that viral encephalitis had spread to 31 provinces and cities in Viet Nam, affecting 325 people and killing 5 of them in the 1st 6 months of this year [2014], health authorities said. - Mod.TY]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Unfortunately, the above report does not indicate what proportions of the more than 100 cases are due to JE virus infections and to meningitis. However, the sample of 73 cases laboratory tested indicated that 42 per cent were due to JE virus infections. This is not surprising, since Viet Nam has had active JE virus transmission this year (2014). Most cases of Japanese encephalitis there occur in the south during the rainy and early dry season, shifting to the north of the country during late summer and autumn. Nationally, 73 per cent of the population lives in areas of risk to JE virus infection.\n\nWild birds, especially ardeids, are reservoirs of JEV. Pigs are amplifying hosts. Several _Culex_ mosquito species are efficient vectors of the virus, transmitting the virus among wild birds and pigs and to humans. Vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites are the only measures available to avoid infection and disease.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Viet Nam can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/152. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): comment, Reye-like encephalopathy 20140804.2656983\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS,WB) 20140801.2652476\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AR) susp 20140727.2638359\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (WB) 20140722.2628448\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (WB) RFI 20140722.2628044\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (WB) RFI 20140717.2616015\nJapanese encephalitis - Viet Nam (02) 20140711.2601829\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (BR) 20140701.2580069\nJapanese encephalitis - Viet Nam 20140629.2573067\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (BR) Reye-like synd. susp. 20140625.2563561\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20140623.2558283\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) 20140619.2553037\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20140616.2544699\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) 20140615.2540893\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20140613.2536936\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR,UP) 20140611.2532425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20140609.2527999\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20140508.2459977\n.................................................sb/lm/ty/msp/lm", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2656983", "archive_id": 2656983, "date": "2014-08-04 09:22:34", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (16): comment, Reye-like encephalopathy", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (16): COMMENT, REYE-LIKE ACUTE HYPOGLYCEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY\n**************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 3 Aug 2014\nFrom: T Jacob John <tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in> [edited]\n\n\n[re: ProMED-mail Japanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS,WB) 20140801.2652476]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAssam and the northern part of West Bengal are contiguous and traditionally JE [Japanese encephalitis virus] enzootic areas. The 2014 southwest monsoon reached there in late June [2014] and since the end of June cases of JE have been reported in both states and also in the next-door state of Arunachal Pradesh (see archive no 20140727.2638359).\n\nThe term acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is used in the context of JE epidemic to denote encephalitis cases that are not laboratory confirmed for one reason or another. Thus, in Assam and West Bengal, the cases of JE and AES should be added up to see the real magnitude of JE outbreak. I understand that West Nile virus is also present in that region and some AES may indeed be West Nile encephalitis.\n\nIn pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the northwestern region of Bihar state and that is also popularly but unfortunately called AES. Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified and in June 2014 children were treated by 10 per cent dextrose infusion and many lives were saved (under publication). This region is not JE enzootic, and here there is no reason to conflate acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy and JE or encephalitis of any other cause.\n\nThere is no specific line of command for outbreak management in these states. In the absence of Department of Public Health in the Ministries of Health either in the Federal and in state governments, outbreaks soon become an administrative and political problem. Without public health surveillance early signals of outbreaks are not picked up and no interception interventions are applied on time. JE vaccination is conducted here by the Expanded Program on Immunisation [EPI] but there is disconnect between EPI and outbreak management. In short we know what should be done to prevent and control outbreaks but the system is not geared to be able to apply that knowledge.\n\n--\nT Jacob John\n439 Civil Supplies Godown Lane,\nKamalakshipuram, Vellore TN 632002\nIndia\n<tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>\n\n[ProMED-mail is grateful for Dr John's clarification of the use of the term AES in the reports that come to us for posting. We await with interest the publication of the Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy report. That will help with interpretation of the Bihar state pre-monsoon reports of AES that appear in the popular press, which frequently cite statements of government officials about the occurrence of AES cases there. It would be of interest to know how many, if any, of the reported JE virus infection cases are in reality due to West Nile virus infections.\n\nMaps of India showing the location of West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh states can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/images2/india-map.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS,WB) 20140801.2652476\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AR) susp 20140727.2638359\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (WB) 20140722.2628448\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (WB) RFI 20140722.2628044\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (WB) RFI 20140717.2616015\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (BR) 20140701.2580069\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (BR) Reye-like synd. susp. 20140625.2563561\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20140623.2558283\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) 20140619.2553037\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20140616.2544699\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) 20140615.2540893\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20140613.2536936\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR,UP) 20140611.2532425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20140609.2527999\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20140508.2459977\n.................................................mpp/ty/mj/lm", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2652476", "archive_id": 2652476, "date": "2014-08-01 15:22:32", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS,WB)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER- INDIA (15): (ASSAM, WEST BENGAL)\n*****************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nPublished Date: 2014-08-01 14:57:49\n[For those who are receiving this as a duplicate copy, we apologize for the inconvenience.

After the doubtful patients tested positive through the ELISA test, they were declared as AES affected, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, fogging was on in the vulnerable areas of the 24 of the 27 districts of the state affected by the killer disease, health department officials said.\n\nThe worst hit districts in Lower Assam were Sonitpur, Barpeta, Nalbari, Darrang, Kamrup (Rural), and Kamrup (Metro), while in the Upper Assam Tinsukia, North Lakhimpur, Jorhat, Dibrugarh, Dhemaji, and Golaghat, they said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\nThis report is confusing in that it differentiates AES and JE as clinical diseases, yet classifies both as vector borne. JE virus certainly is transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes. The cause of AES, however, has been a subject of debate and remains undefined (see ProMED-mail archives below), and Reye syndrome and heat stroke have been proposed as causal factors. This report does not indicate which vaccine will be administered in their campaign, but it is most likely to be JE virus vaccine. That vaccine will probably not be effective to prevent additional cases of early season AES, but will be helpful in preventing cases of JEV encephalitis that usually occurs later in the summer when that virus is transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes from wild birds. The vaccine is best administered just prior to the JE virus transmission season.\n\nJEV was excluded as the etiological agent in these early season AES cases, classified as a suspected Reye syndrome-like encephalopathy by Dr Jacob John (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140625.2563561).

But the episodes were just a tiny fraction of the hundreds that have occurred in recent years across a sprawling web of academic, commercial and government labs that operate without clear national standards or oversight, federal reports show.\n\nSpurred by the anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001, an increase in \"high-level containment\" labs set up to work with risky microbes has raised the number to about 1500 from a little more than 400 in 2004, according to the Government Accountability Office.\n\nYet there has never been a national plan for how many of them are needed, or how they should be built and operated. The more of these labs there are, the G.A.O. warned Congress last week, the greater the chances of dangerous blunders or sabotage, especially in a field where oversight is \"fragmented and largely self-policing.\"\n\nAs the labs have multiplied, so have mishaps. According to a 2012 article by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of reported accidents involving microbes that can cause severe illnesses grew rapidly, from just 16 in 2004 to 128 in 2008 and 269 in 2010, the last year reported. Many of the accidents involved leaks, spills or other releases of infectious material inside the laboratories, potentially infecting workers and often requiring extensive decontamination.\n\nAnother report, by the Department of Homeland Security in 2008, provided a rare glimpse into the types of accidents that have occurred at high-level labs around the country, often at universities.\n\nLab workers at different sites accidentally jabbed themselves with needles contaminated by anthrax or West Nile virus. An air-cleaning system meant to filter dangerous microbes out of a lab failed, but no one knew because the alarms had been turned off. A batch of West Nile virus, improperly packed in dry ice, burst open at a Federal Express shipping center. Mice infected with bubonic plague or Q fever went missing. And workers exposed to Q fever, brucellosis or tuberculosis did not realize it until they either became ill or blood tests detected the exposure.\n\nThe good news is that relatively few lab workers have become ill from accidental exposures: only 11 from 2004 to 2010, according to the CDC report. None died, and none infected other people.\n\nRichard H. Ebright, a molecular biologist and laboratory director from Rutgers University, said he had \"no confidence\" in the safety of the many labs that have sprung up since 2001. He suggested there was a culture of complacency at some of them, as well as hubris among some researchers who believe they do not need oversight or management.\n\nThe most recent revelations have underscored potentially serious lapses at the government's premier institutions. In June 2014, dozens of CDC employees may have been exposed to live anthrax. In another case disclosed this month [July 2014], a CDC lab accidentally contaminated a relatively benign flu sample with a dangerous H5N1 bird flu strain that has killed 386 people since 2003 and then shipped it to a lab at the Department of Agriculture. In yet another episode this month [July 2014], vials of smallpox and other infectious agents were discovered in a government laboratory on the campus of the National Institutes of Health after being stored and apparently forgotten about 50 years ago.\n\n6 or 7 government agencies were involved in the growth spurt of labs across the country focusing on dangerous pathogens, with no overall strategic plan, according to Nancy Kingsbury, the managing director of applied research and methods at the GAO, who testified last week before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.\n\nFor years, the accountability office has warned that there was no one federal agency overseeing all the laboratories. In fact, it has said, the real number of high-level labs is not even known because the only ones required to register with the government are those handling \"select agents,\" microbes that can cause serious illness in people, animals or crops. Other high-level labs handle pathogens that may be dangerous but are not listed as select agents, the office said, adding that not much is known about them.\n\n[Readers are encouraged to read the complete article on the NY Times website. - Mod.MHJ]\n\n[Byline: Denise Grady]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a parallel viewpoint from the UK, go to:\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/anthrax-bird-flu-dangers-lax-security-disease-control-labs.\n\nThe NY Times article notes 400 high-level containment laboratories in 2004 but some 1400 today. Yet I can remember in the decade prior to 9/11 barely 50 labs in the US researching, mostly with BSL 2+ facilities, on dangerous pathogens, including 20 with _B. anthracis_. It was a different time. Since then, there has been a deep flood of federal funding of limited value.\n\nThe primary function of ProMED is to report outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases plus toxic events, but not to be a forum for related discussions. The events and reports arising from the incompletely sterilised anthrax spores at CDC has produced a flush of revelatory reports of related problems there and elsewhere, so we are using the opportunity provided by these 2 articles to cut this thread. - Mod.MHJ\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]\nSee Also\nAnthrax - USA (10): CDC director's report 20140713.2605501\nAnthrax - USA (08): CDC lab exposure highly unlikely 20140702.2583211\nAnthrax - USA (06): CDC laboratory exposure, environment neg. 20140624.2563149\nAnthrax - USA (05): CDC laboratory exposure 20140623.2559920\nAnthrax - USA (04): CDC laboratory exposure 20140620.2554615\nAnthrax - USA (03): CDC laboratory exposure 20140619.2552800\n.................................................mhj/msp/jw", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2616015", "archive_id": 2616015, "date": "2014-07-17 16:23:11", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (WB) RFI", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (11): (WEST BENGAL), REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 15 Jul 2014\nSource: IN [edited]\nhttp://www.in.com/news/lifestyle/west-bengal-30-die-of-encephalitis-52873393-in-1.html\n\n\nA top official said that 30 people have died due to encephalitis in the past 10 days at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital.\n\n\"More than 100 people hailing from the districts of North Bengal were admitted with symptoms of encephalitis during this time,\" Dr Amarendranath Sarkar, Superintendent of North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, said.\n\nMost of the patients came from Jalpaiguri district and some others from Darjeeling, Cooch Behar and North Dinajpur districts, he said.

The maximum number of deaths took place in the state's Muzaffarpur district. Most of these children died at the government-run Sri Krishna Memorial College Hospital and the private-run Kejriwal Charitable Hospital.\n\nState health officials said they have identified half a dozen districts where the disease has spread. These include Bhagalpur, Motihari, and Samastipur districts. Bihar is, however, yet to officially declare an acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) epidemic.\n\nState Health Minister Ramdhani Singh has again appealed for central assistance, saying that his government was serious about controlling spread of the disease, which causes irritation and swelling of the brain.\n\nLast week [week of 23 Jun 2014], Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan launched a two-day vaccination campaign in Muzaffarpur to ensure 100 percent immunization of children.\n\nAs the monsoon has arrived in Bihar, doctors said the cool rain would provide relief to the children suffering from the disease.\n\nMuzaffarpur Civil Surgeon Gayan Bhusan admitted AES virus is still unknown. \"We are relying on symptomatic treatment to save lives,\" he said.\n\nAccording to doctors, the AES is a severe case of encephalitis characterised by inflammation of the brain. Mosquitoes transmit the infection, causing high fever among children.\n\nSuspected AES-related deaths of children were first reported in 1995 in Muzaffarpur. But neither experts from abroad nor from different medical institutes of the country have visited or collected samples to study the cause of deaths, thereby failing to identify the virus till date.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) continues to climb, rising from 124 on 20 Jun 2014 to nearly 190 today (30 Jun 2014), just 10 days later. This report does not indicate which vaccine will be administered in the campaign that the Union Health Minister announced, but it is most likely to be Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccine. That vaccine will probably not be effective to prevent additional cases of early season AES, but will be helpful in preventing cases of JEV encephalitis that usually occurs later in the summer when that virus is transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes from wild birds.\n\nJEV was excluded as the etiological agent in these early season AES cases, classified as a suspected Reye syndrome-like encephalopathy by Dr Jacob John (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140625.2563561).

This year [2014], the outbreak began in the 1st week of June 2014 and has affected a very large number of children.\n\nTypically, a child is found either unconscious or with seizures early in the morning. The cerebrospinal fluid is clear without inflammatory cell response (less than 5 cells per cubic mm). \"CSF gushes out,\" said one pediatrician, indicating brain edema. The moderator's observation of similarity with Reye syndrome is correct. Individually, each child fits with Reye syndrome diagnosis.\n\nThe special feature here are the large numbers of children getting Reye-like encephalopathy in a short period of time (2 months). It is this phenomenon of clustering that fooled people to think of an outbreak due to some infection, hence encephalitis, virus unknown, hence acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). That mistake continued until 2013 when I was invited by the Bihar government to assist. Once I saw cases and made the diagnosis, things have changed rapidly, but unlearning old lessons is difficult for many. There is only so much one individual can do, but I am grateful to the Bihar government for the invitation. In India, there is lack of clarity as to which government -- State or Federal -- is in charge of outbreaks. I am helping the Bihar State government, while the Federal government had been sending various teams during the past many years. Why they do not work with me in cooperation is not known.\n\nI have strongly recommended that the term AES be abandoned, as it is useless and harmful. The Muzaffarpur disease is a form of acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy. I had personally taken classes to the pediatricians of both the hospitals in Muzaffarpur and all Medical Officers of Primary Health Centers (PHC) prior to this year's [2014] expected outbreak and requested them to do lumbar puncture on every child to make sure we do not miss an occasional meningitis or encephalitis. (Among children admitted to the \"encephalitis ward,\" I saw some with bacterial meningitis that would have been clubbed with the outbreak cases).\n\nSecondly every child's blood glucose level must be tested and every child given 10 percent dextrose even before blood glucose value is available. This year [2014] (I am just back from Muzaffarpur), I can confirm that the disease is undoubtedly hypoglycemic encephalopathy (with blood glucose levels below 40 in about half the children in whom testing was done), and lower than 80 in 80-85 percent. The lesson was to give 10 percent dextrose infusion as soon as possible after drawing blood for glucose measurement. Pediatricians who did these tell me that children given 10 percent dextrose within a short period of onset tend to recover within a few hours and are well to go home the next day.\n\nThe instruction from the government so far has been to transport children from villages to the tertiary care hospitals in the city. This results in delays of a few hours. A few days ago, one PHC Medical Officer saw a child at around 7:30 AM, within a half hour of onset, and after taking blood for glucose measurement, infused 10 percent dextrose. Within a half hour, the child sat up with open eyes to the delight of everyone. Blood sugar value was 30 mg [/dL]. So I am advising that PHCs should be made ready for treating these children, and only those who really need more tests or treatment need be referred out.\n\nI have tried hard to obtain a few liver biopsies to look for microvesicular fat inclusion bodies but have failed. In the 2015 season, I hope I will succeed. I understand the difficulties the local pediatricians face. They work really hard, and some feel very upset about so many sick children being hospitalised and many dying. They do not get additional hands to deal with the workload. Then, other investigators come and tell them this is viral encephalitis and keep collecting CSF and serum samples for virology. The public is told that the cases are encephalitis; some even say Japanese encephalitis (and JE vaccination is demanded and is being provided); others still call this AES. Sane voices are crowded out by such cacophony. My hand extended to CDC has not been reciprocated.\n\nWhat causes Muzaffarpur outbreaks of Reye syndrome (or hypoglycemic encephalopathy)? I know of 3 suggestions: One, heat encephalopathy. Certainly, the disease occurs in the height of summer, but the age distribution (all under 10 years) and the early morning onset are against heat disease. In Bangladesh, where litchi-associated encephalopathy has been reported, the suspicion was that organo-chlorine pesticides may be the cause. This line will be explored by my colleagues in Muzaffarpur. The 3rd possibility is litchi-seed-associated methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), and this will also be investigated by my colleagues in future (Ref: John TJ, Das M. Current Science 2014; 106: 1184-1185).\n\nHope these details will clarify the Muzaffarpur situation.\n\n--\nT Jacob John\nChristian Medical College\nVellore, Tamil Nadu, India\n<tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. John for his comments. He suspects, as we did, that a Reye-like syndrome is the likely diagnosis in this outbreak in children in Muzaffarpur (see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Japanese encephalitis and other - India (08): (BR) 20140623.2558283).\n\nIn 1963, Reye and co-workers reported their clinical and pathological observations in 21 children with encephalopathy and fatty change in viscera (Reye RD, Morgan G, Baral J. Encephalopathy and fatty degeneration of the viscera. A Disease entity in childhood.\" Lancet 1963;2 (7311): 749-52. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(63)90554-3. PMID 14055046). The illness usually begins as a non-specific febrile syndrome that is then followed by profuse vomiting, altered mental status, convulsions, coma, and death. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar level) occurs in most cases, accompanied by elevation of blood transaminase and ammonia levels with an acute non-inflammatory encephalopathy, cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and fatty degeneration in the liver and kidneys. The pathogenesis of Reye syndrome appears to involve mitochondrial injury.\n\nMost cases of Reye syndrome were associated with use of aspirin during the illness. In the United States, Reye syndrome became a reportable disease in 1973, and the government began issuing warnings about the association between this syndrome and aspirin. A dramatic decrease in the use of aspirin among children then was followed by a marked decrease in incidence of Reye's syndrome. However, other drugs and mitochondrial toxins (e.g., insecticides) may also be associated with Reye-like syndrome. Several plant species contain substances that have hypoglycemic potential, e.g., the toxin hypoglycin A, which is present in unripened fruit of the ackee tree, can cause Jamaican vomiting sickness (Barceloux DG. Akee fruit and Jamaican vomiting sickness (Blighia sapida Koenig). Dis Mon. Jun 2009;55(6):318-26).\n\nAs mentioned by Dr. John, the current outbreak in Muzaffarpur has been attributed by some to consumption of litchi (AKA lychee) fruit (http://zeenews.india.com/news/health/health-news/litchi-virus-causing-acute-encephalitis-syndrome_28452.html). Although this news article attributed the illness to a \"litchi virus,\" lychee seeds have been found to contain a toxic substance alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl) glycine that can induce hypoglycemia in experimental animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1243468/?page=1). - Mod.ML]\n\n[It is worth having a look at Dr. Lloyd Olson's comments (archive no. 20131011.1995836). He noted: \"In the province of Udorn, northeastern Thailand, of 3000 children admitted to the provincial hospital during 1969, we observed at least 83 children with the clinical features of acute encephalopathy (Pediatrics 1971; 47: 707-16). 46 died, all within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms. The disease was characterized by the sudden onset of fever, vomiting, and headaches progressing to seizures and coma. Almost all children were less than 6 years of age, and the majority of cases occurred during the late rainy season (August to October). This area is also endemic for JEV, and without autopsy and laboratory data, it would have been easy to confuse this syndrome with acute infection.\"\n\nCuriously, the Udorn encephalopathy outbreak ended by the 1980s and never returned, whereas the Bihar cases recur year after year. Dr. Olson also indicated that there was a possibility of aflatoxin involvement. Mod.ML added that contamination of food by aflatoxin has been postulated as another cause of Reye-like syndrome. In any event, given Olson's and Jacob John's assessments, Japanese encephalitis seems to be ruled out in these early season cases. - Mod.TY\n\nLocation map of Bihar state at\nhttp://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/bihar/bihar.jpg. - Mod.JW\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142.]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (08): (BR) 20140623.2558283\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) 20140619.2553037\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20140616.2544699\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) 20140615.2540893\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20140613.2536936\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR,UP) 20140611.2532425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20140609.2527999\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20140508.2459977\n[Reported annually on ProMED since Dec.2009\n2009\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (UP) 20091202.4113\n.................................................ml/ty/ml/msp/jw", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2558283", "archive_id": 2558283, "date": "2014-06-23 21:05:03", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (08): (BIHAR)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\nDate: Fri 20 Jun 2014\nSource: IBN, Press Trust of India report [edited]\nhttp://ibnlive.in.com/news/encephalitis-toll-rises-to-124-union-health-minister-to-visit-bihar/480611-3-232.html\n\n\nWith the death toll of children suffering from acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Bihar rising to 124 today [Fri 20 Jun 2014], Union Health Minister Harshvardhan is arriving in Patna tonight to take stock of the situation.\n\n\"Altogether 123 people have died in 2 hospitals here so far, including 6 in the last 24 hours; 20 new cases have also come, taking the number of hospitalised children to 670. The patients admitted in Muzaffarpur are local as well as from East Champaran, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Vaishali and Samastipur districts,\" said Muzaffarpur Civil Surgeon Dr Gyan Bhushan.\n\n\"A child of Bhagalpur has died here of AES. One patient each from Khagaria and Madhepura districts is admitted in Muzaffarpur. We are establishing a separate ICU to tackle a situation.

He will monitor the efforts being made to check the loss of lives.\n\nA very high death rate of around 26 per cent has made AES more alarming, and the doctors are keeping their fingers crossed. What makes it worse is that the reasons behind the syndrome are yet unknown.\n\n\"We are doing our best and praying for rains to lash Muzaffarpur. So far, there have been no rains here. Past experience shows AES incidence declines rapidly once the monsoon rains start,\" said Bhushan.\n\nMeanwhile, T Jacob John, an expert from Christian Medical College, Vellore in Tamil Nadu said the major reason behind the spread of the disease is malnutrition and unhygienic conditions. \"The blood glucose level of the affected kids has been found to be very low, and we are trying to find out whether it is due to some virus or toxins particular to the heat and humid weather prevalent in these parts during this season,\" said John.\n\nThe symptoms vary from high fever, body ache, stiffness of limbs to meningitis and coma.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 22 Jun 2014\nSource: The Health Site [edited]\nhttp://www.thehealthsite.com/news/us-based-atlanta-institute-may-help-solve-bihar-mystery-disease-harsh-vardhan/\n\n\nThe Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said today [22 Jun 2014] that Atlanta-based CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) will be requested to help in the Bihar encephalitis case. They are requested to test the blood samples of children affected by AES (acute encephalitis syndrome), which has taken the death toll to 130 in Bihar. Mr Vardhan told reporters: \"This encephalitis disease in Bihar is still a mystery to be solved. We are unaware about the exact cause of the disease. I will request the world-famous CDC institute based in Atlanta to test the blood samples of the infected children and find out the reasons behind it. Our Indian scientists are also working on the samples to come out with the cause of the disease.\"\n\n\"The Union government will provide all help to Bihar to tackle the acute encephalitis syndrome. A 2-day special immunisation programme will be conducted on 22 and 23 Jun 2014 in the affected districts [immunization against what? The etiology of this disease has not been determined. - Mod.TY] If malnutrition is a reason, it will also be removed,\" Vardhan said. A majority of children who died of AES were from Muzaffarpur, East Champaran, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Vaishali and Bhagalpur districts. Cases were also recorded in Samastipur, Begusarai and Khagaria districts.\n\nIn the absence of the identification of virus, bacteria or agents causing the deadly disease, having a death rate of 26 per cent, doctors at their best could provide only symptomatic treatment to patients. The symptoms varied from high fever, body ache, stiffness of limbs to meningitis and coma. Usually, the syndrome affected malnourished children with very low sugar levels and plummeting levels of electrolyte in the body.\n\nEncephalitis is a disease that results in inflammation of the brain. The patient's central nervous system is affected. While the lesser symptoms include headaches and fevers, the more severe ones cause the onset of mental issues like seizures, confusion, disorientation, tremors and hallucinations. It can be caused due to bacterial or viral infections of the brain, injection of toxic substances, or increased complications of an infectious disease.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of fatal encephalitis cases reported continues to climb. On 18 Jun 2014, the count was 107 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140619.25) and now has climbed to 124 just 2 days later, as reported in [1] above and then to 130 mentioned in [2], another 2 days later. The nature of the vaccination campaign in report [2] is not mentioned but most likely is for Japanese encephalitis. However, Dr Jacob John dismisses JEV etiology in these early season AES cases (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140615.2540893). He pointed out that the outbreaks in the Muzaffarpur district in Bihar state, annually recurrent, are quite different from many other outbreaks of JEV in various parts of India, including some parts of Bihar. He noted that JEV has a post-monsoon seasonality, obviously due to increase in _Culex_ mosquitoes that are vectors of JEV. Muzaffarpur outbreaks are during May-June (with some in April and some in July), and with onset of monsoon rains, the outbreak stops. The clinical and laboratory parameters of these cases in Bihar are not like encephalitis, rather, are typical of encephalopathy. It is not clear from the report [2] above whether the CDC will just test blood samples sent from India or whether CDC clinical team members will be involved in the field in Bihar as well, collaborating with Indian colleagues. Close collaboration between clinical staff attending affected patients and those providing laboratory support will be essential to arrive at a diagnosis.\n\nMaps showing the location of Bihar State can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/364. - Mod.TY\n\nThe low blood glucose levels suggest Reye's syndrome. This syndrome occurs in children who have been given aspirin when they have a viral illness, most commonly chickenpox or influenza. Infections with other viruses, such as parainfluenza, adenovirus, or enteroviruses are less commonly associated. Patients develop an acute encephalopathy and fatty liver and present with vomiting and altered mental status. Reye's syndrome or Reye-like syndrome has also been associated with exposure to other drugs or toxins. Blood ammonia levels are high, as are levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The mortality rate can be as high as 50 percent. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) 20140619.2553037\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20140616.2544699\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) 20140615.2540893\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20140613.2536936\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR,UP) 20140611.2532425\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20140609.2527999\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20140508.2459977\n.................................................sb/mpp/ty/msp/ml/mj/jw", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2553037", "archive_id": 2553037, "date": "2014-06-19 20:12:30", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (07): (BIHAR)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 18 Jun 2014\nSource: NDTV [edited]\nhttp://www.ndtv.com/article/india/encephalitis-spreads-in-bihar-107-children-dead-in-two-months-543759\n\n\nThe suspected encephalitis death toll in Bihar [State]'s Muzaffarpur district is increasing by the day, and according to the latest report, 107 children have died in the last 2 months.\n\nNow, the outbreak is spreading to some of the adjoining districts.

The season: JE has a post-monsoon seasonality, obviously due to increase in _Culex_ mosquitoes -- Muzaffarpur outbreaks are during May-June (with some in April and some in July), and with onset of monsoon rains the outbreak stops.\n\n(2). The clinical illness: The clinical and laboratory parameters are not like encephalitis (ICD 10 A 86), but typical of encephalopathy. Onset is sudden, without any prodromal phase, typically in the early morning hours. Till previous evening the child [has been] well. Cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] is clear with no increase in cell count. Low CSF sugar and low blood sugar are documented in some 40 per cent of children. Thus, the diagnosis is acute encephalopathy (ICD 10 G 92 and 93). The cause is non-infectious.\n\nThe reason, I believe, why earlier investigators (and there were several teams of experts, including from CDC, who had investigated this problem over a few or even many years) missed this clear distinction was that Japanese encephalitis occurs typically in recurrent seasonal outbreaks, and any acute brain disease occurring in annual seasonal outbreaks are taken for granted as some encephalitis. Once you diagnose encephalitis, the direction of investigation is to take clinical samples and look for viruses.\n\nThose who have not kept up with the literature over the decades may not be aware of the many reports of outbreaks of acute encephalopathy in India (Jamshedpur fever; Nagpur encephalopathy; Reye syndrome outbreak, hepatomyoencephalopathy) and in Thailand (Udorn encephalopathy). So, acute encephalopathy can occur in outbreaks; when outbreaks occur in annual seasonal recurrent fashion, there has to be some factor(s) with repetitive behavior, triggering or actually causing the disease in clusters. Epidemiological puritans can argue if non-infectious encephalopathy outbreaks are truly outbreaks or merely clusters.\n\n(3). Muzaffarpur is famous for lychee [litchi] orchards. May and June are lychee harvest season. The strong spatial and temporal association of the outbreaks with lychee harvesting have been noticed by all previous investigators, but they did not pursue the association in depth. Similar lychee-harvest-associated acute encephalopathy outbreaks have been recently reported in Bangladesh and Viet Nam. In Bangladesh the diagnosis was encephalopathy -- hence pesticides were considered the noxious agent. In Viet Nam, lychee-associated viruses were explored. Even in Muzaffarpur, fruit-eating bats have been noted, and some investigators proposed some bat viruses.\n\nMalda in West Bengal is another lychee cultivating region in India, and this year [2014], a similar outbreak has been reported in the media (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Litchi-virus-kills-8-kids-in-Malda/articleshow/36225598.cms).\n\n(4). The Jamaican vomiting disease (acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy) is triggered by eating unripe ackee fruit [_Blighia sapida_], which contains a toxin called hypoglycin A (Methylenecyclopropylalanine, MCPA). Ackee and lychee belong to one family, namely soapberry (_Sapindaceae_). Lychee seeds have been shown to have a lower analogue of MCPA, namely methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG). In animal experiments, both MCPA and MCPG interfere with fatty acid oxidation, in mitochondria, thus causing acute encephalopathy like in Jamaican vomiting disease.\n\nWe all know lychee is a safe and enjoyably edible fruit, very popular. Eating lychee cannot simply be blamed for the Muzaffarpur (or the Bangladesh and Viet Nam) outbreaks. Yet, the presence of MCPG in lychee seeds must be pursued -- my investigation this year [2014] was aimed at investigating cases for \"metabolic fatty acid derangement\" and lychee seeds and fruits for MCPG or associated substances. Unfortunately, I was given some colleagues who interfered with funding for the studies, and thus I lost the opportunity to complete the investigations this season. Just 4 days ago, I received word that funding may be back on track, but that is too late for this year.\n\nThe pathogenesis appears to be blocked gluconeogenesis -- why children go into gluconeogenesis has to be investigated -- most victims are undernourished, and probably liver glycogen-depleted. So perhaps their glycogenolysis is inadequate to supply brain cells with energy source, namely glucose. Therefore, gluconeogenesis is necessary, but some toxin blocks the pathway -- like in any fatty acid metabolic derangement syndrome (usually of genetic origin). These are all hypothetical, to explain what we have observed. Organic acidemia and aciduria would have confirmed the diagnosis, but this year I did not have funds to pursue this.\n\nIn summary, the Muzaffarpur (and Malda in India, Bangladesh and Viet Nam) seasonal brain disease outbreaks in children are a peculiar acute encephalopathy, non-infectious in origin, probably predisposed by undernutrition and somehow associated with either lychee seed swallowing, or some such unknown link, to be investigated next year. Please be sure I am not giving lychee a bad name; please eat lychee to your hearts' content, for lychee is a great and safe fruit.\n\nI am attaching a recent hypothesis note published in: John TJ, Das M. Acute encephalitis syndrome in children in Muzaffarpur: hypothesis of toxic origin. Current Science, 2014; 106: 1184-1185 (10 May 2014).\n\n--\nT Jacob John\n<tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>\n\n******\n[2] Litchi fruit NOT\nDate: Thu 12 Jun 2014\nSource: The Indian Express [edited]\nhttp://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/no-link-between-litchi-aes-say-experts/\n\n\nExperts looking into the annual outbreak of a disease in parts of Gorakhpur [district] in Uttar Pradesh [state] and Muzaffarpur [district] in Bihar [state], which has claimed the lives of many children, have told The Indian Express that it has nothing to do with the cultivation of litchi [lychee]. The disease, for the 1st time, has also led to the deaths of children in Malda district of West Bengal [state] this year [2014].\n\nIn the absence of any known pathogen or infectious agent, the symptoms are described as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Since those affected reside close to litchi plantations, it has been loosely described as \"litchi syndrome\" as well. Some experts feel that the children are affected by colouring agents and insecticides used on the fruit crop. However, no connection has been established.\n\nMeanwhile, West Bengal's minister of state for health, Chandrima Bhattacharya, said on Wednesday that children should not eat green litchi. \"It contains toxins, which reduces the blood sugar level as well as glucose in the body, leading to the infection, particularly in children,\" she was quoted as saying in the Assembly.\n\nDr Vishal Nath, the director of Muzaffarpur-based National Centre for Litchi under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), said, \"We have been working on investigating a correlation between litchi and the AES cases for years, and have performed hundreds of toxicology studies. Last year [2013], we had a team of experts from the Centre for Disease Control in the US, and the National Centre for Disease Control in Delhi. Even this year [2014] we have doctors from the field conducting tests everyday...we have established zero association between the 2. It is ridiculous to still call the disease a litchi syndrome or associate it with the fruit in any way.\"\n\nNath pointed out that while the crop begins to bear fruit in the 1st week of May, the AES cases start surfacing a month later in June, when 90 per cent of the crop has been \"picked, sold and disposed of.\"\n\n\"Our research teams have also busted the theory that children who contract the disease may have eaten the fruit [that had] fallen from trees, which may have been touched by rats or bats. Zoologists and toxicologists from multiple agencies have conducted tests and found no toxins in the bodies of diagnosed children or on fruit samples,\" Nath explained.\n\nExperts say a history of a similar AES outbreak in Siliguri [West Bengal state] in 1996, which was traced to imported raspberry, might be behind this litchi theory.\n\nExperts at the ICMR's [Indian Council of Medical Research] Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), Patna, who have been trying to identify a cause for the outbreaks in Muzaffarpur, said no known cause of the disease was identified yet. \"We do not know if there is a pathogen or any environmental factors or infectious agents behind the disease. AES is a term for a broad spectrum of diseases which have encephalitis-like syndrome, including fever convulsions and high mortality, but we do not know what the disease is exactly,\" Dr Pradip Das, director of RMRI, said.\n\nIn-charge of National Centre for Disease Control, Patna, Dr Ram Singh, said tests performed by their scientists and CDC in the US last year [2013] had \"shown no association with litchi, or helped us identify any cause of the disease.\"\n\nGorakhpur witnesses JE [Japanese encephalitis virus infections] and AES cases associated with water-borne factors every year. Due to similarities in symptoms, children in Muzaffarpur were 1st tested for JE. Dr G K Thakur, medical superintendent of the Sri Krishna Medical College in Muzaffarpur, one of the 2 hospitals where children are treated, said all diagnosed cases have tested negative for JE. \"If you take the history of the patients, not all have eaten the fruit. Children less than a year old cannot walk around and eat fruits lying around trees. We treat children with anti-convulsant and fever-controlling drugs,\" Thakur said.\n\nDoctors of SKMC [Sri Krishna Medical College] published an article in July [2013] in the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Public Health saying that high temperatures and humidity could be leading to heat strokes, which may be contributing to the AES-like symptoms.\n\nThe experts' views came a day after Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan called an emergency meeting Tuesday [10 Jun 2014] on AES. The ministry announced a JE immunisation campaign on 22-23 Jun [2014] in UP [Uttar Pradesh] and Bihar [states] as a precautionary measure. Harsh Vardhan said there was a need to conduct more research on the still unexplained nature of the disease and set up a National Virology Centre in Muzaffarpur.\n\n[byline: Pritha Chatterjee]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Litchi has been associated with cases of AES for several years.

The disease has acquired the proportions of an epidemic, and has become an annual affair, with poor children being the most vulnerable among the target groups. No treatment is available so far -- a scary prospect by all standards.\n\nDoctors attending to the patients in the hospital's intensive care still don't know why this disease has been striking Muzaffarpur and adjoining areas for over 2 decades now. So far this year [2014], there have been 38 deaths because of suspected encephalitis. In 2013, there were 62 casualties reported from Muzaffarpur and adjoining districts.\n\nGorakhpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh [UP], too, has been in the grip of encephalitis. In spite of the best efforts of the government of India and international research organisations, no cause or cure for the disease have been found yet.\n\nDr Gyan Bhushan, civil surgeon of Muzaffarpur, says, \"I have been in the field for 3 years. It seems that heat, and, particularly, humidity have a large role to play. When humidity levels go up, these children seem to develop severe glucose deficiency.''\n\nUnion health minister Harsh Vardhan, after chairing a meeting on encephalitis in the capital today [10 Jun 2014], announced a series of measures to tackle the dreaded disease, including a 5-year action plan similar to the pulse polio eradication campaign, a dedicated ward for encephalitis in Muzaffarpur and dedicated surveillance systems to track its outbreak. \"I have instructed officials of Bihar and UP to take it up like an emergency. Giving 100 per cent immunisation coverage to a few districts in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh is also a must,'' he told reporters later. [Immunization for what? For Japanese encephalitis virus?

It is curious that the union health minister Harsh Vardhan states that dealing with the outbreak will be handled as an emergency and that a 5-year action plan will be formulated, yet no mention is made of the USA-Indian medical team being put together, led by Jacob John, to determine the etiology (etiologies) of these encephalitis cases. Also, Dr Gyan Bhushan, civil surgeon of Muzaffarpur's comments concerning heat and humidity mentioned above are interesting, given that a published report proposed that heat stroke was responsible for, or contributed to, these cases. Doctors at the Sri Krishna Medical College (SKMC) in Muzaffarpur, which has treated the 2nd highest number of cases in 2013, published 2 articles -- notably the only peer-reviewed medical publications from the area so far -- saying that high temperatures and peak humidity could be leading to heat strokes, which if untreated for long periods may be contributing to the exaggerated symptoms (see ProMED-mail archive no 20130923.1963903).\n\nMaps showing the location of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/364. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20140609.2527999\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20140508.2459977\n2013\n---\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (BR) 20131231.2145305\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20140508.2459977\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (UP) 20131227.2138369\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP) 20131031.2032666\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (UP) comment, RFI 20131011.1995836\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (UP) 20131009.1992629\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20130929.1973911\nUndiagnosed illness, children - India (02): (BR) RFI 20130923.1963903\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (UP) 20130923.1963818\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (KL) 20130827.1904591\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (UP) 20130825.1900553\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13) 20130821.1892929\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20130731.1856438\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20130723.1839559\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (BR) 20130714.1824758\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20130628.1798059\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20130616.1776275\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) RFI 20130610.1764062\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20130601.1748963\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (AS) 20130514.1713488\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20130511.1706357\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20130501.1683457\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP, BR) 20130411.1638769\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20130402.1615081\n.................................................sb/sh/ty/mj/sh", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2527999", "archive_id": 2527999, "date": "2014-06-09 19:39:55", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (02): (BIHAR)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 6 Jun 2014\nSource: Gulf News [edited]\nhttp://gulfnews.com/news/world/india/mystery-disease-kills-20-children-in-bihar-1.1343825\n\n\nA mystery disease has broken out in Bihar, claiming the lives of 20 children in one week. All the deaths were reported from Muzaffarpur and the neighbouring districts of the state.\n\nThe disease, which some claim to be encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, or acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), has claimed over 1000 lives of children in the past 15 years in Bihar, but no one has been able to find out its real reason despite several studies. The disease strikes generally the northern parts of the state every year once the mercury soars but ends the moment rains starts. The symptoms of the disease include high fever, irritation, and swelling of brains.\n\n\"The disease has not been diagnosed yet,\" Bihar's health secretary Deepak Kumar told the media on Friday [6 Jun 2014], adding the government of India had roped in a medical team from United States to investigate the cause of infection. \"Dr Jacob John is leading the combined India-US team to diagnose the ailments. Samples of the infected children are being collected for examination in viral laboratories located in both the countries,\" the heath secretary said.\n\nWhat has worried experts more is that infection has spread in a virulent form this time as the survival rate of the victims looks low. Alarmed at the situation, then health authorities held an emergency meeting [in Patna, Bihar] on Thursday evening [5 Jun 2014] at which it was decided to send a high-level team of health experts to Muzaffarpur where the victims have been admitted at various hospitals for treatment.\n\nStrangely, the health experts are still to identify the disease despite spate of studies, causing strong resentment and frustration among the victims' families. The scene is quite touching at the hospitals in Muzaffarpur districts where continual wailing by victim family members moves every visitor to pity.\n\nEvery year, the government claims to have taken preventive measures to check recurrence of the disease but this ultimately turns out to be an empty promise. \"The disease struck this time despite preventive measures launched by us. We had already alerted the doctors and supplied sufficient medicines to the health centres, yet the disease goes unchecked,\" Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Gyan Bhushan said.\n\nThe seriousness of the entire situation is underlined from the fact the mystery disease has claimed more than 1000 lives in the past [15 years]. However in the last 4 years, it has turned out to be quite deadlier.\n\n[Byline: Lata Rani]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A 7 May 2014 report of a recent study from Odisha and Jharkhand states (ProMED-mail archive no 20140508.2459977) indicated that cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) were caused by infections with viruses of dengue and measles. However, this study indicated that although herpes simplex virus (HSV) was a dominant agent for acute encephalitis, in some cases the viral agents were those of dengue and measles. Over 16 per cent of cases were found to be caused by viral agents identified to be either HSV I or II while another 2.6 per cent of cases were due to measles virus infections. Similarly, Japanese encephalitis virus caused 1.5 per cent of cases, followed by 0.57 per cent by dengue virus. This still leaves nearly 80 per cent of the cases without a diagnosis.\n\nPast reports have implicated Japanese encephalitis virus as responsible for some or all cases but also related cases to polluted water implying enteroviruses, or making a case for heat stroke. The results above indicate that herpes simplex virus (HSV) should be included in the battery of laboratory tests done to diagnose AES illnesses.\n\nIt is of considerable interest to learn that a joint India-USA medical team will be investigating these cases of encephalitis. The team will be headed by Dr Jacob John, a distinguished Indian medical virologist. One hopes that after decades of speculation and incomplete data, the team will finally come up with an identification of the etiological agent(s) involved in these ongoing, unfortunate cases.\n\nThe 9 June 2014 edition of the Delhi Daily News (http://www.delhidailynews.com/news/Protests-in-Bihar-as-encephalitis-death-toll-reaches-25-1402308211/) stated that the death toll is now up to 25 children.\n\nMaps showing the location of Behar state can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/364; and of Muzaffarpur district at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzaffarpur_district. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20140508.2459977\n2013\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (BR) 20131231.2145305\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20140508.2459977\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (UP) 20131227.2138369\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP) 20131031.2032666\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (UP) comment, RFI 20131011.1995836\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (UP) 20131009.1992629\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20130929.1973911\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (UP) 20130923.1963818\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (KL) 20130827.1904591\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (UP) 20130825.1900553\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13) 20130821.1892929\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20130731.1856438\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20130723.1839559\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (BR) 20130714.1824758\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20130628.1798059\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20130616.1776275\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) RFI 20130610.1764062\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20130601.1748963\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (AS) 20130514.1713488\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20130511.1706357\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20130501.1683457\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP, BR) 20130411.1638769\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20130402.1615081\n.................................................sb/dk/ty/mj/dk", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2459977", "archive_id": 2459977, "date": "2014-05-08 20:59:32", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 7 May 2014\nSource: The New Indian Express [edited]\nhttp://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/Dengue-and-Measles-Virus-Can-Cause-Encephalitis--Study/2014/05/07/article2210604.ece\n\n\nAcute encephalitis in eastern states such as Odisha and Jharkhand is caused by viruses of dengue and measles too, a latest study has revealed.\n\nThe study, which was recently published in the Epidemiology and Infection Journal, has showed that though herpes simplex virus (HSV) was a dominant agent for acute encephalitis, in some cases the viral agents were that of dengue and measles.\n\nOver 16 per cent cases were found to be caused by viral agents identified to be either HSV I or II while another 2.6 per cent cases were by measles. Similarly, Japanese encephalitis virus caused 1.5 per cent cases, followed by 0.57 per cent by dengue virus.\n\nThe study was conducted on patients admitted to major tertiary-care referral hospitals in Odisha which cater to patients from Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. The subjects of the study were drawn from SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack; Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Post Graduate Institute of Paediatrics, Cuttack; Capital Hospital, Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, Kalinga Hospital, Sum Hospital and High Tech Medical College and Hospital of Bhubaneswar between April 2011 and July 2012.\n\nExperts from Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) and School of Biotechnology of KIIT University carried out the survey, the outcome of which is expected to throw more light on viral aetiology of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). This is the 1st time that such a study has been conducted and dominance of HSV will be useful in defining the plans of public health system, Director of RMRC Dr SK Kar said.\n\nIn majority of the instances, children were found to have been the victims. At least 12.1 per cent were in the age group of 1 month-5 years, while another 13.4 per cent identified with acute encephalitis were in 6-10 years age bracket. A whopping 55 per cent positive cases were children in 11-15 years age group.\n\nThe fatality rate among the cases caused by viral agents was significantly higher than those caused by non-viral sources. The study showed that close to 11 per cent cases were caused by viral agents against 6.2 per cent for non-viral.\n\nOf the 526 cases which were studied, 37 patients (7 per cent) died during their stay in hospitals. Of them, 10 patients had viral agents. The average gap between hospital admission and death was barely 6 days. The research team also conducted a 6-month post-release follow-up on 489 patients who were discharged from the hospitals and found that 82 per cent of them recovered fully while the rest suffered from illness. Some of them died while others faced neurological disabilities.\n\nThis is the 1st report which shows HSV as the dominant viral agent for AES in India. At least 7 cases had the deadly Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as the agent and patients mostly belonged to 5 coastal districts of the state [Odisha]. Most cases were reported during the post monsoon periods.\n\nThe study team included Dr SK Rathore of School of Biotechnology, KIIT University and Bhagirathi Dwibedi, Dr SK Kar, J Sabat and M Panda of RMRC.\n\nThe Findings:\n- Most patients afflicted by Japanese encephalitis virus belonged to 5 coastal districts of the state [Odisha]\n- In majority of the instances, children were found to have been the victims\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report provides evidence for yet another etiological agent as the cause of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).

Each year, there are hundreds of encephalitis cases in the area of Uttar Pradesh and neighboring Bihar state. In past reports, the disease has been associated with Japanese encephalitis virus infections and with consumption of contaminated water, suggesting enterovirus infections.

A number of years ago an acute encephalopathy syndrome was endemic in many tropical countries. In India it was referred to as \"Jamshedphur fever\" (Br med J 1955: 2: 1298-308) with subsequent reports noting its similarity to Reye syndrome -- a syndrome of acute cerebral edema with microvesicular fat deposits in the viscera (Indian J Med Res 1969: 57: 1865-71; Clin Pediatr 1972; 11: 128-30). Similar syndromes were noted in Indonesia, Brazil, and East Africa.\n\nIn the province of Udorn, northeastern Thailand, of 3000 children admitted to the provincial hospital during 1969, we observed at least 83 children with the clinical features of acute encephalopathy (Pediatrics 1971; 47: 707-16). 46 died, all within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms. The disease was characterized by the sudden onset of fever, vomiting, and headaches progressing to seizures and coma. Almost all children were less than 6 years of age and the majority of cases occurred during the late rainy season (August to October). This area is also endemic for JEV and without autopsy and laboratory data it would have been easy to confuse this syndrome with acute infection.\n\nThe histopathologic features from autopsies conducted on 40 children has been reported (Amer J Clin Path 1971; 56: 558-71) and were characterized by those findings associated with acute Reye syndrome. The latter report also details the evidence pointing to acute aflatoxin poisoning as the etiology of the condition in Udorn.\n\nSubsequent private communication indicated to me that by the 1980s \"Udorn encephalopathy\" had disappeared from northeastern Thailand, for unknown reasons. It would be of interest to learn what the subsequent experience in India was with Jamshedphur fever, if known. In any event, the syndrome being reported as AES in India is not inconsistent with an acute encephalopathy and should be explored for this possibility.\n\nFinally, note is made of a syndrome reported from Viet Nam referred to as \"Litchi-associated\" encephalitis (Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18: 1817-24). It is described as a seasonal, acute syndrome in children during the rainy season with a 25 per cent mortality and cerebral edema as an important component. It would be of obvious interest to know whether autopsy data have found changes consistent with those of Reye syndrome.\n\n--\nLloyd C Olson, MD (retired)\nThe Children's Mercy Hospital\nKansas City Missouri\nUSA\n<lolson@cmh.edu>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Olson for his comments and suggestions. Clearly, the list of possible etiological agents and factors for cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) should be expanded.\n\nProMED-mail would appreciate the response to Dr Olson's question -- what has been the experience in India with Jamshedphur fever?

Doctors say affected patients come from between 10 and 12 districts in the region, and are mostly the rural poor. The disease usually occurs during the monsoon season in Gorakhpur and adjoining areas and children are the worst affected.\n\nMore than 200 patients are still being treated at government hospitals.\n\nAt least 6500 children have died of encephalitis in the region since the 1st case was detected in 1978.\n\nGorakhpur and adjoining districts, which border Nepal in the foothills of the Himalayas, are low-lying and prone to floods, providing a breeding ground for mosquitoes which commonly transmit the virus.\n\nUntil 2005, doctors say that the majority of deaths were caused by Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus. But in the past 7 years, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear.\n\nThe diseases cause headaches and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunction, seizure, and inflammation of the heart and kidney.\n\nDoctors say children between the age of 6 months and 15 years are the worst affected. A 5th of the children who survive have to live with neurological weaknesses, doctors say.\n\nThe government says it has tried to check the regular outbreak of encephalitis in the region. Last week [week of 1 Oct 2013], India launched a vaccine [campaign] against Japanese encephalitis as part of a national programme to fight the virus.\n\n\"Beginning with the 1st report in 1955 in Tamil Nadu state, the Japanese encephalitis virus has now spread to more than 171 districts in 19 states,\" Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said at the launch of the vaccine. In 2005, a virulent outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur killed 1000 people, mostly children.

The 1st shot, given in August 2010, was part of the child's immunization schedule, the 2nd in December of that year, in a massive campaign across Uttar Pradesh and parts of Bihar to ensure the vaccine reached all \"left out\" children. The boy was admitted [in 2013] to the Nehru Hospital in BRD Medical College, where he died the next day.\n\nThe boy was one of the 5 confirmed JE cases in Gorakhpur this year [2013]. The adjoining districts saw another 20 cases. Besides one deceased girl whose family had persistently refused vaccination, all the dead children had been given the protective shots.\n\nSince 1 Jan [2013], over 1000 children have been admitted to the hospital, and 258 have died with the same classic symptoms -- high fever, convulsions, altered senses, rigidity in the limbs and nausea -- now associated with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Only 61 of these children were found to be JE positive.\n\nA total of 226 admissions and 59 deaths have been from Gorakhpur, and 248 cases and 43 deaths from Kushinagar. These have been the 2 worst affected districts this year [2013]. In all of this, Gorakhpur has seen 5 JE cases and Kushinagar 8.\n\nUntil the mid-2000s, it was JE that was considered the annual mysterious killer of children and early teens in the Purvanchal belt of eastern UP and Bihar. Now, a decade later, it has been crossed off as a \"minority disease\" by scientists. The doubts over JE, which started arising [in] 2006 and saw some vindication in 2009, have been confirmed \"to a great extent\" now.\n\nOf 1000 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from children admitted between April and December last year [2012] to Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College, 100 isolates for organisms called enteroviruses (EV) -- specifically the human EV 89 and EV 76 types -- have been identified by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) field station in Gorakhpur. A 10 per cent positivity is considered a huge success for CSF samples. These viruses spread through contaminated water and can cause symptoms similar to JE and are covered under the umbrella of diseases that constitute AES. The JE virus, which causes similar symptoms and is also included under the category of AES diseases, has a completely different route of transmission: it is hosted in pigs, water birds and other livestock and is carried to humans by mosquitoes.\n\nThese findings have been heartening for scientists who were initially reluctant to accept the EV theory due to contradictory results between rectal swabs and CSF samples -- considered the more direct evidence of brain tissue -- until 2011. From 2008-11, while rectal swab samples showed a 15-44 per cent positivity for EVs, CSF samples from the same patients showed positivity rates of between 1.8 per cent and 2.3 per cent.\n\nDr Milind Gore, director of NIV Gorakhpur, who has headed the station's activities since 2006, said: \"There were initial doubts that the virus strands which we were identifying in the rectal swabs were not traversing to the brain tissue, since we could not collate them in the CSF samples. To counter this theory, in 2012, we only tested for CSF samples and put them through rigorous testing, and we have managed to identify 100 isolates of enteroviruses. For us, it's a huge boost, since it's coming from hard primary evidence.\"\n\nThe 1st doubts about JE started after deaths continued despite exhaustive mass immunization campaigns, and lab results provided no concrete answers. In 2006, despite JE vaccinations, 700-800 seizures were reported, and over 150 children died. Most of these children had received JE vaccination. The mystery remains to be fully explained.\n\nThis year [2013], 6 per cent of cases are JE positive, and about 10-15 per cent EV, which leaves the vast majority of cases still undiagnosed. \"We are trying to identify the causative agents in all samples, but there are other factors that need to be considered. The causative agent is the most active in the CSF samples only within the 1st 2-3 days of onset. A majority of children are coming to us late, and hence we are losing out on identifying the pathogens there,\" said Dr K P Kushwaha, principal and head of the department of paediatrics at BRD Medical College.\n\nUnlike bacteria, viruses need active cell lines to multiply for scientists to examine them. \"Earlier, we were using only one such cell line; now we are hoping that more viruses will multiply in our laboratories. We have identified isolated cases of measles and herpes viruses but not in considerable numbers. We are trying to lay our hands on something more, but so far, we have not been successful,\" Dr Gore said. He adds that even in the best diagnosed international outbreak situations, only about 50 per cent of cases are actually diagnosed. \"Considering that, we can say EVs have solved at least some of the mystery, though not all of it.\"\n\nAs scientists and doctors struggle to get a handle on the 3-decade-old disease, many complain that the clinical and administrative management of the outbreaks remain flawed.\n\nIn Gorakhpur, the hub of the management of the disease, representatives of the only medical college in the area and district authorities cannot agree on several things.\n\nThe hundreds of AES cases that are finding their way into government records are coming only from the one medical college and district hospitals in the area. The disease is still to be officially declared a notifiable disease like other common viral diseases like dengue, where every case has to be reported.\n\nSaid Dr Kushwaha: \"All the patients who are coming to us are referrals from private hospitals, and by the time they are coming here, they are already so critical that in the majority of the cases, it is too late for us to do anything. Why can't private hospitals report these cases early?\" He said this year [2013], only 10 per cent of patients are direct entrants, the rest being referrals from private centres. \"The government is losing out on precious data due to this mismanagement.\"\n\nBut district health authorities say there is no monitoring of medical college treatment records, and inflated figures are presented, the definition of AES itself being flawed.\n\nCMO [Chief Medical Officer] of Gorakhpur Dr M P Singh said, \"The unwritten protocol the medical college seems to be following is that any patient who comes with the symptoms of fever, nausea and altered sensorium is declared AES, without waiting for laboratory results. Later, if any of these patients tests positive for malaria, typhoid or meningitis, the case records are not changed. They just put it down as AES with any of these other diseases. This is an absurd situation, where eventually you are diagnosing the disease, but still declaring it as AES.\"\n\nDr Singh said that last year [2012], of the 8 cases that the medical college declared JE positive, repeat tests on 6 showed only 3 to be actually positive. Cases are being reported round the year; 18 cases came in April [2013], many of them children under the age of one year. \"How can a child below the age of one have AES which they say is from EVs? A child that young only has mother's milk, so what is the source of contaminated water,\" he asked. He said district health authorities had, after \"umpteen reminders,\" managed to access treatment records of deceased patients this year [2013] and were studying them.\n\n[Byline: Pritha Chatterjee]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The cases of AES continue to be puzzling. The above report indicates that only a small proportion are due to JEV infections. The occurrence of JEV infections in previously vaccinated children may be due to a decline in protective immunity in individuals who received killed virus vaccine in the more distant past or lack of vaccine potency.\n\nThe report does not indicate whether the vaccine was killed or the live attenuated one that would provide longer protection. The massive JEV vaccination campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Behar states has resulted in a significant reduction in cases due to infection with that virus. As implied in many reports in recent years, apparently, many of the AES cases are due to enterovirus infection. Detection of theses viruses in CSF is more convincing evidence of etiological cause than isolation only from rectal swabs, which may indicate intestinal infections without invasion of the CNS.\n\nThe cause of the majority of the AES cases remains undiagnosed, and one hopes that the scientists involved in attempting to determine the etiologies of these undiagnosed cases will continue to find out what is going on so that scientifically sound preventive measures may be devised and implemented. Although JEV outbreaks may continue to be prevented through vaccination, preventing enterovirus infections, in the absence of vaccines, requires improvement of sanitation infrastructure to assure adequate human waste disposal and uncontaminated potable water supplies, a very costly effort.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of India showing the location of Uttar Pradesh state can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/3h8J. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (KL) 20130827.1904591\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (UP) 20130825.1900553\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13) 20130821.1892929\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20130731.1856438\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20130723.1839559\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (BR) 20130714.1824758\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20130628.1798059\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20130616.1776275\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) RFI 20130610.1764062\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20130601.1748963\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (AS) 20130514.1713488\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20130511.1706357\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20130501.1683457\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP, BR) 20130411.1638769\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20130402.1615081\n.................................................sb/jw/ty/msp/jw", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1904591", "archive_id": 1904591, "date": "2013-08-27 09:53:51", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (KL)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER- INDIA (15): (KERALA)\n***************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 26 Aug 2013\nSource: The Hindu [edited]\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/je-west-nile-turning-killers/article5060340.ece\n\n\nA serious threat of Japanese encephalitis (JE) or West Nile (WN) virus outbreak looms large over Alappuzha district [Kerala state], which is prone to water stagnation and consequent mosquito menace post-monsoon.\n\nThe National Institute of Virology (NIV) Alappuzha unit reported to the district health administration in the beginning of July [2013] that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 28 patients with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) -- all dead -- had tested positive for the JE-WN complex. But the State Health authorities had been unaware of this till the end of July 2013, when a Central team of public health officials, led by Kalpana Barua, visited the State. Public experts have sounded the alert already, as a significant number of AES cases reported in the district in May-July [2013] have tested positive for the JE-WN complex.\n\nStrange enough, the district health administration had maintained that these 28 deaths could not be considered \"cases\" of JE-WN complex because the clinical symptoms of the patients did not meet the classic definition of AES.\n\nAccording to them, the district had only about 30-plus cases of AES since May [2013], leading to 4 deaths, which had been reported to the State health administration.\n\nSenior health officials have pointed out that regardless of whether the 28 persons died from JE-WN or not, the laboratory findings about the presence of the twin infections in so many persons have huge public health significance, which cannot be ignored.\n\n\"Alappuzha district has been endemic to JE, WN, dengue, and other mosquito-borne diseases for long. In the past 2-3 years, we have had many cases of encephalitis, most of which could be either JE or WN because it is difficult to distinguish using clinical symptoms or lab diagnosis. Both cause serious neurological diseases and leave the patients with severe 'sequelae,' including cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, or epileptic episodes. The seriousness of the situation cannot be diluted,\" B Padmakumar, Additional Professor of Medicine, Government Medical College, Alappuzha, says.\n\nThe JE and WN viruses belong to the same family of flaviviruses and are zoonotic infections maintained in a cycle involving migratory birds, mammals such as pigs and horses, and the _Culex_ species of mosquitoes, which breed in stagnant water. JE was first reported in Alappuzha in 1996, and till 1999, there have been major outbreaks.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, very few confirmed cases of JE were reported from Alappuzha, which the Health Department admits was probably because of the problems in properly diagnosing and confirming the disease. All cases involving high fever, convulsions, and altered sensorium were reported by the health system as AES.\n\n\"Both JE and WN are antigenically similar (viral antigen properties are similar) and complex genotyping is required to distinguish either. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) testing of CSF samples of an encephalitis patient gives only the confirmation as JE-WN or any other flavivirus. Virus neutralisation assay is required to differentiate between JE or WN, which could be time-consuming,\" says B Anukumar, scientist in-charge of the NIV wing at Alappuzha.\n\nFrom the public health point of view, it is important that JE and WN surveillance is started in all districts and steps to contain it are intensified, Dr Anukumar says. JE mostly affects children less than 15 years, while WN usually affects older adults. In 2006, during the major chikungunya [virus] epidemic in Alappuzha, some scientists had raised the possibility of the co-circulation of WN virus because of the high rate of mortality during the epidemic.\n\nHowever, NIV gave conclusive evidence about the major presence of WN virus in the region in 2011 during an AES outbreak when 208 cases were reported.\n\nThe district health administration has pointed out that the 28 patients who died from JE-WN, as reported by the NIV, were all elderly persons with various co-morbidities and that they did not have any AES symptoms. \"Lab findings should have clinical correlation also. These persons are living in an endemic area where various flaviviruses are in circulation. It is possible that they were infected by JE-WN viruses, which came up in the lab diagnosis. It does not mean that those persons died of JE or WN,\" a senior official in Alappuzha says.\n\nThe NIV has clarified that all samples of the CSF that they had tested were of patients who had encephalitis meningitis symptoms. The samples were sent from the Alappuzha Medical College hospital.\n\n\"We just tested the CSF samples we received and reported our findings. It is possible that the patients presented a different spectrum of clinical symptoms, which did not fit into the classical definition of AES. The mean age of the patients was 60 years. We have not reported that the 28 deaths were due to JE/WN, but that these persons were exposed to the JE/WN viruses and that IgM positivity of the CSF indicates acute exposure. It is for the Health department to take suitable follow-up action,\" says Dr Anukumar.\n\n[Byline: C Maya]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Both West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) occur in southern India, and it is possible that these patients could have been infected with either one, although that diagnosis is disputed by the district public health administration. The diagnoses were made on the basis of serology, the interpretation of which is confounded by flavivirus cross reactivity, as mentioned in the report above.\n\nNo mention was made about attempts to detect virus sequences by PCR. Although virus neutralization tests may be too slow to provide a diagnosis for patients while they are hospitalized, it is critical to know which viruses are circulating in the area, and that requires neutralization testing.\n\nThere is a vaccine available for JEV but not for WNV. The report above makes no mention of the vaccination history of the patients, or of plans to vaccinate others in the areas where the patients acquired their infection should further testing indicate that JEV is circulating there.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map showing the location of Kerala state can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/879w. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (UP) 20130825.1900553\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13) 20130821.1892929\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20130731.1856438\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20130723.1839559\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (BR) 20130714.1824758\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20130628.1798059\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20130616.1776275\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) RFI 20130610.1764062\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20130601.1748963\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (AS) 20130514.1713488\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20130511.1706357\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20130501.1683457\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP, BR) 20130411.1638769\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20130402.1615081\n.................................................sb/dk/ty/mj/dk", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1900553", "archive_id": 1900553, "date": "2013-08-25 09:29:20", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (UP)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (14): (UTTAR PRADESH)\n*************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 22 Aug 2013\nSource: CNN-IBN Live [edited]\nhttp://ibnlive.in.com/news/up-encephalitis-kills-30-children-in-5-days-in-gorakhpur/416218-3-242.html\n\n\nGorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh has been affected by encephalitis once again, with 30 children succumbing to the disease in the past 5 days.

A central government programme that tracks encephalitis, or brain inflammation, has claimed that waterborne enteroviruses have replaced the Japanese encephalitis virus as the main cause of encephalitis. But many scientists believe the identity of the viruses still remains hazy.\n\n\"In this time and age, there can be no excuse for failing to identify an unknown virus,\" said a senior government scientist who requested not to be named. \"Technology exists today to sequence a virus in less than 6 hours,\" the scientist told The Telegraph.\n\nThe study on the quality of surveillance and diagnosis examined the case records of patients from Kushinagar district in Uttar Pradesh and suggested that assertions that waterborne enteroviruses are the dominant cause of encephalitis are not backed by adequate scientific evidence.\n\n\"Without reliable scientific evidence, it is very easy to shift the hypothesis (of the cause of the encephalitis),\" said Manish Kakkar, a microbiologist and faculty member at the Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, a research and training institution.\n\nKushinagar has been among hubs of encephalitis in eastern India where the Japanese encephalitis virus picked up through mosquito bites had been considered the primary cause of encephalitis from the 1970s until about 2010.\n\nThe Union health ministry had introduced a mass vaccination campaign against the Japanese encephalitis virus in the affected states in eastern India in 2006 with a fresh campaign in 2010, but both Japanese encephalitis and AES have persisted.\n\nHealth ministry figures suggest that AES has outnumbered Japanese encephalitis (JE) [cases] over the past 3 years. During 2012, for instance, India had 745 cases of JE and 8344 cases of AES, with 140 deaths from JE and 1256 deaths from AES.\n\nKakkar and his colleagues have found that the results of diagnostic tests on samples or blood or cerebrospinal fluid from 590 (82 per cent) out of 721 encephalitis patients registered at a district hospital during 2011 were still awaited in July 2012, after virtually all the children had been discharged or died. In 80 per cent of the cases, health authorities had no idea whether patients had been vaccinated.\n\n\"These findings are shocking; with such gaps in information, it's hard to estimate the effect of the vaccination or to determine what might be causing the illness,\" said Kakkar, lead author of the study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases [see below].\n\nThe National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, under the Indian Council of Medical Research has set up a surveillance centre in eastern Uttar Pradesh to help analyse samples from patients and try to identify the cause of the AES.\n\nThe NIV has said it has detected in samples of cerebrospinal fluid of patients with encephalitis genetic material resembling that of enterovirus 89 and enterovirus 76, and throat swabs of patients have turned up signatures of the coxsackievirus and 2 types of echovirus. \"Enteroviruses are known to cause encephalitis, and our evidence is strong,\" a senior NIV scientist said.\n\nBut Kakkar and his colleagues say the focus of health authorities has shifted to enteroviruses even though the studies that found enteroviruses in patient samples have not demonstrated that waterborne pathogens are the main cause of the encephalitis.\n\n\"What Kushinagar shows is India's failure to establish a reliable public health surveillance network,\" said T. Jacob John, a senior virologist formerly with the Christian Medical College, Vellore.\n\n\"We don't need to pinpoint the cause to treat children with encephalitis, for the medical management of the illness,\" John said. \"But to prevent new infections, we have to understand what's causing them.\"\n\n[Byline: G.S.

We reviewed AES surveillance data for January 2011-June 2012 from Kushinagar District, Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were cleaned, incidence was determined, and demographic characteristics of cases and data quality were analyzed. A total of 812 AES case records were identified, of which 23 per cent had illogical entries. AES incidence was highest among boys under 6 years of age, and cases peaked during monsoon season. Records for laboratory results (available for Japanese encephalitis but not AES) and vaccination history were largely incomplete, so inferences about the epidemiology and etiology of AES could not be made. The low-quality AES/Japanese encephalitis surveillance data in this area provide little evidence to support development of prevention and control measures, estimate the effect of interventions, and avoid the waste of public health resources.\n\nConclusion:\nThe current AES/JE surveillance system has a complicated specimen referral and reporting system at the district level, and the available line lists suggest that data are of low quality. Without evidence to estimate the effect of interventions, AES prevention and control measures may be ineffective, and public health resources may be wasted. In 2011, AES and JE were highlighted in the national media, leading to a declaration for several policy initiatives, including formation of a multi-sectorial and inter-ministerial National Encephalitis Control Programme. Despite the high profile of AES, the importance of surveillance data for guiding these initiatives has not been realized or translated to action. Gaps in surveillance capacity that were identified in this study indicate the need for a systematic evaluation of the AES/JE surveillance system in Kushinagar District and constitute key lessons that need to be incorporated as strategic planning is undertaken for this new initiative.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[These 2 reports underscore the need for establishing a reliable diagnosis for the etiology of the AES cases, as has been noted in the moderator comments in ProMED-mail posts over the past several years.

The district health surveillance officer, Amal Mushahary, said the girl is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Guwahati and that her condition is improving. He said another case has been reported from the Gossaigaon area of the district. In June [2013], 2 people were diagnosed with JE [virus infections].\n\nMushahary said the infectious disease has been on the rise in the district over the years and villagers should urgently take steps to arrest its spread. Last year [2012], 13 people were diagnosed with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Of the 13 cases, 7 were found to be JE positive, he added; \"3 persons died last year [2012], while others could not be traced due to inappropriate addresses of the patients,\" he said.\n\nIn 2011, 25 AES cases were reported in the district, of which 7 were diagnosed with JE [virus infections]; 4 succumbed to the disease.\n\n\"People should be most careful during June and July as these are months when spread of the disease is high,\" Mushahary said.\n\nHe urged the administration to take steps to control [transmission] of the disease in the district. \"If no adequate steps are taken immediately, the disease will increase further as pigs, which are the amplifying hosts of the disease, are reared in most of the tribal households,\" he said.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The etiologies of all the current cases above are given as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections.

Seemingly healthy hours earlier, most have lapsed into a coma punctuated by convulsions.\n\nDoctors work to calm the convulsions and keep the children hydrated, but then have to watch helplessly along with the anguished parents as a 3rd of their young patients die, often within hours. Then, as suddenly as it started, the mysterious outbreak stops with the onset of the monsoon rains this month [July 2013]. No one knows why.\n\nThe mud-and-bamboo huts in this part of India cradle more dying children than anywhere in the world, with diarrhea and malnutrition long ranking as the region's great scourges. But now, this unknown killer is stalking the very young.\n\nAlthough public health statistics are unreliable here, the disease is believed to infect tens of thousands of people a year and kill thousands.\n\nAll doctors know is that the illness is a form of brain swelling, or encephalitis, but that is a huge category, covering a wide spectrum of diseases. Doctors have tested for known causes of brain swelling, including meningitis and Japanese encephalitis, but the tests almost always come back negative. India's top health officials say the disease, known officially as acute encephalitis syndrome, has them stumped.\n\n\"This outbreak happens every year, and we have not been able to identify the cause or link even a single factor responsible,\" Dr. L. S. Chauhan, the director of the National Center for Disease Control in India, said in an interview.\n\nDr. Chauhan hopes to change that. With help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, he started a program this year [2013] to train an elite cadre of disease sleuths, part of a recently organized Epidemic Intelligence Service in India, that he hopes will eventually undertake the investigations of India's estimated 1500 epidemics.\n\nBut the outbreak in Muzaffarpur is slowly spreading to neighboring areas, and Dr. Chauhan has thrown everything he can at it, assigning all 7 of his trainees, each already an accomplished physician. Experts from the C.D.C. are advising them, and their work is being closely followed by concerned officials in the United States.\n\nThe 1st reports of this mysterious illness date to 1995, when nearly 1000 children were sickened and 300 died in Muzaffarpur's 3 hospitals. Smaller epidemics have followed almost every year since.\n\nOfficials say they do not know whether the illness began in 1995 or had simply gone unnoticed before. Not only has it spread to nearby areas, but researchers have also recently found similar cases in neighboring Nepal. Some outbreaks in India have gone unreported because officials suppressed any mention for fear of prompting panic or criticism.\n\n\"India has a huge problem with encephalitis,\" said Dr. Rajesh Pandey, one of the epidemiologists camped out in Muzaffarpur, \"and it's not something almost anyone knows about.\"\n\nThe illness is often confused with Japanese encephalitis [virus infection], which generally arrives just after the start of the monsoons and peaks in the fall, as it is spread by mosquitoes that breed in standing water. But this affliction starts a couple of months earlier and ends with the monsoon.\n\n\"This is a real mystery,\" Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the CDC director, said in a telephone interview. \"We're not sure we'll be able to solve it, but at least we can unleash the best epidemiological tools we have to try to answer the question.\"\n\nDr. Chauhan's team has been given a rustic guesthouse next to a hospital here. There is no air-conditioning; the beds sag, and the electricity is fitful. But there is an urgency to the doctors' work. They gather almost every night in a small dining room to update crude posters with information about each case and debate their theories. A new virus, an old bacteria, litchis, alcoholic tree sap, heat, pesticides, rats, bats and sand flies are among the suspected causes.\n\nIn the nearby hospital, parents say in hushed tones that a ghost must be angry. Some paint black spots on siblings' foreheads to ward off the evil eye.\n\nGiven the suddenness with which the illness strikes, their superstition is understandable. At 11:30 p.m. on 10 Jun 2013, a 3-year-old boy was sleeping beside his mother and 2 brothers in their hut in the village of Ganti Vishanpur when he let out a scream and went into convulsions. The boy's father took him to a hospital. Several hours later, the boy's brother, age 5, screamed louder, convulsed and went limp. His panicked mother left her 2-month-old with a relative and took the boy to the hospital. Intensive medication and intravenous fluids stopped the boy's convulsions and cured his dehydration, said Dr. Mohan Kumar, a member of the team.\n\n\"I thought the child was O.K.,\" Dr. Kumar said [but] the 3 year old died that afternoon. His brother was moved to Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital, the region's best hospital, but one so overrun that its hallways are lined with sleeping patients, and its power blinks out almost hourly. Four days later, the father was still sitting beside the 5 year old's limp body, holding his hand.\n\nBut something the boys did, ate, drank, breathed in or encountered led to the 3 year old's death and the 5 year old's coma.\n\nInvestigators have collected samples of blood, urine and spinal fluid from each of this year's [2013] sick children -- there were 133, 59 of whom died -- and they asked their parents more than 150 questions about the children's food, water, sleeping arrangements and villages.\n\nSince cases tend to be isolated, the illness probably does not spread in the traditional person-to-person way, like the flu or tuberculosis. So the researchers are looking not only for the cause (virus, bacteria or toxin), but also for a carrier (rats, livestock or bats) and perhaps even for a vehicle (sand flies, drink or fruit). The investigation is like a highly complex puzzle in which every piece must be solved.\n\nA day in the field with Dr. Pandey revealed the magnitude of the task. It took him to a tiny cluster of brick-and-bamboo huts that made up the village of Chotta Sindhwari and the home of a 10-year-old boy hospitalized 2 weeks earlier with brain swelling. Dr. Pandey asked to see where he slept. His parents showed him a small room in a brick building with a mud floor, a bamboo roof and a wooden sleeping platform. Flies buzzed around; a young goat wandered in. Sacks of corn and rice, a magnet for rats, were piled near the bed. There was little ventilation, which could create excess heat. Mango, banana, palm and litchi trees were nearby. Dr. Pandey took notes on it all.\n\n[In the building,] 5 siblings slept on the platform, and there was mosquito netting above it. But the boy's mother said she sometimes found him sleeping on the mud floor outside the netting.\n\nWater came from a nearby pump. There was standing water with mosquito larvae, which Dr. Pandey collected in a small plastic bottle. They will be grown later for identification.\n\n\"This well is probably shallow, and they drink from it directly,\" Dr. Pandey said, making it a possible source of fecal contamination. Some have guessed that the disease is an intestinal virus carried in contaminated water. But patients with such infections usually have enlarged spleens, something not seen in the affected children, Dr. Pandey said.\n\nHe asked about the village's use of pesticides. (A separate team of environmental experts will soon test villages for pesticide and toxin residues.) He visited its grove of litchi trees. One theory is that infected bats contaminate the fruit, which ripen in May and June.\n\nAs if on cue, a cheerful old man walked through the grove carrying a clay pot of palm sap, which becomes mildly alcoholic in the summer heat. The pot was filled with a milky brew, dead insects and perhaps some bat feces and urine. Maybe children find a way to drink it, Dr. Pandey speculated, or their parents, inured to its effects, drink it and somehow pass along an infection.\n\nThen Dr. Pandey walked down the village's dirt road to find a random child of the 10 year old's age and perform the same survey. He was pursued by a pack of curious children, one of whom eventually stepped forward like an army recruit -- chest out, head up -- to answer the doctor's questions.\n\nThe village visit took 5 hours, and the study will need about 360 subjects. The epidemiologists say they have been working 14-hour days.\n\n\"I'm here until we finish,\" Dr. Pandey said.\n\n[Byline: Gardiner Harris]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The reports of encephalitis (usually termed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in India) continue to be confusing. The above report seems to rule out Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections on seasonal grounds, yet other reports in this and previous years of AES in northeastern India have been attributed in part or entirely to JEV infections. However, in some instances, JEV infections are reported to be responsible for a minority of the cases. A 1 Apr 2013 ProMED-mail report (archive no. 20130402.1615081) indicated that encephalitis cases had already been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal in India this year (2013), totaling 228 cases and 49 fatalities up to 19 Mar 2013. Of those cases, 7, all from West Bengal, were classified as JEV infections. An additional report on 11 May 2013 (archive no. 20130628.1798059) stated that there were 24 cases of JEV encephalitis in Assam state this year [2013], along with 53 deaths due to encephalitis and 362 other cases of AES.\n\nIt seems curious that cases in Uttar Pradesh state have not been mentioned in the current report, as that has been a locality of a large number of reported JEV and AES cases in the past. There is no indication in these or previous reports this year (2013) whether individuals, especially the children, have been vaccinated recently against JEV infection. The arrival of the USA CDC team is good news indeed. With a vigorous field epidemiological study and the strong laboratory support of the CDC, one hopes that the etiology of these undefined AES cases can be resolved definitively.\n\nProMED thanks Kunihiko Iizuka for sending in these and other related reports.\n\nMaps of India and Bihar state can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/r/77fN. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20130628.1798059\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20130616.1776275\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) RFI 20130610.1764062\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR): 20130601.1748963\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (AS) 20130514.1713488\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20130511.1706357\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20130501.1683457\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP, BR) 20130411.1638769\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20130402.1615081\n.................................................dk/ty/msp/dk", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1798059", "archive_id": 1798059, "date": "2013-06-28 17:41:31", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (09): (ASSAM)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 27 Jun 2013\nSource: Zee News, Press Trust of India (PTI) report [edited]\nhttp://zeenews.india.com/news/assam/encephalitis-has-claimed-53-lives-in-assam-since-january_858292.html\n\n\nSince January this year [2013], 53 have died due to encephalitis and 362 others have suffered from acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Assam.\n\nAnother 24 positive cases of Japanese encephalitis were detected during the period, NRHM [National Rural Health Mission] state surveillance officer Dr B C Bhagabati told PTI.\n\nDibrugarh district in upper Assam accounted for the maximum deaths (13), he said; 10 of the deaths were reported this week, he said, with 3 deaths reported in Dibrugarh, 2 each in Sonitpur and Darrang, and one each in Jorhat, Lakhimpur and Morigaon districts.\n\nKamrup (Metro), where Guwahati is situated, had 29 incidences of the disease during the last 6 months.\n\nAs preventive measures, he said, the government has stepped up fogging and DDT spraying and intensified the ITBN (Insecticide Treated Bednet) scheme, besides holding awareness programmes in villages.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection cases in this report is not clear.

However, this time, acute encephalitis has claimed 38 lives and affected 118 persons even before the onset of the disease season. This despite chief secretary Jawed Usmani issuing repeated directives to the state health department and officials posted in the districts to initiate preventive measures.\n\nEncephalitis is the inflammation of the brain caused by microbial agents such as bacteria and viruses. The cause of infection in [Indian] eastern districts of Uttar Pradesh [UP] and parts of Bihar, and Nepal is virus in 98 per cent of the patients. Encephalitis has killed children for [a] long [time], but the documentation work began in the mid 1970s. Earlier, the Arbo-B virus [flavivirus] was the cause of encephalitis and the disease was called Japanese encephalitis. After extensive vaccination campaigns, the incidence of Japanese encephalitis subsided. Still children continue to die. Researches have shown that the cause of encephalitis in about 45 per cent of the cases is not known.\n\nStatistics gathered from the health department show that of the total cases, 103 patients belonged to UP of whom 34 died. Bihar accounted for the remaining 14 cases and 4 deaths. A patient from Nepal is also undergoing treatment at the Baba Raghav Das Medical College of Gorakhpur [Uttar Pradesh]. Kushinagar turned out to be the worst affected district so far, but Gorakhpur has seen the maximum deaths.\n\nIn Kushinagar, as many as 30 cases and 10 deaths have been reported while in Gorakhpur, 12 of the 23 patients suffering with acute encephalitis have died. What has pressed the panic button for the health department officials is that the case fatality rate for the 1st quarter of 2013 is significantly higher than that in 2012. Case fatality rate refers to the number of patients who die against those admitted. In the 1st quarter of 2012, as many as 26.9 per cent of the children suffering from AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] died, a growth of 33 per cent in 2013. Doctors at the communicable diseases unit of state health directorate believe that by the end of the year, the case fatality rate will subside.\n\nThe only silver lining is that the number of cases of Japanese encephalitis [has declined]. Experts at the Gorakhpur unit of National Institute of Virology give credit to the special vaccination drive against JE [Japanese encephalitis] for the low number of cases. Still as these children struggle for life, staff employed in the hospital attended them calmly. \"The season is yet to begin. Come in August or September to know what the encephalitis epidemic looks like,\" a medical officer told TOI.\n\nSenior faculty members at the BRD Medical College stated that the cause of encephalitis in about 45 per cent is not known. But in an equal proportion of children, strains of enterovirus are causing disease.\n\nEnterovirus[es are in] a large family divided into 4, like: echo, coxsackie-B, polio, and human enterovirus (HEV). It [enteroviruses] is normally associated with polio [controlled in India. - Mod.TY], and is largely found in human excreta.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The appearance of encephalitis, often termed acute encephalitis syndrome in India, this early in the year is of concern.

Domestic pigs are known reservoirs of JEV.\n\nTransmitted to humans by [several species of] _Culex _ mosquitoes, the symptoms of JE include severe rigors, convulsions and high temperature. Patients may go into coma, and the fatality rate is high among child victims.\n\n1st isolated in Japan in 1935, JEV has become a major public health menace with a worldwide case-fatality rate of 30 per cent, and 30-50 per cent of survivors develop permanent brain damage.\n\nThe isolation of the GI strain in West Bengal has cast doubts about the efficacy of vaccines currently used against JE derived from the GIII strain. \"In future, a JE outbreak is quite likely in the state if this vaccine fails to protect sufficiently against GI of JEV,\" the researchers noted in their study.\n\nOther experts said there was no cause for panic. \"GIII-derived vaccine is used in countries where the GI strain is prevalent and has been found to be effective. I do not think there is any risk,\" Komal Kushwaha, a physician at the Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur, told SciDev.Net.\n\nKushwaha suggested carrying out a study by completely immunising one district and keeping another as control over a period of 2 years.\n\n[Byline: Archita Bhatta]\n\nReference:\nArindam Sarkar, Debjani Taraphdar, Subhra Kanti Mukhopadhyay, Sekhar Chakrabarti and Shyamalendu Chatterjee. Molecular evidence for the occurrence of Japanese encephalitis virus genotype I and III infection associated with acute Encephalitis in Patients of West Bengal, India, 2010. Virology Journal 9:271. 2012.\n\nAbstract (provisional)\n\nBackground:\nJapanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen, is the sole etiologic agent of Japanese encephalitis (JE), a neurotropic killer disease which is one of the major causes of viral encephalitis worldwide, with prime public health concern. JE was 1st reported in the state of West Bengal, India in 1973. Since then, it has been reported every year from different districts of the state, although vaccination has already been done, indicating that there might be either partial coverage of the vaccine or the emergence of a mutated/new strain of JEV. To understand JEV genotype distribution, we conducted a molecular epidemiological study on a total of 135 serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples referred and/or collected from clinically suspected patients with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) admitted in different district hospitals of West Bengal, India, 2010.\n\nFindings:\nJEV etiology was confirmed in 36/135 (26 per cent) and 13/61 (21 per cent) 2-15 day febrile illness samples from AES cases by analyzing Mac-ELISA followed by RT-PCR tests, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete envelope gene sequences of 13 isolates showed the emergence of JEV genotype I (GI) co-circulating with genotype III (GIII).\n\nConclusion:\nThis study represents the 1st report of JEV GI with GIII co-circulating in West Bengal. The efficacy of the vaccine (derived from the JEV GIII strain SA-14-14-2) to protect against emerging JEV GI needs careful evaluation. In future, a JE outbreak is quite likely in the state if this vaccine fails to protect sufficiently against GI of JEV.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Travelers would not be the source of JEV GI in West Bengal state because viremias in humans are not adequate to infect mosquito vectors that would lead to ongoing virus transmission. It does seem unlikely that the JEV GIII vaccine would fail to protect people from JEV GI infection. Studies using animal models would confirm or discard effective cross-protection. It will be interesting to see which of these genotypes predominates in West Bengal over time and whether individuals who have been vaccinated recently with the GIII vaccine develop clinical disease from JEV infections. If protection is not adequate, the vaccination strategy in eastern India will need to be reevaluated.\n\nReports of the etiology of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in eastern India have been confusing. Some attribute all of the AES cases to JEV infection, others to a small proportion, or to none of them. This report confirms JEV as one of the etiological agents responsible for AES.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of West Bengal state can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/2iyC. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (OA) 20121111.1404565\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (UP) 20121023.1360246\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP, RA) 20121016.1347211\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (UP) 20121005.1325059\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15) UP 20120921.1304596\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (UP) 20120912.1291540\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (UP) 20120903.1278429\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20120730.1221784\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (UP) 20120714.1201337\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20120712.1199565\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (Assam) 20120701.1186667\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BI) comment, RFI 20120630.1185855\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BI) 20120629.1184898\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BI, UP) 20120616.1170331\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BI) 20120613.1166861\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BI), RFI 20120612.1165900\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BI) RFI 20120607.1159903\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP) 20120606.1158514\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (BI) 20120604.1155306\n.................................................sb/dk/ty/msp/dk", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1404565", "archive_id": 1404565, "date": "2012-11-11 20:23:03", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (OR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (19): (ODISHA)\n******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 10 Nov 2012\nSource: News Track India [edited]\nhttp://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/2012/11/10/149-Japanese-Encephalitis-kills-24-kids-in-Odisha.html\n\n\nJapanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne disease, has killed at least 24 children in Odisha's Malkangiri district, an official said on Saturday [10 Nov 2012]. A team of experts visited the affected area a few days ago and collected nearly 70 samples after the children, aged between 2-5 years, died in 5 villages of the district in recent months. The team found that 10 samples were positive for Japanese encephalitis virus, according to the Joint Director of the state health department, M. M. Pradhan.\n\nThe dead children had symptoms including swelling of the eyes, nose, and ears, and they also had other symptoms characteristic of Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus that is responsible for the deaths of thousands of children in India every year. The investigation results of the rest of the samples will come soon, Pradhan said.\n\nPradhan said that villages had large number of pigs, the amplifying host of the virus.\n\nNo new cases of disease have been reported from the district after the affected areas were disinfected and an awareness campaign was launched.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[So far, 10 of some 70 samples from affected children have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis virus infection. It is not yet clear whether any other virus may be implicated in this outbreak as has been reported elsewhere in India, particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nJapanese encephalitis (JE) is a virus disease that infects animals and humans. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and in humans causes inflammation of the membranes around the brain. It is associated with irrigation and build-up of the mosquito-vector populations. This may cause the circulation of the virus to spill over into humans from its preferred hosts, birds and pigs. An effective inactivated vaccine is available, but it is expensive and requires more than a single injection. As is the case in Odisha, control of the pig population and mosquito eradication may be the best public health options.\n\nMost JE virus infections are mild or without apparent symptoms, but approximately one in 200 infections result in severe disease characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and death. The case fatality rate can be as high as 60 percent among those with such disease symptoms. In areas where Japanese encephalitis virus is common, encephalitis is observed mainly in young children, because older children and adults have already been infected and are immune.\n\nOrissa -- now officially rendered as Odisha -- is located on the east coast of India, adjacent to the Bay of Bengal.

The 1st he heard of the handpump being too shallow was when his 9-year-old daughter died of encephalitis this year [2012] and the grieving father was told it was because of the water she had drunk from the handpump.\n\nWith water-borne acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) now making up close to 95 per cent of the encephalitis cases across eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a renewed focus on the water the area's children are drinking. \"The big problem in this area is that since it is low-lying and surrounded by rivers, the water table is very high, which makes contamination easier,\" says Gorakhpur's district magistrate Ravi Kumar NG.\n\nMilind Gore, who heads the National Institute of Virology's Gorakhpur research unit, says water samples taken by them near handpumps in affected areas have shown the presence of enteroviruses, which can cause AES.\n\nAn important part of the administration's work to prevent encephalitis is discouraging people from using these handpumps and installing India Mark II pumps. \"We have been sanctioned Rs 160 crore [USD 34 309 018] for improving drinking water, through which 4600 handpumps are being installed in Gorakhpur district alone,\" says Kumar.\n\nBut while the shallow handpump is now accepted as the villain in the piece, residents say they had to take no permissions while installing handpumps, many of them up to 25 years ago. \"We got the contractor to put in a handpump, and when he hit water, he stopped. How would village people know how deep to put it in?\" says a man, whose brother lost his infant daughter to AES 12 days ago.\n\n\"No one has ever told us there is any problem with our handpump,\" says a woman of Bargadahi village in Gorakhpur. Her 6-year-old daughter was hospitalized with AES a month ago but has largely recovered. The entire family still drinks water from the same handpump outside their house.\n\nIn other villages, some of the deeper handpumps installed by the government are located inside the compounds of the better off, often upper caste, residents of the village, a problem the district administration too acknowledges. Against this backdrop, the Centre's continued insistence on improved handpumps in an area in which groundwater poses problems seems fraught with danger.\n\n[Byline: Rukmini Shrinivasan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Conflicting reports of the etiology of these acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases continue. The above report, and several previous ones of AES, have associated the disease with contaminated water, implying enterovirus etiology. The above report, for the 1st time, explicitly states that enteroviruses are responsible, with improved pumps being offered as the preventive approach.\n\nHowever, the 16 Oct 2012 report stated, \"The doctors said that viral encephalitis is caused by insect or mosquito bites [that transmit a virus]. Now, the medical, health and family welfare department has stepped up anti-mosquito activities in the area. Medical department sources said that directions have been issued to medical officials in Alwar to carry out fogging and other anti-larvae activities and other measures to kill mosquitoes and insects,\" to prevent transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus (See ProMED-mail archive no . 20121016.1347211).

It is suspected he was suffering from viral encephalitis. He along with 6 other children had been admitted to J K Lon hospital on Sunday. Dr Rambabu Sharma said, \"The test reports of the children are still awaited but they are clinically suspected cases of viral encephalitis.\"\n\nOne another child is serious and is in the intensive care unit (ICU). The doctors have put him on ventilator while the others are undergoing treatment in the emergency ward.\n\nAlwar has been gripped by various diseases this year [2012], which has even taken the government off guard. Bansur MLA Rohitash Sharma said, \"5 children have died in the area in last 2 days due to fever.\" Of the children who died on Sunday, 3 belonged to the same house. One other died on his way to Jaipur.\n\nThe doctors in Bansur's community health centre had referred the children to Jaipur's J K Lon hospital when they could not handle the situation. The community health centre did not have adequate equipment to take care of the little patients.\n\nMeanwhile, health minister AA Khan also reached J K Lon hospital and directed the doctors to provide all facilities to the ailing children. He also met the parents of the children admitted to the hospital. MLA Rohitash Sharma too visited the hospital on Monday evening [15 Oct 2012].\n\nThe doctors said that viral encephalitis is caused by insect or mosquito bites [that transmit a virus]. Now, the medical, health and family welfare department has stepped up anti-mosquito activities in the area. Medical department sources said that directions have been issued to medical officials in Alwar to carry out fogging and other anti-larvae activities and other measures to kill mosquitoes and insects. The officials are conducting door-to-door survey in the area to find out if there are any more patients.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The etiological agent involved in these cases is not stated, as is often the case in these reports of encephalitis in India. The acute encephalitis syndrome mentioned in the Uttar Pradesh (UP) cases is often associated with polluted water, suggesting one or more enteroviruses might be responsible. Other past reports have implicated Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The Jaipur cases, located far distant from UP, in northwest India, are associated in the above report with mosquitoes, suggesting (JEV) is responsible. In neither report is the vaccination status of the patients mentioned. India often mounts JEV vaccination campaigns in areas where outbreaks occur, such as the eastern parts of UP state.\n\nAt least 390 people, mostly children, were reported in an outbreak of viral encephalitis in UP this year as of 4 Oct 2012, according to health authorities.

More than 2500 patients were admitted to government hospitals in Gorakhpur city this year [2012], Press Trust of India quoted a health official as saying. At least 270 patients were still being treated at the hospitals, he said. The disease is caused by contaminated water.\n\nNearly 6500 children have died of encephalitis in the region since the 1st case was detected in 1978. The disease occurs regularly during the monsoon in Gorakhpur and adjoining districts which border Nepal in the foothills of the Himalayas. The low-lying areas are prone to floods, providing a breeding ground for mosquitoes which commonly transmit the virus. Doctors say affected patients come from 10-12 districts in the region, and are mostly rural poor.\n\nUntil 2005, the majority of deaths were caused by Japanese encephalitis, caused by a mosquito-borne virus, doctors say. But in the past 6 years, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear.\n\nThe diseases cause headaches and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunctions, seizures, and inflammation of the heart and kidneys. Doctors say children between the ages of 6 months to 15 years are the worst affected. A fifth of the children who survive have to live with neurological weaknesses, doctors say.\n\nThe government says it has tried to check the regular outbreak of the encephalitis in the region.\n\nThe encephalitis outbreak in Gorakhpur has attracted national and international attention -- scientists from the US-based Centers for Disease Control visited the area in 2009, and took away medical samples to examine the virus.\n\nIn 2005, a virulent outbreak of Japanese encephalitis [virus infections] in Gorakhpur killed 1000 people, mostly children. This was the worst outbreak since 1978.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The death toll in eastern Uttar Pradesh state continues to climb from 274 reported on 11 Sep 2012 (see ProMED-mail archive below) to 322 on 19 Sep 2012 and now to 390 with this report, above. The report implies that the majority of cases of encephalitis over the past 6 years are not due to Japanese encephalitis virus infections. As in some previous reports, contaminated water is cited as the source of the outbreaks, suggesting enterovirus infections. The report also does not indicate what the findings of the USA CDC team were.

As many as 28 people are currently undergoing treatment at different block Public Health Centres (PHCs) in the district. \"So far, 22 people have died of Japanese encephalitis in the district; 28 are undergoing treatment,\" said Additional Deputy Commissioner (Health) Sivasagar I Rahman.\n\nAccording to reports, several cases of acute Japanese encephalitis syndrome (AES) emerged from different areas of the district. Several areas under the 8 block PHCs of Khelua, Geleki, Morabajar, Patsaku, Kalugaon, Dimow, Sapekhati and Metora have witnessed fast spread of the disease.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), Japanese encephalitis is a viral disease that infects animals and humans. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and in humans causes inflammation of the membranes around the brain. Intensification and expansion of irrigated rice production systems in South and Southeast Asia over the past 20 years have had an important impact on the disease burden caused by Japanese encephalitis [virus infections].\n\nJapanese encephalitis (JE) is a disease caused by a flavivirus that affects the membranes around the brain. Most JE virus infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms, but approximately one in 200 infections results in severe disease characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and death. The case fatality rate can be as high as 60 per cent among those with disease symptoms; 30 per cent of those who survive suffer from lasting damage to the central nervous system. In areas where the JE virus is common, encephalitis occurs mainly in young children because older children and adults have already been infected and are immune.\n\nThe virus causing Japanese encephalitis is transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ and _Culex vishnui_ groups, which breed particularly in flooded rice fields.\n\nJapanese encephalitis is a leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia with 30 000 - 50 000 clinical cases reported annually. It occurs from the islands of the Western Pacific in the east to the Pakistani border in the west, and from Korea in the north to Papua New Guinea in the south. Because of the critical role of pigs, its presence in Muslim countries is negligible. JE distribution is very significantly linked to irrigated rice production combined with pig rearing.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A 1 Jul 2012 report indicated that there were 20 deaths due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections in Assam state (See ProMED-mail archive no. 20120701.1186667). Now there are 22. Assam has had recent outbreaks of JEV infections. One presumes that the above cases are laboratory confirmed as (JEV) infections. Other reports from northeast India mention AES but with JEV discarded or responsible for a minority of cases. In the above report, no mention is made of recent JEV vaccination campaigns in this area. Pigs can be amplifying hosts because they have a viremia of relatively long duration and a high enough titer to serve as a source of infectious blood meals for _Culex_ mosquitoes. Wading birds, such as herons, serve as reservoir hosts.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map showing the location of Assam state can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/00J-. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (Assam) 20120701.1186667\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08) (BI) comment, RFI 20120630.1185855\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BI) 20120629.1184898\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BI, UP) 20120616.1170331\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BI) 20120613.1166861\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BI), RFI 20120612.1165900\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BI) RFI 20120607.1159903\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP) 20120606.1158514\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (BI) 20120604.1155306\n.................................................sb/lm/ty/msp/lm", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1186667", "archive_id": 1186667, "date": "2012-07-01 21:44:07", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (Assam)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (09):: (ASSAM)\n******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 1 Jul 2012\nSource: Assam Times [edited]\nhttp://www.assamtimes.org/hot-news/6917.html\n\n\nAssam is in deep grip of the killer Japanese encephalitis where the [death] toll has gone up to 20.

The etiologies of all of the current cases, above, are not clearly indicated. Some are reported as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections, and failure to carry out mosquito vector control by fogging is blamed for the cases.

In fact, there is no specific drug to cure the AES, according to SKMCH deputy superintendent Dr Sunil Shahi. However, Dr Shahi informed that a new symptom has been found in majority of the patients that their blood sugar level has been found to be far below normal. Most of them have been found to have sugar only 10 to 50. [Hypoglycemia may be explained by presence of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome plus starvation. - Mod.DK]. Inflammation of brain tissues has also been found in most of the cases. Convulsion and high fever are common among them.\n\nThe calamity has assumed such an alarming proportion that chances of its cure are bleak. As many as 117 patients have been admitted to Kejriwal Hospital and 57 at SKMCH in the last 16 days. It is now evident that the disease is linked to weather. It occurs only in May-June every year. As the temperature has soared to 41 deg C [106 deg F], 13 new cases have been admitted to the SKMCH on Tuesday [12 Jun 2012] alone. Kejriwal Hospital's administrator VV Giri said the situation is more serious than last year. Only 92 cases had been admitted to this hospital and only 30 of them had expired in a span of 30 days in 2011, whereas 117 had already been admitted and of them 42 had expired in a span of 16 days this time. As both the heat and humidity are still at their peak, more such cases are bound to come. Kejriwal Hospital's attending physician Dr Vidya Shreeprabha said on Tuesday that the condition of all the 35 patients is very serious. It may be difficult to predict how many of them will survive. But no stone is left unturned to save them. The ward is overcrowded with patients and their attendants. 2 of the 4 air-conditioners of the ward are not working. The overall scenario of the ward is pathetic as half of the patients are surviving on oxygen.\n\nThe parents had wrapped up their children with wet cloth to control the fever, while some keep crying due to uneasiness. Most of them are lying in an unconsciousness state.\n\nThe state health department has provided free medicines to the hospital. Giri claimed that now the hospital is not charging anything in advance from attendants since 8 Jun [2012]. The government has also given 2 ambulances to this hospital for carrying patients to SKMCH and their home. All the hapless families are poor, depending mostly on daily wages. None of the affected children are from urban areas. They live under unhygienic conditions and drink only impure water. All the children are suffering from malnutrition.\n\n[Byline: Priti Nath Jha]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRonan Kelly\n<ronankelly@comcast.net>\n\n[As the number of cases increases rapidly, the ability of the hospital and its staff to care for them appears stretched to the limit. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Bihar (Muzaffarpur) proposed diagnosis\nDate: June 2012\nSource: Indian Pediatrics [edited]\nhttp://www.indianpediatrics.net/june2012/502.pdf\n\n\nRef: Gopal Shankar Sahni: Recurring Epidemics of Acute Encephalopathy in Children in Muzaffarpur, Bihar. 2012. Indian Pediatrics, 49(6): 502-3.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nMuzaffarpur district, suffers repeated epidemics of acute encephalopathy in children for the past 16-17 years. An outbreak of this mystery disease, with high case fatality (63.3 per cent) was reported in children from Muzaffarpur district, Bihar, in June 2011. We report here our findings of the investigations carried out to confirm the etiology and to describe the clinico-epidemiological features.\n\nClinically, the presentation indicated acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). We studied 80 children from age group of 2-10 (median, 3.5) years belonging to a low socioeconomic background. Almost all cases were from rural areas. Following clinical criteria were used to select a case of AES: rapid onset of unconsciousness in a previously healthy child after attack of convulsion, and presence of fever higher than 40 deg C [104 deg F].\n\nThe main presenting features were fever and convulsions (100 per cent), unconsciousness (100 per cent), decerebrate rigidity (50 per cent), tachycardia (80 per cent), tachypnea (80 per cent), and absent splenomegaly. The CSF was normal but under raised pressure (100 per cent). Hematological investigations revealed leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance (80 per cent). Biochemical investigation revealed hyponatremia (90 per cent), hypokalemia (5 per cent), mild raised SGPT (50-100IU/L) (30 per cent), mild raised blood urea (40-50mg/dL) (40 per cent), and normal creatinine.\n\nSmears for malarial parasites were negative. CT scan was done in 8 cases; 2 showed feature of cerebral edema, rest was normal. ECG showed non-specific ST changes and tachyarrhythmia.\n\nThe requisite clinical samples were collected from 55 patients and sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune and the National Communicable Disease Center, New Delhi for virological testing. These included 31 CSF samples, 59 serum samples, 19 nasal swabs, 48 throat swabs, 44 rectal swabs, 2 urine samples, 2 postmortem brain needle biopsy material by nasal route, and 1 postmortem liver biopsy specimen. All clinical samples were negative for known virus causing acute encephalitis like JE, Nipah, West Nile, and Chandipura viruses [tests used not mentioned. - Mod.TY]. Some specimens were processed for the discovery of novel agents. However, no agent has been found which can be attributed to the cause of the mystery disease in Muzaffarpur.\n\nThe presentation, seasonal distribution, climatic condition, and investigations of the cases did suggest a diagnosis of encephalopathy of heat stroke (HS), as similar picture has been described in few other studies also. Between April-June, the climate of Muzaffarpur is extremely hot and humid (28/40 deg C, [82-104 deg F] 90 per cent humidity) and most epidemics occurred at the height of temperature (38-40 deg C [100-104 deg F]) and humidity (70-80 per cent) suggesting the possibility of HS. The number of cases suddenly decreases with the onset of rain and resultant sudden drop in temperature.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRonan Kelly\n<ronankelly@comcast.net>\n\n[Interestingly, this report does not mention low blood sugar levels, which surely would have been tested for. Without an indication of the test used to detect the presence of viruses, it is difficult to know how sensitive and specific they might have been, nor is there any indication that serological tests (paired sera) might have been done on surviving individuals.\n\nTesting of samples at a WHO reference laboratory would add additional in formation to exclude or include a battery of viruses associated with encephalitis, especially enteroviruses. Previous reports from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states have indicated that at least a minority of acute encephalitis cases are due to JEV infections. This does not exclude the possibility that some cases might be due to heat stroke. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BI), RFI 20120612.1165900\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BI) RFI 20120607.1159903\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP) 20120606.1158514\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (BI) 20120604.1155306\n2011\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (34): (UP, BI) Nepal 20111109.3328\n.................................................dk/ty/mj/dk", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1165900", "archive_id": 1165900, "date": "2012-06-12 21:36:09", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BI), RFI", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (04): (BIHAR), REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n******************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 11 Jun 2012\nSource: DNA [edited]\nhttp://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_100-children-dead-57-other-affected-due-to-encephalitis_1701089\n\n\nAltogether 100 children have died and 57 others were undergoing treatment at various hospitals due to outbreak of the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Bihar since May this year [2012], state's Health Minister Ashwani Chaube said on Monday [11 Jun 2012].

As per the state government figures, till 2 Jun [2012], a total of 334 cases of AES have been reported across the state and 80 patients have died. But none of these have been confirmed as Japanese encephalitis [virus infection] cases.\n\nTill June 2011, 346 cases of AES, including 3 of Japanese encephalitis [JE], were reported. The number of deaths was 60. By the end of 2011, however, around 3500 AES cases were reported, with over 550 deaths.\n\nLast year [2011], Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad visited Gorakhpur and promised infrastructural support to BRD Medical College; 4 ventilators were sanctioned by the centre under the NRHM [National Rural Health Mission]. Former chief minister Mayawati had announced a 100-bed special ward for encephalitis patients at the college. Campaigns were undertaken to create awareness about hygiene, safe drinking water, and prevention of encephalitis.\n\n\"Cases are slightly more than last year [2011]. Deaths have also increased,\" said Dr Ramji Lal, director general, Medical and Health. He said since AES is a waterborne disease, the only prevention is providing safe drinking water. \"We have moved a proposal to arrange for clean drinking water in AES-affected areas. We have trained officials in these areas to create awareness about safe drinking water and rushing AES patients to nearest CHC-PHC [community health centres-primary health centres] at the earliest,\" said Lal, adding that if the measures being taken now are successful, AES cases may be controlled during the peak season.\n\nThe number of cases of JE, on the other hand, are under control, for which experts credit a special vaccination drive in 2010.\n\n\"The response of the vaccine is up to 80 per cent and if the routine immunisation for JE is continued, it can be well controlled this year [2012],\" said Dr MM Gore, in charge of the Gorakhpur unit of National Institute of Virology.

As indicated in previous reports last year (2011), JE virus infections are responsible for a minority of AES cases. There is still no virological diagnosis provided for the other etiological agents responsible for AES. Because cases are associated with contaminated water, presumably enteroviruses are involved. Providing clean drinking water, as proposed, should be very helpful for prevention of additional cases.

Till last year [2010], the average stay of an\nencephalitis patient at the hospital used to be 2 weeks, but the\nrecovery time has increased to 3 weeks this year. Symptoms like high\nfever and convulsions continue for 3 weeks now. Besides, children are\ncoming with rashes all over their body and inflation of the heart,\"\nsaid Dr KP Kushwaha, head of the Pediatrics Department at BRD Medical\nCollege. \"Rashes used to be there in some cases and even heart\ninflation, but it was very rare. Now more and more patients are coming\nin with these complaints and we are observing and analysing the\nsituation,\" said Dr Kushwaha.\n\nOver the last few years, after Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus\ninfection] cases started declining following regular vaccination, the\nclinical profile of the patients had remained almost the same; the\nonly change has been a slight increase in the number of adult\npatients. This is for the 1st time that doctors have noticed major\nchanges in the clinical profile of the patients.\n\nDenying any possibility of mutation in the virus, Dr MM Gore, senior\nscientist at the National Institute of Virology, who is also in charge\nof the NIV field laboratory at Gorakhpur, said: \"It is too early to\ncome to any conclusion, because even doctors are still observing the\nclinical changes\". He added: \"As far as I have come to know, symptoms\nof JE patients remain the same and it is the other forms of\nencephalitis where doctors have observed changes in the clinical\nprofile.\"\n\nThe problem with the experts is that apart from the JE virus, the\nviruses affecting the majority of the patients have not yet been\nidentified. For this reason, all non-JE patients are grouped together\nin a category called acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). The lack of\nidentification of AES viruses makes it difficult to ascertain the\ncauses behind these clinical changes.\n\n\"It is too early to conclude anything. After the outbreak is over in\nthe next few days, we will analyse the data.

The\nsymptoms of Japanese encephalitis include high fever, headache and\nnausea, bouts of unconsciousness or convulsions, altered sensorium or\nimpact on sensory part of the brain, chills, confusion and agitation,\nrigidity of neck, lethargy, and inability to talk or feel anything.\n\nDoctors suggested people to use medicated mosquito nets and repellents\nto avoid getting infected.

So far,\n2300 patients have been admitted to a hospital in the affected\nGorakhpur area of Uttar Pradesh state. A doctor told the BBC that it\nwas a \"tragedy beyond imagination,\" with children dying every day.\nNearly 6000 children have died of encephalitis in the hospital since\nthe 1st case was detected in 1978. Most of the deaths this year [2011]\nhave happened since July 2011, doctors say.\n\nThe disease occurs regularly during the monsoon in the Gorakhpur\nregion bordering Nepal in the foothills of the Himalayas. The\nlow-lying areas are prone to floods, providing a breeding ground for\nmosquitoes which commonly transmit the virus. Doctors say affected\npatients come from 10-12 districts in the region and are mostly poor.\n\nUntil 2005, the majority of deaths were caused by Japanese\nencephalitis, caused by a mosquito-borne virus, doctors say. But in\nthe past 6 years, children have been dying of other forms of viral\nencephalitis, caused by a mosquito-borne virus, doctors say. Both the\ndiseases cause headaches and vomiting and can lead to comas, brain\ndysfunctions, seizures and inflammations of the heart and kidneys.\nDoctors say children between the age of 6 months-15 years are worst\naffected, and most of the victims are poor people from rural areas.\n\n\"It is an unbelievable tragedy. There are 5-10 children dying\neveryday,\" Dr KP Kushwaha, head of paediatrics at the BRD Medical\nCollege, the only hospital treating patients, told the BBC. Most of\nthe 370 beds in the paediatrics and medicine departments at the\nhospital are overflowing with more than one patient to a bed, he said.\nA 5th of the children who survive have to live with neurological\nweaknesses, doctors say. \"Children are most affected because they have\nlower immunity, and they end up consuming a lot of contaminated water\nat home,\" Dr Kushwaha said.\n\nThough the incubation period of viral encephalitis is between 3-30\ndays, patients are brought to the hospital from far-flung areas\nbecause of the lack of adequate healthcare in their villages. \"The\npublic health care system is in a shambles. And the tragedy repeats\nitself every year,\" said Kumar Harsh, a local journalist.\n\nThe government says it has tried to check the regular outbreak of the\nencephalitis in the region. In 2006 and 2010, 2 massive vaccination\ndrives against Japanese encephalitis were carried out in Gorakhpur,\nleading to a drastic decline of the disease in the area.\n\nThe disease is caused by contaminated water. Also, people took\nprecautions by using mosquito nets and repellents. But tackling other\nforms of viral encephalitis has proved to be a tougher challenge, and\ncontrolling it will require a vast improvement in sanitation and\ndrinking water supplies in rural areas, health officials say.\n\nThe state government disbursed over millions of rupees from a federal\nhealth programme for treatment of patients at the state-run BRD\nMedical College in 2009. Part of this money was spent in hiring 135\nresearchers, doctors and paramedical staff to beef up treatment. Most\nof the money ran out by August 2009, leaving only 36 of them receiving\nregular salaries, say authorities.\n\nThe encephalitis outbreak in Gorakhpur has attracted national and\ninternational attention; scientists from the US-based Centers for\nDisease Control visited the area in 2009 and took away medical samples\nto examine the virus.\n\nIn 2005, a virulent outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur\nkilled 1000 people, mostly children. This was the worst outbreak since\n1978.\n\n[Byline: Soutik Biswas]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report does not indicate what the other mosquito-borne virus\nmight be in addition to JE virus.

Around 347 people have died in the Indian state of Uttar\nPradesh, while 54 children have died in the neighbouring state of\nBihar. Over 2000 cases have been reported in the last 3 months.\n\n\"Acute encephalitis syndrome has 2 types of infections -- Japanese\nencephalitis [virus], which occurs due to mosquitoes, and enteroviral\nencephalitis, which is caused due to unsafe drinking water,\" said\nDinesh Kumar Srivastava from the Community Medicine Department in\nUttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur district, where patients are receiving\ntreatment.\n\nOfficials said the main areas where the outbreak of the virus has been\nnoticed have been poor, flood-hit areas of the region, where this\nyear's [2011] monsoons have left pools of stagnant water that have\nallowed mosquitoes to breed and infect villagers. The floods have also\nled to the contamination of clean water sources such as wells, leaving\nmany people with no option but to use the same dirty water for both\ndrinking and sanitation. The infection spreads every year in\nimpoverished parts of Uttar Pradesh during the monsoon season,\nresulting in hundreds of deaths.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, viral encephalitis causes\nhigh fever, headache, stiff neck and back, vomiting, confusion and, in\nsevere cases, seizures, paralysis, and coma. Infants and elderly\npeople are particularly at risk of severe illness.\n\nOfficials say the government has earmarked 22 million rupees (USD 450\n000) to tackle problems like the unavailability of clean drinking\nwater, lack of sanitation, and water logging, to prevent the virus\nfrom spreading. But local aid workers say efforts need to be stepped\nup. \"The infection started in the early 1970s and since then it has\nbecome an annual feature. The government is adopting short term\nmeasures to deal with the infection instead of making any long term\nplan to get rid of the virus,\" said Sanjay Kumar Srivastava from\nAction for Peace, Prosperity and Liberty (APPL), a charity doing\nresearch on the disease. \"Besides, no preventive measures are taken to\nstop the outbreak,\" he added, suggesting that vaccinations be more\nreadily available to adults as well as to children.\n\n[Byline: Alka Pande, Nita Bhalla]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Previous reports of unspecified acute encephalitis syndrome\nimplicated contaminated water as a source of the infectious agent,\nsuggesting, without stating, that enteroviruses might be involved.

However, sources in the National Vector-borne\nDisease Control Programme (NVBDCP) of the Central Government contest\nthe above claim of the State Health Department as not true.\n\nSources in the Health Department told this newspaper the department\nhas taken steps like distribution of long lasting insecticidal nets in\nhigh risk areas and conducting awareness programmes against\nvector-borne diseases all over the state. These awareness programmes\nhave been undertaken generally on malaria and particularly on JE in\nthe high-risk areas of the disease.\n\nAround 35 lakh [3.5 million] long lasting insecticidal nets were\ndistributed by the department in 2010 and 2011. Spraying of DDT also\ncontinued in the state between 15 Feb [2011] till July 2011, and\nfogging has also been done at places, said the Health Department\nsources.\n\nIn the meantime, children in the age group of 1-15 have been\nvaccinated against Japanese encephalitis infection in the 11 districts\nof Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Golaghat, Jorhat, Tinsukia, Dhemaji,\nSonitpur, Lakhimpur, Kamrup, Nagaon and Udalguri. Routine immunization\nof the children who were below one year of age during the vaccination\ncampaign in these 11 districts has also been done, sources said. The\nvaccination programme is conducted by the Assam government with\nsupport from the Union Health Ministry's Immunisation Wing, said the\nsources. This time, the state government has projected 5 more\ndistricts for vaccination during the current year. These districts\ninclude Morigaon, Darrang, Nalbari, Barpeta and Goalpara, said the\nsources.\n\nSince the adults are becoming vulnerable to Japanese encephalitis\n[virus] infection, the government of Assam is now considering an\nimmunisation programme for the adults on priority basis, according to\nthe number of JE cases found in the districts. It is expected that by\nSeptember next [2011?], vaccination of adults against JE infection\ncould be started.\n\nThe sovernment of Assam has set up 8 laboratories to diagnose JE\ninfection at the Assam Medical College, Jorhat Medical College,\nGauhati Medical College, Lakhimpur Civil Hospital, Sivasagar Civil\nHospital, Golaghat Civil Hospital, Tezpur Mission Hospital and at the\nDibrugarh Lahowal-based Regional Medical Research Centre, sources\nsaid. Better facilities for diagnosing JE [virus] infection and better\ntreatment facilities for the patients suffering from JE infection have\nbeen providing scope for better planning to control the disease, and\nthe detection of so many cases is the result of all such facilities,\nsaid the sources.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The JE virus transmission season in Assam is well underway. The\nvaccination campaign should prove helpful in preventing additional\ncases. Interestingly, there is no mention made of non-JE encephalitis\ncases categorized as \"acute encephalitis syndrome\" of unknown\netiology, as had been reported last year (2010) and again recently in\nUttar Pradesh state.\n\nIt is not clear whether DDT is being applied only in houses for\nmalaria control in Assam or more widely for control of JE virus\nvectors. The application of DDT for mosquito control illustrates the\ndilemma that public health authorities face. Use of DDT for control of\nthe _Culex_ mosquitoes that are the JE virus vectors would requite its\napplication over large areas where they breed. Because DDT and its\nbreakdown products are very stable compounds that bioaccumulate in\norganisms in natural food chains, its use has been banned in many\ncountries due to the adverse ecological effects it causes. Landscape\napplication is not _Culex_ target-specific and will reduce populations\nof other insects, including beneficial ones. There is also the risk\nthat DDT is no longer as effective for control if the target mosquito\npopulations have become resistant to it.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of India showing the location\nof Assam state can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/00J-. -\nMod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (UP) 20110725.2239\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (AS) 20110721.2202\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (UP) 20110719.2184\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (AS) 20110715.2145\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (UP) 20110707.2055\n.................................................ty/msp/dk", "reports": [], "disease": "other"}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=796919", "archive_id": 796919, "date": "2011-07-25 10:39:44", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (UP)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (05): (UTTAR PRADESH)\n**************************************************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 24 Jul 2011\nSource: The Times of India (TOI), Times News Network (TNN) [edited]\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/Encephalitis-accompanies-rainsin-east-UP-claims/articleshow/9340775.cms\n\n\nMonsoon heralds the season of death in Poorvanchal [Purvanchal,\neastern Uttar Pradesh]. With the deadly combo of Japanese encephalitis\n[JE] and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) claiming its 106 victim\nlast Friday [22 Jul 2011], the scenario threatens to turn ugly once\nagain this year.\n\nBRD Medical College in Gorakhpur is overflowing with patients pouring\nin from neighbouring districts of Siddharthnagar, Maharajganj,\nKushinagar, Sant Kabirnagar, Deoria, Maharajganj, Gonda, and from\nBihar and neighbouring Nepal as well.\n\nThe rice bowl of UP has lost nearly 3500 lives to the vicious killers\nover the past 6 years. And though health officials celebrate the\n'statistical victory' that JE figures have plummeted to a mere 2 per\ncent from 35.88 per cent as reported in 2005, the sudden spurt in AES\ncases has them in knots.\n\nExperts explain, \"AES is a severe neurological condition with high\nmortality rate. For the semi-literate or illiterate victims and their\nfamilies, it is a \"plain mystery fever that brings sure death.\" The\nvirus, which has moved into the killer slot, could prove particularly\nworrisome this year [2011]. It has already overtaken JE much before\nthe peak season in August.\n\n\"Cases of AES, which has no vaccine have shown a definite climb this\nyear,\" said Dr SP Ram director general health UP. Talking to TOI, Dr\nRam said that 85 AES deaths have been reported in UP till July [2011].\nThe number last year [2010] at this time of year was 75. In contrast,\nthe casualty figure of JE reads 21. The official attributes the later\nphenomenon largely to a sustained vaccination programme. The bigger\nissue of how the department proposes to tackle the AES, however,\nleaves him floundering.\n\nAdmitting that the particular strain has not been identified, Dr Ram\nsaid, \"The National Institute of Virology is working on it . It could\nbe an enterovirus, meningitis, malaria, or any other water-borne\nvirus,\" he said, and added that the process could take time.\n\nThen there have been other attempts like the visit by an expert team\nfrom Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta. The team took\n150 samples, but forgot to send the report or the pilot project in\nKushinagar undertaken by the Union Ministry of Health and Family\nWelfare for prevention and control of AES, which sources say is\nlargely confined to papers.\n\n\"The state health department has launched an awareness campaign to\nintroduce the populace to hygiene and cleanliness practice and written\nto the chief secretary UP to sanction mark 2 hand pumps for the\naffected belt to ensure safe drinking water,\" Dr Ram said. Whether\nthis would ever become a priority agenda with a government busy\nfire-fighting at this time, remains a mute point though.\n\n\"The only lasting solution is to declare JE eradication a national\nprogramme like the malaria or polio eradication programmes,\" says Dr\nRN Singh, convener of the encephalitis eradication movement in\nGorakhpur. Dr Singh is leading a campaign to make JE an election issue\nthis time. \"With 125 MLAs [members of the legislative assembly] out of\n403 hailing from Poorvanchal, what is needed is a committed push,\" he\nsaid.\n\n[Byline: Manjari Mishra]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is encouraging to learn that the Indian National Institute of\nVirology and, apparently, the USA CDC are attempting to determine the\netiology of the acute encephalitis syndrome cases that are not\nJapanese encephalitis virus infections.

That means the combination of Culicine mosquitoes\nthat breed in rice fields and water birds that develop Japanese\nencephalitis (JE) viremia. Thus, it is a JE affected eco-type area; in\n2006 and since then some JE vaccination (Chinese live SA14-14-2) has\nbeen going on. In 2006, when a mass campaign was conducted, the\nprevalence plummeted. Since then the EPI [Expanded Program on\nImmunization] mode of vaccine delivery is beset with many problems, so\nJE continues relentlessly. The National Institute of Virology [NIV]\n(of Pune, Maharashtra, an ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research]\nCentre) has established a field station in Gorakhpur for\ninvestigations. That is how we know that there are JE cases and non-JE\ncases.\n\nThe non-JE \"acute encephalitis syndrome\" could be one or more\nconditions. Enterovirus(es) have been proposed since both the field\nstation and the Lucknow Medical College virologist have isolated many\nenteroviruses including a rare isolate from CSF. The NIV people\ndiscount the enterovirus theory but the Lucknow people insist it is an\nenterovirus disease.\n\nIt cannot be an enterovirus syndrome since it is annually recurrent\nand geographically confined. Enteroviruses spread widely. My guess is\nthat it may not even be a viral syndrome -- virologists look only for\nviruses. It could even be a non-infectious problem (such as the\n'hepatomyoencephalopathy' we have described in western UP -- it was\ncalled Saharanpur encephalitis for over 2 decades and investigated by\nNIV repeatedly. Our systematic studies showed it to be _Cassia\noccidentalis_ poisoning of children who ate lots of the beans. A\nGoogle search on Saharanpur encephalitis is a way to search or look\nfor hepatomyoencephalopathy, or else I can send a series of\npublications.\n\n--\nDr T Jacob John\nDepartment of Clinical Virology\nChristian Medical College\nVellore, Tamil Nadu\nIndia\n<tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>\n\n[ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr John for his comments.\n\nAs Dr John indicated, clearly a health landscape view (\"healthscape\")\nis essential to determine the etiology and epidemiology of the cases\nof encephalitis that have been going on in this area of Gorakhpur.\nUntil that information is in hand, prevention and control will not be\npossible. Vaccination to prevent Japanese encephalitis virus\ninfections will be helpful, but for less than half the reported cases.\nAnother (other) etiological agents that are endemic in the area must\nbe involved in the cases termed acute encephalitis syndrome. Dr John\nmentions possible involvement of the plant _Cassia occidentalis_ (or\n_Senna occidentalis_) with the common name of coffee senna or\ncoffeeweed. It contains toxins in all parts (seeds, roots, leaves,\nfruits). The symptoms of intoxication include diarrhea, tremors and\ndark brown urine if plant parts are consumed in large quantities. The\ntoxic compounds in it include anthraquinones, emodin glycosides,\ntoxalbumins, and alkaloids.\n\nA map showing the location of Uttar Pradesh state can be accessed at\n<http://www.indianorphanages.net/images/india-political-map.gif>.\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of India is available at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/02lp>. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (27): (UP) 20101228.4576\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (26): (UP) 20101204.4351\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (25): (UP) 20101105.4006\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (24): (UP) 20101014.3727\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (23): (UP) 20101013.3711\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (UP) 20101001.3568\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (UP) 20100929.3525\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP) 20100921.3402\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (UP, BH) Nepal 20100915.3340\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20100805.2646\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (UP) 20100728.2535\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (ML) 20100723.2473\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN) conf. 20100716.2380\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (AP) 20100422.1309\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (UP) 20100416.1236\n........................................jw/ty/mj/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

About 700 AES cases have been reported among\nadults this year -- of these around 100 were JE.\"\n\nKushwaha said some parts of the increase could be \"because the total\nnumber of AES cases has increased from about 2100 last year to about\n3000 cases this year.\" But there is another disturbing trend: while\nthe mortality rate of the disease among children has been around 13.7\npercent, the mortality rate among adults was close to 16 percent this\nyear, he said.\n\nThe 2 Dec 2010 edition of\n(<http://in.jagran.yahoo.com/news/local/uttarpradesh/4_1_6972559.html>\nin Hindi) mentions both Japanese and waterborne encephalitis are\ninvolved in these outbreaks.\n\nThe 29 Nov 2010 edition of the Indian Express\n(<http://www.indianexpress.com/news/JE-vaccination-to-begin-in-eastern-UP-at-last/717544>)\nreports that after 6 months after the Centre and the state government\ndisagreed over the use of \"unusable\" Japanese encephalitis vaccine\nfor a special vaccination drive in the eastern Uttar Pradesh, the\ndrive would finally begin on 30 Nov 2010 with the state getting a\nfresh stock of the vaccine.\n\nThe etiologies of the apparent majority these cases are still not\ndefined.

In 2009, by October, the total cases of AES in the\nstate were reported to be 2300 with 357 deaths. However, this year [2010],\nthe cases have already risen to 2538, with 369 deaths.

Experts believe the reason behind this is a failed\nvaccine drive. Every year, the Centre is unable to provide the\nrequired number of vaccines on time. And whatever little arrives, even\nthat is not fully used by the state. \"Yes, it has been some sort of\nfailure,\" admits the state's Additional Director (Health), UK Srivastav.\n\n\"If the Centre could not provide the vaccine, isn't it the duty of the\nstate to source it? The vaccines cost barely 30-odd crores [USD\n670,600] which is nothing compared to the thousands of crores spent on\nbuilding memorials\" [a crore is a unit in the Indian numbering system\nequal to 10 million. - Mod.TY] says Dr. RMD Agarwal, a paediatrician\nand a BJP MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly].\n\nThe 1st bad strike of Japanese encephalitis came in the 2005 monsoons.\nTo stem it, in 2006, a vaccination drive was introduced, but reports\nsuggest that only 35 percent of children were actually immunized. For\nthe next 3 years, no child got the vaccine. And now in 2010, as the\ndisease returns with a vengeance, the vaccines the Centre had rushed\nto UP turned out to be of such poor quality that they were completely\nunusable. The next vaccination drive is planned for November 2010.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRonan Kelly\n<ronankelly@comcast.net>\n\n[ProMED thanks Ronan Kelly for forwarding the above report. It was in\nresponse to the question posed by Mod.TY about the vaccination efforts\nin this area of UP. The above report goes on to further express the\nlocal pediatrician's frustration and criticism about the lack of\neffective JE virus vaccination efforts.\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP) 20100921.3402\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (UP, BH) Nepal 20100915.3340\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20100805.2646\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (UP) 20100728.2535\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (ML) 20100723.2473\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN) conf. 20100716.2380\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (AP) 20100422.1309\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (UP) 20100416.1236\n.................................jw/sb/ty/ejp/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

A figure, which in\nitself shows, how deep the roots of the epidemic have\nreached. Also, In western Uttar Pradesh, 7 children have died and\nanother hundred are in the hospital in Moradabad. Though the cause of\ndeath is not confirmed, the children were beleived to be suffering\nfrom viral fever.\n\nIt is believed that encephalitis is caused due to mosquitoes that\nbreed in stagnant water. Hygiene is an important factor that plays a\ngreat role in the spiraling of the disease.\n\nIn the last 32 years, more than 7000 people have died of encephalitis\njust at the Gorakhpur Medical College Hospital.

Eastern parts of India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh are\nravaged by encephalitis each year ... but this is one of the worst\noutbreaks, officials said.\n\nThe deaths of 4 more children on Saturday [28 Aug 2010] pushed the\ntoll to 215, with hundreds sick in hospitals in Gorakhpur, an ...\narea of 14 million people, regional health officer UK Srivastava told\nAFP by telephone from Gorakhpur. \"A total of 1324 patients had been\nadmitted in hospitals until Saturday in Gorakhpur,\" which is the\nepicentre of the outbreak, and \"more encephalitis patients are coming\ninto our hospitals,\" Srivastava said.\n\nThe outbreak began in early July [2010]. \"We fear the total number of\nencephalitis cases will go up to at least 3500 and the death rate\nwill be at a ratio of around 20 percent,\" he said.\n\n\"We have begun spraying insecticide to wipe out populations of the\n_Culex_ mosquitoes which transmits the disease [virus] and we're\nhanding out chlorine to villagers to disinfect drinking water\nsupplies,\" Srivastava said.\n\nKP Kushwaha, chief paediatrician at Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College,\nsaid doctors were overwhelmed ... and \"encephalitis usually surfaces\nby August but this year [2010] patients began coming in from early\nJuly\" and if it continues this is going to be \"an impossible task to\nhandle,\" he added.\n\nVS Nigam, in charge of Uttar Pradesh's encephalitis prevention\nprogramme, said a mammoth project to contain the disease had ended\nwith 35 million children vaccinated in the state's 34 districts. But\nas soon children are vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis, they\nfall sick with acute encephalitis syndrome \"because when one virus is\nsuppressed by vaccines, others become dominant,\" he said. \"It's a\nlarge challenge,\" he added.\n\nThe regional chapter of the Voluntary Health Association, India's\nlargest non-governmental organisation, which works alongside the UN\nChildren's Fund (UNICEF), blamed the annual tragedy on the state's\nfailure to effectively immunise children. \"A high alert is sounded\nonly after an encephalitis epidemic flares,\" association executive\ndirector JP Sharma said. \"Preventive steps should be taken well ahead\nof the monsoon as vaccines need an incubation period to make human\nbeings immune to the virus,\" Sharma told AFP [immunity is not\nimmediate following vaccination, there is a time lag during which\ntime the immune system develops antibodies against the antigen\ncontained in the vaccine. - Mod.MPP] .\n\n[Byline: Pratap Chakravarty]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The encephalitis outbreak continues.

The deceased was aged about 74. He was\nadmitted to Gauhati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) with high fever\nwhere he was diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis. One more patient\nfrom the village is undergoing treatment at the hospital.\n\nThe surfacing of his fatal disease has created panic among the people\nof these areas. The people have alleged that the District Health\nDepartment has taken no serious steps to combat it. The district\nmalaria department sprayed DDT only among 4 families. The district\nmalaria officer opined that as the area is not included in the action\nplan for spraying DDT, they have no right to spray DDT without the\npermission of the higher authority. On the other hand the district\nhealth department, though, sent a bugging vehicle to the affected\nvillage but it miserably failed to discharge smoke due to some\nmechanical defect. Even, the deputy commissioner of Nalbari who is\nthe president of district health society or the joint director of\nhealth services is yet to visit the affected village, which is\nsituated only 8 km [5 mi] away from Nalbari town.\n\nThe panic stricken villagers on Sunday [1 Aug 2010] organised an\nawareness meeting at Barkuriha LP school inviting health and malaria\nofficials. The awareness meeting presided over by Dr Biren Deka was\naddressed among others by Dr Kamal Dev Goswami, health officer of\nKamarkuchi PHC [primary health care], Dr Gokul Patowary, IDS [India\nDevelopment Service], Nalbari, Dipak Tamuli, district malaria\nofficer, Rajib Sarma, media expert NRHM [National Rural Health\nMission], and Ashok Kalita, panchayat [village assembly] president.\n\nThe panicky villagers demanded the health department to immediately\nadminister Japanese encephalitis [virus] vaccine in the village. They\nalso demanded the district administration to shift the piggery farm,\nthe source of this virus, to a areas away from inhabited places.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report does not indicate if these JE virus cases were\nlaboratory confirmed or were presumptive diagnoses. Pigs are\namplifying hosts of JE virus and would have to be relocated well\nbeyond the flight range of the _Culex_ mosquito vectors to avoid\ntransmission to humans in the affected village. Wild birds are the\nreservoir hosts of the virus. This report raises again the conflict\nrelating to use of DDT insecticide for vector control. The _Culex_\nvectors of JE virus are abundant and widely distributed, making their\ncontrol with insecticides difficult logistically and costly.\n\nA map showing the locations of the Indian states can be accessed at\n<http://www.indianorphanages.net/images/india-political-map.gif>.\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of India is available at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/00J->. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (UP) 20100728.2535\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (ML) 20100723.2473\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN) conf. 20100716.2380\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (MN) conf. 20100713.2352\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (MN) susp. 20100711.2323\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (MN) susp 20100707.2261\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (MN) susp 20100630.2185\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (AP) 20100422.1309\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (UP) 20100416.1236\n...................................ty/mj/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Despite claiming close to\n100 lives up to Monday [26 Jul 2010], and with another 550 admitted in\nthe hospitals, scientists and doctors are still groping in the dark\nover the identity of the viral strain.\n\n\"We are sure about one thing, that it is not Japanese encephalitis\nvirus. Only 11.71 per cent of the samples have tested positive for\nJapanese encephalitis virus, while the rest are still unknown,\"\nclaimed director general (medical & health) Dr RR Bharti.\n\nWhen even the local unit of the National Institute of Virology (NIV)\nPune, based in Gorakhpur, failed to arrive at any conclusion, Bharti\nrequested the Union Health Ministry to intervene. A team of Union\nHealth Ministry officials and scientists from the Indian Council of\nMedical Research (ICMR) -- along with Bharti and Dr SP Ram -- visited\nGorakhpur on Saturday [24 Jul 2010]. However, they also failed to\ndiagnose the viral strain causing deaths of children in the region.\n\"At times, it shows symptoms of an enterovirus [meningitis?] but not\nuniformly, so we cannot arrive at any concrete conclusion,\" said Bharti.\n\nMeanwhile, the official daily bulletin at the State Health Directorate\nreported 94 deaths due to the mystery virus, with another 543 admitted\nto hospital.\n\nOn the other hand, the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) and nearly\nhalf a dozen public representatives have raised [questions] about the\nfunctioning of the Health Department. SHRC has sought explanation from\nthe Health Department over the rising number of children's deaths in\nGorakhpur region. \"We have no answer about this disease, which is\nlocally referred to as Japani bukhar. It is being called acute\nencephalitis syndrome (AES) by medical experts. We are just providing\npreventive measures taken by the department to the concerned\nauthorities,\" said a senior health official.\n\nAccording to the figures at the Control Room in Lucknow, 543 children\nare suffering from AES as of Mon 26 Jul 2010. Another 94 have died,\nwhile 10 have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis virus\ninfection. One child has died due to Japanese encephalitis in\nGorakhpur also.\n\nLocal health activist Dr RN Singh claimed that \"The actual number of\ndeaths have surpassed 100 in Gorakhpur region.\"\n\nState health officials have issued directives that the children be\ntreated at the local health centre level. In a letter by Bharti,\ndistrict health officials in Purvanchal have been directed to refer\nonly serious cases to Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur.\n\"When the medical college has failed to diagnose the disease, it is\nsimply not possible that local health centres provide proper\nhealthcare to these children,\" said RN Singh.\n\nMeanwhile, state health officials narrate their efforts in combating\nthe Japanese encephalitis menace. A separate ward with 126 beds has\nbeen constructed at a cost of Rs 5.88 crore [USD 1.26 million]. Nearly\n3.5 crore [35 million] children were vaccinated against Japanese\nencephalitis in 2009. An extensive awareness campaign has been\nlaunched in the region, with special emphasis on sanitation and\ncleanliness.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap alerts via\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Previously, in mid-April 2010, Mod.TY commented that the region of\nGorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh reported over 500 encephalitis cases last\nyear (2009), some due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and others\nwere described as acute encephalitis of undefined etiology but not due\nto JEV infections. There is no information indicating how many of\nthese current cases are due to JEV and how many to another etiological\nagent, perhaps enteroviruses or Nipah virus.\n\nThere appears to have been little progress in establishing the\nidentity of the non-Japanese encephalitis virus presumed to be\nresponsible for as many as 88 percent of cases of acute pediatric\nillness in Uttar Pradesh. The undiagnosed illness has been graced with\nthe designation acute encephalitis syndrome, but it is unclear whether\na single etiological agent is responsible for this condition. Further\ninformation would be welcomed.\n\nUttar Pradesh is located in the northern part of India. With a\npopulation of over 190 million people, it is India's most populous\nstate.

After issuing a\nnotification, director Y. Yaima asked all hospitals and medical staff\nin private and government health institutes as well as people,\nparticularly in the 4 valley districts where the outbreak has been\nreported, to be on maximum alert.\n\nThe department declared the outbreak of the disease after 34 of the\n40 blood samples sent to the Regional Medical Research Centre,\nDibrugarh, and the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, New\nDelhi, tested positive. Of the 40 samples, 27 were sent to the\nDibrugarh centre.

These are the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, the\ngovernment-run Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital and 2 private hospitals. The\ndepartment has issued guidelines to the hospitals on how to treat\npatients affected by the disease. The director said since Japanese\nencephalitis was a viral infection, there was no curative treatment.\nThe only way to deal with the situation was to continue with\nsymptomatic treatment.\n\nOfficials of the department said since the 1st report of suspected\ncases of the disease came last month [June 2010], fogging had been\nintensified in the valley areas to kill mosquitoes. Officials of the\ndepartment have also stepped up an awareness campaign called\ninformation education campaign in these areas.

Vaccination of the\npopulation at risk seems to be the better approach to reducing the\nnumber of encephalitis cases, should JE virus prove to be the\netiological agent involved.\n\nAn interactive map showing the region where these cases occurred in\nfar eastern India can be accessed at\n<http://www.maplandia.com/india/manipur/imphal/>.\nA map showing the location of states in India, including Manipur, can\nbe accessed at\n<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg>.\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of India can be accessed at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/01Cs>. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (MN) susp 20100630.2185\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (AP) 20100422.1309\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (UP) 20100416.1236\n2009\n---\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (UP) 20091223.4322\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (UP) 20091214.4241\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP) 20091205.4153\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (UP) 20091202.4113\nJapanese encephalitis - India (16): (UP, BR) 20091126.4060\nJapanese encephalitis - India (15): (UP) 20091119.3989\nJapanese encephalitis - India (14): (UP) 20091111.3911\nJapanese encephalitis - India (13): (UP) 20091104.3814\nJapanese encephalitis - India (12): (UP) RFI 20091101.3773\nJapanese encephalitis - India (11): (BR) 20091031.3766\nJapanese encephalitis - India (10): (UP) 20091010.351\nJapanese encephalitis - India (05): (UP) 20090826.3001\nJapanese encephalitis - India (02): (UP, NL, AS) 20090818.2929\nJapanese encephalitis - India (UP): susp, RFI 20090513.1789\nEncephalitis, unidentified - India (03): (UP) 20091001.3420\nEncephalitis, unidentified - India (02): (UP) 20090917.3256\nEncephalitis, unidentified - India: (UP) RFI 20090826.3012\nEncephalitis - India: (UP) RFI 20090826.3000\n...................................sb/ty/mj/lm\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

To confirm the disease blood samples of the patients\nhave been sent to JN Hospital, where facilities for blood testing for\nJapanese encephalitis [virus infection] were recently installed, state\nmalaria officer, Dr H Nimaichand said today [29 Jun 2010].\n\nFacilities for testing blood to confirm other mosquitoborne diseases are\nnow available at RIMS Hospital, JN Hospital, Churachandpur District\nHospital, and Tamenglong District Hospital. With the facilities available\nin the state, [there is no] inconvenience in getting results to confirm the\nkind of disease suffered by a patient related to mosquito bites, the doctor\nsaid. He also said that facility for testing for Japanese encephalitis\n[virus infection] will also be made available in other hospitals at the\nearliest opportunity. Authorities have started taking steps to provide\n[testing] in some selected government hospitals.\n\nStressing the need for cooperation from other government departments,\nChandramani said that the long abandoned pitch dug for the sewerage project\nundertaken by the PWD [public works department] in Imphal areas has become\na favourable egg hatching ground of mosquitoes. Water reservoirs of the\nPHED [Public Health Engineering Department] at different places also need\nto be covered properly.

An 8 month old baby girl was diagnosed with JE and was treated\nat Niloufer hospital. The baby girl has suffered partial paralysis to the\nright side of her body, authorities said.\n\nJapanese encephalitis is an ailment [caused by] a virus transmitted by\n_Culex_ mosquitoes causing inflammation of the membranes in human brain.\nHealth authorities pointed out that the mosquitoes are getting infected\nwith the JE virus from pigs, which are present in large numbers in\nTalabkatta area.\n\nUsually, according to authorities, JE virus [JEV] reproduces in pigs and\nmosquitoes get infected when they feed and take blood meals from pigs. The\nJE virus spills over to the community when the infected mosquito starts\nbiting human population. [Large aquatic habitat birds, such as herons, are\nwildlife reservoirs of JEV. - Mod.TY]\n\nPreventive measures\n-------------------\nTo prevent outbreak of JE in and around Talabkatta, district health\nauthorities conducted a health camp on Wednesday [21 Apr 2010] and took up\nhouse to house survey of the area. The health authorities collected 53\nblood smears. \"We covered nearly 70 houses and distributed medicines,\nincluding Homeo preventive medicines, for children below 15 years. We have\nrequested GHMC [Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation] authorities to\nisolate pigs in the locality,\" said district medical and health officer Dr\nCh Jaya Kumari.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One wonders if the report of blood smears, rather than blood samples for\nJEV serology, is accurate. Perhaps they are looking for malaria infections\nas well. Isolating pigs outside the flight range of _Culex_ mosquitoes may\nprove a difficult task logistically. It is curious that no mention is made\nof applying JEV vaccine if this case is indicative of potential risk of an\noutbreak.\n\nA map showing the location of Indian states, including Andhra Pradesh, can\nbe accessed at\n<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg>.

Department of Communicable Disease\nPrevention and Control, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, 2. Department of Virology, Sahlgrenska\nUniversity Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nClinical specimens from 79 symptomatic\nindividuals with a recent history of travel to\ncountries with verified transmission of influenza\nA(H1N1) virus (North America) were tested with a\nmultiple real-time PCR targeting a broad range of\nagents that may cause acute respiratory\ninfection. This analysis revealed that besides 4\ncases of influenza A(H1N1) virus, other\nrespiratory viruses were diagnosed in almost 60\npercent of the samples. These observations are a\nreminder that many different viral transmissions\noccur simultaneously in countries with ongoing\nspread of influenza A(H1N1) virus. The findings\ndemonstrate that the definition of suspected\ncases by clinical and epidemiological criteria\nhas only a poor capacity for discriminating\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v from other viral infections.\n\nBackground\n\nA new influenza A(H1N1) virus variant has spread\nglobally since its 1st appearance in April 2009\n[1,2] and as of 17 Jun 2009, there were 39 620\ncases reported by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) [3]. On 30 Apr 2009, the European\nCommission suggested a case definition [4], which\nhas been adopted and modified by most authorities\nin the European Union Member States. In agreement\nwith this recommendation, testing for influenza A\nwas recommended in Sweden for cases with a\nclinical presentation including respiratory\nsymptoms and fever above 38 C and epidemiological\ncircumstances such as recent travel (within 7\ndays) to areas where the new influenza has been\nobserved [5] or close contact with confirmed\ncases.\n\nThe regular sentinel surveillance for seasonal\ninfluenza has been extended and now focuses on\nidentification of imported cases with influenza\nA(H1N1) virus, and on preventing secondary\ntransmission by contact tracing and antiviral\nmedication in an attempt to delay sustained\ncommunity transmission. In order to provide a\nbetter basis for the decision whether or not to\ninitiate preventive measures, expanded testing,\ntargeting a broad range of respiratory agents has\nbeen applied to specimens from all suspected\ncases in the region Vastra Gotaland (1.5 million\ninhabitants). We report here the results of this\nexpanded testing.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThis report includes samples of patients who,\nduring the period from 24 Apr to 10 Jun 2009\npresented with influenza-like symptoms and a\nhistory of recent travel to the United States or\nMexico, and therefore were recommended for\nexamination and sampling. This clinical\nexamination was performed by infectious disease\nclinicians on call at Sahlgrenska University\nHostpital/\u00d6stra in Gothenburg, and our report is\nbased on their evaluation and laboratory results.\nIn summary, of all 79 patients included with a\ntravel history, 90 percent presented with\nrespiratory symptoms, 5 percent without\nrespiratory symptoms, and for the remaining 5\npercent this information is not documented. 66\npercent had fever above 38 C, 29 percent had no\nfever; information on fever was missing for 5\npercent. Nasopharyngeal swabs were sent to the\nmolecular diagnostic unit at the virological\nlaboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for\ntesting by a multiple real-time PCR targeting 13\nviruses and 2 bacteria, !\nrun in 6 parallel multiplex PCRs on an ABI 7500\ninstrument [6]. Samples that were reactive for\nthe influenza A component (matrix protein target,\n[7]) of this PCR were subtyped by an additional\nreal-time PCR targeting the haemagglutinin gene,\nrun in 3 parallel reactions specific for the H3N2\nand H1N1 subtypes that have been circulating for\na long time, as well as for the new H1N1v strain.\n[Readers requiring information on the primers and\nprobes used in the real-time PCR are referred to\na Table in the original text].\n\nResults and discussion\n\nIn total, samples from 79 patients were tested\n(42 males, 37 females; median age 30 years, range\n1-75 years), with between 10 and 16 samples on\naverage each week and most of them taken from\npatients with respiratory symptoms and a history\nof recent travel to North America. Four cases\nwith the new influenza A (H1N1)v variant were\ndiagnosed. Interestingly, in 56 percent of the\ncases, other aetiologies were identified (Table).\n\nTable. Viral aetiologies for the patients\nfulfilling definition of suspected cases of\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, Apr-Jun 2009 (n=79)\n\nViral aetiology / Number / Percentage\n\nRhinovirus / 28 / 34\nCoronavirus / 8 / 10\nInfluenza B virus / 3 / 4\nHuman parainfluenza virus types 1-3 / 3 / 3 / 4\nAdenovirus / 2 / 2\nInfluenza A (H1N1) virus / 4 / 5\nMetapneumovirus / 1 / 1\nEnterovirus / 1 / 1\nRespiratory syncytial virus / 0 / 0\nMycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae / 0 / 0\nNegative / 32 / 39\nTotal number / 82 / 100\n\n(Note: 3 patients had double infections with\nrhinovirus, together with enterovirus,\nmetapneumovirus or adenovirus.)\n\nThe most common finding was rhinovirus, observed\nin 28 of 82 cases (34 percent), and 3 of these\npatients also had a 2nd viral infection\n(enterovirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus).\nThe frequent identification of rhinovirus and\nother viruses demonstrates that the criteria for\nsuspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)v are\nrelevant as indicators of a viral infection, but\nnot specific for influenza A. On the other hand,\napplying more restrictive criteria would probably\nhave excluded most infections with the new\nA(H1N1) virus strain, considering that their\nclinical presentation has been reported to be\nrelatively mild. This illustrates a dilemma with\nsurveillance actions aiming at revealing the\nspread of new respiratory infections. If the\napplied criteria are too strict (for example\nfever above 39 C, cough and muscle pain), the\nepidemic is likely to be underestimated, because\nonly the severe cases are identified. If on the\nother hand the criteria are liberal, as\nillustrated by the cur!\nrent epidemic, most of the cases will probably\nhave other aetiologies. The positive predictive\nvalue of clinical criteria for identification of\ninfluenza A is particularly low in the early\nphase of an epidemic, when the incidence of\ninfluenza A is low, but will become relatively\nhigh during the peak when a large proportion of\nrespiratory infections will be due to influenza A\nvirus. The value of broad virology testing\ndecreases in the course of an influenza epidemic,\nwhen the detection rate of other aetiologies may\ndecrease from above 50 percent as observed in\nthis report to below 10 percent during the\ninfluenza peak (unpublished observations from our\nlaboratory).\n\nThe cases with influenza A were analysed further\nby a typing PCR that within 4-5 hours could\nidentify whether the strain was a traditional\nH1N1 or H3N2 virus, or the new H1N1 variant. This\ntyping system targets specific regions of the\nhaemagglutinin gene and has been developed in our\nlaboratory (unpublished). It has proved to have a\ngood sensitivity, as illustrated by cycle\nthreshold (Ct) values that are typically lower\nthan those obtained in the general PCR for\ninfluenza A, which targets a conserved region of\nthe matrix protein gene.\n\nThe results of the multiple PCR used in our\nsetting were available within 24 hours after\nsampling and served at the same time as\nconfirmation for the result of the 1st, general\ninfluenza A PCR. In cases that presented with\ntypical influenza-like symptoms but were negative\nfor influenza A in the 1st PCR, the finding of an\nalternative aetiology was helpful for the\ndecision to refrain from preventive measures.\nSuch measures include oseltamivir treatment of\npatients and influenza testing and prophylactic\ntreatment of their close contacts. The clinical\npractice was not always different, but in some\ncases, the identification of an alternative\naetiology such as rhinovirus was helpful for the\ndecision not to treat the patient of contacts,\neven when the patient had symptoms clearly\nindicative of possible influenza. From this\nexperience, we therefore conclude that a broad\ndiagnostic test is a valuable tool in the early\ninvestigation of a new emerging respiratory virus\nlike the new influ!\nenza A(H1N1)v.\n\n[Note added in proof: On 17 Jun 2009, Sweden\nchanged to a stricter case definition for\nsuspected cases. It now requires more than 2\nsymptoms besides epidemiology and fever.]\n\nReferences\n\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).

The number reported hospitalized from\nmilk powder increased almost 9-fold to 12 892, with 104 in a serious\ncondition, the official China Central Television said on its nightly\nnews broadcast today. Hong Kong authorities have asked the city's\ndoctors to report all cases of kidney illness suspected of being\nconnected with the tainted milk.\n\nChina and Hong Kong have set up hotlines for distributing medical\ninformation to concerned parents and recalled milk products that\ntests show may contain melamine. China's State Administration of\nIndustry and Commerce had paid refunds for 304 tons of dairy products\nas of 9 a.m. yesterday, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.\nIn China, 39 965 children have visited clinics after falling ill from\nthe powder, CCTV said today [21 Sep 2008].\n\nThe Hong Kong girl, who wasn't identified, had been drinking as many\nas 3 cups a day of a high-calcium, low-fat Yili milk, the health\ndepartment's statement said. She has been treated and discharged, it said.\n\nChina's milk-contamination scandal was exposed on [11 Sep 2008] when\nthe Beijing-based Ministry of Health said it found melamine in baby\nformula made by Sanlu Group Co., a domestic producer that's 43\npercent owned by Auckland, New Zealand-based Fonterra Cooperative\nGroup Ltd. It's since widened to include 21 other Chinese dairy\nproducers after tests found the chemical in 69 batches of formula and\n24 batches of liquid milk and yogurt.\n\nMost of the hospitalizations to date were caused by Sanlu products,\nCCTV reported today [21 Sep 2008], citing Ministry of Health\nstatistics, without being more specific. There have been no reported\ncases of sickness caused by drinking liquid milk, CCTV said.\n\nChina's 3 biggest dairy producers by market value -- Yili, China\nMengniu Dairy Co. and Bright Dairy & Food Co. -- are among companies\nwhose products contain melamine, according to the government.\n\nPlunging consumer confidence and increased spending on quality\ncontrol in the aftermath of the scandal will erode earnings of\nChinese dairy companies, said UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Surging\ncosts and government caps on price increases had already crimped\nprofit margins.\n\nChina's dairy market was expected to expand to USD 20 billion this\nyear [2008], from USD 18 billion in 2007, Euromonitor forecast before\nthe melamine scandal.\n\nChina's latest quality-control scandal may also further erode global\nconfidence in exports the world's most-populous country depends on to\nhelp generate 10 million jobs a year. The nation's manufacturers are\nalready grappling with reduced demand from their biggest overseas\ncustomers as growth slows in Japan, the U.S. and Europe.\n\nTaiwan's Department of Health today [21 Sep 2008] ordered King Car\nFood Co. to recall 8 of its products, including instant coffee and\nsoup, that were made in Taiwan with mainland Chinese dairy\ningredients. The company this morning notified Taiwan authorities\nthat the products contained melamine, the health department's statement said.\n\nThe U.S. is testing food, milk and milk-derived products including\nwhey powder that may contain ingredients from China, the Food and\nDrug Administration said in a statement yesterday [20 Sep 2008]. The\nadministration will also step up inspection at ports of entry to keep\nout tainted milk products, the Associated Press reported.\n\nChina yesterday [20 Sep 2008] ordered widespread inspections of dairy\ncompanies and promised to punish anyone responsible. Companies will\nbear the costs of recalls and medical treatment for ailments caused\nby their products, the statement by the State Council said.\n\nChina's Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and\nQuarantine is conducting inspections for melamine at 1548 dairy\ncompanies, according to CCTV. Mengniu, Yili and Bright Dairy have\nissued statements apologizing to customers and pledging to step up\nquality controls.\n\nSuppliers of milk to the dairy companies sought to cut costs by\ndiluting milk and then adding melamine, which makes the protein\ncontent appear artificially higher. Investigations showed that as\nmany as 372 milk stations supplying Sanlu had been adding the\nchemical since as early as April 2005, Yang Chongyong, deputy\ngovernor of Hebei province where Sanlu is based, said on [17 Sep 2008].\n\nNew Zealand authorities took 3 weeks to notify China's central\ngovernment after learning from Fonterra on [14 Aug 2008] that its\nChinese partner Sanlu may be using tainted milk, the New Zealand\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in an e-mailed statement\nyesterday [20 Sep 2008].\n\nNew Zealand relayed the news to China on [9 Sep 2008]. China\nannounced a probe on [10 Sep 2008], and the next day [11 Sep 2008]\nthe Chinese Ministry of Health said milk powder made by Sanlu may\ncause kidney stones in infants.\n\nFonterra Chief Executive Officer Andrew Ferrier last week said local\nofficials in Hebei took too long to issue a public warning of the\ncontamination.\n\n[Byline: Lee Spears and Wendy Leung]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPRO/MBDS <promed-mbds@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above newswire presents the 1st report of problems outside of\nmainland China associated with the ingestion of melamine-contaminated\nmilk products. It also mentions a significant increase in the numbers\nof identified affected children in China -- now 12 892 compared with\n\"more than 6240\" reported in the WHO update on 19 Sep 2008 (see\nPRO/MBDS posting, Infant kidney stones - China (04): WHO,\ninternational recall 20080919.2948 or ProMED-mail posting, Infant\nkidney stones - China (04): WHO, international recall 20080919.2951).\nWith the current increased investigation into presence of the\ncontaminated product in other international markets (see additional\nreports below), it would not be surprising to learn of additional\ncases being identified in other countries that imported these milk\npowder products.\n\nThe above mentioned time-line does not fully match information from\nother newswires and announcements. The 1st posting carried on this\ntopic by PRO/MBDS and ProMED-mail was on 10 Sep 2008 and had\nnewswires from 10 Sep 2008 and 9 Sep 2008 mentioning the clustering\nof kidney stones in infants using one particular milk producer's\nproduct in Gansu Province (see PRO/MBDS posting Infant kidney stones\n- China: Gansu, milk powder susp., RFI 20080910.2827 and ProMED-mail\nposting Infant kidney stones - China: Gansu, milk powder susp., RFI\n20080910.2828).\n\nIn an editorial from the New Zealand Herald published today (21 Sep\n2008), there is mention that Fontera learned of the contamination on\n2 Aug 2008 but did not disclose this information until 11 Sep 2008,\nwhereas the dates given in the above article include knowledge of the\nproblem by Fontera on 14 Aug 2008 and notification on 9 Sep 2008 (see\narticle at:\n<http://www.nzherald.co.nz/food/news/article.cfm?c_id=206&objectid=10533356>).\n\nThe intriguing tidbit in the above newswire is the mention that San\nLu -- one of the key milk powder producers implicated in this current\nscandal related to melamine contamination of milk powder -- mentioned\nthis practice dates back to April 2005. \"Investigations showed that\nas many as 372 milk stations supplying Sanlu had been adding the\nchemical since as early as April 2005, Yang Chongyong, deputy\ngovernor of Hebei province, where Sanlu is based, said on [17 Sep\n2008].\" In a retrospective search of information available on the\ninternet related to milk contamination in China, there was a newswire\ndated 9 May 2007 related to the melamine contamination of pet food\nthat mentioned that other products were tested, including milk\npowder, and were found to be free of melamine (see article at:\n<http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/2007-05-09-petfood-managers-detained_N.htm>).\n\nPRO/MBDS (and ProMED-mail) would be very interested to learn whether\nany of our subscribers had information on the occurrence of kidney\nstones in infants in China related to this melamine contamination of\nmilk products before the PRO/MBDS and ProMED-mail postings on 10 Sep\n2008, perhaps from internet-based chat rooms in China. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[2] Taiwan - melamine identified in milk products\nDate: 19 Sep 2008\nFrom: Eva Tseng <ev.tseng@gmail.com>\n\nIn today's post about infant kidney stones in China (see PRO/MBDS\nposting, Infant kidney stones - China (04): WHO, international recall\n20080919.2948 or ProMED-mail posting, Infant kidney stones - China\n(04): WHO, international recall 20080919.2951), there was a comment\nat the end that Chinese authorities have reported that only 5\ncountries have imported the contaminated baby milk. However, I just\nwanted to point out that, in fact, 25 tons of contaminated Sanlu milk\npowder were imported to Taiwan. Below are news articles about the\nTaiwan Department of Health's efforts to track down and destroy all the powder:\n<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2008/09/15/2003423265>;\n<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/09/17/2003423421>.\n\n--\nEva Tseng\nMD/MPH candidate\nTufts University School of Medicine\n<ev.tseng@gmail.com>\n\n******\n[3] Melamine identified in liquid milk\nDate: 20 Sep 2008\nSource: TVNZ.com [edited]\n<http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/413551/2090743>\n\n\nThe scandal that was 1st confined to baby milk formula has spread to\nliquid milk in China.\n\nTests show 10 percent of the liquid milk supply has been contaminated\nwith melamine, the chemical that has killed 4 infants and left\nthousands more ill.\n\nIn New Zealand, food safety investigators are taking no chances. They\nare now testing Chinese dairy products including milk, tea and yoghurt.\n\n\"There is a small risk that there is contaminated product [moving]\ninto the country, and that's why we are looking at as many as we\ncan,\" says Sandra Daly, of the Food Safety Authority.\n\nIn China, 6000 babies are ill, and more than 20 companies are accused\nof selling products tainted with melamine.\n\nThe only coffee Starbucks is making right now in China is made with\nsoy, as the scandal spreads to everyday drinking milk.\n\nChina has been plagued with problems in the food and drug industry.\nIn 2004, 13 children died from malnutrition from fake milk powder.\n\nLast year [2007], thousands of Chinese-made toys were recalled after\nbeing contaminated with lead paint.\n\nThe food and drug regulator was executed for accepting bribes.\n\nEvery day this week, a new product is being taken off the shelves,\nleaving the Chinese to find a product they can trust and generating\nworld-wide distrust in Chinese goods.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPRO/MBDS <promed-mbds@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] Burundi - ban on Chinese milk products\nDate: 21 Sep 2008\nSource: AFP (Agence France Presse) [edited]\n<http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gy_DFKsCMmxRqTvBqExMMXuT4sBQ>\n\n\nBurundi became the 3rd African nation to ban Chinese milk products,\nafter tainted milk from the country killed 4 babies in China and made\nthousands of others ill, the government said Sunday [21 Sep 2008].\n\n\"The trade, industry and tourism ministry is calling on importers and\nshopkeepers who stock Chinese milk to stop selling the product until\nthe end of an investigation,\" a ministry statement said.\n\n\"This measure also concerns the sellers of repackaged milk, whatever\nits origin,\" added the statement, while urging consumers to keep a\nwatchful eye on the packaging of milk products.\n\nA special commission has been set up to investigate the scale of the\ntainted milk problem in Burundi and \"take urgent measures to protect\nthe population,\" the statement said.\n\nBurundi imports milk products from 2 Chinese companies that are\ncurrently embroiled in the tainted powdered-milk scandal.\n\nFour children have died, and at least 6200 are ill owing to milk\nproducts contaminated with melamine, an industrial chemical used in\nthe manufacturing of plastics.\n\nA Burundi consumer association, known as ABUCO, expressed concern\nthat tainted milk products were already being stocked in the country's shops.\n\n\"For the moment, nobody knows if the milk is being sold on the\nBurundi market,\" said Noel Nkurunziza, the president of ABUCO.\n\nOn Saturday [20 Sep 2008], Gabon and Tanzania banned Chinese milk\nproducts and all Chinese dairy products.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPRO/MBDS <promed-mbds@promedmail.org>\n\n[Burundi and Gabon were 2 of the 5 countries mentioned to be\nimporters of milk powder containing products made by companies\npresently implicated in the contamination of milk products. The other\n3 countries mentioned by the Chinese as importers of these products\nare Bangladesh, Myanmar and Yemen.

The number reported hospitalized from\nmilk powder increased almost 9-fold to 12 892, with 104 in a serious\ncondition, the official China Central Television said on its nightly\nnews broadcast today. Hong Kong authorities have asked the city's\ndoctors to report all cases of kidney illness suspected of being\nconnected with the tainted milk.\n\nChina and Hong Kong have set up hotlines for distributing medical\ninformation to concerned parents and recalled milk products that\ntests show may contain melamine. China's State Administration of\nIndustry and Commerce had paid refunds for 304 tons of dairy products\nas of 9 a.m. yesterday, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.\nIn China, 39 965 children have visited clinics after falling ill from\nthe powder, CCTV said today [21 Sep 2008].\n\nThe Hong Kong girl, who wasn't identified, had been drinking as many\nas 3 cups a day of a high-calcium, low-fat Yili milk, the health\ndepartment's statement said. She has been treated and discharged, it said.\n\nChina's milk-contamination scandal was exposed on [11 Sep 2008] when\nthe Beijing-based Ministry of Health said it found melamine in baby\nformula made by Sanlu Group Co., a domestic producer that's 43\npercent owned by Auckland, New Zealand-based Fonterra Cooperative\nGroup Ltd. It's since widened to include 21 other Chinese dairy\nproducers after tests found the chemical in 69 batches of formula and\n24 batches of liquid milk and yogurt.\n\nMost of the hospitalizations to date were caused by Sanlu products,\nCCTV reported today [21 Sep 2008], citing Ministry of Health\nstatistics, without being more specific. There have been no reported\ncases of sickness caused by drinking liquid milk, CCTV said.\n\nChina's 3 biggest dairy producers by market value -- Yili, China\nMengniu Dairy Co. and Bright Dairy & Food Co. -- are among companies\nwhose products contain melamine, according to the government.\n\nPlunging consumer confidence and increased spending on quality\ncontrol in the aftermath of the scandal will erode earnings of\nChinese dairy companies, said UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Surging\ncosts and government caps on price increases had already crimped\nprofit margins.\n\nChina's dairy market was expected to expand to USD 20 billion this\nyear [2008], from USD 18 billion in 2007, Euromonitor forecast before\nthe melamine scandal.\n\nChina's latest quality-control scandal may also further erode global\nconfidence in exports the world's most-populous country depends on to\nhelp generate 10 million jobs a year. The nation's manufacturers are\nalready grappling with reduced demand from their biggest overseas\ncustomers as growth slows in Japan, the U.S. and Europe.\n\nTaiwan's Department of Health today [21 Sep 2008] ordered King Car\nFood Co. to recall 8 of its products, including instant coffee and\nsoup, that were made in Taiwan with mainland Chinese dairy\ningredients. The company this morning notified Taiwan authorities\nthat the products contained melamine, the health department's statement said.\n\nThe U.S. is testing food, milk and milk-derived products including\nwhey powder that may contain ingredients from China, the Food and\nDrug Administration said in a statement yesterday [20 Sep 2008]. The\nadministration will also step up inspection at ports of entry to keep\nout tainted milk products, the Associated Press reported.\n\nChina yesterday [20 Sep 2008] ordered widespread inspections of dairy\ncompanies and promised to punish anyone responsible. Companies will\nbear the costs of recalls and medical treatment for ailments caused\nby their products, the statement by the State Council said.\n\nChina's Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and\nQuarantine is conducting inspections for melamine at 1548 dairy\ncompanies, according to CCTV. Mengniu, Yili and Bright Dairy have\nissued statements apologizing to customers and pledging to step up\nquality controls.\n\nSuppliers of milk to the dairy companies sought to cut costs by\ndiluting milk and then adding melamine, which makes the protein\ncontent appear artificially higher. Investigations showed that as\nmany as 372 milk stations supplying Sanlu had been adding the\nchemical since as early as April 2005, Yang Chongyong, deputy\ngovernor of Hebei province where Sanlu is based, said on [17 Sep 2008].\n\nNew Zealand authorities took 3 weeks to notify China's central\ngovernment after learning from Fonterra on [14 Aug 2008] that its\nChinese partner Sanlu may be using tainted milk, the New Zealand\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in an e-mailed statement\nyesterday [20 Sep 2008].\n\nNew Zealand relayed the news to China on [9 Sep 2008]. China\nannounced a probe on [10 Sep 2008], and the next day [11 Sep 2008]\nthe Chinese Ministry of Health said milk powder made by Sanlu may\ncause kidney stones in infants.\n\nFonterra Chief Executive Officer Andrew Ferrier last week said local\nofficials in Hebei took too long to issue a public warning of the\ncontamination.\n\n[Byline: Lee Spears and Wendy Leung]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPRO/MBDS <promed-mbds@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above newswire presents the 1st report of problems outside of\nmainland China associated with the ingestion of melamine-contaminated\nmilk products.

Reinert et al. elevated 46 subgenera of aedine\nmosquitoes, many in the genus _Aedes_ , to generic status. The first 2\nauthors are well-respected mosquito taxonomists while the 3rd is a\ntaxonomist specialising in cladistics. The leading medical entomology\njournal in the UK, namely Medical and Veterinary Entomology, published a\npaper by J.M. Medlock et al. (2005, vol.19, 2-21) in which they recognised\nas currently valid the names _Stegomyia aegypti_ and _Stegomyia albopicta_,\nthus accepting the new classification of Reinert et al. (2004).\nFurthermore, several web sites began using the new classification of the\naedine mosquitoes.\nAs a consequence of the above, in a ProMED-mail post of 17 Mar 2005, I said\nthat despite the fact that taxonomic name changes always caused confusion, I\nnevertheless believed ProMED should fall in line and adopt the new\nclassification of Reinert et al. (2004).\nHowever, since then there has been much vigorous debate on the practical\nconsequences of such name changes and challenges to the validity of the\ncladistics used in the Reinert et al. paper. After discussions with many\nmosquito experts, including taxonomists and editors of medical entomology\njournals, I have agreed to accept the consensus of their deliberations. That\nis, more research and interpretation of the Reinert et al. (2004) paper is\nneeded, but in the meantime we should encourage use of the older\nclassification and so maintain usage of the traditional names.\nThus, ProMED favors using the older and more familiar names such as _Aedes\naegypti_, but if a contributor really wishes to adopt the new\nclassification, then the older name must be placed in parentheses after the\n1st use of each new name. For example, _Stegomyia aegypti_ (=_Aedes\naegypti_, see Reinert et al. 2004).\nTo add to these problems, an earlier publication (Reinert 2000) raised the\nsubgenus _Ochlerotatus_ of the genus _Aedes_ to generic status. This change\nwas widely accepted, albeit somewhat grudgingly by some, and has been used\nin publications worldwide over the last 4 years. But the present proposal to\nreturn to the older classification means we need to return _Ochlerotatus_\nto subgeneric level, so for example it is no longer _Ochlerotatus\ntriseriatus_ but once again _Aedes triseriatus_.\nWe are much indebted to John D. Edman, editor of the Journal of Medical\nEntomology, for trying to get us all to agree on a strategy of promoting the\nuse of the older classification. I understand that many journals --\nincluding the Journal of Medical Entomology, the American Journal of\nTropical Medicine and Hygiene, Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology,\nEmerging Infectious Diseases, Journal of the American Mosquito Control\nAssociation, Journal of Vector Ecology, Medical and Veterinary Entomology,\nVector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases -- will adopt the above strategy of\npromoting use of the older classification.\nKey references are :\nReinert J.

One of the more important changes is that the\nsubgenus _Stegomyia_ has been elevated to generic status, and so\n_Aedes aegypti_ become _Stegomyia aegypti_ (which can be abbreviated\nto _St. aegypti_) and _Ae. albopictus_ becomes _Stegomyia albopicta_\nHere the masculine name _albopictus_ has to be feminised to agree\nwith the genus name _Stegomyia_.\nMany other former _Aedes_ species, including vectors such as\n_africanus_ (now _africana_), _bromeliae_, _polynesiensis_ and\n_scutellaris_, are now in the genus _Stegomyia_.\nName changes, especially those involving vectors, always cause\nconfusion to the uninitiated. But I think ProMED should fall in line\nand adopt the reclassification of the aedine mosquitoes. The\nreference for these changes is:-\nReinert, J.F., Harbach, R.E. and Kitching, I.J.

Plague can be carried by various rodents besides prairie dogs,\nincluding squirrels, mice, pack rats, and rock squirrels.\nSigns posted along trails in Bear Creek Lake Park warn horse and bike\nriders to stay away from the prairie dog colony between the lake and US\nHighway 285. Almost the whole colony has been wiped out, but no human\ninfections have been reported. The plague bacillus is carried by fleas on\nrodents. It causes sudden high fever, chills, headache, and swelling and\nextreme pain in a lymph node typically in the groin or axilla. [classic\nsigns of the bubonic form of plague. - Mod.TG\nHuman infection from plague-carrying rodents is rare, but at least one or 2\nhuman cases are reported to the state each year. In half the cases, family\npets have had contact with a rodent and brought the infected fleas home.\nSince 1957, 48 human cases have been recorded in Colorado, 7 of which were\nlinked to prairie dogs, with the remaining cases stemming from other\nrodents, pet contact, or undetermined causes, according to John Pape, an\nepidemiologist with the Colorado Department of Public Health and\nEnvironment. Two of the 7 cases caused by infected prairie dogs were people\nwho skinned infected prairie dogs.\nThe infection among rodents is cyclical, with the plague passing through\ncolonies every 5 to 10 years. The last severe infestation occurred from\n1992 to 1994, hitting colonies across the state. This year, the plague in\nprairie dog colonies has been reported in Adams, Pueblo, and Larimer\ncounties, said Jim Dale, Jefferson County's director of environmental\nhealth services.\n\u00ad\u00ad\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Prairie dogs are often sentinel animals, as they are extremely sensitive\nto _Yersinia pestis_. Prairie dogs and other rodents most often pass plague\nto cats. Lymph nodes on the cat may rupture in the hand of the owner,\nveterinarian, or a child. Bacteria on the hand can easily be transmitted to\nthe face or enter the body through other cutaneous abrasions. Bubonic\nplague may become systemic, invading the lungs and can be passed\npneumonically. Cat-associated human plague often results in the pneumonic\nform of plague in humans (5 of the 23 reported cases in the article: Gage\nKL, Dennis DT, Orloski KA, Ettestad P, Brown TL, Reynolds PJ, et al. Cases\nof cat-associated human plague in the Western US, 1977-1998. Clin Infect\nDis 2000; 30(6): 893-900).
