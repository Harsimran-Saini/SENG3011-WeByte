Some 400 000 people in the developing world have\naccess to the drugs out of 6 million who need them, UN experts here said.\nAccording to the report, the most global epidemic in history is also\nbecoming increasingly feminine. Now, nearly half of all people infected\nbetween the ages of 15 and 49 are women. In Africa, the proportion is\nalmost 60 per cent.\nThe report comes at a time when the world has significantly boosted its\ncommitment and resources to HIV/AIDS, but the need is still far greater,\naccording to the fourth global report by the Joint United Nations Program\non HIV/AIDS released in advance of Sunday's 15th International AIDS\nConference here. \"Over 20 years of AIDS provides us with compelling\nevidence that unless we act now we will be paying later -- a trenchant\nmessage for the countries of Asia and the Pacific,\" said Peter Piot, the\nprogram's executive director, in the report.\nIn Asia, with 60 per cent of the world's population, 7.4 million people are\nliving with HIV. One of every 4 newly-infected people is Asian. The\nepidemic is fueled by drug use, sex work, and sex between men, but it is\nfast moving into the general population, UN experts said. China and India\nhave severe epidemics in a number of provinces, territories, and states. In\nIndonesia and Vietnam, infections among injecting drug users have soared.\n\"There's a . . . window of opportunity to get prevention programs up to\nscale in Asia,\" said Kathleen Cravero, the program's deputy executive\ndirector at a press conference here. \"If we miss it, we will see an\nepidemic the likes of which we never imagined despite what has happened in\nAfrica.\"\nFar from leveling off, in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa infection\nrates are on the rise. In that region alone last year, 3 million people\nbecame sick with HIV. Seven countries in southern Africa report prevalence\nrates -- the percentage of people who have HIV -- of more than 15 per cent.\nThey are Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, and\nZambia.
