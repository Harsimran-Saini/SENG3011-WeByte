The last outbreak of Marburg in Uganda, in 2012, resulted in 20 probable or confirmed cases and 9 deaths in 4 districts of the country (ProMED-mail archive number 20121123.1422035). - Mod.LM\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97.]\nSee Also\nMarburg virus disease - Uganda (06): update 20141022.2888295\nMarburg virus disease - Uganda (05): situational update, new probable cases 20141015.2866171\nMarburg virus disease - Uganda (04): WHO 20141011.2853630\nMarburg virus disease - Uganda (03): no new cases 20141009.2848550\nMarburg virus disease - Uganda (02): suspected cases 20141007.2837671\nMarburg virus disease - Uganda: (KM) RFI 20141005.2834300\n2012\n---\nMarburg virus disease - Uganda (11): WHO 20121123.1422035\n.................................................sb/lm/msp/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["marburg virus disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-09-16 00:00:00", "2014-09-28 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-10-16 00:00:00", "2012-10-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "West Africa 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Liberia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Uganda", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mpigi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Marburg", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kampala", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Guinea", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2888295", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Marburg virus disease - Uganda (06): update", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2888295", "date": "2012-11-10 22:23:24", "main_text": "MARBURG VIRUS DISEASE - UGANDA (10); (KABALE), FATAL\n****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 10 Nov 2012\nSource: Saturday Monitor, National [edited]\nhttp://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/One+year+old+dies+of+Marburg+in+Ibanda/-/688334/1616178/-/aetde2z/-/index.html\n\n\nBoy dies of Marburg virus disease in Ibanda\n-------------------------------------------\nA one-and-half-year old boy has reportedly died of Marburg virus infection at Ruhoko Hospital in Ibanda District.

The death occurred in Bukora Kitumba sub-county in Kabale district. \"It's sad the 5th person has died because the emergency team delayed to reach Kabale on Friday [19 Oct 2012]\", according to Patrick Besigye Keihwa, the Kabale District Chairman.\n\nMeanwhile, the emergency team dispatched to deal with the outbreak has arrived in Kabale. The team will be conducting burials and managing an emergency zone to treat people. Efforts are also underway to track all people who had had contact with the victims, the government said. The authorities urged the public to avoid direct bodily contact with a person suffering from Marburg virus disease and unnecessary public gatherings.\n\nMarburg virus disease, also known as Marburg haemorrhagic fever is transmitted through bodily fluids such as saliva and blood, or by handling infected wild animals such as monkeys. The disease [is caused by a virus belonging] to the same family of viruses as Ebola virus [the family _Filoviridae_], starts with severe headache and leads to haemorrhaging and, in previous outbreaks in Africa, to death in 80 percent or more of cases, usually within 8 to 9 days.\n\nThe last outbreak of Marburg virus disease in Uganda occurred in 2007 and killed 2 miners in the west of the country. The latest outbreak comes after at least 16 people died from Ebola virus disease in August [2012]. In 2000, 425 people contracted Ebola virus disease in Uganda and more than half of them died.\n\nA major outbreak of Marburg virus disease occurred among gold miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1998 and 2000, causing 128 deaths out of 154 cases. An outbreak in Angola in 2004-05 killed 150 people out of 163 cases, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\n[Byline: Goodluck Musinguzi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n****\n[2]\nDate: Fri 19 Oct 2012\nSource: eTN Global Travel Industry News [edited]\nhttp://www.eturbonews.com/31810/refugees-congo-suspected-have-brought-marburg-uganda\n\n\nRefugees from Congo suspected to have brought Marburg to Uganda\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAccording to emerging reports from Southwestern Uganda, there is increasing suspicion of an outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus disease, and affected individuals have been tested and put into a full quarantine. A team of health officials is on the ground, assisted reportedly by security personnel, combing areas where refugees have sought shelter to identify anyone displaying symptoms in line with the early signs of the disease.\n\nOnly 2 weeks ago, Uganda was declared free Ebola virus disease, after an outbreak, also suspected to have been brought into Uganda from the Eastern Congo, which [was responsible for the deaths of] patients and health workers. Marburg virus disease falls into the same category of virus diseases as Ebola virus disease, and while less virulent, is still known to be a disease with a high percentage of fatalities.\n\nDiseases in Congo's rain forests are common but normally contained within a small radius of one or 2 communities. But with the lack of health care structures in that part of the [Democratic Republic of Congo], where at the moment intense fighting is going on, it makes refugees often the main carriers to bring such disease across the border into Uganda, where a much better-equipped health care infrastructure is then compelled to deal with the unwanted 'imports.'\n\nThe local media in Kampala is now starting to pick up on the news, which almost inevitably started to emerge on Twitter as individuals on the ground sent messages out, which were then picked up and retweeted.\n\nThe outbreak comes on the day prior to Uganda's National Bird Watching contest, with the opening ceremony taking place this afternoon at the Uganda Museum in Kampala from where the participating teams were to leave for their chosen locations upcountry and in the national parks.\n\nA full statement is expected later today [19 Oct 2012] from the Ministry of Health, but the Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe has reportedly confirmed that [the causative agent] is Marburg virus, prompting widespread containment measures now unfolding around the affected areas between Kabale and Kisoro.\n\n[Byline: Dr. Wolfgang H.

Kabale District has a common border with Rwanda, but is not directly adjacent to the Democratic Republic of Congo, which lies further to the west.

Transmission does not occur during the incubation period 3 to 9 days). Infection results from contact with blood or other body fluids (faeces, vomitus, urine, saliva, and respiratory secretions) with high virus concentration, especially when these fluids contain blood. Transmission via infected semen can occur; virus has been detected in semen up to 7 weeks after clinical recovery.\n\nPatients become increasingly infectious as their illness progresses, and are most infectious during the phase of severe illness. Close contact with a severely ill patient, during care at home or in hospital, and certain burial practices are common routes of infection. Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries is associated with more severe disease, rapid deterioration, and possibly higher fatality.

The death occurred in Bukora Kitumba sub-county in Kabale district. \"It's sad the 5th person has died because the emergency team delayed to reach Kabale on Friday [19 Oct 2012]\", according to Patrick Besigye Keihwa, the Kabale District Chairman.\n\nMeanwhile, the emergency team dispatched to deal with the outbreak has arrived in Kabale. The team will be conducting burials and managing an emergency zone to treat people. Efforts are also underway to track all people who had had contact with the victims, the government said. The authorities urged the public to avoid direct bodily contact with a person suffering from Marburg virus disease and unnecessary public gatherings.\n\nMarburg virus disease, also known as Marburg haemorrhagic fever is transmitted through bodily fluids such as saliva and blood, or by handling infected wild animals such as monkeys. The disease [is caused by a virus belonging] to the same family of viruses as Ebola virus [the family _Filoviridae_], starts with severe headache and leads to haemorrhaging and, in previous outbreaks in Africa, to death in 80 percent or more of cases, usually within 8 to 9 days.\n\nThe last outbreak of Marburg virus disease in Uganda occurred in 2007 and killed 2 miners in the west of the country. The latest outbreak comes after at least 16 people died from Ebola virus disease in August [2012]. In 2000, 425 people contracted Ebola virus disease in Uganda and more than half of them died.\n\nA major outbreak of Marburg virus disease occurred among gold miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1998 and 2000, causing 128 deaths out of 154 cases. An outbreak in Angola in 2004-05 killed 150 people out of 163 cases, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\n[Byline: Goodluck Musinguzi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n****\n[2]\nDate: Fri 19 Oct 2012\nSource: eTN Global Travel Industry News [edited]\nhttp://www.eturbonews.com/31810/refugees-congo-suspected-have-brought-marburg-uganda\n\n\nRefugees from Congo suspected to have brought Marburg to Uganda\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAccording to emerging reports from Southwestern Uganda, there is increasing suspicion of an outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus disease, and affected individuals have been tested and put into a full quarantine.

The team will be conducting burials and managing an emergency zone to treat people. Efforts are also underway to track all people who had had contact with the victims, the government said. The authorities urged the public to avoid direct bodily contact with a person suffering from Marburg virus disease and unnecessary public gatherings.\n\nMarburg virus disease, also known as Marburg haemorrhagic fever is transmitted through bodily fluids such as saliva and blood, or by handling infected wild animals such as monkeys. The disease [is caused by a virus belonging] to the same family of viruses as Ebola virus [the family _Filoviridae_], starts with severe headache and leads to haemorrhaging and, in previous outbreaks in Africa, to death in 80 percent or more of cases, usually within 8 to 9 days.\n\nThe last outbreak of Marburg virus disease in Uganda occurred in 2007 and killed 2 miners in the west of the country. The latest outbreak comes after at least 16 people died from Ebola virus disease in August [2012].

A statement issued Friday [19 Oct 2012] afternoon said laboratory tests done at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) confirmed 3 samples positive for the highly infectious viral hemorrhagic fever. Preliminary reports from the district indicate that 4 other people had allegedly died of a strange disease since [4 Oct 2012]. This strange disease has now been confirmed as Marburg hemorrhagic fever. Investigations indicate that all the cases occurred among members of the same family in Kiyonjo parish in Kitumba sub-county.\n\nMarburg hemorrhaagic fever is a killer disease caused by a virus and is spread through direct contact with wounds, body fluids like blood, saliva, vomitus, stool and urine of an infected person. A person suffering from Marburg virus disease presents with sudden onset of high fever with any of the following; headache, vomiting blood, joint and muscle pains and bleeding through the body openings, i.e. eyes, nose, gums, ears, anus and the skin.\n\nMarburg is a highly contagious disease and kills in a short time but can easily be prevented [?}. The Ministry of Health is working with stakeholders and other development partners to contain the spread of this disease. The following measures have been put in place in order to limit the spread of this highly infectious disease;\n\n- A team of experts has been dispatched to the district to support both clinical and public health investigations\n- The National Taskforce has reactivated its rapid response committees to quickly act to any emergencies\n- The surveillance team has commenced the active tracing and listing of all possible contacts that were exposed to the suspects and confirmed cases.\n- The Kabale District Taskforce has been reactivated to effectively coordinate programs in the district\n\nThe Ministry of Health urges the general public to observe the following protective measures;\n\n- Report any suspected patient to a nearby health unit\n- Avoid direct contact with body fluids of a person suffering from Marburg by using protective materials like gloves and masks\n- Avoid unnecessary public gatherings\n\nThe Ministry of Health calls upon the public to stay calm as all possible measures are being undertaken to control the situation. For more information and reports of any cases, please contact the Ministry hotline on +256750996034. The country will be kept informed further on the outcome of this health emergency.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Disease Alert\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[The 1st outbreak of this disease occurred in Marburg, Germany, and Belgrade, former Yugoslavia, in 1967 leading to the initial recognition of this disease. The outbreak was associated laboratory work using African green monkeys (_Cercopithecus aethiops_) imported from Uganda. Subsequently, outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa (in a person with a recent travel history to Zimbabwe) and Uganda. The most recent outbreak in Uganda occurred in 2007, and this new outbreak follows closely on an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola virus, another filovirus, in Kibale district, recently declared over by the Ugandan Ministry of Health and WHO.\n\nNeither disease has a vaccine or specific treatment. Ecological studies are in progress to identify the natural reservoir of both Marburg and Ebola. There is evidence that bats are involved, but much work remains to be done to definitively describe the the natural transmission cycle. Monkeys are susceptible to infection but are not considered plausible reservoir hosts as virtually all infected animals die too rapidly to sustain survival of the virus. Infection of humans occurs sporadically.
