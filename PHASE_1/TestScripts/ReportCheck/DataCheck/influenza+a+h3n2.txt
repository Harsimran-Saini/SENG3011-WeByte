It joins an older strain, H3N8, that has been present in the state since 2015, also mainly confined to Northern Nevada.\n\nLocal veterinarians say they haven't seen either flu strain in Las Vegas yet, but warn it's just a matter of time. \"I was shocked it took so long to get here (to Nevada),\" Dr. Travis McDermott, hospital director at Durango Animal Hospital in Las Vegas, said of the new strain. \"It's going to be a big deal, I think.\"\n\nDr. Debbie White, a veterinarian at Craig Road and Lone Mountain animal hospitals, also predicted the illness will spread here. \"People in Vegas, we kind of think we don't have infectious disease and we live in a bubble,\" she said. \"But that's not the case.\"\n\nIn the past, veterinarians typically only recommended the vaccine for dogs traveling to an area where the flu was present. But this year [2018], many vets are telling pet owners it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nThe signs of dog flu resemble those of kennel cough, a highly contagious canine respiratory disease, or even the human infection: coughing, sneezing, fever and lethargy. And like the human flu, dog flu can kill. \"As many as 8 to 10 percent will die from it,\" McDermott said. \"The scary thing about it is that it's extremely contagious,\" though not to humans.\n\nFor dogs boarded at Durango Animal Hospital, the vaccine is mandatory, McDermott said. Dogs who come into close contact with other dogs at locations like parks, kennels or shelters are at higher risk for contracting the virus and also are recommended to be vaccinated.\n\nInfected dogs can transmit the flu for about 3 weeks -- even if they never come down with symptoms -- as can a pet owner who interacts with an infected dog and then a healthy one. In addition to direct contact, the virus can also spread through contaminated objects and a cough or sneeze.\n\n\"The dogs in Las Vegas are naive, (meaning) they've never seen this virus,\" White said. \"And that means just about every dog that encounters the virus is going to become infected.\"\n\nAs in humans, the vaccine, which protects against both strains, isn't 100 percent effective, though it can dampen symptoms if a dog contracts the flu.\n\nHarley, an energetic 1.5-year-old Doberman pinscher, stood perfectly still recently as Dr. Brittney Spurling at the Cheyenne West Animal Hospital administered her flu shot. Veterinarians there have been notifying their clients via email about the concern. That's how Harley's owner, who asked not to be named, heard about the shot.\n\nSpurling said she was particularly worried when colleagues in Reno told her they'd dealt with the Northern Nevada outbreak firsthand and urged dog owners to visit their veterinarian to get the flu vaccine and a booster shot 2 to 4 weeks later. \"We're just trying to hope for the best and prepare for the worst,\" she said.\n\n[Byline: Jessie Bekker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[\"Canine influenza [CI] or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the US, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the United States, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain.\n\n\"In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia, specifically, Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs.

It joins an older strain, H3N8, that has been present in the state since 2015, also mainly confined to Northern Nevada.\n\nLocal veterinarians say they haven't seen either flu strain in Las Vegas yet, but warn it's just a matter of time. \"I was shocked it took so long to get here (to Nevada),\" Dr. Travis McDermott, hospital director at Durango Animal Hospital in Las Vegas, said of the new strain. \"It's going to be a big deal, I think.\"\n\nDr. Debbie White, a veterinarian at Craig Road and Lone Mountain animal hospitals, also predicted the illness will spread here. \"People in Vegas, we kind of think we don't have infectious disease and we live in a bubble,\" she said. \"But that's not the case.\"\n\nIn the past, veterinarians typically only recommended the vaccine for dogs traveling to an area where the flu was present. But this year [2018], many vets are telling pet owners it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nThe signs of dog flu resemble those of kennel cough, a highly contagious canine respiratory disease, or even the human infection: coughing, sneezing, fever and lethargy. And like the human flu, dog flu can kill. \"As many as 8 to 10 percent will die from it,\" McDermott said. \"The scary thing about it is that it's extremely contagious,\" though not to humans.\n\nFor dogs boarded at Durango Animal Hospital, the vaccine is mandatory, McDermott said. Dogs who come into close contact with other dogs at locations like parks, kennels or shelters are at higher risk for contracting the virus and also are recommended to be vaccinated.\n\nInfected dogs can transmit the flu for about 3 weeks -- even if they never come down with symptoms -- as can a pet owner who interacts with an infected dog and then a healthy one. In addition to direct contact, the virus can also spread through contaminated objects and a cough or sneeze.\n\n\"The dogs in Las Vegas are naive, (meaning) they've never seen this virus,\" White said. \"And that means just about every dog that encounters the virus is going to become infected.\"\n\nAs in humans, the vaccine, which protects against both strains, isn't 100 percent effective, though it can dampen symptoms if a dog contracts the flu.\n\nHarley, an energetic 1.5-year-old Doberman pinscher, stood perfectly still recently as Dr. Brittney Spurling at the Cheyenne West Animal Hospital administered her flu shot. Veterinarians there have been notifying their clients via email about the concern. That's how Harley's owner, who asked not to be named, heard about the shot.\n\nSpurling said she was particularly worried when colleagues in Reno told her they'd dealt with the Northern Nevada outbreak firsthand and urged dog owners to visit their veterinarian to get the flu vaccine and a booster shot 2 to 4 weeks later. \"We're just trying to hope for the best and prepare for the worst,\" she said.\n\n[Byline: Jessie Bekker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[\"Canine influenza [CI] or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus.

It joins an older strain, H3N8, that has been present in the state since 2015, also mainly confined to Northern Nevada.\n\nLocal veterinarians say they haven't seen either flu strain in Las Vegas yet, but warn it's just a matter of time. \"I was shocked it took so long to get here (to Nevada),\" Dr. Travis McDermott, hospital director at Durango Animal Hospital in Las Vegas, said of the new strain. \"It's going to be a big deal, I think.\"\n\nDr. Debbie White, a veterinarian at Craig Road and Lone Mountain animal hospitals, also predicted the illness will spread here. \"People in Vegas, we kind of think we don't have infectious disease and we live in a bubble,\" she said. \"But that's not the case.\"\n\nIn the past, veterinarians typically only recommended the vaccine for dogs traveling to an area where the flu was present. But this year [2018], many vets are telling pet owners it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nThe signs of dog flu resemble those of kennel cough, a highly contagious canine respiratory disease, or even the human infection: coughing, sneezing, fever and lethargy. And like the human flu, dog flu can kill. \"As many as 8 to 10 percent will die from it,\" McDermott said. \"The scary thing about it is that it's extremely contagious,\" though not to humans.\n\nFor dogs boarded at Durango Animal Hospital, the vaccine is mandatory, McDermott said. Dogs who come into close contact with other dogs at locations like parks, kennels or shelters are at higher risk for contracting the virus and also are recommended to be vaccinated.\n\nInfected dogs can transmit the flu for about 3 weeks -- even if they never come down with symptoms -- as can a pet owner who interacts with an infected dog and then a healthy one. In addition to direct contact, the virus can also spread through contaminated objects and a cough or sneeze.\n\n\"The dogs in Las Vegas are naive, (meaning) they've never seen this virus,\" White said. \"And that means just about every dog that encounters the virus is going to become infected.\"\n\nAs in humans, the vaccine, which protects against both strains, isn't 100 percent effective, though it can dampen symptoms if a dog contracts the flu.\n\nHarley, an energetic 1.5-year-old Doberman pinscher, stood perfectly still recently as Dr. Brittney Spurling at the Cheyenne West Animal Hospital administered her flu shot. Veterinarians there have been notifying their clients via email about the concern. That's how Harley's owner, who asked not to be named, heard about the shot.\n\nSpurling said she was particularly worried when colleagues in Reno told her they'd dealt with the Northern Nevada outbreak firsthand and urged dog owners to visit their veterinarian to get the flu vaccine and a booster shot 2 to 4 weeks later. \"We're just trying to hope for the best and prepare for the worst,\" she said.\n\n[Byline: Jessie Bekker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[\"Canine influenza [CI] or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus.

This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain.\n\n\"In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2.

There are no human cases at this time.\n\nThe Clinton County Fair Board is working with the Ohio Department of Agriculture and the Clinton County Agricultural Society, along with local and state health officials, to stop further spread of this virus in the animal population. By Friday morning [14 Jul 2017], all swine will have been removed from the Clinton County Fairgrounds.\n\nSwine flu, like any flu virus can be spread, although rare, from pigs to people. Spread of swine flu viruses from pigs to people is thought to happen the same way that human flu viruses are spread; mainly through droplets when infected pigs cough or sneeze.\n\nWhat to do if you get sick:\n- flu symptoms usually include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting or diarrhea;\n- if you are at high risk and you get the flu symptoms, call your health care provider. Tell them about your high risk factors and your symptoms. If you have had recent exposure to pigs, tell them that too;\n- if you are not at high risk and you get flu symptoms after exposure to pigs, seek medical care as you normally would;\n- a health care provider can decide whether influenza testing or treatment is needed;\n- these drugs work better the sooner you start them, so seek medical treatment promptly if you get symptoms and are at high risk.\n\n\"If you have been in contact with swine and are experiencing signs and symptoms of flu-like illness, please consult your medical provider,\" said Dr Terry Holten, Clinton County Health District Medical Director. \"Especially if you are high risk which includes children under 5 years, those with long-term health conditions, like asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, as well as pregnant women and people 65 years and older.\"\n\nThe Clinton County Fair remains open to the public. As with any pet or livestock contact, visitors should continue to wash their hands after petting animals and before eating. Sanitizer stations are available throughout the Clinton County Fairgrounds.\n\nHighland County Junior Fair Coordinator Jana Holbrook said that she has not received any guidance from the Ohio Department of Agriculture at this time.

The animal superstore began a rigorous 72-hour disinfecting process and expects to reopen the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp Wednesday [29 Jul 2015].\n\nA Mason resident took her 6-month-old dog to the Petsmart location on Mason Montgomery Road last week and was told about dog flu. She then noticed some signs in [her dog] and called Misty Vistas Pet Hospital. \"[My dog is] very young and we just got her, so I wouldn't want her to get any more sick and a concern could be that something could be more serious,\" she said. Her veterinarian Dr. Joey Branstutter gave her some antibiotics for her [dog`s] respiratory illness and recommended keeping her in isolation from other dogs. \"I'm definitely going to keep her away from other dogs for a period of 10 days, I know that it is actually more contagious before the onset of everything,\" [the dog owner] said.\n\nBranstutter said there have been no confirmed cases of dog flu at Misty Vistas, including [this dog,] but he has received several calls about it.\n\"Respiratory signs, cough, any kind of gurgling signs, lethargy, lack of appetite, that kind of thing,\" Branstutter said. \"Most cases they are going to pass on their own after 10 to 14 days. About 20 percent of them will progress to a pneumonia and can get more severe, so that's the scary thing about it.\"\n\nExperts are warning pet owners to be extra vigilant in keeping their dogs healthy. Officials advise dog owners to call their veterinarian if they notice the following signs:\n- Coughing\n- Eye or nose discharge\n- Loss of appetite\n- Loss of energy\n\nThe dog flu spreads through direct contact with the contamination, experts said. You can prevent spread of disease by washing your hands after coming in contact with dogs.\n\nPetsmart released a statement on Thursday [23 Jul 2015]:\n\"We have seen multiple cases of canine respiratory illness in dogs in our Mason PetsHotel location. At this point, we have several confirmed cases of canine influenza.\n\n\"Out of caution, we temporarily stopped taking new reservations for the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp. We also contacted all pet parents with pets staying in this hotel to ask them to pick up their pets if possible. In the meantime, pets that remained in our care were monitored around the clock by a PetSmart associate. In partnership with Banfield Pet Hospital, these pets also received multiple visits every day from a Banfield veterinarian.\n\n\"Once pets were safely removed from the hotel, we began a rigorous 72-hour disinfecting process. We expect to reopen the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp tomorrow.\n\n\"The health and well-being of pets is our top priority, and we are going to do everything we can to help contain the spread of this virus and ensure the pets in our PetsHotels receive the best care possible. We are closely monitoring the spread of the virus and will continue to take precautionary action as appropriate.\"\n\nBanfield Pet Hospital also released a statement:\n\n\"At Banfield Pet Hospital we are a full service general practice that treat pets for a variety of reasons, including respiratory symptoms, and have had a few confirmed cases of canine influenza. This is a highly contagious disease that has hit several regions across the country this year, and we recommend pet owners call their veterinarian to discuss treatment if their dog has symptoms that could be related to canine influenza. In line with guidelines from the American Veterinary Medicine Association, we have taken all appropriate and necessary cautions to prevent the spread of this virus, as we do for any potentially contagious illness.

The animal superstore began a rigorous 72-hour disinfecting process and expects to reopen the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp Wednesday [29 Jul 2015].\n\nA Mason resident took her 6-month-old dog to the Petsmart location on Mason Montgomery Road last week and was told about dog flu. She then noticed some signs in [her dog] and called Misty Vistas Pet Hospital. \"[My dog is] very young and we just got her, so I wouldn't want her to get any more sick and a concern could be that something could be more serious,\" she said. Her veterinarian Dr. Joey Branstutter gave her some antibiotics for her [dog`s] respiratory illness and recommended keeping her in isolation from other dogs. \"I'm definitely going to keep her away from other dogs for a period of 10 days, I know that it is actually more contagious before the onset of everything,\" [the dog owner] said.\n\nBranstutter said there have been no confirmed cases of dog flu at Misty Vistas, including [this dog,] but he has received several calls about it.\n\"Respiratory signs, cough, any kind of gurgling signs, lethargy, lack of appetite, that kind of thing,\" Branstutter said. \"Most cases they are going to pass on their own after 10 to 14 days. About 20 percent of them will progress to a pneumonia and can get more severe, so that's the scary thing about it.\"\n\nExperts are warning pet owners to be extra vigilant in keeping their dogs healthy. Officials advise dog owners to call their veterinarian if they notice the following signs:\n- Coughing\n- Eye or nose discharge\n- Loss of appetite\n- Loss of energy\n\nThe dog flu spreads through direct contact with the contamination, experts said. You can prevent spread of disease by washing your hands after coming in contact with dogs.\n\nPetsmart released a statement on Thursday [23 Jul 2015]:\n\"We have seen multiple cases of canine respiratory illness in dogs in our Mason PetsHotel location. At this point, we have several confirmed cases of canine influenza.\n\n\"Out of caution, we temporarily stopped taking new reservations for the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp. We also contacted all pet parents with pets staying in this hotel to ask them to pick up their pets if possible. In the meantime, pets that remained in our care were monitored around the clock by a PetSmart associate. In partnership with Banfield Pet Hospital, these pets also received multiple visits every day from a Banfield veterinarian.\n\n\"Once pets were safely removed from the hotel, we began a rigorous 72-hour disinfecting process. We expect to reopen the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp tomorrow.\n\n\"The health and well-being of pets is our top priority, and we are going to do everything we can to help contain the spread of this virus and ensure the pets in our PetsHotels receive the best care possible. We are closely monitoring the spread of the virus and will continue to take precautionary action as appropriate.\"\n\nBanfield Pet Hospital also released a statement:\n\n\"At Banfield Pet Hospital we are a full service general practice that treat pets for a variety of reasons, including respiratory symptoms, and have had a few confirmed cases of canine influenza. This is a highly contagious disease that has hit several regions across the country this year, and we recommend pet owners call their veterinarian to discuss treatment if their dog has symptoms that could be related to canine influenza. In line with guidelines from the American Veterinary Medicine Association, we have taken all appropriate and necessary cautions to prevent the spread of this virus, as we do for any potentially contagious illness.

The animal superstore began a rigorous 72-hour disinfecting process and expects to reopen the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp Wednesday [29 Jul 2015].\n\nA Mason resident took her 6-month-old dog to the Petsmart location on Mason Montgomery Road last week and was told about dog flu. She then noticed some signs in [her dog] and called Misty Vistas Pet Hospital. \"[My dog is] very young and we just got her, so I wouldn't want her to get any more sick and a concern could be that something could be more serious,\" she said. Her veterinarian Dr. Joey Branstutter gave her some antibiotics for her [dog`s] respiratory illness and recommended keeping her in isolation from other dogs. \"I'm definitely going to keep her away from other dogs for a period of 10 days, I know that it is actually more contagious before the onset of everything,\" [the dog owner] said.\n\nBranstutter said there have been no confirmed cases of dog flu at Misty Vistas, including [this dog,] but he has received several calls about it.\n\"Respiratory signs, cough, any kind of gurgling signs, lethargy, lack of appetite, that kind of thing,\" Branstutter said. \"Most cases they are going to pass on their own after 10 to 14 days. About 20 percent of them will progress to a pneumonia and can get more severe, so that's the scary thing about it.\"\n\nExperts are warning pet owners to be extra vigilant in keeping their dogs healthy. Officials advise dog owners to call their veterinarian if they notice the following signs:\n- Coughing\n- Eye or nose discharge\n- Loss of appetite\n- Loss of energy\n\nThe dog flu spreads through direct contact with the contamination, experts said. You can prevent spread of disease by washing your hands after coming in contact with dogs.\n\nPetsmart released a statement on Thursday [23 Jul 2015]:\n\"We have seen multiple cases of canine respiratory illness in dogs in our Mason PetsHotel location. At this point, we have several confirmed cases of canine influenza.\n\n\"Out of caution, we temporarily stopped taking new reservations for the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp. We also contacted all pet parents with pets staying in this hotel to ask them to pick up their pets if possible. In the meantime, pets that remained in our care were monitored around the clock by a PetSmart associate. In partnership with Banfield Pet Hospital, these pets also received multiple visits every day from a Banfield veterinarian.\n\n\"Once pets were safely removed from the hotel, we began a rigorous 72-hour disinfecting process. We expect to reopen the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp tomorrow.\n\n\"The health and well-being of pets is our top priority, and we are going to do everything we can to help contain the spread of this virus and ensure the pets in our PetsHotels receive the best care possible. We are closely monitoring the spread of the virus and will continue to take precautionary action as appropriate.\"\n\nBanfield Pet Hospital also released a statement:\n\n\"At Banfield Pet Hospital we are a full service general practice that treat pets for a variety of reasons, including respiratory symptoms, and have had a few confirmed cases of canine influenza. This is a highly contagious disease that has hit several regions across the country this year, and we recommend pet owners call their veterinarian to discuss treatment if their dog has symptoms that could be related to canine influenza. In line with guidelines from the American Veterinary Medicine Association, we have taken all appropriate and necessary cautions to prevent the spread of this virus, as we do for any potentially contagious illness.

The animal superstore began a rigorous 72-hour disinfecting process and expects to reopen the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp Wednesday [29 Jul 2015].\n\nA Mason resident took her 6-month-old dog to the Petsmart location on Mason Montgomery Road last week and was told about dog flu. She then noticed some signs in [her dog] and called Misty Vistas Pet Hospital. \"[My dog is] very young and we just got her, so I wouldn't want her to get any more sick and a concern could be that something could be more serious,\" she said. Her veterinarian Dr. Joey Branstutter gave her some antibiotics for her [dog`s] respiratory illness and recommended keeping her in isolation from other dogs. \"I'm definitely going to keep her away from other dogs for a period of 10 days, I know that it is actually more contagious before the onset of everything,\" [the dog owner] said.\n\nBranstutter said there have been no confirmed cases of dog flu at Misty Vistas, including [this dog,] but he has received several calls about it.\n\"Respiratory signs, cough, any kind of gurgling signs, lethargy, lack of appetite, that kind of thing,\" Branstutter said. \"Most cases they are going to pass on their own after 10 to 14 days. About 20 percent of them will progress to a pneumonia and can get more severe, so that's the scary thing about it.\"\n\nExperts are warning pet owners to be extra vigilant in keeping their dogs healthy. Officials advise dog owners to call their veterinarian if they notice the following signs:\n- Coughing\n- Eye or nose discharge\n- Loss of appetite\n- Loss of energy\n\nThe dog flu spreads through direct contact with the contamination, experts said. You can prevent spread of disease by washing your hands after coming in contact with dogs.\n\nPetsmart released a statement on Thursday [23 Jul 2015]:\n\"We have seen multiple cases of canine respiratory illness in dogs in our Mason PetsHotel location. At this point, we have several confirmed cases of canine influenza.\n\n\"Out of caution, we temporarily stopped taking new reservations for the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp. We also contacted all pet parents with pets staying in this hotel to ask them to pick up their pets if possible. In the meantime, pets that remained in our care were monitored around the clock by a PetSmart associate. In partnership with Banfield Pet Hospital, these pets also received multiple visits every day from a Banfield veterinarian.\n\n\"Once pets were safely removed from the hotel, we began a rigorous 72-hour disinfecting process. We expect to reopen the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp tomorrow.\n\n\"The health and well-being of pets is our top priority, and we are going to do everything we can to help contain the spread of this virus and ensure the pets in our PetsHotels receive the best care possible. We are closely monitoring the spread of the virus and will continue to take precautionary action as appropriate.\"\n\nBanfield Pet Hospital also released a statement:\n\n\"At Banfield Pet Hospital we are a full service general practice that treat pets for a variety of reasons, including respiratory symptoms, and have had a few confirmed cases of canine influenza. This is a highly contagious disease that has hit several regions across the country this year, and we recommend pet owners call their veterinarian to discuss treatment if their dog has symptoms that could be related to canine influenza. In line with guidelines from the American Veterinary Medicine Association, we have taken all appropriate and necessary cautions to prevent the spread of this virus, as we do for any potentially contagious illness. The dog flu has been confirmed in the Greater Cincinnati area.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Readers are encouraged to read my comments in ProMED-mail post 20150723.3529872.

But contrary to widespread rumor, there is no hard data yet, nor even strong circumstantial evidence, to link the H3N2 outbreak to rescues of dogs from Asian meat markets.\n\nRescue agencies in recent months are known to have transported fewer than 100 dogs to the US from the regions of Asia where the H3N2 canine influenza virus occurs. None of those dogs are known to have reached the US Midwest. While the possibility of the H3N2 virus moving with a rescue dog cannot be totally excluded, there are many other ways in which it might have come to the US.\n\nThe simplest scenario might be that an infected sniffer dog might have sneezed while inspecting outbound cargo at an Asian airport. The H3N2 virus -- or almost any flu virus -- could remain alive and infectious for far longer than the 13:35 duration of a flight from Seoul to Chicago.\n\nUpon arrival in Chicago, a US sniffer dog inspecting incoming cargo might have inhaled the virus. Since most dogs do not suffer severe clinical signs from canine influenzas, and since the viruses usually have an incubation period of up to a week, the infected US dog might have spread the virus to any number of others before any US dogs fell seriously ill.\n\nThe H3N2 virus was detected in the US, CBS News reported on 5 Apr 2015, \"after several dogs at PetSmart boarding facilities got sick. The company temporarily closed 3 Chicago-area locations to be disinfected.\"\n\nThe hum increased to a shriek after Audie Cornish of National Public Radio on 15 Apr 2015 interviewed Edward Dubovi of the Cornell University Department of Population Medicine & Diagnostics and Cornell School of Veterinary Medicine. \"The outbreak really went into full force around the Easter holiday,\" explained Dubovi, \"when a number of people probably put their dogs into kennels, and so you had maybe a higher collection of dogs in smaller environments. And so this thing (the virus) had an opportunity to expand very rapidly.\n\n\"We've had a [canine influenza] virus in the dog population in the United States since 2004,\" Dubovi continued, referring to an outbreak of canine influenza that began among racing greyhounds. But that outbreak turned out to be a mutated form of the H3N8 equine influenza virus, identified in racehorses for more than 40 years. Occurring in racehorses in 13 nations during 2004, H3N8 somehow jumped into greyhounds at tracks in 11 US states -- several of which were dual-purpose tracks, used for both horse and greyhound racing, or had been used for both horse and greyhound racing at some time in the past.\n\n\"As we did some subsequent testing and the outbreak got a bit bigger,\" Dubovi went on, \"it became evident that this was not the normal canine influenza virus that we have been seeing in the US. And the preliminary evidence so far is that this virus is probably one that came out of Asia. And as it turns out, our requirements for movement of companion animals into the United States are fairly lax. And we certainly have situations now,\" Dubovi speculated, \"where animal rescue groups are rescuing dogs in China and Korea from their meat markets, and we know for a fact that, in fact, some of those dogs have found their way into the Chicago area.\"\n\nAsked by ANIMALS 24-7 for particulars of that allegation, Dubovi offered none, but referred ANIMALS 24-7 to Maddie's Fund assistant professor of shelter medicine Cynda Crawford, of the University of Florida at Gainesville. Crawford, the lead researcher in identifying the H3N8 canine influenza virus in 2004, had recently been in Chicago investigating the H3N2 outbreak, Dubovi said. \"I generally keep to the business of disease diagnostics and test reporting,\" Dubovi told ANIMALS 24-7. \"I have probably reviewed most of the papers out of China and Korea about H3N2 and have been concerned about the appearance of this virus in the US, as it appears to be more pathogenic than our H3N8,\" Dubovi added.\n\nCynda Crawford had more questions than answers. Crawford was aware that Humane Society International (HIS) and the Change for Animals Foundation in January 2015 flew 23 dogs who had been rescued from a dog meat farm from Seoul, South Korea to Washington, DC. Two months later, in March 2015, HSI and the Change for Animals Foundation flew another 57 dogs from a South Korean dog meat farm to San Francisco [California].\n\nBut the 1st 23 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, the Fairfax County Animal Shelter, the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, the City of Manassas Animal Control & Adoption Shelter, Loudoun County Animal Services [all in Virginia], and the Washington Animal Rescue League [in Washington, DC] -- all about 700 miles from Chicago.\n\nThe 2nd 57 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the San Francisco SPCA, the East Bay SPCA, the Marin Humane Society, and the Sacramento SPCA [all in California] -- all more than 2000 miles from Chicago.\n\n\"I am afraid I don't have any more information than what can be found on the Internet,\" Crawford told ANIMALS 24-7. \"I certainly support the laudable work of HSI, the Change for Animals Foundation, the Asia Canine Protection Alliance, and other international animal welfare groups to stop the dog meat farming and trade. There is no evidence that I know of for inadvertent introduction of the Asian H3N2 virus via their efforts.\n\n\"The importation of South Korean dogs to shelters in north Virginia in early January would be within the time frame of the start of the Chicago cases in late January/early February,\" Crawford acknowledged. \"However, I do not know if any of these Korean dogs or any dogs that had contact with them made it to Chicago. I am curious if the dogs had respiratory signs on arrival to stateside shelters, or shortly thereafter, and were considered to have 'kennel cough' associated with the stress of long distance travel. It would also be interesting to know if any of the resident dogs in the receiving shelters developed 'kennel cough' after the arrival of the Korean dogs.\"\n\nBut several layers of biosecurity requirements for importing dogs into the US -- if observed -- would appear to preclude any of the dogs rescued by Humane Society International and the Change for Animals Foundation being infected with H3N2.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control & Prevention [CDC] requires dogs \"be vaccinated against rabies and be healthy upon arrival,\" summarizes https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/461/~/quarantine-requirements-for-imported-dogs,-including-puppies.\n\n\"Dogs that have never been vaccinated against rabies must be vaccinated at least 30 days before entering the United States,\" the site adds. \"Puppies must not be vaccinated against rabies before 3 months of age, so the youngest that a puppy can be imported into the United States is 4 months of age. The rabies vaccination requirement applies to all dogs including service animals. The only exception is for dogs arriving from areas designated as being rabies-free who have lived there for at least the last 6 months or since birth.\"\n\nThe CDC requirement implies that imported dogs must have been under health observation and in secure custody, if not actual quarantine, for more than 4 times longer than the normal incubation period for canine influenza.\n\nThe USDA Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service on 18 Aug 2014 introduced an even stricter rule governing the import of dogs \"from any part of the world into the continental United States or Hawaii for purposes of resale, research, or veterinary treatment, unless the dogs are in good health, have received all necessary vaccinations, and are at least 6 months of age,\" according to the regulatory language. Specifically, USDA-APHIS requires vaccinations for rabies and distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Moreover, the USDA-APHIS rule was introduced with text specifically rejecting exemptions for \"imports for rescue purposes.\"\n\n\"Because the canine flu viruses are a quick-hit virus with short shedding periods,\" explained Crawford, \"it would seem difficult to import an infected dog who was still in the contagious period. That said,\" Crawford cautioned, \"the biggest flu outbreak in Australia occurred in horses in 2007. Australia was an equine influenza-free country and this status was maintained by strict quarantine of imported horses for 3 weeks. In 2007, equine influenza virus was brought into the country via an infected horse, possibly due to a breach in quarantine, and the virus spread like wildfire to hundreds of horses with many deaths. Like the canine virus, the equine flu virus also is a quick-hit, short shedding period (7 days) virus.\"\n\n\"The H3N2 virus,\" Crawford elaborated, \"is typically shed for 7 days, possibly 10 days in some cases. The incubation period is typically 2-3 days, meaning the virus is already in day 2-3 of its short 7-10 day shedding cycle by the time dogs start coughing. A subset of dogs have subclinical infection -- they shed virus for a few days but do not display clinical signs. The flu viruses do not persist in the environment for more than 12-24 hours, depending on ambient conditions,\" meaning that H3N2 might survive outside of a host animal for the duration of a direct flight from South East Asia, but would probably not survive for longer unless flown in a frozen form. \"Flu viruses can be viable after freeze/thawing,\" Crawford noted.\n\nBut while the temperatures in aircraft holds often dropped below freezing in earlier generations of high-flying jets, the Boeing and Airbus jets usually used on transoceanic flights today typically maintain hold temperatures of close to 40 degrees Fahrenheit [5 degrees Celsius].\n\n\"Obviously, there are many potential routes by which this virus could breach our borders,\" Crawford said. \"We may never know how the H3N2 virus was introduced into the US -- the most important thing right now is finding out how to stop the spread.\"\n\n\"There are likely more questions than answers,\" agreed Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases infectious disease moderator Tam Garland of Texas A&M University, at http://www.promedmail.org. \"For example, did the strain originate in birds? How did it adapt to dogs? How long did it take to adapt to dogs if it came from avians? Did it pass through an intermediate host such as humans or pigs prior to adapting to dogs? Does it present a risk to humans? The risk to humans is likely small,\" Garland anticipated, \"or we would have had affected human caretakers of these affected dogs coming down with this strain of the flu.\"\n\nResponded Crawford to the question of avian origin, which might suggest a link to the illegal but extensive commerce between the US and Southeast Asia in gamecocks, \"The H3N2 canine virus evolved from avian H3N2 viruses in Korea, but several mutations have occurred over the years associated with adaptation to the dog as the new host. I think these mutations have distanced the dog virus from the bird virus. There are several published papers on the phylogenetics of the dog H3N2 virus compared to avian and human H3N2 viruses.\"\n\nConcerning the potential risk to humans, Dubovi told Audie Cornish of NPR, \"Right now we have no evidence that the virus is moving from the dogs into the human population,\" but that does not mean such a cross-species infection could not happen. \"If you had a sick dog in your house,\" Dubovi said, \"you could transmit the virus to another animal in the house through what we call fomites -- just saliva, or if a dog sneezes on you, and you move to another animal.\" Dubovi warned that \"The Asian variety of the flu also can infect cats. There is a vaccine against the US variety,\" Dubovi said, but cautioned, \"We are unable at this point in time to indicate whether or not it will afford any protection against the virus we think is coming from Asia. \"The best thing to do right now until this calms down,\" Dubovi advised, \"is to keep dogs separated as much as possible. The fewer contacts your dog has with another dog, the lesser the chance of it picking this particular virus up, or any other virus for that matter.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nMerritt Clifton\nEditor\nhttp://www.animals24-7.org\n\n[Subsequent to this posting on Animals 27-7, it was noted by Mr Clifton:\n\n\"After posting 'Canine influenza, dog meat, & the rescue connection,' I became aware of an independent rescuer, not affiliated with any organization larger than her own, who claims to have imported 23 dogs from South Korea, 1 or 2 at a time, between January 2014 and late January 2015.

But contrary to widespread rumor, there is no hard data yet, nor even strong circumstantial evidence, to link the H3N2 outbreak to rescues of dogs from Asian meat markets.\n\nRescue agencies in recent months are known to have transported fewer than 100 dogs to the US from the regions of Asia where the H3N2 canine influenza virus occurs. None of those dogs are known to have reached the US Midwest. While the possibility of the H3N2 virus moving with a rescue dog cannot be totally excluded, there are many other ways in which it might have come to the US.\n\nThe simplest scenario might be that an infected sniffer dog might have sneezed while inspecting outbound cargo at an Asian airport. The H3N2 virus -- or almost any flu virus -- could remain alive and infectious for far longer than the 13:35 duration of a flight from Seoul to Chicago.\n\nUpon arrival in Chicago, a US sniffer dog inspecting incoming cargo might have inhaled the virus. Since most dogs do not suffer severe clinical signs from canine influenzas, and since the viruses usually have an incubation period of up to a week, the infected US dog might have spread the virus to any number of others before any US dogs fell seriously ill.\n\nThe H3N2 virus was detected in the US, CBS News reported on 5 Apr 2015, \"after several dogs at PetSmart boarding facilities got sick. The company temporarily closed 3 Chicago-area locations to be disinfected.\"\n\nThe hum increased to a shriek after Audie Cornish of National Public Radio on 15 Apr 2015 interviewed Edward Dubovi of the Cornell University Department of Population Medicine & Diagnostics and Cornell School of Veterinary Medicine. \"The outbreak really went into full force around the Easter holiday,\" explained Dubovi, \"when a number of people probably put their dogs into kennels, and so you had maybe a higher collection of dogs in smaller environments. And so this thing (the virus) had an opportunity to expand very rapidly.\n\n\"We've had a [canine influenza] virus in the dog population in the United States since 2004,\" Dubovi continued, referring to an outbreak of canine influenza that began among racing greyhounds. But that outbreak turned out to be a mutated form of the H3N8 equine influenza virus, identified in racehorses for more than 40 years. Occurring in racehorses in 13 nations during 2004, H3N8 somehow jumped into greyhounds at tracks in 11 US states -- several of which were dual-purpose tracks, used for both horse and greyhound racing, or had been used for both horse and greyhound racing at some time in the past.\n\n\"As we did some subsequent testing and the outbreak got a bit bigger,\" Dubovi went on, \"it became evident that this was not the normal canine influenza virus that we have been seeing in the US. And the preliminary evidence so far is that this virus is probably one that came out of Asia. And as it turns out, our requirements for movement of companion animals into the United States are fairly lax. And we certainly have situations now,\" Dubovi speculated, \"where animal rescue groups are rescuing dogs in China and Korea from their meat markets, and we know for a fact that, in fact, some of those dogs have found their way into the Chicago area.\"\n\nAsked by ANIMALS 24-7 for particulars of that allegation, Dubovi offered none, but referred ANIMALS 24-7 to Maddie's Fund assistant professor of shelter medicine Cynda Crawford, of the University of Florida at Gainesville. Crawford, the lead researcher in identifying the H3N8 canine influenza virus in 2004, had recently been in Chicago investigating the H3N2 outbreak, Dubovi said. \"I generally keep to the business of disease diagnostics and test reporting,\" Dubovi told ANIMALS 24-7. \"I have probably reviewed most of the papers out of China and Korea about H3N2 and have been concerned about the appearance of this virus in the US, as it appears to be more pathogenic than our H3N8,\" Dubovi added.\n\nCynda Crawford had more questions than answers. Crawford was aware that Humane Society International (HIS) and the Change for Animals Foundation in January 2015 flew 23 dogs who had been rescued from a dog meat farm from Seoul, South Korea to Washington, DC. Two months later, in March 2015, HSI and the Change for Animals Foundation flew another 57 dogs from a South Korean dog meat farm to San Francisco [California].\n\nBut the 1st 23 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, the Fairfax County Animal Shelter, the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, the City of Manassas Animal Control & Adoption Shelter, Loudoun County Animal Services [all in Virginia], and the Washington Animal Rescue League [in Washington, DC] -- all about 700 miles from Chicago.\n\nThe 2nd 57 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the San Francisco SPCA, the East Bay SPCA, the Marin Humane Society, and the Sacramento SPCA [all in California] -- all more than 2000 miles from Chicago.\n\n\"I am afraid I don't have any more information than what can be found on the Internet,\" Crawford told ANIMALS 24-7. \"I certainly support the laudable work of HSI, the Change for Animals Foundation, the Asia Canine Protection Alliance, and other international animal welfare groups to stop the dog meat farming and trade. There is no evidence that I know of for inadvertent introduction of the Asian H3N2 virus via their efforts.\n\n\"The importation of South Korean dogs to shelters in north Virginia in early January would be within the time frame of the start of the Chicago cases in late January/early February,\" Crawford acknowledged. \"However, I do not know if any of these Korean dogs or any dogs that had contact with them made it to Chicago. I am curious if the dogs had respiratory signs on arrival to stateside shelters, or shortly thereafter, and were considered to have 'kennel cough' associated with the stress of long distance travel. It would also be interesting to know if any of the resident dogs in the receiving shelters developed 'kennel cough' after the arrival of the Korean dogs.\"\n\nBut several layers of biosecurity requirements for importing dogs into the US -- if observed -- would appear to preclude any of the dogs rescued by Humane Society International and the Change for Animals Foundation being infected with H3N2.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control & Prevention [CDC] requires dogs \"be vaccinated against rabies and be healthy upon arrival,\" summarizes https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/461/~/quarantine-requirements-for-imported-dogs,-including-puppies.\n\n\"Dogs that have never been vaccinated against rabies must be vaccinated at least 30 days before entering the United States,\" the site adds. \"Puppies must not be vaccinated against rabies before 3 months of age, so the youngest that a puppy can be imported into the United States is 4 months of age. The rabies vaccination requirement applies to all dogs including service animals. The only exception is for dogs arriving from areas designated as being rabies-free who have lived there for at least the last 6 months or since birth.\"\n\nThe CDC requirement implies that imported dogs must have been under health observation and in secure custody, if not actual quarantine, for more than 4 times longer than the normal incubation period for canine influenza.\n\nThe USDA Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service on 18 Aug 2014 introduced an even stricter rule governing the import of dogs \"from any part of the world into the continental United States or Hawaii for purposes of resale, research, or veterinary treatment, unless the dogs are in good health, have received all necessary vaccinations, and are at least 6 months of age,\" according to the regulatory language. Specifically, USDA-APHIS requires vaccinations for rabies and distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Moreover, the USDA-APHIS rule was introduced with text specifically rejecting exemptions for \"imports for rescue purposes.\"\n\n\"Because the canine flu viruses are a quick-hit virus with short shedding periods,\" explained Crawford, \"it would seem difficult to import an infected dog who was still in the contagious period. That said,\" Crawford cautioned, \"the biggest flu outbreak in Australia occurred in horses in 2007. Australia was an equine influenza-free country and this status was maintained by strict quarantine of imported horses for 3 weeks. In 2007, equine influenza virus was brought into the country via an infected horse, possibly due to a breach in quarantine, and the virus spread like wildfire to hundreds of horses with many deaths. Like the canine virus, the equine flu virus also is a quick-hit, short shedding period (7 days) virus.\"\n\n\"The H3N2 virus,\" Crawford elaborated, \"is typically shed for 7 days, possibly 10 days in some cases. The incubation period is typically 2-3 days, meaning the virus is already in day 2-3 of its short 7-10 day shedding cycle by the time dogs start coughing. A subset of dogs have subclinical infection -- they shed virus for a few days but do not display clinical signs. The flu viruses do not persist in the environment for more than 12-24 hours, depending on ambient conditions,\" meaning that H3N2 might survive outside of a host animal for the duration of a direct flight from South East Asia, but would probably not survive for longer unless flown in a frozen form. \"Flu viruses can be viable after freeze/thawing,\" Crawford noted.\n\nBut while the temperatures in aircraft holds often dropped below freezing in earlier generations of high-flying jets, the Boeing and Airbus jets usually used on transoceanic flights today typically maintain hold temperatures of close to 40 degrees Fahrenheit [5 degrees Celsius].\n\n\"Obviously, there are many potential routes by which this virus could breach our borders,\" Crawford said. \"We may never know how the H3N2 virus was introduced into the US -- the most important thing right now is finding out how to stop the spread.\"\n\n\"There are likely more questions than answers,\" agreed Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases infectious disease moderator Tam Garland of Texas A&M University, at http://www.promedmail.org. \"For example, did the strain originate in birds? How did it adapt to dogs? How long did it take to adapt to dogs if it came from avians? Did it pass through an intermediate host such as humans or pigs prior to adapting to dogs? Does it present a risk to humans? The risk to humans is likely small,\" Garland anticipated, \"or we would have had affected human caretakers of these affected dogs coming down with this strain of the flu.\"\n\nResponded Crawford to the question of avian origin, which might suggest a link to the illegal but extensive commerce between the US and Southeast Asia in gamecocks, \"The H3N2 canine virus evolved from avian H3N2 viruses in Korea, but several mutations have occurred over the years associated with adaptation to the dog as the new host. I think these mutations have distanced the dog virus from the bird virus. There are several published papers on the phylogenetics of the dog H3N2 virus compared to avian and human H3N2 viruses.\"\n\nConcerning the potential risk to humans, Dubovi told Audie Cornish of NPR, \"Right now we have no evidence that the virus is moving from the dogs into the human population,\" but that does not mean such a cross-species infection could not happen. \"If you had a sick dog in your house,\" Dubovi said, \"you could transmit the virus to another animal in the house through what we call fomites -- just saliva, or if a dog sneezes on you, and you move to another animal.\" Dubovi warned that \"The Asian variety of the flu also can infect cats. There is a vaccine against the US variety,\" Dubovi said, but cautioned, \"We are unable at this point in time to indicate whether or not it will afford any protection against the virus we think is coming from Asia. \"The best thing to do right now until this calms down,\" Dubovi advised, \"is to keep dogs separated as much as possible. The fewer contacts your dog has with another dog, the lesser the chance of it picking this particular virus up, or any other virus for that matter.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nMerritt Clifton\nEditor\nhttp://www.animals24-7.org\n\n[Subsequent to this posting on Animals 27-7, it was noted by Mr Clifton:\n\n\"After posting 'Canine influenza, dog meat, & the rescue connection,' I became aware of an independent rescuer, not affiliated with any organization larger than her own, who claims to have imported 23 dogs from South Korea, 1 or 2 at a time, between January 2014 and late January 2015.

The only exception is for dogs arriving from areas designated as being rabies-free who have lived there for at least the last 6 months or since birth.\"\n\nThe CDC requirement implies that imported dogs must have been under health observation and in secure custody, if not actual quarantine, for more than 4 times longer than the normal incubation period for canine influenza.\n\nThe USDA Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service on 18 Aug 2014 introduced an even stricter rule governing the import of dogs \"from any part of the world into the continental United States or Hawaii for purposes of resale, research, or veterinary treatment, unless the dogs are in good health, have received all necessary vaccinations, and are at least 6 months of age,\" according to the regulatory language. Specifically, USDA-APHIS requires vaccinations for rabies and distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Moreover, the USDA-APHIS rule was introduced with text specifically rejecting exemptions for \"imports for rescue purposes.\"\n\n\"Because the canine flu viruses are a quick-hit virus with short shedding periods,\" explained Crawford, \"it would seem difficult to import an infected dog who was still in the contagious period. That said,\" Crawford cautioned, \"the biggest flu outbreak in Australia occurred in horses in 2007. Australia was an equine influenza-free country and this status was maintained by strict quarantine of imported horses for 3 weeks. In 2007, equine influenza virus was brought into the country via an infected horse, possibly due to a breach in quarantine, and the virus spread like wildfire to hundreds of horses with many deaths. Like the canine virus, the equine flu virus also is a quick-hit, short shedding period (7 days) virus.\"\n\n\"The H3N2 virus,\" Crawford elaborated, \"is typically shed for 7 days, possibly 10 days in some cases. The incubation period is typically 2-3 days, meaning the virus is already in day 2-3 of its short 7-10 day shedding cycle by the time dogs start coughing. A subset of dogs have subclinical infection -- they shed virus for a few days but do not display clinical signs. The flu viruses do not persist in the environment for more than 12-24 hours, depending on ambient conditions,\" meaning that H3N2 might survive outside of a host animal for the duration of a direct flight from South East Asia, but would probably not survive for longer unless flown in a frozen form. \"Flu viruses can be viable after freeze/thawing,\" Crawford noted.\n\nBut while the temperatures in aircraft holds often dropped below freezing in earlier generations of high-flying jets, the Boeing and Airbus jets usually used on transoceanic flights today typically maintain hold temperatures of close to 40 degrees Fahrenheit [5 degrees Celsius].\n\n\"Obviously, there are many potential routes by which this virus could breach our borders,\" Crawford said. \"We may never know how the H3N2 virus was introduced into the US -- the most important thing right now is finding out how to stop the spread.\"\n\n\"There are likely more questions than answers,\" agreed Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases infectious disease moderator Tam Garland of Texas A&M University, at http://www.promedmail.org. \"For example, did the strain originate in birds? How did it adapt to dogs? How long did it take to adapt to dogs if it came from avians? Did it pass through an intermediate host such as humans or pigs prior to adapting to dogs? Does it present a risk to humans? The risk to humans is likely small,\" Garland anticipated, \"or we would have had affected human caretakers of these affected dogs coming down with this strain of the flu.\"\n\nResponded Crawford to the question of avian origin, which might suggest a link to the illegal but extensive commerce between the US and Southeast Asia in gamecocks, \"The H3N2 canine virus evolved from avian H3N2 viruses in Korea, but several mutations have occurred over the years associated with adaptation to the dog as the new host. I think these mutations have distanced the dog virus from the bird virus. There are several published papers on the phylogenetics of the dog H3N2 virus compared to avian and human H3N2 viruses.\"\n\nConcerning the potential risk to humans, Dubovi told Audie Cornish of NPR, \"Right now we have no evidence that the virus is moving from the dogs into the human population,\" but that does not mean such a cross-species infection could not happen. \"If you had a sick dog in your house,\" Dubovi said, \"you could transmit the virus to another animal in the house through what we call fomites -- just saliva, or if a dog sneezes on you, and you move to another animal.\" Dubovi warned that \"The Asian variety of the flu also can infect cats. There is a vaccine against the US variety,\" Dubovi said, but cautioned, \"We are unable at this point in time to indicate whether or not it will afford any protection against the virus we think is coming from Asia. \"The best thing to do right now until this calms down,\" Dubovi advised, \"is to keep dogs separated as much as possible. The fewer contacts your dog has with another dog, the lesser the chance of it picking this particular virus up, or any other virus for that matter.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nMerritt Clifton\nEditor\nhttp://www.animals24-7.org\n\n[Subsequent to this posting on Animals 27-7, it was noted by Mr Clifton:\n\n\"After posting 'Canine influenza, dog meat, & the rescue connection,' I became aware of an independent rescuer, not affiliated with any organization larger than her own, who claims to have imported 23 dogs from South Korea, 1 or 2 at a time, between January 2014 and late January 2015.

But contrary to widespread rumor, there is no hard data yet, nor even strong circumstantial evidence, to link the H3N2 outbreak to rescues of dogs from Asian meat markets.\n\nRescue agencies in recent months are known to have transported fewer than 100 dogs to the US from the regions of Asia where the H3N2 canine influenza virus occurs. None of those dogs are known to have reached the US Midwest. While the possibility of the H3N2 virus moving with a rescue dog cannot be totally excluded, there are many other ways in which it might have come to the US.\n\nThe simplest scenario might be that an infected sniffer dog might have sneezed while inspecting outbound cargo at an Asian airport. The H3N2 virus -- or almost any flu virus -- could remain alive and infectious for far longer than the 13:35 duration of a flight from Seoul to Chicago.\n\nUpon arrival in Chicago, a US sniffer dog inspecting incoming cargo might have inhaled the virus. Since most dogs do not suffer severe clinical signs from canine influenzas, and since the viruses usually have an incubation period of up to a week, the infected US dog might have spread the virus to any number of others before any US dogs fell seriously ill.\n\nThe H3N2 virus was detected in the US, CBS News reported on 5 Apr 2015, \"after several dogs at PetSmart boarding facilities got sick. The company temporarily closed 3 Chicago-area locations to be disinfected.\"\n\nThe hum increased to a shriek after Audie Cornish of National Public Radio on 15 Apr 2015 interviewed Edward Dubovi of the Cornell University Department of Population Medicine & Diagnostics and Cornell School of Veterinary Medicine. \"The outbreak really went into full force around the Easter holiday,\" explained Dubovi, \"when a number of people probably put their dogs into kennels, and so you had maybe a higher collection of dogs in smaller environments. And so this thing (the virus) had an opportunity to expand very rapidly.\n\n\"We've had a [canine influenza] virus in the dog population in the United States since 2004,\" Dubovi continued, referring to an outbreak of canine influenza that began among racing greyhounds. But that outbreak turned out to be a mutated form of the H3N8 equine influenza virus, identified in racehorses for more than 40 years. Occurring in racehorses in 13 nations during 2004, H3N8 somehow jumped into greyhounds at tracks in 11 US states -- several of which were dual-purpose tracks, used for both horse and greyhound racing, or had been used for both horse and greyhound racing at some time in the past.\n\n\"As we did some subsequent testing and the outbreak got a bit bigger,\" Dubovi went on, \"it became evident that this was not the normal canine influenza virus that we have been seeing in the US. And the preliminary evidence so far is that this virus is probably one that came out of Asia. And as it turns out, our requirements for movement of companion animals into the United States are fairly lax. And we certainly have situations now,\" Dubovi speculated, \"where animal rescue groups are rescuing dogs in China and Korea from their meat markets, and we know for a fact that, in fact, some of those dogs have found their way into the Chicago area.\"\n\nAsked by ANIMALS 24-7 for particulars of that allegation, Dubovi offered none, but referred ANIMALS 24-7 to Maddie's Fund assistant professor of shelter medicine Cynda Crawford, of the University of Florida at Gainesville. Crawford, the lead researcher in identifying the H3N8 canine influenza virus in 2004, had recently been in Chicago investigating the H3N2 outbreak, Dubovi said. \"I generally keep to the business of disease diagnostics and test reporting,\" Dubovi told ANIMALS 24-7. \"I have probably reviewed most of the papers out of China and Korea about H3N2 and have been concerned about the appearance of this virus in the US, as it appears to be more pathogenic than our H3N8,\" Dubovi added.\n\nCynda Crawford had more questions than answers. Crawford was aware that Humane Society International (HIS) and the Change for Animals Foundation in January 2015 flew 23 dogs who had been rescued from a dog meat farm from Seoul, South Korea to Washington, DC. Two months later, in March 2015, HSI and the Change for Animals Foundation flew another 57 dogs from a South Korean dog meat farm to San Francisco [California].\n\nBut the 1st 23 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, the Fairfax County Animal Shelter, the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, the City of Manassas Animal Control & Adoption Shelter, Loudoun County Animal Services [all in Virginia], and the Washington Animal Rescue League [in Washington, DC] -- all about 700 miles from Chicago.\n\nThe 2nd 57 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the San Francisco SPCA, the East Bay SPCA, the Marin Humane Society, and the Sacramento SPCA [all in California] -- all more than 2000 miles from Chicago.\n\n\"I am afraid I don't have any more information than what can be found on the Internet,\" Crawford told ANIMALS 24-7. \"I certainly support the laudable work of HSI, the Change for Animals Foundation, the Asia Canine Protection Alliance, and other international animal welfare groups to stop the dog meat farming and trade. There is no evidence that I know of for inadvertent introduction of the Asian H3N2 virus via their efforts.\n\n\"The importation of South Korean dogs to shelters in north Virginia in early January would be within the time frame of the start of the Chicago cases in late January/early February,\" Crawford acknowledged. \"However, I do not know if any of these Korean dogs or any dogs that had contact with them made it to Chicago. I am curious if the dogs had respiratory signs on arrival to stateside shelters, or shortly thereafter, and were considered to have 'kennel cough' associated with the stress of long distance travel. It would also be interesting to know if any of the resident dogs in the receiving shelters developed 'kennel cough' after the arrival of the Korean dogs.\"\n\nBut several layers of biosecurity requirements for importing dogs into the US -- if observed -- would appear to preclude any of the dogs rescued by Humane Society International and the Change for Animals Foundation being infected with H3N2.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control & Prevention [CDC] requires dogs \"be vaccinated against rabies and be healthy upon arrival,\" summarizes https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/461/~/quarantine-requirements-for-imported-dogs,-including-puppies.\n\n\"Dogs that have never been vaccinated against rabies must be vaccinated at least 30 days before entering the United States,\" the site adds. \"Puppies must not be vaccinated against rabies before 3 months of age, so the youngest that a puppy can be imported into the United States is 4 months of age.

The company temporarily closed 3 Chicago-area locations to be disinfected.\"\n\nThe hum increased to a shriek after Audie Cornish of National Public Radio on 15 Apr 2015 interviewed Edward Dubovi of the Cornell University Department of Population Medicine & Diagnostics and Cornell School of Veterinary Medicine. \"The outbreak really went into full force around the Easter holiday,\" explained Dubovi, \"when a number of people probably put their dogs into kennels, and so you had maybe a higher collection of dogs in smaller environments. And so this thing (the virus) had an opportunity to expand very rapidly.\n\n\"We've had a [canine influenza] virus in the dog population in the United States since 2004,\" Dubovi continued, referring to an outbreak of canine influenza that began among racing greyhounds. But that outbreak turned out to be a mutated form of the H3N8 equine influenza virus, identified in racehorses for more than 40 years. Occurring in racehorses in 13 nations during 2004, H3N8 somehow jumped into greyhounds at tracks in 11 US states -- several of which were dual-purpose tracks, used for both horse and greyhound racing, or had been used for both horse and greyhound racing at some time in the past.\n\n\"As we did some subsequent testing and the outbreak got a bit bigger,\" Dubovi went on, \"it became evident that this was not the normal canine influenza virus that we have been seeing in the US. And the preliminary evidence so far is that this virus is probably one that came out of Asia. And as it turns out, our requirements for movement of companion animals into the United States are fairly lax. And we certainly have situations now,\" Dubovi speculated, \"where animal rescue groups are rescuing dogs in China and Korea from their meat markets, and we know for a fact that, in fact, some of those dogs have found their way into the Chicago area.\"\n\nAsked by ANIMALS 24-7 for particulars of that allegation, Dubovi offered none, but referred ANIMALS 24-7 to Maddie's Fund assistant professor of shelter medicine Cynda Crawford, of the University of Florida at Gainesville. Crawford, the lead researcher in identifying the H3N8 canine influenza virus in 2004, had recently been in Chicago investigating the H3N2 outbreak, Dubovi said. \"I generally keep to the business of disease diagnostics and test reporting,\" Dubovi told ANIMALS 24-7. \"I have probably reviewed most of the papers out of China and Korea about H3N2 and have been concerned about the appearance of this virus in the US, as it appears to be more pathogenic than our H3N8,\" Dubovi added.\n\nCynda Crawford had more questions than answers. Crawford was aware that Humane Society International (HIS) and the Change for Animals Foundation in January 2015 flew 23 dogs who had been rescued from a dog meat farm from Seoul, South Korea to Washington, DC. Two months later, in March 2015, HSI and the Change for Animals Foundation flew another 57 dogs from a South Korean dog meat farm to San Francisco [California].\n\nBut the 1st 23 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, the Fairfax County Animal Shelter, the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, the City of Manassas Animal Control & Adoption Shelter, Loudoun County Animal Services [all in Virginia], and the Washington Animal Rescue League [in Washington, DC] -- all about 700 miles from Chicago.\n\nThe 2nd 57 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the San Francisco SPCA, the East Bay SPCA, the Marin Humane Society, and the Sacramento SPCA [all in California] -- all more than 2000 miles from Chicago.\n\n\"I am afraid I don't have any more information than what can be found on the Internet,\" Crawford told ANIMALS 24-7. \"I certainly support the laudable work of HSI, the Change for Animals Foundation, the Asia Canine Protection Alliance, and other international animal welfare groups to stop the dog meat farming and trade. There is no evidence that I know of for inadvertent introduction of the Asian H3N2 virus via their efforts.\n\n\"The importation of South Korean dogs to shelters in north Virginia in early January would be within the time frame of the start of the Chicago cases in late January/early February,\" Crawford acknowledged. \"However, I do not know if any of these Korean dogs or any dogs that had contact with them made it to Chicago. I am curious if the dogs had respiratory signs on arrival to stateside shelters, or shortly thereafter, and were considered to have 'kennel cough' associated with the stress of long distance travel. It would also be interesting to know if any of the resident dogs in the receiving shelters developed 'kennel cough' after the arrival of the Korean dogs.\"\n\nBut several layers of biosecurity requirements for importing dogs into the US -- if observed -- would appear to preclude any of the dogs rescued by Humane Society International and the Change for Animals Foundation being infected with H3N2.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control & Prevention [CDC] requires dogs \"be vaccinated against rabies and be healthy upon arrival,\" summarizes https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/461/~/quarantine-requirements-for-imported-dogs,-including-puppies.\n\n\"Dogs that have never been vaccinated against rabies must be vaccinated at least 30 days before entering the United States,\" the site adds. \"Puppies must not be vaccinated against rabies before 3 months of age, so the youngest that a puppy can be imported into the United States is 4 months of age. The rabies vaccination requirement applies to all dogs including service animals. The only exception is for dogs arriving from areas designated as being rabies-free who have lived there for at least the last 6 months or since birth.\"\n\nThe CDC requirement implies that imported dogs must have been under health observation and in secure custody, if not actual quarantine, for more than 4 times longer than the normal incubation period for canine influenza.\n\nThe USDA Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service on 18 Aug 2014 introduced an even stricter rule governing the import of dogs \"from any part of the world into the continental United States or Hawaii for purposes of resale, research, or veterinary treatment, unless the dogs are in good health, have received all necessary vaccinations, and are at least 6 months of age,\" according to the regulatory language. Specifically, USDA-APHIS requires vaccinations for rabies and distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Moreover, the USDA-APHIS rule was introduced with text specifically rejecting exemptions for \"imports for rescue purposes.\"\n\n\"Because the canine flu viruses are a quick-hit virus with short shedding periods,\" explained Crawford, \"it would seem difficult to import an infected dog who was still in the contagious period. That said,\" Crawford cautioned, \"the biggest flu outbreak in Australia occurred in horses in 2007. Australia was an equine influenza-free country and this status was maintained by strict quarantine of imported horses for 3 weeks. In 2007, equine influenza virus was brought into the country via an infected horse, possibly due to a breach in quarantine, and the virus spread like wildfire to hundreds of horses with many deaths. Like the canine virus, the equine flu virus also is a quick-hit, short shedding period (7 days) virus.\"\n\n\"The H3N2 virus,\" Crawford elaborated, \"is typically shed for 7 days, possibly 10 days in some cases. The incubation period is typically 2-3 days, meaning the virus is already in day 2-3 of its short 7-10 day shedding cycle by the time dogs start coughing. A subset of dogs have subclinical infection -- they shed virus for a few days but do not display clinical signs. The flu viruses do not persist in the environment for more than 12-24 hours, depending on ambient conditions,\" meaning that H3N2 might survive outside of a host animal for the duration of a direct flight from South East Asia, but would probably not survive for longer unless flown in a frozen form. \"Flu viruses can be viable after freeze/thawing,\" Crawford noted.\n\nBut while the temperatures in aircraft holds often dropped below freezing in earlier generations of high-flying jets, the Boeing and Airbus jets usually used on transoceanic flights today typically maintain hold temperatures of close to 40 degrees Fahrenheit [5 degrees Celsius].\n\n\"Obviously, there are many potential routes by which this virus could breach our borders,\" Crawford said. \"We may never know how the H3N2 virus was introduced into the US -- the most important thing right now is finding out how to stop the spread.\"\n\n\"There are likely more questions than answers,\" agreed Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases infectious disease moderator Tam Garland of Texas A&M University, at http://www.promedmail.org. \"For example, did the strain originate in birds? How did it adapt to dogs? How long did it take to adapt to dogs if it came from avians? Did it pass through an intermediate host such as humans or pigs prior to adapting to dogs? Does it present a risk to humans? The risk to humans is likely small,\" Garland anticipated, \"or we would have had affected human caretakers of these affected dogs coming down with this strain of the flu.\"\n\nResponded Crawford to the question of avian origin, which might suggest a link to the illegal but extensive commerce between the US and Southeast Asia in gamecocks, \"The H3N2 canine virus evolved from avian H3N2 viruses in Korea, but several mutations have occurred over the years associated with adaptation to the dog as the new host. I think these mutations have distanced the dog virus from the bird virus. There are several published papers on the phylogenetics of the dog H3N2 virus compared to avian and human H3N2 viruses.\"\n\nConcerning the potential risk to humans, Dubovi told Audie Cornish of NPR, \"Right now we have no evidence that the virus is moving from the dogs into the human population,\" but that does not mean such a cross-species infection could not happen. \"If you had a sick dog in your house,\" Dubovi said, \"you could transmit the virus to another animal in the house through what we call fomites -- just saliva, or if a dog sneezes on you, and you move to another animal.\" Dubovi warned that \"The Asian variety of the flu also can infect cats. There is a vaccine against the US variety,\" Dubovi said, but cautioned, \"We are unable at this point in time to indicate whether or not it will afford any protection against the virus we think is coming from Asia. \"The best thing to do right now until this calms down,\" Dubovi advised, \"is to keep dogs separated as much as possible. The fewer contacts your dog has with another dog, the lesser the chance of it picking this particular virus up, or any other virus for that matter.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nMerritt Clifton\nEditor\nhttp://www.animals24-7.org\n\n[Subsequent to this posting on Animals 27-7, it was noted by Mr Clifton:\n\n\"After posting 'Canine influenza, dog meat, & the rescue connection,' I became aware of an independent rescuer, not affiliated with any organization larger than her own, who claims to have imported 23 dogs from South Korea, 1 or 2 at a time, between January 2014 and late January 2015.

But contrary to widespread rumor, there is no hard data yet, nor even strong circumstantial evidence, to link the H3N2 outbreak to rescues of dogs from Asian meat markets.\n\nRescue agencies in recent months are known to have transported fewer than 100 dogs to the US from the regions of Asia where the H3N2 canine influenza virus occurs. None of those dogs are known to have reached the US Midwest. While the possibility of the H3N2 virus moving with a rescue dog cannot be totally excluded, there are many other ways in which it might have come to the US.\n\nThe simplest scenario might be that an infected sniffer dog might have sneezed while inspecting outbound cargo at an Asian airport. The H3N2 virus -- or almost any flu virus -- could remain alive and infectious for far longer than the 13:35 duration of a flight from Seoul to Chicago.\n\nUpon arrival in Chicago, a US sniffer dog inspecting incoming cargo might have inhaled the virus. Since most dogs do not suffer severe clinical signs from canine influenzas, and since the viruses usually have an incubation period of up to a week, the infected US dog might have spread the virus to any number of others before any US dogs fell seriously ill.\n\nThe H3N2 virus was detected in the US, CBS News reported on 5 Apr 2015, \"after several dogs at PetSmart boarding facilities got sick.

But contrary to widespread rumor, there is no hard data yet, nor even strong circumstantial evidence, to link the H3N2 outbreak to rescues of dogs from Asian meat markets.\n\nRescue agencies in recent months are known to have transported fewer than 100 dogs to the US from the regions of Asia where the H3N2 canine influenza virus occurs. None of those dogs are known to have reached the US Midwest. While the possibility of the H3N2 virus moving with a rescue dog cannot be totally excluded, there are many other ways in which it might have come to the US.\n\nThe simplest scenario might be that an infected sniffer dog might have sneezed while inspecting outbound cargo at an Asian airport. The H3N2 virus -- or almost any flu virus -- could remain alive and infectious for far longer than the 13:35 duration of a flight from Seoul to Chicago.\n\nUpon arrival in Chicago, a US sniffer dog inspecting incoming cargo might have inhaled the virus. Since most dogs do not suffer severe clinical signs from canine influenzas, and since the viruses usually have an incubation period of up to a week, the infected US dog might have spread the virus to any number of others before any US dogs fell seriously ill.\n\nThe H3N2 virus was detected in the US, CBS News reported on 5 Apr 2015, \"after several dogs at PetSmart boarding facilities got sick. The company temporarily closed 3 Chicago-area locations to be disinfected.\"\n\nThe hum increased to a shriek after Audie Cornish of National Public Radio on 15 Apr 2015 interviewed Edward Dubovi of the Cornell University Department of Population Medicine & Diagnostics and Cornell School of Veterinary Medicine. \"The outbreak really went into full force around the Easter holiday,\" explained Dubovi, \"when a number of people probably put their dogs into kennels, and so you had maybe a higher collection of dogs in smaller environments. And so this thing (the virus) had an opportunity to expand very rapidly.\n\n\"We've had a [canine influenza] virus in the dog population in the United States since 2004,\" Dubovi continued, referring to an outbreak of canine influenza that began among racing greyhounds. But that outbreak turned out to be a mutated form of the H3N8 equine influenza virus, identified in racehorses for more than 40 years. Occurring in racehorses in 13 nations during 2004, H3N8 somehow jumped into greyhounds at tracks in 11 US states -- several of which were dual-purpose tracks, used for both horse and greyhound racing, or had been used for both horse and greyhound racing at some time in the past.\n\n\"As we did some subsequent testing and the outbreak got a bit bigger,\" Dubovi went on, \"it became evident that this was not the normal canine influenza virus that we have been seeing in the US. And the preliminary evidence so far is that this virus is probably one that came out of Asia. And as it turns out, our requirements for movement of companion animals into the United States are fairly lax. And we certainly have situations now,\" Dubovi speculated, \"where animal rescue groups are rescuing dogs in China and Korea from their meat markets, and we know for a fact that, in fact, some of those dogs have found their way into the Chicago area.\"\n\nAsked by ANIMALS 24-7 for particulars of that allegation, Dubovi offered none, but referred ANIMALS 24-7 to Maddie's Fund assistant professor of shelter medicine Cynda Crawford, of the University of Florida at Gainesville. Crawford, the lead researcher in identifying the H3N8 canine influenza virus in 2004, had recently been in Chicago investigating the H3N2 outbreak, Dubovi said. \"I generally keep to the business of disease diagnostics and test reporting,\" Dubovi told ANIMALS 24-7. \"I have probably reviewed most of the papers out of China and Korea about H3N2 and have been concerned about the appearance of this virus in the US, as it appears to be more pathogenic than our H3N8,\" Dubovi added.\n\nCynda Crawford had more questions than answers. Crawford was aware that Humane Society International (HIS) and the Change for Animals Foundation in January 2015 flew 23 dogs who had been rescued from a dog meat farm from Seoul, South Korea to Washington, DC. Two months later, in March 2015, HSI and the Change for Animals Foundation flew another 57 dogs from a South Korean dog meat farm to San Francisco [California].\n\nBut the 1st 23 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, the Fairfax County Animal Shelter, the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, the City of Manassas Animal Control & Adoption Shelter, Loudoun County Animal Services [all in Virginia], and the Washington Animal Rescue League [in Washington, DC] -- all about 700 miles from Chicago.\n\nThe 2nd 57 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the San Francisco SPCA, the East Bay SPCA, the Marin Humane Society, and the Sacramento SPCA [all in California] -- all more than 2000 miles from Chicago.\n\n\"I am afraid I don't have any more information than what can be found on the Internet,\" Crawford told ANIMALS 24-7. \"I certainly support the laudable work of HSI, the Change for Animals Foundation, the Asia Canine Protection Alliance, and other international animal welfare groups to stop the dog meat farming and trade. There is no evidence that I know of for inadvertent introduction of the Asian H3N2 virus via their efforts.\n\n\"The importation of South Korean dogs to shelters in north Virginia in early January would be within the time frame of the start of the Chicago cases in late January/early February,\" Crawford acknowledged. \"However, I do not know if any of these Korean dogs or any dogs that had contact with them made it to Chicago. I am curious if the dogs had respiratory signs on arrival to stateside shelters, or shortly thereafter, and were considered to have 'kennel cough' associated with the stress of long distance travel. It would also be interesting to know if any of the resident dogs in the receiving shelters developed 'kennel cough' after the arrival of the Korean dogs.\"\n\nBut several layers of biosecurity requirements for importing dogs into the US -- if observed -- would appear to preclude any of the dogs rescued by Humane Society International and the Change for Animals Foundation being infected with H3N2.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control & Prevention [CDC] requires dogs \"be vaccinated against rabies and be healthy upon arrival,\" summarizes https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/461/~/quarantine-requirements-for-imported-dogs,-including-puppies.\n\n\"Dogs that have never been vaccinated against rabies must be vaccinated at least 30 days before entering the United States,\" the site adds. \"Puppies must not be vaccinated against rabies before 3 months of age, so the youngest that a puppy can be imported into the United States is 4 months of age. The rabies vaccination requirement applies to all dogs including service animals. The only exception is for dogs arriving from areas designated as being rabies-free who have lived there for at least the last 6 months or since birth.\"\n\nThe CDC requirement implies that imported dogs must have been under health observation and in secure custody, if not actual quarantine, for more than 4 times longer than the normal incubation period for canine influenza.\n\nThe USDA Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service on 18 Aug 2014 introduced an even stricter rule governing the import of dogs \"from any part of the world into the continental United States or Hawaii for purposes of resale, research, or veterinary treatment, unless the dogs are in good health, have received all necessary vaccinations, and are at least 6 months of age,\" according to the regulatory language. Specifically, USDA-APHIS requires vaccinations for rabies and distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Moreover, the USDA-APHIS rule was introduced with text specifically rejecting exemptions for \"imports for rescue purposes.\"\n\n\"Because the canine flu viruses are a quick-hit virus with short shedding periods,\" explained Crawford, \"it would seem difficult to import an infected dog who was still in the contagious period. That said,\" Crawford cautioned, \"the biggest flu outbreak in Australia occurred in horses in 2007. Australia was an equine influenza-free country and this status was maintained by strict quarantine of imported horses for 3 weeks. In 2007, equine influenza virus was brought into the country via an infected horse, possibly due to a breach in quarantine, and the virus spread like wildfire to hundreds of horses with many deaths. Like the canine virus, the equine flu virus also is a quick-hit, short shedding period (7 days) virus.\"\n\n\"The H3N2 virus,\" Crawford elaborated, \"is typically shed for 7 days, possibly 10 days in some cases. The incubation period is typically 2-3 days, meaning the virus is already in day 2-3 of its short 7-10 day shedding cycle by the time dogs start coughing. A subset of dogs have subclinical infection -- they shed virus for a few days but do not display clinical signs. The flu viruses do not persist in the environment for more than 12-24 hours, depending on ambient conditions,\" meaning that H3N2 might survive outside of a host animal for the duration of a direct flight from South East Asia, but would probably not survive for longer unless flown in a frozen form. \"Flu viruses can be viable after freeze/thawing,\" Crawford noted.\n\nBut while the temperatures in aircraft holds often dropped below freezing in earlier generations of high-flying jets, the Boeing and Airbus jets usually used on transoceanic flights today typically maintain hold temperatures of close to 40 degrees Fahrenheit [5 degrees Celsius].\n\n\"Obviously, there are many potential routes by which this virus could breach our borders,\" Crawford said. \"We may never know how the H3N2 virus was introduced into the US -- the most important thing right now is finding out how to stop the spread.\"\n\n\"There are likely more questions than answers,\" agreed Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases infectious disease moderator Tam Garland of Texas A&M University, at http://www.promedmail.org. \"For example, did the strain originate in birds? How did it adapt to dogs? How long did it take to adapt to dogs if it came from avians? Did it pass through an intermediate host such as humans or pigs prior to adapting to dogs? Does it present a risk to humans? The risk to humans is likely small,\" Garland anticipated, \"or we would have had affected human caretakers of these affected dogs coming down with this strain of the flu.\"\n\nResponded Crawford to the question of avian origin, which might suggest a link to the illegal but extensive commerce between the US and Southeast Asia in gamecocks, \"The H3N2 canine virus evolved from avian H3N2 viruses in Korea, but several mutations have occurred over the years associated with adaptation to the dog as the new host. I think these mutations have distanced the dog virus from the bird virus. There are several published papers on the phylogenetics of the dog H3N2 virus compared to avian and human H3N2 viruses.\"\n\nConcerning the potential risk to humans, Dubovi told Audie Cornish of NPR, \"Right now we have no evidence that the virus is moving from the dogs into the human population,\" but that does not mean such a cross-species infection could not happen. \"If you had a sick dog in your house,\" Dubovi said, \"you could transmit the virus to another animal in the house through what we call fomites -- just saliva, or if a dog sneezes on you, and you move to another animal.\" Dubovi warned that \"The Asian variety of the flu also can infect cats. There is a vaccine against the US variety,\" Dubovi said, but cautioned, \"We are unable at this point in time to indicate whether or not it will afford any protection against the virus we think is coming from Asia. \"The best thing to do right now until this calms down,\" Dubovi advised, \"is to keep dogs separated as much as possible. The fewer contacts your dog has with another dog, the lesser the chance of it picking this particular virus up, or any other virus for that matter.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nMerritt Clifton\nEditor\nhttp://www.animals24-7.org\n\n[Subsequent to this posting on Animals 27-7, it was noted by Mr Clifton:\n\n\"After posting 'Canine influenza, dog meat, & the rescue connection,' I became aware of an independent rescuer, not affiliated with any organization larger than her own, who claims to have imported 23 dogs from South Korea, 1 or 2 at a time, between January 2014 and late January 2015.

The only exception is for dogs arriving from areas designated as being rabies-free who have lived there for at least the last 6 months or since birth.\"\n\nThe CDC requirement implies that imported dogs must have been under health observation and in secure custody, if not actual quarantine, for more than 4 times longer than the normal incubation period for canine influenza.\n\nThe USDA Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service on 18 Aug 2014 introduced an even stricter rule governing the import of dogs \"from any part of the world into the continental United States or Hawaii for purposes of resale, research, or veterinary treatment, unless the dogs are in good health, have received all necessary vaccinations, and are at least 6 months of age,\" according to the regulatory language. Specifically, USDA-APHIS requires vaccinations for rabies and distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Moreover, the USDA-APHIS rule was introduced with text specifically rejecting exemptions for \"imports for rescue purposes.\"\n\n\"Because the canine flu viruses are a quick-hit virus with short shedding periods,\" explained Crawford, \"it would seem difficult to import an infected dog who was still in the contagious period. That said,\" Crawford cautioned, \"the biggest flu outbreak in Australia occurred in horses in 2007. Australia was an equine influenza-free country and this status was maintained by strict quarantine of imported horses for 3 weeks. In 2007, equine influenza virus was brought into the country via an infected horse, possibly due to a breach in quarantine, and the virus spread like wildfire to hundreds of horses with many deaths. Like the canine virus, the equine flu virus also is a quick-hit, short shedding period (7 days) virus.\"\n\n\"The H3N2 virus,\" Crawford elaborated, \"is typically shed for 7 days, possibly 10 days in some cases. The incubation period is typically 2-3 days, meaning the virus is already in day 2-3 of its short 7-10 day shedding cycle by the time dogs start coughing. A subset of dogs have subclinical infection -- they shed virus for a few days but do not display clinical signs. The flu viruses do not persist in the environment for more than 12-24 hours, depending on ambient conditions,\" meaning that H3N2 might survive outside of a host animal for the duration of a direct flight from South East Asia, but would probably not survive for longer unless flown in a frozen form. \"Flu viruses can be viable after freeze/thawing,\" Crawford noted.\n\nBut while the temperatures in aircraft holds often dropped below freezing in earlier generations of high-flying jets, the Boeing and Airbus jets usually used on transoceanic flights today typically maintain hold temperatures of close to 40 degrees Fahrenheit [5 degrees Celsius].\n\n\"Obviously, there are many potential routes by which this virus could breach our borders,\" Crawford said. \"We may never know how the H3N2 virus was introduced into the US -- the most important thing right now is finding out how to stop the spread.\"\n\n\"There are likely more questions than answers,\" agreed Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases infectious disease moderator Tam Garland of Texas A&M University, at http://www.promedmail.org. \"For example, did the strain originate in birds? How did it adapt to dogs? How long did it take to adapt to dogs if it came from avians? Did it pass through an intermediate host such as humans or pigs prior to adapting to dogs? Does it present a risk to humans? The risk to humans is likely small,\" Garland anticipated, \"or we would have had affected human caretakers of these affected dogs coming down with this strain of the flu.\"\n\nResponded Crawford to the question of avian origin, which might suggest a link to the illegal but extensive commerce between the US and Southeast Asia in gamecocks, \"The H3N2 canine virus evolved from avian H3N2 viruses in Korea, but several mutations have occurred over the years associated with adaptation to the dog as the new host. I think these mutations have distanced the dog virus from the bird virus. There are several published papers on the phylogenetics of the dog H3N2 virus compared to avian and human H3N2 viruses.\"\n\nConcerning the potential risk to humans, Dubovi told Audie Cornish of NPR, \"Right now we have no evidence that the virus is moving from the dogs into the human population,\" but that does not mean such a cross-species infection could not happen. \"If you had a sick dog in your house,\" Dubovi said, \"you could transmit the virus to another animal in the house through what we call fomites -- just saliva, or if a dog sneezes on you, and you move to another animal.\" Dubovi warned that \"The Asian variety of the flu also can infect cats. There is a vaccine against the US variety,\" Dubovi said, but cautioned, \"We are unable at this point in time to indicate whether or not it will afford any protection against the virus we think is coming from Asia. \"The best thing to do right now until this calms down,\" Dubovi advised, \"is to keep dogs separated as much as possible. The fewer contacts your dog has with another dog, the lesser the chance of it picking this particular virus up, or any other virus for that matter.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nMerritt Clifton\nEditor\nhttp://www.animals24-7.org\n\n[Subsequent to this posting on Animals 27-7, it was noted by Mr Clifton:\n\n\"After posting 'Canine influenza, dog meat, & the rescue connection,' I became aware of an independent rescuer, not affiliated with any organization larger than her own, who claims to have imported 23 dogs from South Korea, 1 or 2 at a time, between January 2014 and late January 2015. Apparently these dogs went to the San Francisco area.\"\n\nThese are not the same cases as mentioned in the more lengthy investigation.\n\nThe issue of the pet slaughter for meat in other parts of the world, most notably Korea and China, is gruesome and inhumane.\n\nWhile saving the animals is important and to stop the brutal, inhumane and gruesome slaughter of pets is important, equally important is to quarantine the rescued animals. They need health checks, vaccinations, deworming, and importantly, time to recover from the horrific conditions under which they are held.\n\nGiven the horrible conditions these animals, it is possible this rescue trade may have brought back the new strain of canine influenza virus. - Mod.TG]\nSee Also\nInfluenza, canine - USA (04): (Midwest) H3N2 20150418.3305718\nInfluenza, canine - USA (03): (IL) new strain H3N2 20150413.3293591\nInfluenza, canine - USA (02): (IL) 20150407.3280113\nInfluenza, canine - USA: (IL) 20150401.3269290\n2014\n---\nInfluenza, canine - USA (03): (NYC) 20140903.2744239\nInfluenza, canine - USA (02): (PA) 20140819.2702049\nInfluenza, canine - USA: (MA) 20140512.2467267\n2013\n---\nInfluenza, canine - USA (03): (MD) 20130830.1914244\nInfluenza, canine - USA (02): (MD) 20130825.1900398\nInfluenza, canine - USA (NH) 20130325.1601563\n2012\n---\nInfluenza, canine - USA (02): (PA) 20120901.1276129\nInfluenza, canine - USA: (CA) 20120714.1202100\n.................................................tg/je/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rabies"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2015-04-05 00:00:00", "2015-04-15 00:00:00", "2004-03-16 00:00:00", "2004-03-16 00:00:00", "2004-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-01-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-01-23 00:00:00", "2014-08-18 00:00:00", "2007-03-16 00:00:00", "2007-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-01-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "San Francisco", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Seoul", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hawaii", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maddie", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Indiana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Arlington", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ohio", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Wisconsin", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Virginia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Illinois", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington , DC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington ,", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "DC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chicago", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the City of Manassas Animal Control & Adoption Shelter", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gainesville", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3305718", "headline": "PRO/AH> Influenza, canine - USA (04): (Midwest) H3N2", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3305718", "date": "2013-12-05 20:44:41", "main_text": "INFLUENZA, CANINE - CHINA: H3N2 AVIAN ORIGIN, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 4 Dec 2013 [accessed]\nSource: Infection, Genetics and Evolution, cited by Flutrackers [edited]\nhttp://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=214497\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24298574\n\n\nAvian-origin H3N2 canine influenza virus circulating in farmed dogs in Guangdong, China.

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of 8 gene segments of these viruses revealed that they were most similar to the newly isolated canine H3N2 viruses in dogs and cats from Korea and China, which originated from an avian strain.

However, little is known about the prevalence situation of H3N2 CIV infections in farmed dogs in China. This is the 1st systematic epidemiological surveillance of CIV in different dog populations in Southern China.\n\nTwo virus strains -- A/Canine/Guangdong/1/2011(H3N2) and A/canine/Guangdong/5/2011(H3N2) -- were isolated from canine nasal swabs collected at one dog farm in Guangzhou and the other farm in Shenzhen. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of 8 gene segments of these viruses revealed that they were most similar to the newly isolated canine H3N2 viruses in dogs and cats from Korea and China, which originated from an avian strain. This indicates that H3N2 CIV may be a common pathogen for pet and farmed dog populations in southern China at present.\n\nSerological surveillance has shown that the infection rates of this avian-origin canine influenza in farmed dogs and in pet dogs were 12.22 and 5.3 percent, respectively, as determined by ELISA. The data also suggested that transmission occurred, most probably by close contact, between H3N2 CIV infected dogs in different dog populations in recent years.\n\nAs H3N2 outbreaks among dogs continue in Guangdong Province (located very close to Hong Kong), [in densely populated areas with frequent animal trade], there is a continued risk for pet H3N2 CIV infections and for mutations or genetic reassortment leading to new virus strains with increased transmissibility among dogs.

This is the 1st systematic epidemiological surveillance of CIV in different dog populations in Southern China.\n\nTwo virus strains -- A/Canine/Guangdong/1/2011(H3N2) and A/canine/Guangdong/5/2011(H3N2) -- were isolated from canine nasal swabs collected at one dog farm in Guangzhou and the other farm in Shenzhen. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of 8 gene segments of these viruses revealed that they were most similar to the newly isolated canine H3N2 viruses in dogs and cats from Korea and China, which originated from an avian strain. This indicates that H3N2 CIV may be a common pathogen for pet and farmed dog populations in southern China at present.\n\nSerological surveillance has shown that the infection rates of this avian-origin canine influenza in farmed dogs and in pet dogs were 12.22 and 5.3 percent, respectively, as determined by ELISA. The data also suggested that transmission occurred, most probably by close contact, between H3N2 CIV infected dogs in different dog populations in recent years.\n\nAs H3N2 outbreaks among dogs continue in Guangdong Province (located very close to Hong Kong), [in densely populated areas with frequent animal trade], there is a continued risk for pet H3N2 CIV infections and for mutations or genetic reassortment leading to new virus strains with increased transmissibility among dogs. Further in-depth study is required, as H3N2 CIV has been established in different dog populations and poses a potential threat to public health.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The text of the full paper concluded with the following segment: \"...although no direct transmission of H3N2 CIV from dogs to humans has been reported, it is possible that the CIV may generate a new pandemic outbreak, which poses a great threat to our human life. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring dogs in pet hospitals and on dog farms; furthermore, the development of a canine H3N2 vaccine is extremely urgent.\"\n\nThe initial genome announcement of the H3N2 canine strain from Guangdong was published in September 2012.\n\nReference\nShuo Su, Nan Cao, Jidang Chen, Furong Zhao, Huatao Li, Mingxi Zhao, Yanjing Wang, Zhen Huang, Liguo Yuan, Heng Wang (2012).

This strain, known as H3N2, spread around the globe and eventually killed an estimated 1 million people. A new study from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] reveals that there are many strains of H3N2 circulating in birds and pigs that are genetically similar to the 1968 strain and have the potential to generate a pandemic if they leap to humans. The researchers, led by Ram Sasisekharan, the Alfred H Caspary Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT, also found that current flu vaccines might not offer protection against these strains. \"There are indeed examples of H3N2 that we need to be concerned about,\" says Sasisekharan, who is also a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. \"From a pandemic-preparedness point of view, we should potentially start including some of these H3 strains as part of influenza vaccines.\" The study, which appears in the [10 May 2013] issue of the journal Scientific Reports, also offers the World Health Organization and public health agencies' insight into viral strains that should raise red flags if detected.\n\nInfluenza evolution\n-------------------\nIn the past 100 years, influenza viruses that emerged from pigs or birds have caused several notable flu pandemics. When one of these avian or swine viruses gains the ability to infect humans, it can often evade the immune system, which is primed to recognize only strains that commonly infect humans. Strains of H3N2 have been circulating in humans since the 1968 pandemic, but they have evolved to a less dangerous form that produces a nasty seasonal flu. However, H3N2 strains are also circulating in pigs and birds. Sasisekharan and his colleagues wanted to determine the risk of H3N2 strains re-emerging in humans, whose immune systems would no longer recognize the more dangerous forms of H3N2. This type of event has a recent precedent: In 2009, a strain of H1N1 emerged that was very similar to the virus that caused a 1918 pandemic that killed 50 million to 100 million people. \"We asked if that could happen with H3,\" Sasisekharan says. \"You would think it's more readily possible with H3 because we observe that there seems to be a lot more mixing of H3 between humans and swine.\"\n\nGenetic similarities\n--------------------\nIn the new study, the researchers compared the 1968 H3N2 strain and about 1100 H3 strains now circulating in pigs and birds, focusing on the gene that codes for the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. After comparing HA genetic sequences in five key locations that control the viruses' interactions with infected hosts, the researchers calculated an \"antigenic index\" for each strain. This value indicates the percentage of these genetic regions identical to those of the 1968 pandemic strain and helps determine how well an influenza virus can evade a host's immune response. The researchers also took into account the patterns of attachment of the HA protein to sugar molecules called glycans. The virus' ability to attach to glycan receptors found on human respiratory-tract cells is key to infecting humans.\n\nSeeking viruses with an antigenic index of at least 49 percent and glycan-attachment patterns identical to those of the 1968 virus, the research team identified 581 H3 viruses isolated since 2000 that could potentially cause a pandemic. Of these, 549 came from birds and 32 from pigs.\n\nThe researchers then exposed some of these strains to antibodies provoked by the current H3 seasonal-flu vaccines. As they predicted, these antibodies were unable to recognize or attack these H3 strains. Of the 581 HA sequences, 6 swine strains already contain the standard HA mutations necessary for human adaptation, and are thus capable of entering the human population either directly or via genetic reassortment, Sasisekharan says.\n\n\"One of the amazing things about the influenza virus is its ability to grab genes from different pools,\" he says. \"There could be viral genes that mix among pigs, or between birds and pigs.\" The findings from this study will raise our awareness for potential H3N2 flu pandemics and will at the same time help us to monitor, prevent and prepare for such events,\" says Yizhi Jane Tao, an assistant professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Rice University who was not part of the research team. Sasisekharan and colleagues are now doing a similar genetic study of H5 influenza strains. The H3 study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\n\n[Byline: Anne Trafton]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The introductory and discussion sections from the scientific publication on which the commentary above is based are summarised below. - Mod.CP]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 10 May 2013\nSource: Nature, Scientific Reports [edited]\nhttp://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130510/srep01822/full/srep01822.html\n\n\n[Ref: Tharakaraman K, Raman R, Stebbins NW, Viswanathan K , Sasisekharan V, Sasisekharan R: Antigenically intact hemagglutinin in circulating avian and swine influenza viruses and potential for H3N2 pandemic.

Given that the H3N2 is another subtype that currently circulates in the human population and is high on WHO pandemic preparedness list, we assessed the likelihood of reemergence of H3N2 from a non-human host. Using HA sequence features relevant to immune recognition, receptor binding and transmission we have identified several recent H3 strains in avian and swine that present hallmarks of a reemerging virus. IgG polyclonal raised in rabbit with recent seasonal vaccine H3 fail to recognize these swine H3 strains suggesting that existing vaccines may not be effective in protecting against these strains. Vaccine strategies can mitigate risks associated with a potential H3N2 pandemic in humans.\n\n[Interested readers are recommended to access the original text at the source URL above to view the impressive volume of data processed in this analysis, and the excellent diagrams and images accompanying the text. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe H3 HA of some of the recent avian strains share approximately 86 percent overall sequence identity with the HA of the avian progenitor of the 1968 pandemic virus (A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963), reflecting antigenic intactness within birds. Many sequences from swine, some collected as recently as 2001, were also found to have high homology with the A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963 HA, indicating avian to swine transfer. For reasons that remain unclear, the more recent swine H3 HAs (2006 and later) have diverged significantly from the 1968 pandemic H3N2 HA while in contrast the majority of swine H1 HAs remained antigenically stable from 1918 to the 1990s. Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time -- quite possibly, this could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period. In fact, the AI [antigenic identity] values of human H3 in the last decade are comparable to the AI values of some swine H3 HAs of the same period; interestingly, the recent human and swine HAs show differential binding to polyclonal antibodies generated against seasonal vaccine strain (Fig. 2). This apparent discrepancy may be explained in part by the presence of certain key antigenic \"hotspot\" locations, where amino acid substitutions can lead to disproportionately large changes in antigenicity. Our observation is supported by other studies on H3 antigenic evolution. The frequent interspecies transmission of H3 viruses might also explain why this subtype is associated with the highest rates of mortality.\n\nThe importance of glycosylation in antigenic site masking leading to a new pandemic cycle and viral evolution became apparent after the 2009 pandemic. It was observed that the seasonal H1N1 HA carries antigenic site-masking glycosylation sites not present in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 HA (and 1918 H1N1 HA) and the exposure of the unprotected antigenic surface is believed to be the reason underpinning the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Akin to H1 subtype, the additional glycosylation sites on the recent seasonal H3 appear to have a role in antigenic site masking. For instance, the glycosylation at position 63 masks antigenic site E, and glycosylation at sites, and protect antigenic A. The shielding nature of these glycosylation sites is evident from the gradual decline in the mutation rate of the masked antigenic sites following their appearance (Fig. S2), portending a 2009 H1N1-like H3N2 pandemic. If a virus carrying a HA similar to the ones identified by this analysis makes its way into humans, it would need to evolve rapidly in response to selective pressures from vaccination and herd immunity. The ability of H3 subtype to add glycosylation sites will be a key factor enabling the virus to achieve sustained circulation in the next cycle. In contrast, a previous study using nucleotide sequence analysis concluded that H2 has an intrinsically lower capacity to add glycosylation sites. Taking these factors together, we assert that it is less likely for an avian or swine H2 virus (antigenically similar to 1957-58 pandemic H2N2) to gain a foothold for sustained circulation in humans when compared to H3 viruses.\n\nThe rapid antigenic drift that human H3N2 HA underwent during the early adaptation period of the virus (1968-76) appears to have slowed down after 1977. Interestingly, this time period also coincides with the reemergence of H1N1 in the human population. The (re-) emerging H1N1 subtype could have imposed strong selective pressures on the H3N2 to stop circulating in humans after 1977. The evolution of human H3N2 HA after 1977 is characterized by glycosylation accrual, low-level site-specific antigenic changes, and variations at other non-immunodominant sites. Additionally, a recent study found that the affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001. These observations suggest that currently circulating viruses are not as dominant as the earlier viruses. Based on this trend, one can argue that human H3N2 HA presently is \"antigenically drained\", which poses a substantially high barrier to evolution via antigenic drift. However, the presence of antigenically intact H3 in avian and swine suggests that, as with 2009 H1N1 pandemic, reassortment can result in 'resetting and shifting' the antigenicity back to that of the 1968 pandemic and hence facilitate sustained evolution of this subtype in humans.\n\nInfluenza A viruses of other subtypes (H5, H7, H9) that have caused sporadic infections in humans over the past decade also pose equal risk of a pandemic, especially since they represent completely novel HA subtypes. Although antigenic phenotypes could be predicted from HA sequences, the genetic signatures in influenza viruses that lead to a sustained human-to-human transmission cannot be accurately predicted. Although an antigenically novel HA is necessary, it is not the only determining factor for a pandemic. While gain of host receptor specificity is a key determinant, changes in influenza proteins other than HA such as the polymerase (PB2) are typically involved, making predictions of the timing of future pandemics more complex. Nevertheless, our study facilitates setting the stage for future work aimed at designing vaccination studies with animal models using a cocktail of H3 antigens from strains of current avian and swine origin along with specific past strains. Such studies would augment the preparedness in the event of potential re-emergence of H3N2 pandemic.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses appear to have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time, which could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period.\n\nThe affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001.

It was observed that the seasonal H1N1 HA carries antigenic site-masking glycosylation sites not present in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 HA (and 1918 H1N1 HA) and the exposure of the unprotected antigenic surface is believed to be the reason underpinning the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Akin to H1 subtype, the additional glycosylation sites on the recent seasonal H3 appear to have a role in antigenic site masking. For instance, the glycosylation at position 63 masks antigenic site E, and glycosylation at sites, and protect antigenic A. The shielding nature of these glycosylation sites is evident from the gradual decline in the mutation rate of the masked antigenic sites following their appearance (Fig. S2), portending a 2009 H1N1-like H3N2 pandemic. If a virus carrying a HA similar to the ones identified by this analysis makes its way into humans, it would need to evolve rapidly in response to selective pressures from vaccination and herd immunity. The ability of H3 subtype to add glycosylation sites will be a key factor enabling the virus to achieve sustained circulation in the next cycle. In contrast, a previous study using nucleotide sequence analysis concluded that H2 has an intrinsically lower capacity to add glycosylation sites. Taking these factors together, we assert that it is less likely for an avian or swine H2 virus (antigenically similar to 1957-58 pandemic H2N2) to gain a foothold for sustained circulation in humans when compared to H3 viruses.\n\nThe rapid antigenic drift that human H3N2 HA underwent during the early adaptation period of the virus (1968-76) appears to have slowed down after 1977. Interestingly, this time period also coincides with the reemergence of H1N1 in the human population. The (re-) emerging H1N1 subtype could have imposed strong selective pressures on the H3N2 to stop circulating in humans after 1977. The evolution of human H3N2 HA after 1977 is characterized by glycosylation accrual, low-level site-specific antigenic changes, and variations at other non-immunodominant sites. Additionally, a recent study found that the affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001. These observations suggest that currently circulating viruses are not as dominant as the earlier viruses. Based on this trend, one can argue that human H3N2 HA presently is \"antigenically drained\", which poses a substantially high barrier to evolution via antigenic drift. However, the presence of antigenically intact H3 in avian and swine suggests that, as with 2009 H1N1 pandemic, reassortment can result in 'resetting and shifting' the antigenicity back to that of the 1968 pandemic and hence facilitate sustained evolution of this subtype in humans.\n\nInfluenza A viruses of other subtypes (H5, H7, H9) that have caused sporadic infections in humans over the past decade also pose equal risk of a pandemic, especially since they represent completely novel HA subtypes. Although antigenic phenotypes could be predicted from HA sequences, the genetic signatures in influenza viruses that lead to a sustained human-to-human transmission cannot be accurately predicted. Although an antigenically novel HA is necessary, it is not the only determining factor for a pandemic. While gain of host receptor specificity is a key determinant, changes in influenza proteins other than HA such as the polymerase (PB2) are typically involved, making predictions of the timing of future pandemics more complex. Nevertheless, our study facilitates setting the stage for future work aimed at designing vaccination studies with animal models using a cocktail of H3 antigens from strains of current avian and swine origin along with specific past strains. Such studies would augment the preparedness in the event of potential re-emergence of H3N2 pandemic.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses appear to have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time, which could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period.\n\nThe affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001.

This strain, known as H3N2, spread around the globe and eventually killed an estimated 1 million people. A new study from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] reveals that there are many strains of H3N2 circulating in birds and pigs that are genetically similar to the 1968 strain and have the potential to generate a pandemic if they leap to humans. The researchers, led by Ram Sasisekharan, the Alfred H Caspary Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT, also found that current flu vaccines might not offer protection against these strains. \"There are indeed examples of H3N2 that we need to be concerned about,\" says Sasisekharan, who is also a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. \"From a pandemic-preparedness point of view, we should potentially start including some of these H3 strains as part of influenza vaccines.\" The study, which appears in the [10 May 2013] issue of the journal Scientific Reports, also offers the World Health Organization and public health agencies' insight into viral strains that should raise red flags if detected.\n\nInfluenza evolution\n-------------------\nIn the past 100 years, influenza viruses that emerged from pigs or birds have caused several notable flu pandemics. When one of these avian or swine viruses gains the ability to infect humans, it can often evade the immune system, which is primed to recognize only strains that commonly infect humans. Strains of H3N2 have been circulating in humans since the 1968 pandemic, but they have evolved to a less dangerous form that produces a nasty seasonal flu. However, H3N2 strains are also circulating in pigs and birds. Sasisekharan and his colleagues wanted to determine the risk of H3N2 strains re-emerging in humans, whose immune systems would no longer recognize the more dangerous forms of H3N2. This type of event has a recent precedent: In 2009, a strain of H1N1 emerged that was very similar to the virus that caused a 1918 pandemic that killed 50 million to 100 million people. \"We asked if that could happen with H3,\" Sasisekharan says. \"You would think it's more readily possible with H3 because we observe that there seems to be a lot more mixing of H3 between humans and swine.\"\n\nGenetic similarities\n--------------------\nIn the new study, the researchers compared the 1968 H3N2 strain and about 1100 H3 strains now circulating in pigs and birds, focusing on the gene that codes for the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. After comparing HA genetic sequences in five key locations that control the viruses' interactions with infected hosts, the researchers calculated an \"antigenic index\" for each strain. This value indicates the percentage of these genetic regions identical to those of the 1968 pandemic strain and helps determine how well an influenza virus can evade a host's immune response. The researchers also took into account the patterns of attachment of the HA protein to sugar molecules called glycans. The virus' ability to attach to glycan receptors found on human respiratory-tract cells is key to infecting humans.\n\nSeeking viruses with an antigenic index of at least 49 percent and glycan-attachment patterns identical to those of the 1968 virus, the research team identified 581 H3 viruses isolated since 2000 that could potentially cause a pandemic. Of these, 549 came from birds and 32 from pigs.\n\nThe researchers then exposed some of these strains to antibodies provoked by the current H3 seasonal-flu vaccines. As they predicted, these antibodies were unable to recognize or attack these H3 strains. Of the 581 HA sequences, 6 swine strains already contain the standard HA mutations necessary for human adaptation, and are thus capable of entering the human population either directly or via genetic reassortment, Sasisekharan says.\n\n\"One of the amazing things about the influenza virus is its ability to grab genes from different pools,\" he says. \"There could be viral genes that mix among pigs, or between birds and pigs.\" The findings from this study will raise our awareness for potential H3N2 flu pandemics and will at the same time help us to monitor, prevent and prepare for such events,\" says Yizhi Jane Tao, an assistant professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Rice University who was not part of the research team. Sasisekharan and colleagues are now doing a similar genetic study of H5 influenza strains. The H3 study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\n\n[Byline: Anne Trafton]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The introductory and discussion sections from the scientific publication on which the commentary above is based are summarised below. - Mod.CP]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 10 May 2013\nSource: Nature, Scientific Reports [edited]\nhttp://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130510/srep01822/full/srep01822.html\n\n\n[Ref: Tharakaraman K, Raman R, Stebbins NW, Viswanathan K , Sasisekharan V, Sasisekharan R: Antigenically intact hemagglutinin in circulating avian and swine influenza viruses and potential for H3N2 pandemic.

Given that the H3N2 is another subtype that currently circulates in the human population and is high on WHO pandemic preparedness list, we assessed the likelihood of reemergence of H3N2 from a non-human host. Using HA sequence features relevant to immune recognition, receptor binding and transmission we have identified several recent H3 strains in avian and swine that present hallmarks of a reemerging virus. IgG polyclonal raised in rabbit with recent seasonal vaccine H3 fail to recognize these swine H3 strains suggesting that existing vaccines may not be effective in protecting against these strains. Vaccine strategies can mitigate risks associated with a potential H3N2 pandemic in humans.\n\n[Interested readers are recommended to access the original text at the source URL above to view the impressive volume of data processed in this analysis, and the excellent diagrams and images accompanying the text. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe H3 HA of some of the recent avian strains share approximately 86 percent overall sequence identity with the HA of the avian progenitor of the 1968 pandemic virus (A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963), reflecting antigenic intactness within birds. Many sequences from swine, some collected as recently as 2001, were also found to have high homology with the A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963 HA, indicating avian to swine transfer. For reasons that remain unclear, the more recent swine H3 HAs (2006 and later) have diverged significantly from the 1968 pandemic H3N2 HA while in contrast the majority of swine H1 HAs remained antigenically stable from 1918 to the 1990s. Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time -- quite possibly, this could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period. In fact, the AI [antigenic identity] values of human H3 in the last decade are comparable to the AI values of some swine H3 HAs of the same period; interestingly, the recent human and swine HAs show differential binding to polyclonal antibodies generated against seasonal vaccine strain (Fig. 2). This apparent discrepancy may be explained in part by the presence of certain key antigenic \"hotspot\" locations, where amino acid substitutions can lead to disproportionately large changes in antigenicity. Our observation is supported by other studies on H3 antigenic evolution. The frequent interspecies transmission of H3 viruses might also explain why this subtype is associated with the highest rates of mortality.\n\nThe importance of glycosylation in antigenic site masking leading to a new pandemic cycle and viral evolution became apparent after the 2009 pandemic. It was observed that the seasonal H1N1 HA carries antigenic site-masking glycosylation sites not present in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 HA (and 1918 H1N1 HA) and the exposure of the unprotected antigenic surface is believed to be the reason underpinning the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Akin to H1 subtype, the additional glycosylation sites on the recent seasonal H3 appear to have a role in antigenic site masking. For instance, the glycosylation at position 63 masks antigenic site E, and glycosylation at sites, and protect antigenic A. The shielding nature of these glycosylation sites is evident from the gradual decline in the mutation rate of the masked antigenic sites following their appearance (Fig. S2), portending a 2009 H1N1-like H3N2 pandemic. If a virus carrying a HA similar to the ones identified by this analysis makes its way into humans, it would need to evolve rapidly in response to selective pressures from vaccination and herd immunity. The ability of H3 subtype to add glycosylation sites will be a key factor enabling the virus to achieve sustained circulation in the next cycle. In contrast, a previous study using nucleotide sequence analysis concluded that H2 has an intrinsically lower capacity to add glycosylation sites. Taking these factors together, we assert that it is less likely for an avian or swine H2 virus (antigenically similar to 1957-58 pandemic H2N2) to gain a foothold for sustained circulation in humans when compared to H3 viruses.\n\nThe rapid antigenic drift that human H3N2 HA underwent during the early adaptation period of the virus (1968-76) appears to have slowed down after 1977. Interestingly, this time period also coincides with the reemergence of H1N1 in the human population. The (re-) emerging H1N1 subtype could have imposed strong selective pressures on the H3N2 to stop circulating in humans after 1977. The evolution of human H3N2 HA after 1977 is characterized by glycosylation accrual, low-level site-specific antigenic changes, and variations at other non-immunodominant sites. Additionally, a recent study found that the affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001. These observations suggest that currently circulating viruses are not as dominant as the earlier viruses. Based on this trend, one can argue that human H3N2 HA presently is \"antigenically drained\", which poses a substantially high barrier to evolution via antigenic drift.

Sasisekharan and colleagues are now doing a similar genetic study of H5 influenza strains.

Given that the H3N2 is another subtype that currently circulates in the human population and is high on WHO pandemic preparedness list, we assessed the likelihood of reemergence of H3N2 from a non-human host. Using HA sequence features relevant to immune recognition, receptor binding and transmission we have identified several recent H3 strains in avian and swine that present hallmarks of a reemerging virus. IgG polyclonal raised in rabbit with recent seasonal vaccine H3 fail to recognize these swine H3 strains suggesting that existing vaccines may not be effective in protecting against these strains. Vaccine strategies can mitigate risks associated with a potential H3N2 pandemic in humans.\n\n[Interested readers are recommended to access the original text at the source URL above to view the impressive volume of data processed in this analysis, and the excellent diagrams and images accompanying the text. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe H3 HA of some of the recent avian strains share approximately 86 percent overall sequence identity with the HA of the avian progenitor of the 1968 pandemic virus (A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963), reflecting antigenic intactness within birds. Many sequences from swine, some collected as recently as 2001, were also found to have high homology with the A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963 HA, indicating avian to swine transfer. For reasons that remain unclear, the more recent swine H3 HAs (2006 and later) have diverged significantly from the 1968 pandemic H3N2 HA while in contrast the majority of swine H1 HAs remained antigenically stable from 1918 to the 1990s. Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time -- quite possibly, this could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period. In fact, the AI [antigenic identity] values of human H3 in the last decade are comparable to the AI values of some swine H3 HAs of the same period; interestingly, the recent human and swine HAs show differential binding to polyclonal antibodies generated against seasonal vaccine strain (Fig. 2). This apparent discrepancy may be explained in part by the presence of certain key antigenic \"hotspot\" locations, where amino acid substitutions can lead to disproportionately large changes in antigenicity. Our observation is supported by other studies on H3 antigenic evolution. The frequent interspecies transmission of H3 viruses might also explain why this subtype is associated with the highest rates of mortality.\n\nThe importance of glycosylation in antigenic site masking leading to a new pandemic cycle and viral evolution became apparent after the 2009 pandemic. It was observed that the seasonal H1N1 HA carries antigenic site-masking glycosylation sites not present in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 HA (and 1918 H1N1 HA) and the exposure of the unprotected antigenic surface is believed to be the reason underpinning the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Akin to H1 subtype, the additional glycosylation sites on the recent seasonal H3 appear to have a role in antigenic site masking. For instance, the glycosylation at position 63 masks antigenic site E, and glycosylation at sites, and protect antigenic A. The shielding nature of these glycosylation sites is evident from the gradual decline in the mutation rate of the masked antigenic sites following their appearance (Fig. S2), portending a 2009 H1N1-like H3N2 pandemic. If a virus carrying a HA similar to the ones identified by this analysis makes its way into humans, it would need to evolve rapidly in response to selective pressures from vaccination and herd immunity. The ability of H3 subtype to add glycosylation sites will be a key factor enabling the virus to achieve sustained circulation in the next cycle. In contrast, a previous study using nucleotide sequence analysis concluded that H2 has an intrinsically lower capacity to add glycosylation sites. Taking these factors together, we assert that it is less likely for an avian or swine H2 virus (antigenically similar to 1957-58 pandemic H2N2) to gain a foothold for sustained circulation in humans when compared to H3 viruses.\n\nThe rapid antigenic drift that human H3N2 HA underwent during the early adaptation period of the virus (1968-76) appears to have slowed down after 1977. Interestingly, this time period also coincides with the reemergence of H1N1 in the human population. The (re-) emerging H1N1 subtype could have imposed strong selective pressures on the H3N2 to stop circulating in humans after 1977. The evolution of human H3N2 HA after 1977 is characterized by glycosylation accrual, low-level site-specific antigenic changes, and variations at other non-immunodominant sites. Additionally, a recent study found that the affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001. These observations suggest that currently circulating viruses are not as dominant as the earlier viruses. Based on this trend, one can argue that human H3N2 HA presently is \"antigenically drained\", which poses a substantially high barrier to evolution via antigenic drift. However, the presence of antigenically intact H3 in avian and swine suggests that, as with 2009 H1N1 pandemic, reassortment can result in 'resetting and shifting' the antigenicity back to that of the 1968 pandemic and hence facilitate sustained evolution of this subtype in humans.\n\nInfluenza A viruses of other subtypes (H5, H7, H9) that have caused sporadic infections in humans over the past decade also pose equal risk of a pandemic, especially since they represent completely novel HA subtypes. Although antigenic phenotypes could be predicted from HA sequences, the genetic signatures in influenza viruses that lead to a sustained human-to-human transmission cannot be accurately predicted. Although an antigenically novel HA is necessary, it is not the only determining factor for a pandemic. While gain of host receptor specificity is a key determinant, changes in influenza proteins other than HA such as the polymerase (PB2) are typically involved, making predictions of the timing of future pandemics more complex. Nevertheless, our study facilitates setting the stage for future work aimed at designing vaccination studies with animal models using a cocktail of H3 antigens from strains of current avian and swine origin along with specific past strains. Such studies would augment the preparedness in the event of potential re-emergence of H3N2 pandemic.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses appear to have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time, which could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period.\n\nThe affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001.

This strain, known as H3N2, spread around the globe and eventually killed an estimated 1 million people. A new study from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] reveals that there are many strains of H3N2 circulating in birds and pigs that are genetically similar to the 1968 strain and have the potential to generate a pandemic if they leap to humans. The researchers, led by Ram Sasisekharan, the Alfred H Caspary Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT, also found that current flu vaccines might not offer protection against these strains. \"There are indeed examples of H3N2 that we need to be concerned about,\" says Sasisekharan, who is also a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. \"From a pandemic-preparedness point of view, we should potentially start including some of these H3 strains as part of influenza vaccines.\" The study, which appears in the [10 May 2013] issue of the journal Scientific Reports, also offers the World Health Organization and public health agencies' insight into viral strains that should raise red flags if detected.\n\nInfluenza evolution\n-------------------\nIn the past 100 years, influenza viruses that emerged from pigs or birds have caused several notable flu pandemics. When one of these avian or swine viruses gains the ability to infect humans, it can often evade the immune system, which is primed to recognize only strains that commonly infect humans. Strains of H3N2 have been circulating in humans since the 1968 pandemic, but they have evolved to a less dangerous form that produces a nasty seasonal flu. However, H3N2 strains are also circulating in pigs and birds. Sasisekharan and his colleagues wanted to determine the risk of H3N2 strains re-emerging in humans, whose immune systems would no longer recognize the more dangerous forms of H3N2. This type of event has a recent precedent: In 2009, a strain of H1N1 emerged that was very similar to the virus that caused a 1918 pandemic that killed 50 million to 100 million people. \"We asked if that could happen with H3,\" Sasisekharan says. \"You would think it's more readily possible with H3 because we observe that there seems to be a lot more mixing of H3 between humans and swine.\"\n\nGenetic similarities\n--------------------\nIn the new study, the researchers compared the 1968 H3N2 strain and about 1100 H3 strains now circulating in pigs and birds, focusing on the gene that codes for the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. After comparing HA genetic sequences in five key locations that control the viruses' interactions with infected hosts, the researchers calculated an \"antigenic index\" for each strain. This value indicates the percentage of these genetic regions identical to those of the 1968 pandemic strain and helps determine how well an influenza virus can evade a host's immune response. The researchers also took into account the patterns of attachment of the HA protein to sugar molecules called glycans. The virus' ability to attach to glycan receptors found on human respiratory-tract cells is key to infecting humans.\n\nSeeking viruses with an antigenic index of at least 49 percent and glycan-attachment patterns identical to those of the 1968 virus, the research team identified 581 H3 viruses isolated since 2000 that could potentially cause a pandemic. Of these, 549 came from birds and 32 from pigs.\n\nThe researchers then exposed some of these strains to antibodies provoked by the current H3 seasonal-flu vaccines. As they predicted, these antibodies were unable to recognize or attack these H3 strains. Of the 581 HA sequences, 6 swine strains already contain the standard HA mutations necessary for human adaptation, and are thus capable of entering the human population either directly or via genetic reassortment, Sasisekharan says.\n\n\"One of the amazing things about the influenza virus is its ability to grab genes from different pools,\" he says. \"There could be viral genes that mix among pigs, or between birds and pigs.\" The findings from this study will raise our awareness for potential H3N2 flu pandemics and will at the same time help us to monitor, prevent and prepare for such events,\" says Yizhi Jane Tao, an assistant professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Rice University who was not part of the research team. Sasisekharan and colleagues are now doing a similar genetic study of H5 influenza strains.

This strain, known as H3N2, spread around the globe and eventually killed an estimated 1 million people. A new study from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] reveals that there are many strains of H3N2 circulating in birds and pigs that are genetically similar to the 1968 strain and have the potential to generate a pandemic if they leap to humans. The researchers, led by Ram Sasisekharan, the Alfred H Caspary Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT, also found that current flu vaccines might not offer protection against these strains. \"There are indeed examples of H3N2 that we need to be concerned about,\" says Sasisekharan, who is also a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. \"From a pandemic-preparedness point of view, we should potentially start including some of these H3 strains as part of influenza vaccines.\" The study, which appears in the [10 May 2013] issue of the journal Scientific Reports, also offers the World Health Organization and public health agencies' insight into viral strains that should raise red flags if detected.\n\nInfluenza evolution\n-------------------\nIn the past 100 years, influenza viruses that emerged from pigs or birds have caused several notable flu pandemics. When one of these avian or swine viruses gains the ability to infect humans, it can often evade the immune system, which is primed to recognize only strains that commonly infect humans. Strains of H3N2 have been circulating in humans since the 1968 pandemic, but they have evolved to a less dangerous form that produces a nasty seasonal flu. However, H3N2 strains are also circulating in pigs and birds. Sasisekharan and his colleagues wanted to determine the risk of H3N2 strains re-emerging in humans, whose immune systems would no longer recognize the more dangerous forms of H3N2. This type of event has a recent precedent: In 2009, a strain of H1N1 emerged that was very similar to the virus that caused a 1918 pandemic that killed 50 million to 100 million people. \"We asked if that could happen with H3,\" Sasisekharan says. \"You would think it's more readily possible with H3 because we observe that there seems to be a lot more mixing of H3 between humans and swine.\"\n\nGenetic similarities\n--------------------\nIn the new study, the researchers compared the 1968 H3N2 strain and about 1100 H3 strains now circulating in pigs and birds, focusing on the gene that codes for the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. After comparing HA genetic sequences in five key locations that control the viruses' interactions with infected hosts, the researchers calculated an \"antigenic index\" for each strain. This value indicates the percentage of these genetic regions identical to those of the 1968 pandemic strain and helps determine how well an influenza virus can evade a host's immune response. The researchers also took into account the patterns of attachment of the HA protein to sugar molecules called glycans. The virus' ability to attach to glycan receptors found on human respiratory-tract cells is key to infecting humans.\n\nSeeking viruses with an antigenic index of at least 49 percent and glycan-attachment patterns identical to those of the 1968 virus, the research team identified 581 H3 viruses isolated since 2000 that could potentially cause a pandemic. Of these, 549 came from birds and 32 from pigs.\n\nThe researchers then exposed some of these strains to antibodies provoked by the current H3 seasonal-flu vaccines. As they predicted, these antibodies were unable to recognize or attack these H3 strains. Of the 581 HA sequences, 6 swine strains already contain the standard HA mutations necessary for human adaptation, and are thus capable of entering the human population either directly or via genetic reassortment, Sasisekharan says.\n\n\"One of the amazing things about the influenza virus is its ability to grab genes from different pools,\" he says. \"There could be viral genes that mix among pigs, or between birds and pigs.\" The findings from this study will raise our awareness for potential H3N2 flu pandemics and will at the same time help us to monitor, prevent and prepare for such events,\" says Yizhi Jane Tao, an assistant professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Rice University who was not part of the research team. Sasisekharan and colleagues are now doing a similar genetic study of H5 influenza strains. The H3 study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\n\n[Byline: Anne Trafton]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The introductory and discussion sections from the scientific publication on which the commentary above is based are summarised below. - Mod.CP]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 10 May 2013\nSource: Nature, Scientific Reports [edited]\nhttp://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130510/srep01822/full/srep01822.html\n\n\n[Ref: Tharakaraman K, Raman R, Stebbins NW, Viswanathan K , Sasisekharan V, Sasisekharan R: Antigenically intact hemagglutinin in circulating avian and swine influenza viruses and potential for H3N2 pandemic.

Given that the H3N2 is another subtype that currently circulates in the human population and is high on WHO pandemic preparedness list, we assessed the likelihood of reemergence of H3N2 from a non-human host. Using HA sequence features relevant to immune recognition, receptor binding and transmission we have identified several recent H3 strains in avian and swine that present hallmarks of a reemerging virus. IgG polyclonal raised in rabbit with recent seasonal vaccine H3 fail to recognize these swine H3 strains suggesting that existing vaccines may not be effective in protecting against these strains. Vaccine strategies can mitigate risks associated with a potential H3N2 pandemic in humans.\n\n[Interested readers are recommended to access the original text at the source URL above to view the impressive volume of data processed in this analysis, and the excellent diagrams and images accompanying the text. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe H3 HA of some of the recent avian strains share approximately 86 percent overall sequence identity with the HA of the avian progenitor of the 1968 pandemic virus (A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963), reflecting antigenic intactness within birds. Many sequences from swine, some collected as recently as 2001, were also found to have high homology with the A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963 HA, indicating avian to swine transfer. For reasons that remain unclear, the more recent swine H3 HAs (2006 and later) have diverged significantly from the 1968 pandemic H3N2 HA while in contrast the majority of swine H1 HAs remained antigenically stable from 1918 to the 1990s. Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time -- quite possibly, this could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period. In fact, the AI [antigenic identity] values of human H3 in the last decade are comparable to the AI values of some swine H3 HAs of the same period; interestingly, the recent human and swine HAs show differential binding to polyclonal antibodies generated against seasonal vaccine strain (Fig. 2). This apparent discrepancy may be explained in part by the presence of certain key antigenic \"hotspot\" locations, where amino acid substitutions can lead to disproportionately large changes in antigenicity. Our observation is supported by other studies on H3 antigenic evolution. The frequent interspecies transmission of H3 viruses might also explain why this subtype is associated with the highest rates of mortality.\n\nThe importance of glycosylation in antigenic site masking leading to a new pandemic cycle and viral evolution became apparent after the 2009 pandemic. It was observed that the seasonal H1N1 HA carries antigenic site-masking glycosylation sites not present in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 HA (and 1918 H1N1 HA) and the exposure of the unprotected antigenic surface is believed to be the reason underpinning the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Akin to H1 subtype, the additional glycosylation sites on the recent seasonal H3 appear to have a role in antigenic site masking. For instance, the glycosylation at position 63 masks antigenic site E, and glycosylation at sites, and protect antigenic A. The shielding nature of these glycosylation sites is evident from the gradual decline in the mutation rate of the masked antigenic sites following their appearance (Fig. S2), portending a 2009 H1N1-like H3N2 pandemic. If a virus carrying a HA similar to the ones identified by this analysis makes its way into humans, it would need to evolve rapidly in response to selective pressures from vaccination and herd immunity. The ability of H3 subtype to add glycosylation sites will be a key factor enabling the virus to achieve sustained circulation in the next cycle. In contrast, a previous study using nucleotide sequence analysis concluded that H2 has an intrinsically lower capacity to add glycosylation sites. Taking these factors together, we assert that it is less likely for an avian or swine H2 virus (antigenically similar to 1957-58 pandemic H2N2) to gain a foothold for sustained circulation in humans when compared to H3 viruses.\n\nThe rapid antigenic drift that human H3N2 HA underwent during the early adaptation period of the virus (1968-76) appears to have slowed down after 1977. Interestingly, this time period also coincides with the reemergence of H1N1 in the human population. The (re-) emerging H1N1 subtype could have imposed strong selective pressures on the H3N2 to stop circulating in humans after 1977. The evolution of human H3N2 HA after 1977 is characterized by glycosylation accrual, low-level site-specific antigenic changes, and variations at other non-immunodominant sites. Additionally, a recent study found that the affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001. These observations suggest that currently circulating viruses are not as dominant as the earlier viruses. Based on this trend, one can argue that human H3N2 HA presently is \"antigenically drained\", which poses a substantially high barrier to evolution via antigenic drift. However, the presence of antigenically intact H3 in avian and swine suggests that, as with 2009 H1N1 pandemic, reassortment can result in 'resetting and shifting' the antigenicity back to that of the 1968 pandemic and hence facilitate sustained evolution of this subtype in humans.\n\nInfluenza A viruses of other subtypes (H5, H7, H9) that have caused sporadic infections in humans over the past decade also pose equal risk of a pandemic, especially since they represent completely novel HA subtypes. Although antigenic phenotypes could be predicted from HA sequences, the genetic signatures in influenza viruses that lead to a sustained human-to-human transmission cannot be accurately predicted. Although an antigenically novel HA is necessary, it is not the only determining factor for a pandemic. While gain of host receptor specificity is a key determinant, changes in influenza proteins other than HA such as the polymerase (PB2) are typically involved, making predictions of the timing of future pandemics more complex. Nevertheless, our study facilitates setting the stage for future work aimed at designing vaccination studies with animal models using a cocktail of H3 antigens from strains of current avian and swine origin along with specific past strains. Such studies would augment the preparedness in the event of potential re-emergence of H3N2 pandemic.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses appear to have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time, which could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period.\n\nThe affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001.

The shielding nature of these glycosylation sites is evident from the gradual decline in the mutation rate of the masked antigenic sites following their appearance (Fig. S2), portending a 2009 H1N1-like H3N2 pandemic. If a virus carrying a HA similar to the ones identified by this analysis makes its way into humans, it would need to evolve rapidly in response to selective pressures from vaccination and herd immunity. The ability of H3 subtype to add glycosylation sites will be a key factor enabling the virus to achieve sustained circulation in the next cycle. In contrast, a previous study using nucleotide sequence analysis concluded that H2 has an intrinsically lower capacity to add glycosylation sites. Taking these factors together, we assert that it is less likely for an avian or swine H2 virus (antigenically similar to 1957-58 pandemic H2N2) to gain a foothold for sustained circulation in humans when compared to H3 viruses.\n\nThe rapid antigenic drift that human H3N2 HA underwent during the early adaptation period of the virus (1968-76) appears to have slowed down after 1977. Interestingly, this time period also coincides with the reemergence of H1N1 in the human population. The (re-) emerging H1N1 subtype could have imposed strong selective pressures on the H3N2 to stop circulating in humans after 1977. The evolution of human H3N2 HA after 1977 is characterized by glycosylation accrual, low-level site-specific antigenic changes, and variations at other non-immunodominant sites. Additionally, a recent study found that the affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001. These observations suggest that currently circulating viruses are not as dominant as the earlier viruses. Based on this trend, one can argue that human H3N2 HA presently is \"antigenically drained\", which poses a substantially high barrier to evolution via antigenic drift. However, the presence of antigenically intact H3 in avian and swine suggests that, as with 2009 H1N1 pandemic, reassortment can result in 'resetting and shifting' the antigenicity back to that of the 1968 pandemic and hence facilitate sustained evolution of this subtype in humans.\n\nInfluenza A viruses of other subtypes (H5, H7, H9) that have caused sporadic infections in humans over the past decade also pose equal risk of a pandemic, especially since they represent completely novel HA subtypes. Although antigenic phenotypes could be predicted from HA sequences, the genetic signatures in influenza viruses that lead to a sustained human-to-human transmission cannot be accurately predicted. Although an antigenically novel HA is necessary, it is not the only determining factor for a pandemic. While gain of host receptor specificity is a key determinant, changes in influenza proteins other than HA such as the polymerase (PB2) are typically involved, making predictions of the timing of future pandemics more complex. Nevertheless, our study facilitates setting the stage for future work aimed at designing vaccination studies with animal models using a cocktail of H3 antigens from strains of current avian and swine origin along with specific past strains. Such studies would augment the preparedness in the event of potential re-emergence of H3N2 pandemic.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses appear to have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time, which could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period.\n\nThe affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001.

This strain, known as H3N2, spread around the globe and eventually killed an estimated 1 million people. A new study from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] reveals that there are many strains of H3N2 circulating in birds and pigs that are genetically similar to the 1968 strain and have the potential to generate a pandemic if they leap to humans. The researchers, led by Ram Sasisekharan, the Alfred H Caspary Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT, also found that current flu vaccines might not offer protection against these strains. \"There are indeed examples of H3N2 that we need to be concerned about,\" says Sasisekharan, who is also a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. \"From a pandemic-preparedness point of view, we should potentially start including some of these H3 strains as part of influenza vaccines.\" The study, which appears in the [10 May 2013] issue of the journal Scientific Reports, also offers the World Health Organization and public health agencies' insight into viral strains that should raise red flags if detected.\n\nInfluenza evolution\n-------------------\nIn the past 100 years, influenza viruses that emerged from pigs or birds have caused several notable flu pandemics. When one of these avian or swine viruses gains the ability to infect humans, it can often evade the immune system, which is primed to recognize only strains that commonly infect humans. Strains of H3N2 have been circulating in humans since the 1968 pandemic, but they have evolved to a less dangerous form that produces a nasty seasonal flu. However, H3N2 strains are also circulating in pigs and birds. Sasisekharan and his colleagues wanted to determine the risk of H3N2 strains re-emerging in humans, whose immune systems would no longer recognize the more dangerous forms of H3N2. This type of event has a recent precedent: In 2009, a strain of H1N1 emerged that was very similar to the virus that caused a 1918 pandemic that killed 50 million to 100 million people. \"We asked if that could happen with H3,\" Sasisekharan says. \"You would think it's more readily possible with H3 because we observe that there seems to be a lot more mixing of H3 between humans and swine.\"\n\nGenetic similarities\n--------------------\nIn the new study, the researchers compared the 1968 H3N2 strain and about 1100 H3 strains now circulating in pigs and birds, focusing on the gene that codes for the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. After comparing HA genetic sequences in five key locations that control the viruses' interactions with infected hosts, the researchers calculated an \"antigenic index\" for each strain. This value indicates the percentage of these genetic regions identical to those of the 1968 pandemic strain and helps determine how well an influenza virus can evade a host's immune response. The researchers also took into account the patterns of attachment of the HA protein to sugar molecules called glycans. The virus' ability to attach to glycan receptors found on human respiratory-tract cells is key to infecting humans.\n\nSeeking viruses with an antigenic index of at least 49 percent and glycan-attachment patterns identical to those of the 1968 virus, the research team identified 581 H3 viruses isolated since 2000 that could potentially cause a pandemic. Of these, 549 came from birds and 32 from pigs.\n\nThe researchers then exposed some of these strains to antibodies provoked by the current H3 seasonal-flu vaccines. As they predicted, these antibodies were unable to recognize or attack these H3 strains. Of the 581 HA sequences, 6 swine strains already contain the standard HA mutations necessary for human adaptation, and are thus capable of entering the human population either directly or via genetic reassortment, Sasisekharan says.\n\n\"One of the amazing things about the influenza virus is its ability to grab genes from different pools,\" he says. \"There could be viral genes that mix among pigs, or between birds and pigs.\" The findings from this study will raise our awareness for potential H3N2 flu pandemics and will at the same time help us to monitor, prevent and prepare for such events,\" says Yizhi Jane Tao, an assistant professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Rice University who was not part of the research team. Sasisekharan and colleagues are now doing a similar genetic study of H5 influenza strains. The H3 study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\n\n[Byline: Anne Trafton]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The introductory and discussion sections from the scientific publication on which the commentary above is based are summarised below. - Mod.CP]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 10 May 2013\nSource: Nature, Scientific Reports [edited]\nhttp://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130510/srep01822/full/srep01822.html\n\n\n[Ref: Tharakaraman K, Raman R, Stebbins NW, Viswanathan K , Sasisekharan V, Sasisekharan R: Antigenically intact hemagglutinin in circulating avian and swine influenza viruses and potential for H3N2 pandemic.

Given that the H3N2 is another subtype that currently circulates in the human population and is high on WHO pandemic preparedness list, we assessed the likelihood of reemergence of H3N2 from a non-human host. Using HA sequence features relevant to immune recognition, receptor binding and transmission we have identified several recent H3 strains in avian and swine that present hallmarks of a reemerging virus. IgG polyclonal raised in rabbit with recent seasonal vaccine H3 fail to recognize these swine H3 strains suggesting that existing vaccines may not be effective in protecting against these strains. Vaccine strategies can mitigate risks associated with a potential H3N2 pandemic in humans.\n\n[Interested readers are recommended to access the original text at the source URL above to view the impressive volume of data processed in this analysis, and the excellent diagrams and images accompanying the text. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe H3 HA of some of the recent avian strains share approximately 86 percent overall sequence identity with the HA of the avian progenitor of the 1968 pandemic virus (A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963), reflecting antigenic intactness within birds. Many sequences from swine, some collected as recently as 2001, were also found to have high homology with the A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963 HA, indicating avian to swine transfer. For reasons that remain unclear, the more recent swine H3 HAs (2006 and later) have diverged significantly from the 1968 pandemic H3N2 HA while in contrast the majority of swine H1 HAs remained antigenically stable from 1918 to the 1990s. Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time -- quite possibly, this could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period. In fact, the AI [antigenic identity] values of human H3 in the last decade are comparable to the AI values of some swine H3 HAs of the same period; interestingly, the recent human and swine HAs show differential binding to polyclonal antibodies generated against seasonal vaccine strain (Fig. 2). This apparent discrepancy may be explained in part by the presence of certain key antigenic \"hotspot\" locations, where amino acid substitutions can lead to disproportionately large changes in antigenicity. Our observation is supported by other studies on H3 antigenic evolution. The frequent interspecies transmission of H3 viruses might also explain why this subtype is associated with the highest rates of mortality.\n\nThe importance of glycosylation in antigenic site masking leading to a new pandemic cycle and viral evolution became apparent after the 2009 pandemic. It was observed that the seasonal H1N1 HA carries antigenic site-masking glycosylation sites not present in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 HA (and 1918 H1N1 HA) and the exposure of the unprotected antigenic surface is believed to be the reason underpinning the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Akin to H1 subtype, the additional glycosylation sites on the recent seasonal H3 appear to have a role in antigenic site masking. For instance, the glycosylation at position 63 masks antigenic site E, and glycosylation at sites, and protect antigenic A. The shielding nature of these glycosylation sites is evident from the gradual decline in the mutation rate of the masked antigenic sites following their appearance (Fig. S2), portending a 2009 H1N1-like H3N2 pandemic. If a virus carrying a HA similar to the ones identified by this analysis makes its way into humans, it would need to evolve rapidly in response to selective pressures from vaccination and herd immunity. The ability of H3 subtype to add glycosylation sites will be a key factor enabling the virus to achieve sustained circulation in the next cycle. In contrast, a previous study using nucleotide sequence analysis concluded that H2 has an intrinsically lower capacity to add glycosylation sites. Taking these factors together, we assert that it is less likely for an avian or swine H2 virus (antigenically similar to 1957-58 pandemic H2N2) to gain a foothold for sustained circulation in humans when compared to H3 viruses.\n\nThe rapid antigenic drift that human H3N2 HA underwent during the early adaptation period of the virus (1968-76) appears to have slowed down after 1977. Interestingly, this time period also coincides with the reemergence of H1N1 in the human population. The (re-) emerging H1N1 subtype could have imposed strong selective pressures on the H3N2 to stop circulating in humans after 1977. The evolution of human H3N2 HA after 1977 is characterized by glycosylation accrual, low-level site-specific antigenic changes, and variations at other non-immunodominant sites. Additionally, a recent study found that the affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001. These observations suggest that currently circulating viruses are not as dominant as the earlier viruses. Based on this trend, one can argue that human H3N2 HA presently is \"antigenically drained\", which poses a substantially high barrier to evolution via antigenic drift.

Indiana reported the highest number of cases at 138, up from 120 reported the previous week. The swine-origin H3N2 virus contains the matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus and so far this summer has been detected in Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nMaryland today [17 Aug 2012] reported its 1st 6 H3N2v infections, in 5 children and one adult from Queen Anne's county who had direct contact with pigs. None of the patients had serious infections or were hospitalised. Also, testing by the Maryland Department of Agriculture has detected a similar virus in pigs that the sick people had contact with at 4 Queen Anne's county farms. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (MDHMH) said in a statement that the findings in pigs are preliminary and will be confirmed by more testing. It said animal health officials will boost surveillance for the virus and monitor pigs at agricultural fairs in Maryland more closely for flulike symptoms. Fairs are under way in Montgomery and Worcester counties.\n\nPennsylvania is reporting 4 confirmed and 6 probable cases, all youth who participated in the Huntingdon County Fair that took place from 5 through 11 Aug [2012], according to a statement today [17 Aug 2012] from the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDH). None of the patients were hospitalized, and though investigations are ongoing, so far authorities have found no evidence of person-to-person spread. Eli Avila, MD, JD, MPH, Pennsylvania's secretary for health, said the illnesses fit the typical flu profile, and he urged people to take the same precautions as for seasonal flu. \"People should use common sense and take steps to protect their health if they're visiting or exhibiting in a county fair in the coming weeks, especially if they are at high risk for illnesses,\" he added.\n\nWisconsin health officials today [17 Aug 2012] said the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene has confirmed 2 H3N2v cases, both with links to the Wisconsin State Fair, according to a statement from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS). The Wisconsin State Fair took place from 1 through 11 Aug 2012 in West Allis, a suburb of Milwaukee. One case was in an adult from southeastern Wisconsin who worked at the fair, but did not have direct contact with pigs. The other was in an adolescent from the western part of the state who exhibited swine at the fair. Neither patient has been hospitalized and both are recovering from their illness, the WDHS said. The Wisconsin Division of Public Health is working with the state lab and local health departments to identify additional cases. Henry Anderson, MD, Wisconsin's state health officer, said in the statement, \"We encourage people to enjoy all their local fairs have to offer this summer, but take precautions to reduce the chances of getting H3N2v influenza.\" He urged older people, pregnant women, young children, and people with weakened immune systems to avoid swine barns this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Indiana reported that 3 more counties (Marion, Marshall, and Delaware) are reporting H3N2v cases, pushing the total number of affected counties to 23. In a statement yesterday [16 Aug 2012], the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) said it found some duplicated samples that were submitted to the state lab and it has adjusted the number of confirmed cases in some counties. Indiana health officials continue to investigate the cases but so far have found no evidence of person-to-person transmission, according to the statement, which said human infections are most likely in people who have close proximity to infected pigs, such as working with them in barns and in livestock exhibits at fairs.\n\nJoe Bresee, MD, medical epidemiologist in the CDC's Influenza Division, told CIDRAP News that most of the H3N2v cases are still occurring in kids and people who have direct exposure to pigs, such as spending all day in a barn with them at a fair. \"There have been some casual exposure cases, but not many,\" he said, adding that the CDC doesn't have enough information about all of the cases yet to assess the relative risks of different types of exposure.

Indiana reported the highest number of cases at 138, up from 120 reported the previous week. The swine-origin H3N2 virus contains the matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus and so far this summer has been detected in Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nMaryland today [17 Aug 2012] reported its 1st 6 H3N2v infections, in 5 children and one adult from Queen Anne's county who had direct contact with pigs. None of the patients had serious infections or were hospitalised. Also, testing by the Maryland Department of Agriculture has detected a similar virus in pigs that the sick people had contact with at 4 Queen Anne's county farms. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (MDHMH) said in a statement that the findings in pigs are preliminary and will be confirmed by more testing. It said animal health officials will boost surveillance for the virus and monitor pigs at agricultural fairs in Maryland more closely for flulike symptoms. Fairs are under way in Montgomery and Worcester counties.\n\nPennsylvania is reporting 4 confirmed and 6 probable cases, all youth who participated in the Huntingdon County Fair that took place from 5 through 11 Aug [2012], according to a statement today [17 Aug 2012] from the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDH). None of the patients were hospitalized, and though investigations are ongoing, so far authorities have found no evidence of person-to-person spread. Eli Avila, MD, JD, MPH, Pennsylvania's secretary for health, said the illnesses fit the typical flu profile, and he urged people to take the same precautions as for seasonal flu. \"People should use common sense and take steps to protect their health if they're visiting or exhibiting in a county fair in the coming weeks, especially if they are at high risk for illnesses,\" he added.\n\nWisconsin health officials today [17 Aug 2012] said the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene has confirmed 2 H3N2v cases, both with links to the Wisconsin State Fair, according to a statement from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS). The Wisconsin State Fair took place from 1 through 11 Aug 2012 in West Allis, a suburb of Milwaukee. One case was in an adult from southeastern Wisconsin who worked at the fair, but did not have direct contact with pigs. The other was in an adolescent from the western part of the state who exhibited swine at the fair. Neither patient has been hospitalized and both are recovering from their illness, the WDHS said. The Wisconsin Division of Public Health is working with the state lab and local health departments to identify additional cases. Henry Anderson, MD, Wisconsin's state health officer, said in the statement, \"We encourage people to enjoy all their local fairs have to offer this summer, but take precautions to reduce the chances of getting H3N2v influenza.\" He urged older people, pregnant women, young children, and people with weakened immune systems to avoid swine barns this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Indiana reported that 3 more counties (Marion, Marshall, and Delaware) are reporting H3N2v cases, pushing the total number of affected counties to 23. In a statement yesterday [16 Aug 2012], the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) said it found some duplicated samples that were submitted to the state lab and it has adjusted the number of confirmed cases in some counties. Indiana health officials continue to investigate the cases but so far have found no evidence of person-to-person transmission, according to the statement, which said human infections are most likely in people who have close proximity to infected pigs, such as working with them in barns and in livestock exhibits at fairs.\n\nJoe Bresee, MD, medical epidemiologist in the CDC's Influenza Division, told CIDRAP News that most of the H3N2v cases are still occurring in kids and people who have direct exposure to pigs, such as spending all day in a barn with them at a fair. \"There have been some casual exposure cases, but not many,\" he said, adding that the CDC doesn't have enough information about all of the cases yet to assess the relative risks of different types of exposure. The CDC expects to get more system data from the H3N2v infections in the next few weeks, Bresee said, but so far, more than 90 percent of the infections are occurring in kids, the same level the CDC reported last week.\n\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said no swine H3N2 virus that contain the former pandemic virus's matrix gene have been detected in European pigs.

Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection (CHP) announced today [17 Aug 2012] that variant H3N2 has been declared a notifiable disease.

Indiana reported the highest number of cases at 138, up from 120 reported the previous week. The swine-origin H3N2 virus contains the matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus and so far this summer has been detected in Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nMaryland today [17 Aug 2012] reported its 1st 6 H3N2v infections, in 5 children and one adult from Queen Anne's county who had direct contact with pigs. None of the patients had serious infections or were hospitalised. Also, testing by the Maryland Department of Agriculture has detected a similar virus in pigs that the sick people had contact with at 4 Queen Anne's county farms. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (MDHMH) said in a statement that the findings in pigs are preliminary and will be confirmed by more testing. It said animal health officials will boost surveillance for the virus and monitor pigs at agricultural fairs in Maryland more closely for flulike symptoms. Fairs are under way in Montgomery and Worcester counties.\n\nPennsylvania is reporting 4 confirmed and 6 probable cases, all youth who participated in the Huntingdon County Fair that took place from 5 through 11 Aug [2012], according to a statement today [17 Aug 2012] from the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDH). None of the patients were hospitalized, and though investigations are ongoing, so far authorities have found no evidence of person-to-person spread. Eli Avila, MD, JD, MPH, Pennsylvania's secretary for health, said the illnesses fit the typical flu profile, and he urged people to take the same precautions as for seasonal flu. \"People should use common sense and take steps to protect their health if they're visiting or exhibiting in a county fair in the coming weeks, especially if they are at high risk for illnesses,\" he added.\n\nWisconsin health officials today [17 Aug 2012] said the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene has confirmed 2 H3N2v cases, both with links to the Wisconsin State Fair, according to a statement from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS). The Wisconsin State Fair took place from 1 through 11 Aug 2012 in West Allis, a suburb of Milwaukee. One case was in an adult from southeastern Wisconsin who worked at the fair, but did not have direct contact with pigs. The other was in an adolescent from the western part of the state who exhibited swine at the fair. Neither patient has been hospitalized and both are recovering from their illness, the WDHS said. The Wisconsin Division of Public Health is working with the state lab and local health departments to identify additional cases. Henry Anderson, MD, Wisconsin's state health officer, said in the statement, \"We encourage people to enjoy all their local fairs have to offer this summer, but take precautions to reduce the chances of getting H3N2v influenza.\" He urged older people, pregnant women, young children, and people with weakened immune systems to avoid swine barns this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Indiana reported that 3 more counties (Marion, Marshall, and Delaware) are reporting H3N2v cases, pushing the total number of affected counties to 23. In a statement yesterday [16 Aug 2012], the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) said it found some duplicated samples that were submitted to the state lab and it has adjusted the number of confirmed cases in some counties.

Indiana health officials continue to investigate the cases but so far have found no evidence of person-to-person transmission, according to the statement, which said human infections are most likely in people who have close proximity to infected pigs, such as working with them in barns and in livestock exhibits at fairs.\n\nJoe Bresee, MD, medical epidemiologist in the CDC's Influenza Division, told CIDRAP News that most of the H3N2v cases are still occurring in kids and people who have direct exposure to pigs, such as spending all day in a barn with them at a fair. \"There have been some casual exposure cases, but not many,\" he said, adding that the CDC doesn't have enough information about all of the cases yet to assess the relative risks of different types of exposure. The CDC expects to get more system data from the H3N2v infections in the next few weeks, Bresee said, but so far, more than 90 percent of the infections are occurring in kids, the same level the CDC reported last week.\n\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said no swine H3N2 virus that contain the former pandemic virus's matrix gene have been detected in European pigs. Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection (CHP) announced today [17 Aug 2012] that variant H3N2 has been declared a notifiable disease.

Indiana reported the highest number of cases at 138, up from 120 reported the previous week. The swine-origin H3N2 virus contains the matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus and so far this summer has been detected in Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nMaryland today [17 Aug 2012] reported its 1st 6 H3N2v infections, in 5 children and one adult from Queen Anne's county who had direct contact with pigs. None of the patients had serious infections or were hospitalised. Also, testing by the Maryland Department of Agriculture has detected a similar virus in pigs that the sick people had contact with at 4 Queen Anne's county farms. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (MDHMH) said in a statement that the findings in pigs are preliminary and will be confirmed by more testing. It said animal health officials will boost surveillance for the virus and monitor pigs at agricultural fairs in Maryland more closely for flulike symptoms. Fairs are under way in Montgomery and Worcester counties.\n\nPennsylvania is reporting 4 confirmed and 6 probable cases, all youth who participated in the Huntingdon County Fair that took place from 5 through 11 Aug [2012], according to a statement today [17 Aug 2012] from the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDH). None of the patients were hospitalized, and though investigations are ongoing, so far authorities have found no evidence of person-to-person spread. Eli Avila, MD, JD, MPH, Pennsylvania's secretary for health, said the illnesses fit the typical flu profile, and he urged people to take the same precautions as for seasonal flu. \"People should use common sense and take steps to protect their health if they're visiting or exhibiting in a county fair in the coming weeks, especially if they are at high risk for illnesses,\" he added.\n\nWisconsin health officials today [17 Aug 2012] said the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene has confirmed 2 H3N2v cases, both with links to the Wisconsin State Fair, according to a statement from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS). The Wisconsin State Fair took place from 1 through 11 Aug 2012 in West Allis, a suburb of Milwaukee. One case was in an adult from southeastern Wisconsin who worked at the fair, but did not have direct contact with pigs. The other was in an adolescent from the western part of the state who exhibited swine at the fair. Neither patient has been hospitalized and both are recovering from their illness, the WDHS said. The Wisconsin Division of Public Health is working with the state lab and local health departments to identify additional cases. Henry Anderson, MD, Wisconsin's state health officer, said in the statement, \"We encourage people to enjoy all their local fairs have to offer this summer, but take precautions to reduce the chances of getting H3N2v influenza.\" He urged older people, pregnant women, young children, and people with weakened immune systems to avoid swine barns this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Indiana reported that 3 more counties (Marion, Marshall, and Delaware) are reporting H3N2v cases, pushing the total number of affected counties to 23.

A new version of the said chapter 2.8.8. was adopted by OIE's General Session, Paris, May 2010 (available on-line at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.08_SWINE_INFLUENZA.pdf).\n\n--\nArnon Shimshony\nProMED-mail Animal Disease and Zoonoses Moderator\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nSee Also\nInfluenza (64): USA, A/(H3N2)v, CDC report 20120805.1228593\n2010\n----\nInfluenza pandemic (H1N1) (64): WHO, pandemic over 20100811.2753\nInfluenza pandemic (H1N1), animal (04): global, update 20100131.0337\n.................................................arn/msp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "nipah virus", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2065-03-16 00:00:00", "2064-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2005-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-05-16 00:00:00", "2064-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2064-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Swine", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Paris", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1228593", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Influenza (64): USA, A/(H3N2)v, CDC report", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1228593", "date": "2012-01-29 18:32:14", "main_text": "INFLUENZA (05): EUROPE, H3N2 PREDOMINANT\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 27 Jan 2012\nSource: EuroFlu - Weekly Electronic Bulletin [abreviated & edited]\nhttp://www.euroflu.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi\n\nInfluenza activity continues to rise slowly in the WHO European Region due to A(H3N2)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary\n\nInfluenza activity continues to rise slowly in the WHO European Region due to A(H3N2)\n\u2022 This issue is based on data for week 3/2012 reported by 46 Member States in the WHO European Region. Consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) continue to be relatively low in most countries of the Region, but with many countries reporting increasing activity.\n\u2022 29 % of sentinel specimens tested positive for influenza, which is an increase over last week: 95% of these were influenza A.\n\u2022 Of the 352 influenza A viruses from sentinel sources that were subtyped, 99 % were A(H3N2).\n\nCurrent situation: week 3/2012\n\nTrends in clinical activity were reported by 42 countries: 20 stable, 19 increasing and 3 decreasing. At the same time, ILI and ARI consultation rates remained at low levels in most countries of the WHO European Region. Similar to the previous week, consultation rates were highest in young children. Of the 41 countries reporting on the geographical spread of influenza: 12 reported no activity; 7 local activity; 18 sporadic activity; and 4 countries (Finland, Iceland, Italy and Spain) regional activity. Intensity was reported to be low in most countries reporting on this indicator, except for Bulgaria, Iceland, Italy and Spain, where influenza activity was at medium levels.\n\nSevere acute respiratory infection (SARI): week 3/2012\n\n11 countries reported data from sentinel hospital-based surveillance for SARI: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia and Ukraine. The number of SARI hospitalizations remained largely unchanged compared to the previous week, except in Kazakhstan, which reported increases in SARI hospitalization \u2013 mainly in children aged 0\u20134 years. A total of 122 respiratory specimens was collected from SARI patients, of which 10 (8%) tested positive for influenza with 6 being subtyped, all as A(H3N2). 6 countries so far (Albania, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Romania and Ukraine) have reported influenza detections in SARI patients during the course of this influenza season.\n\nVirological situation: week 3/2012\n\nSentinel outpatient clinics collected 1469 respiratory specimens, 422 (29 %) of which tested positive for influenza viruses: 401 (95%) were type A and 21 (5%) were type B. Of the 352 influenza A viruses subtyped, 349 (99%) were influenza A(H3N2) and 3 (1%) were A(H1N1)pdm09. In the 18 countries testing 20 or more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 0% to 85%, with a median of 22% (mean: 25%). In addition, 525 non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for influenza: 504 (96%) type A and 21 (4%) type B.

The new cases, in Maine and Indiana,\nbring to 7 the number seen in the U.S. since July [2011]. To date\nCanada has seen no infections with this virus, the National\nMicrobiology Laboratory said.\n\nWhile the infections have been mainly mild, the CDC is keeping a close\neye on the situation. The head of the Atlanta-based agency's influenza\ndivision said a seed strain for a vaccine that would protect against\nthis virus has already been developed and has been given to vaccine\nmanufacturers. \"We're really trying to be in front of events in terms\nof preparedness,\" Dr. Nancy Cox said in an interview. \"We're being\nvery vigilant because we realize that there's a portion of the\npopulation ... that really has very little cross-reactive antibodies\nto the swine reassortant virus.\"\n\nThe group Cox was referring to is children. Most of the infections --\n2 from Maine, 3 from Pennsylvania and 2 from Indiana - have been in\nyoung children, though Cox noted one of the cases was a 59-year-old\nperson. Most of the people who have been infected had close contact\nwith pigs and the 2 latest cases are no exception.\n\nDr. Stephen Sears, state epidemiologist for Maine, said the 2 children\nfrom his state who were infected both had a lot of contact with pigs.\nWhile they live in the same region of Maine, the children did not have\ncontact with each other. Sears said there is no thought at this point\nthat the virus is spreading from person to person and there were no\nreports of influenza among members of either child's family.\n\nThe virus is a strain of influenza A known as H3N2 that has picked up\none of the genes -- the M gene -- of the H1N1 flu strain that caused\nthe 2009 pandemic. The CDC says the swine H3N2 virus probably picked\nup the M gene from the pandemic H1N1 virus when a pig was co-infected\nwith swine H3N2 and the H1N1 strain. It's not clear whether having\nthat gene is helping this virus transmit to humans. But a study done\nin guinea pigs -- one of the animal models for influenza -- showed\nthat the M gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus is critical to the pandemic\nvirus's ability to transmit well [in guinea pigs].\n\nDr. Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, who was involved in that study, said that\nfinding is suggestive, but guinea pigs aren't people. \"Whether these\ncases now reflect that this particular H3N2 with the M gene of the new\nH1N1 transmits better into humans, I think it's too early to say,\"\nsaid Garcia-Sastre, a researcher at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital.\n\nThe swine-origin H3N2 is related -- though not closely - to H3N2\nviruses that circulate each winter among people. The CDC said the H3N2\ncomponent in the annual flu shot would not be expected to protect\nagainst the swine-origin variety. Cox said the virus seems most\nclosely related to human H3N2s that circulated in the early 1990s.\nThat suggests a lot of people would probably have antibodies against\nthis virus, which in turn might make it hard for the virus to be able\nto spread person to person. But people born after the early 1990s\nprobably would not be protected against the virus. Cox said it's not\npossible to be sure, but based on lab work, her team believes fewer\npeople would be susceptible to this virus than were vulnerable to the\n2009 pandemic virus when it emerged.\n\nPigs are highly susceptible to influenza, and a number of flu strains\ncirculate among swine herds. Occasionally, these viruses trigger human\ninfections, generally among people who work with pigs. There have been\n28 such cases reported since 2005, the CDC said.\n\nIn the last few years, the rate of such detections appears to have\nincreased. But no one is sure whether that means there have been more\ncases, or whether there have always been these numbers of cases but\nimprovements to surveillance means they are now being seen.\n\nThe United States and other countries have built up flu surveillance\nefforts in the past 7 or 8 years, 1st due to concern over H5N1 avian\nflu and later as a result of the 2009 pandemic. After a spate of human\ncases of swine H3N2 infection last year [2010], the CDC asked the\nlaboratory that makes candidate viruses for vaccines to make one for a\nswine H3N2 vaccine. That lab is at New York Medical College in\nValhalla. That virus had the same hemagglutinin and neuraminidase\ngenes -- the H and N in a virus's name -- as the new virus does. And\nflu vaccines target [the proteins encoded] in these 2 genes.\n\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are now 7 cases (6 children and an adult) of infection with an\ninfluenza virus that has been sporadically jumping to people from pigs\nin the United States; 2 in Maine, 3 in Pennsylvania and 2 in Indiana.\nAlthough these cases appear to be independent events, most of those\ninfected had close contact with pigs.\n\nAt present there is no evidence that the virus is spreading from\nperson to person and there has been no report of influenza among\nfamily members.\n\nIt seems likely that the swine H3N2 virus probably picked up its M\ngene (by sub-unit reassortment) from the pandemic H1N1 virus when a\npig was co-infected with swine H3N2 and the H1N1 strain. Model\nexperiments with guinea pigs suggest that the presence of the M gene\nfrom the 2009 H1N pandemic virus favours transmissibility of the the\nH3N2 reassortant virus.\n\nThe infections have been mainly mild, but as a precaution the\ninfluenza division of the CDC has already developed a seed strain for\na vaccine that would protect against this virus and supplied it to\nvaccine producers.\n\nA map of the states of the United States of America can be accessed\nat:\nhttp://www.50states.com/cap.htm. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nInfluenza (63): USA (ME, NOT NH) swine-origin H3N2 reassortant\n20111102.3260\nInfluenza (60): USA (ME) swine-origin H3N2 reassortant 20111021.3134\nInfluenza (54): (PA) swine-origin H3N2 reassortant, comment\n20110913.2789\nInfluenza (52): (PA), swine-origin H3N2 reassortant, 3 cases\n20110906.2723\nInfluenza (51): swine-origin H3N2 reassortant, children 20110902.2685\nInfluenza (40): H3N2/H1N1 reassortant ex patient 20110609.1749\n.................................................cp/ejp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-07-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2005-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2063-03-16 00:00:00", "2054-03-16 00:00:00", "2052-03-16 00:00:00", "2051-03-16 00:00:00", "2040-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maine", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Atlanta", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States of America", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Indiana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York 's", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "968052", "headline": "PRO/AH> Influenza (74): swine-origin H3N2 reassortant, vaccine candidate", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=968052", "date": "2011-11-05 23:16:17", "main_text": "INFLUENZA (66): UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SWINE-ORIGIN H3N2\nREASSORTANT, UPDATE\n*******************************************************************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 4 Nov 2011\nSource: The Record.com and the Canadian Press [edited]\nhttp://www.therecord.com/living/article/620441--u-s-spots-two-more-human-cases-of-flu-with-new-swine-virus-but-cases-not-linked\n\n\nMore human cases of flu with new swine virus\n--------------------------------------------\nTwo new cases of human infection with a flu virus that has been\nsporadically jumping to people from pigs have been spotted in the\nUnited States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nreported Friday [4 Nov 2011].

The new cases, in Maine and Indiana,\nbring to 7 the number seen in the U.S. since July [2011]. To date\nCanada has seen no infections with this virus, the National\nMicrobiology Laboratory said.\n\nWhile the infections have been mainly mild, the CDC is keeping a close\neye on the situation. The head of the Atlanta-based agency's influenza\ndivision said a seed strain for a vaccine that would protect against\nthis virus has already been developed and has been given to vaccine\nmanufacturers. \"We're really trying to be in front of events in terms\nof preparedness,\" Dr. Nancy Cox said in an interview. \"We're being\nvery vigilant because we realize that there's a portion of the\npopulation ... that really has very little cross-reactive antibodies\nto the swine reassortant virus.\"\n\nThe group Cox was referring to is children. Most of the infections --\n2 from Maine, 3 from Pennsylvania and 2 from Indiana - have been in\nyoung children, though Cox noted one of the cases was a 59-year-old\nperson. Most of the people who have been infected had close contact\nwith pigs and the 2 latest cases are no exception.\n\nDr. Stephen Sears, state epidemiologist for Maine, said the 2 children\nfrom his state who were infected both had a lot of contact with pigs.\nWhile they live in the same region of Maine, the children did not have\ncontact with each other. Sears said there is no thought at this point\nthat the virus is spreading from person to person and there were no\nreports of influenza among members of either child's family.\n\nThe virus is a strain of influenza A known as H3N2 that has picked up\none of the genes -- the M gene -- of the H1N1 flu strain that caused\nthe 2009 pandemic. The CDC says the swine H3N2 virus probably picked\nup the M gene from the pandemic H1N1 virus when a pig was co-infected\nwith swine H3N2 and the H1N1 strain. It's not clear whether having\nthat gene is helping this virus transmit to humans. But a study done\nin guinea pigs -- one of the animal models for influenza -- showed\nthat the M gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus is critical to the pandemic\nvirus's ability to transmit well [in guinea pigs].\n\nDr. Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, who was involved in that study, said that\nfinding is suggestive, but guinea pigs aren't people. \"Whether these\ncases now reflect that this particular H3N2 with the M gene of the new\nH1N1 transmits better into humans, I think it's too early to say,\"\nsaid Garcia-Sastre, a researcher at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital.\n\nThe swine-origin H3N2 is related -- though not closely - to H3N2\nviruses that circulate each winter among people. The CDC said the H3N2\ncomponent in the annual flu shot would not be expected to protect\nagainst the swine-origin variety. Cox said the virus seems most\nclosely related to human H3N2s that circulated in the early 1990s.\nThat suggests a lot of people would probably have antibodies against\nthis virus, which in turn might make it hard for the virus to be able\nto spread person to person. But people born after the early 1990s\nprobably would not be protected against the virus. Cox said it's not\npossible to be sure, but based on lab work, her team believes fewer\npeople would be susceptible to this virus than were vulnerable to the\n2009 pandemic virus when it emerged.\n\nPigs are highly susceptible to influenza, and a number of flu strains\ncirculate among swine herds. Occasionally, these viruses trigger human\ninfections, generally among people who work with pigs. There have been\n28 such cases reported since 2005, the CDC said.\n\nIn the last few years, the rate of such detections appears to have\nincreased. But no one is sure whether that means there have been more\ncases, or whether there have always been these numbers of cases but\nimprovements to surveillance means they are now being seen.\n\nThe United States and other countries have built up flu surveillance\nefforts in the past 7 or 8 years, 1st due to concern over H5N1 avian\nflu and later as a result of the 2009 pandemic.

The new cases, in Maine and Indiana,\nbring to 7 the number seen in the U.S. since July [2011]. To date\nCanada has seen no infections with this virus, the National\nMicrobiology Laboratory said.\n\nWhile the infections have been mainly mild, the CDC is keeping a close\neye on the situation. The head of the Atlanta-based agency's influenza\ndivision said a seed strain for a vaccine that would protect against\nthis virus has already been developed and has been given to vaccine\nmanufacturers. \"We're really trying to be in front of events in terms\nof preparedness,\" Dr. Nancy Cox said in an interview. \"We're being\nvery vigilant because we realize that there's a portion of the\npopulation ... that really has very little cross-reactive antibodies\nto the swine reassortant virus.\"\n\nThe group Cox was referring to is children. Most of the infections --\n2 from Maine, 3 from Pennsylvania and 2 from Indiana - have been in\nyoung children, though Cox noted one of the cases was a 59-year-old\nperson. Most of the people who have been infected had close contact\nwith pigs and the 2 latest cases are no exception.\n\nDr. Stephen Sears, state epidemiologist for Maine, said the 2 children\nfrom his state who were infected both had a lot of contact with pigs.\nWhile they live in the same region of Maine, the children did not have\ncontact with each other. Sears said there is no thought at this point\nthat the virus is spreading from person to person and there were no\nreports of influenza among members of either child's family.\n\nThe virus is a strain of influenza A known as H3N2 that has picked up\none of the genes -- the M gene -- of the H1N1 flu strain that caused\nthe 2009 pandemic. The CDC says the swine H3N2 virus probably picked\nup the M gene from the pandemic H1N1 virus when a pig was co-infected\nwith swine H3N2 and the H1N1 strain. It's not clear whether having\nthat gene is helping this virus transmit to humans. But a study done\nin guinea pigs -- one of the animal models for influenza -- showed\nthat the M gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus is critical to the pandemic\nvirus's ability to transmit well [in guinea pigs].\n\nDr. Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, who was involved in that study, said that\nfinding is suggestive, but guinea pigs aren't people. \"Whether these\ncases now reflect that this particular H3N2 with the M gene of the new\nH1N1 transmits better into humans, I think it's too early to say,\"\nsaid Garcia-Sastre, a researcher at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital.\n\nThe swine-origin H3N2 is related -- though not closely - to H3N2\nviruses that circulate each winter among people. The CDC said the H3N2\ncomponent in the annual flu shot would not be expected to protect\nagainst the swine-origin variety. Cox said the virus seems most\nclosely related to human H3N2s that circulated in the early 1990s.\nThat suggests a lot of people would probably have antibodies against\nthis virus, which in turn might make it hard for the virus to be able\nto spread person to person. But people born after the early 1990s\nprobably would not be protected against the virus. Cox said it's not\npossible to be sure, but based on lab work, her team believes fewer\npeople would be susceptible to this virus than were vulnerable to the\n2009 pandemic virus when it emerged.\n\nPigs are highly susceptible to influenza, and a number of flu strains\ncirculate among swine herds. Occasionally, these viruses trigger human\ninfections, generally among people who work with pigs. There have been\n28 such cases reported since 2005, the CDC said.\n\nIn the last few years, the rate of such detections appears to have\nincreased. But no one is sure whether that means there have been more\ncases, or whether there have always been these numbers of cases but\nimprovements to surveillance means they are now being seen.\n\nThe United States and other countries have built up flu surveillance\nefforts in the past 7 or 8 years, 1st due to concern over H5N1 avian\nflu and later as a result of the 2009 pandemic. After a spate of human\ncases of swine H3N2 infection last year [2010], the CDC asked the\nlaboratory that makes candidate viruses for vaccines to make one for a\nswine H3N2 vaccine. That lab is at New York Medical College in\nValhalla. That virus had the same hemagglutinin and neuraminidase\ngenes -- the H and N in a virus's name -- as the new virus does.

Model\nexperiments with guinea pigs suggest that the presence of the M gene\nfrom the 2009 H1N pandemic virus favours transmissibility of the the\nH3N2 reassortant virus.\n\nThe infections have been mainly mild, but as a precaution the\ninfluenza division of the CDC has already developed a seed strain for\na vaccine that would protect against this virus and supplied it to\nvaccine producers.\n\nA map of the states of the United States of America can be accessed\nat:\nhttp://www.50states.com/cap.htm. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nInfluenza (63): USA (ME, NOT NH) swine-origin H3N2 reassortant\n20111102.3260\nInfluenza (60): USA (ME) swine-origin H3N2 reassortant 20111021.3134\nInfluenza (54): (PA) swine-origin H3N2 reassortant, comment\n20110913.2789\nInfluenza (52): (PA), swine-origin H3N2 reassortant, 3 cases\n20110906.2723\nInfluenza (51): swine-origin H3N2 reassortant, children 20110902.2685\nInfluenza (40): H3N2/H1N1 reassortant ex patient 20110609.1749\n.................................................cp/ejp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-07-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2005-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2063-03-16 00:00:00", "2054-03-16 00:00:00", "2052-03-16 00:00:00", "2051-03-16 00:00:00", "2040-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maine", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Atlanta", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States of America", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Indiana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York 's", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "934360", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Influenza (63): USA (ME, NOT NH) swine-origin H3N2 reassortant", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=934360", "date": "2010-11-12 18:00:09", "main_text": "INFLUENZA (14): SWINE ORIGIN (TRIPLE REASSORTANT) H3N2 VIRUSES\n**************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Fri 12 Nov 2010\nSource: CDC Online Newsroom [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/media/subtopic/heard.htm#h3n2>\n\n\nReports of human infections with swine origin influenza A (H3N2)\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nThe 12 Nov 2010 FluView reports 2 human infections with swine origin\ninfluenza A (H3N2) viruses in the United States. Test samples from 2\npatients submitted by Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have been confirmed at the\nCDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] as positive for swine\norigin triple-reassortant (tr) H3N2 influenza viruses -- viruses that\nnormally infect pigs. While human infection with swine influenza viruses is\nrare, it can occur. This is most likely to occur when people are in close\nproximity to infected pigs, such as in pig barns and livestock exhibits\nhousing pigs at fairs.\n\nBoth of the patients with confirmed trH3N2 infection reported in FluView\nwere in the vicinity of live pigs. Dates of illness onset in the 2 patients\nare more than 6 weeks apart and the viruses from the 2 patients have some\ngenetic differences, confirming that these 2 cases are not linked. Ongoing\ninvestigations in both states have not shown any evidence of community\ntransmission of these viruses. The most likely scenario at this point is\nthat these are 2 isolated cases of human infection with swine influenza\nviruses that, while very rare, do occur from time to time. Both patients\nhave fully recovered from their illnesses; however, these 2 cases do\nunderscore the importance of human and animal surveillance for influenza.\n\nThese 2 cases reported in FluView bring the total number of human\ninfections with swine origin influenza viruses reported to CDC since 2005\nto 18. Previously, 3 of these reports had been swine origin A (H3N2)\nviruses. The Pennsylvania and Wisconsin cases bring the number of reports\nswine origin A (H3N2) infections in humans in the United States to 5. The\nviruses identified in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are similar to viruses\nthat infected a patient in Iowa in September 2009, a patient in Kansas in\nAugust 2009 and a patient in Minnesota in May 2010.\n\nSwine Influenza (swine flu) is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type\nA influenza viruses that regularly causes outbreaks of influenza in pigs.\nSwine flu viruses cause high levels of illness and low death rates in pigs.\nSwine influenza viruses may circulate among swine throughout the year, but\nmost outbreaks occur during the late fall and winter months similar to\noutbreaks in humans. There are 4 main influenza type A virus subtypes that\nhave been isolated in pigs: H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and H3N1. Most flu viruses\ncirculating in pigs are referred to as \"triple-reassortant\" viruses because\nthese flu viruses contain genes from human, swine and avian influenza viruses.\n\nMost commonly, cases of human infection with swine-origin influenza viruses\noccur in people with direct exposure to pigs. The patient in Pennsylvania\nlives in an area where live pigs are farmed and the patient in Wisconsin\nbecame sick 2 days after attending a state fair where pigs were exhibited.\nIt's important to note that swine influenza viruses are not transmitted to\nhumans by food. You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork\nproducts. Eating properly handled and cooked pork and pork products is safe.\n\nIn the past, CDC received reports of approximately one human infection with\na swine influenza virus every one to 2 years, but in the past few years,\nabout 3 cases have been reported per year. Increased reporting of human\ninfections with swine influenza could be the result of increased influenza\ntesting capacity and capabilities in public health laboratories.\n\nThese trH3N2 viruses are different from the 2009 H1N1 virus that has been\ncirculating in the United States since late April 2009. They are also\ndifferent from human seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses that typically\ncirculate among people during the flu season. Swine trH3N2 viruses commonly\ncirculate in pigs in North America, but rarely infect humans. These viruses\nare different from the swine classical H1N1 or swine trH1N1 influenza\nviruses that also circulate in pigs in North America because they have H3N2\nsurface antigens. Tr H3N2 viruses first emerged in North American swine\nherds in the late 1990s. The H3 and N2 genes which 1st emerged in swine flu\nviruses originated from human seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses that\ncirculated globally among humans in the late 1990s.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of instances of human infection with animal\ninfluenza viruses do not result in human to human transmission, each case\nshould be fully investigated to be sure that such viruses are not spreading\namong humans and to limit further exposure of humans to infected animals if\ninfected animals are identified. Surveillance for both seasonal and novel\ninfluenza viruses is conducted by the CDC and its state and local health\npartners year round.\n\nFor more information about swine influenza, see:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/>.\nWeekly US surveillance updates are published in FluView and posted at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm>.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[There are 4 main influenza type A virus subtypes that have been isolated\nin pigs: H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and H3N1.

Test samples from 2\npatients submitted by Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have been confirmed at the\nCDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] as positive for swine\norigin triple-reassortant (tr) H3N2 influenza viruses -- viruses that\nnormally infect pigs. While human infection with swine influenza viruses is\nrare, it can occur. This is most likely to occur when people are in close\nproximity to infected pigs, such as in pig barns and livestock exhibits\nhousing pigs at fairs.\n\nBoth of the patients with confirmed trH3N2 infection reported in FluView\nwere in the vicinity of live pigs. Dates of illness onset in the 2 patients\nare more than 6 weeks apart and the viruses from the 2 patients have some\ngenetic differences, confirming that these 2 cases are not linked. Ongoing\ninvestigations in both states have not shown any evidence of community\ntransmission of these viruses. The most likely scenario at this point is\nthat these are 2 isolated cases of human infection with swine influenza\nviruses that, while very rare, do occur from time to time. Both patients\nhave fully recovered from their illnesses; however, these 2 cases do\nunderscore the importance of human and animal surveillance for influenza.\n\nThese 2 cases reported in FluView bring the total number of human\ninfections with swine origin influenza viruses reported to CDC since 2005\nto 18. Previously, 3 of these reports had been swine origin A (H3N2)\nviruses. The Pennsylvania and Wisconsin cases bring the number of reports\nswine origin A (H3N2) infections in humans in the United States to 5. The\nviruses identified in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are similar to viruses\nthat infected a patient in Iowa in September 2009, a patient in Kansas in\nAugust 2009 and a patient in Minnesota in May 2010.\n\nSwine Influenza (swine flu) is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type\nA influenza viruses that regularly causes outbreaks of influenza in pigs.\nSwine flu viruses cause high levels of illness and low death rates in pigs.\nSwine influenza viruses may circulate among swine throughout the year, but\nmost outbreaks occur during the late fall and winter months similar to\noutbreaks in humans. There are 4 main influenza type A virus subtypes that\nhave been isolated in pigs: H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and H3N1. Most flu viruses\ncirculating in pigs are referred to as \"triple-reassortant\" viruses because\nthese flu viruses contain genes from human, swine and avian influenza viruses.\n\nMost commonly, cases of human infection with swine-origin influenza viruses\noccur in people with direct exposure to pigs. The patient in Pennsylvania\nlives in an area where live pigs are farmed and the patient in Wisconsin\nbecame sick 2 days after attending a state fair where pigs were exhibited.\nIt's important to note that swine influenza viruses are not transmitted to\nhumans by food. You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork\nproducts. Eating properly handled and cooked pork and pork products is safe.\n\nIn the past, CDC received reports of approximately one human infection with\na swine influenza virus every one to 2 years, but in the past few years,\nabout 3 cases have been reported per year. Increased reporting of human\ninfections with swine influenza could be the result of increased influenza\ntesting capacity and capabilities in public health laboratories.\n\nThese trH3N2 viruses are different from the 2009 H1N1 virus that has been\ncirculating in the United States since late April 2009. They are also\ndifferent from human seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses that typically\ncirculate among people during the flu season. Swine trH3N2 viruses commonly\ncirculate in pigs in North America, but rarely infect humans. These viruses\nare different from the swine classical H1N1 or swine trH1N1 influenza\nviruses that also circulate in pigs in North America because they have H3N2\nsurface antigens. Tr H3N2 viruses first emerged in North American swine\nherds in the late 1990s. The H3 and N2 genes which 1st emerged in swine flu\nviruses originated from human seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses that\ncirculated globally among humans in the late 1990s.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of instances of human infection with animal\ninfluenza viruses do not result in human to human transmission, each case\nshould be fully investigated to be sure that such viruses are not spreading\namong humans and to limit further exposure of humans to infected animals if\ninfected animals are identified. Surveillance for both seasonal and novel\ninfluenza viruses is conducted by the CDC and its state and local health\npartners year round.\n\nFor more information about swine influenza, see:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/>.\nWeekly US surveillance updates are published in FluView and posted at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm>.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[There are 4 main influenza type A virus subtypes that have been isolated\nin pigs: H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and H3N1.

Test samples from 2\npatients submitted by Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have been confirmed at the\nCDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] as positive for swine\norigin triple-reassortant (tr) H3N2 influenza viruses -- viruses that\nnormally infect pigs. While human infection with swine influenza viruses is\nrare, it can occur. This is most likely to occur when people are in close\nproximity to infected pigs, such as in pig barns and livestock exhibits\nhousing pigs at fairs.\n\nBoth of the patients with confirmed trH3N2 infection reported in FluView\nwere in the vicinity of live pigs. Dates of illness onset in the 2 patients\nare more than 6 weeks apart and the viruses from the 2 patients have some\ngenetic differences, confirming that these 2 cases are not linked. Ongoing\ninvestigations in both states have not shown any evidence of community\ntransmission of these viruses. The most likely scenario at this point is\nthat these are 2 isolated cases of human infection with swine influenza\nviruses that, while very rare, do occur from time to time. Both patients\nhave fully recovered from their illnesses; however, these 2 cases do\nunderscore the importance of human and animal surveillance for influenza.\n\nThese 2 cases reported in FluView bring the total number of human\ninfections with swine origin influenza viruses reported to CDC since 2005\nto 18. Previously, 3 of these reports had been swine origin A (H3N2)\nviruses. The Pennsylvania and Wisconsin cases bring the number of reports\nswine origin A (H3N2) infections in humans in the United States to 5. The\nviruses identified in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are similar to viruses\nthat infected a patient in Iowa in September 2009, a patient in Kansas in\nAugust 2009 and a patient in Minnesota in May 2010.\n\nSwine Influenza (swine flu) is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type\nA influenza viruses that regularly causes outbreaks of influenza in pigs.\nSwine flu viruses cause high levels of illness and low death rates in pigs.\nSwine influenza viruses may circulate among swine throughout the year, but\nmost outbreaks occur during the late fall and winter months similar to\noutbreaks in humans. There are 4 main influenza type A virus subtypes that\nhave been isolated in pigs: H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and H3N1. Most flu viruses\ncirculating in pigs are referred to as \"triple-reassortant\" viruses because\nthese flu viruses contain genes from human, swine and avian influenza viruses.\n\nMost commonly, cases of human infection with swine-origin influenza viruses\noccur in people with direct exposure to pigs. The patient in Pennsylvania\nlives in an area where live pigs are farmed and the patient in Wisconsin\nbecame sick 2 days after attending a state fair where pigs were exhibited.\nIt's important to note that swine influenza viruses are not transmitted to\nhumans by food. You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork\nproducts. Eating properly handled and cooked pork and pork products is safe.\n\nIn the past, CDC received reports of approximately one human infection with\na swine influenza virus every one to 2 years, but in the past few years,\nabout 3 cases have been reported per year. Increased reporting of human\ninfections with swine influenza could be the result of increased influenza\ntesting capacity and capabilities in public health laboratories.\n\nThese trH3N2 viruses are different from the 2009 H1N1 virus that has been\ncirculating in the United States since late April 2009. They are also\ndifferent from human seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses that typically\ncirculate among people during the flu season. Swine trH3N2 viruses commonly\ncirculate in pigs in North America, but rarely infect humans. These viruses\nare different from the swine classical H1N1 or swine trH1N1 influenza\nviruses that also circulate in pigs in North America because they have H3N2\nsurface antigens. Tr H3N2 viruses first emerged in North American swine\nherds in the late 1990s. The H3 and N2 genes which 1st emerged in swine flu\nviruses originated from human seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses that\ncirculated globally among humans in the late 1990s.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of instances of human infection with animal\ninfluenza viruses do not result in human to human transmission, each case\nshould be fully investigated to be sure that such viruses are not spreading\namong humans and to limit further exposure of humans to infected animals if\ninfected animals are identified. Surveillance for both seasonal and novel\ninfluenza viruses is conducted by the CDC and its state and local health\npartners year round.\n\nFor more information about swine influenza, see:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/>.\nWeekly US surveillance updates are published in FluView and posted at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm>.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[There are 4 main influenza type A virus subtypes that have been isolated\nin pigs: H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and H3N1.

In addition to H1N1 viruses, H3N2\nviruses also circulate in pigs. Pig to human and human to pig H3N2\ntransmission have both been documented, and it has long been thought that\npigs may play a role in the generation of new human strains. As pigs may\nbe infected with human, pig, and avian influenza strains, they are a\npotential source of new viral reassortants. Pigs, for example, might play\na catalytic role in \"transforming\" avian viral strains into human viral\nequivalents. The Hong Kong newspaper report does not suggest that this was\nthe case, however.\nImportant additional questions include whether pig to human transmission is\ncommon, whether clinically apparent human cases are the exception to the\nrule, and whether such instances are background noise, or constitute a\npotential risk for emergence of a new pandemic viruses. Based on the\ninformation provided, Dr. Mak's comment that there seems to be little human\nthreat seems reasonable. That CDC is assisting in the investigation is\nalso good news.

Symptoms again were mild and the children recovered\nwithout infecting family members.\nDr Mak said this particular H3N2 did not appear to be particularly\ninfectious, and said comparisons with the H5N1 bird flu outbreak of 1997\nwere \"unfair\", as this virus was not a new disease.\n\"We're of the opinion that this present case is a scientific discovery\nwhich does not appear to pose any major threat to public health.\" He said\nflu was picked up by breathing in airborne secretions from an infected\nperson or animal, and was not food-borne.\n\"There's no risk of getting influenza by eating pork,\" he said.

The results of more tests on the sample\nsent to the US are expected by the end of the week. In 1997, six people in\nHong Kong died of \"bird flu\", the H5N1 strain of influenza previously known\nonly in birds.\n[Byline: Jo Bowman\n*********\nCOMMENT\nAs the article suggests, because of intensive surveillance in Hong Kong,\ntransmission to humans of avian and porcine influenza A viruses is likely\nto be documented with increasing frequency. Hong Kong's H5N1 avian\ninfluenza outbreak two years ago caused international alarm, and led to\nexpanded surveillance for human and zoonotic influenza A circulation.\nAlthough human infection with porcine influenza viruses has long been\nknown, the implications for viral evolution and development of pathogenic\npotential are incompletely understood. In addition to H1N1 viruses, H3N2\nviruses also circulate in pigs. Pig to human and human to pig H3N2\ntransmission have both been documented, and it has long been thought that\npigs may play a role in the generation of new human strains. As pigs may\nbe infected with human, pig, and avian influenza strains, they are a\npotential source of new viral reassortants. Pigs, for example, might play\na catalytic role in \"transforming\" avian viral strains into human viral\nequivalents. The Hong Kong newspaper report does not suggest that this was\nthe case, however.\nImportant additional questions include whether pig to human transmission is\ncommon, whether clinically apparent human cases are the exception to the\nrule, and whether such instances are background noise, or constitute a\npotential risk for emergence of a new pandemic viruses. Based on the\ninformation provided, Dr. Mak's comment that there seems to be little human\nthreat seems reasonable. That CDC is assisting in the investigation is\nalso good news. This and recent influenza events provide continuing\nopportunities to learn more, via coordinated epidemiologic and viral\ngenetic study, about critical aspects of human-zoonotic influenza virus\nrelationships, leading to a better understanding of where human viruses\ncome from and how to control and prevent them.\n--\nDavid M.

The highly infectious human strains of influenza, Sydney and\nHarbin flu viruses, are also H3N2, but in this case swab tests revealed the\ngirl did not catch the bug from another person.\n\"The initial analysis suggests that this virus may be of swine origin and\ntherefore we are carrying out further investigations,\" department\nconsultant on community medicine Dr Mak Kwok-hang said.\n\"According to her family members, this baby girl has had no history of\ncontact with pigs.\" A Tuen Mun Hospital spokeswoman said the girl, an only\nchild, had been discharged in good health on 10 Sep 1999, two days after\nbeing admitted to the paediatrics ward with a cough and fever. She had not\nbeen ill since and had not been readmitted to hospital.
