It has killed\nat least 4 people, as well as a horse, 11 porpoises that washed\nashore, and dozens of cats and dogs. It is 37 times more infectious\non the island than it is in Australia, where it has long been a\nfixture in the environment, an international research team reported\nyesterday [23 Nov 2004] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences.\nSymptoms of infection include cough, lethargy, and night sweats. In\nserious cases, the fungus moves from the lungs into the central\nnervous system.\nThe unprecedented BC outbreak, which began in 1999 and continues\ntoday, highlights the need for global monitoring of the fungus, say\nthe scientists, who suspect it may be expanding its range because of\nclimate change. The outbreak was initially linked to Rathtrevor Beach\nProvincial Park in Parksville, but _Cryptococcus_ has now been found\nin soil and on trees from Victoria north to Courtenay.\nThe scientists warn the fungus now has the potential to cause\ninfections in temperate regions around the world. \"From a scientific\npoint of view, it is extraordinary,\" says Karen Bartlett, a co-author\nof the report, who studies environment health at the University of BC\n\"It is so rare to be right on top of an emerging infectious disease.\"\nThe fungi can be deadly when drawn deep into the lungs. The cells\nhave a \"slippery\" sugar coating that enables them to evade the lungs'\nprotective cells, which normally engulf and kill infectious\norganisms, says Ms. Bartlett. Being a tropical fungus, _Cryptococcus_\nalso has the ability to thrive at the body's temperature of 37 C that\nkills most other fungi.\nHow and why the tropical fungus took hold on the island is still a\nmystery, but researchers believe it is there to stay. \"I don't think\nit's going to go away anytime soon,\" says Sarah Kidd, lead author of\nthe paper, who is now at the University of BC. She has moved from\nAustralia to BC to study the outbreak of the fungus, which is living\nin the soil and under tree bark. It can also survive in seawater,\nwhich could help explain the porpoise deaths.\nMs. Bartlett suspects _Cryptococcus gattii_ may have been on\nVancouver Island at low levels for a long period, but no one noticed,\nbecause it was incapable of becoming airborne and infecting people or\nanimals. She says something changed in the late 1990s. The leading\ntheory is that the eastern coast of Vancouver Island has become\nwarmer and drier, making the region more hospitable. Or, perhaps, the\nresearchers say, logging and urban development opened up a new niche\nfor the fungus. It may have been imported on a plant from the tropics.\nWhile _Cryptococcus_ has proven more infectious on Vancouver Island,\nthe researchers stress that it isn't as lethal, or as fast-spreading,\nas many other pathogens. \"The attack rate is still quite low,\" says\nMs. Bartlett. Vancouver Island has 37 infections a year for every one\nmillion people, compared to about one case a year for every one\nmillion people in Australia. There is less risk of infection in the\nwinter months, perhaps because BC's rains wash the _Cryptococcus_\nparticles out of the air.\nOlder men are most vulnerable to infection, perhaps because they tend\nto spend a lot of time outdoors, says Laura MacDougall, an\nepidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control. Antifungal\nmedications are available, but must be taken for several months, she\nsays, adding that most infections are now [identified] early, and\nsuccessfully treated, because physicians and veterinarians have\n_Cryptococcus_ on their \"index of suspicion.\"\nThe researchers say the infection rate may drop, as islanders develop\nimmunity to the fungus over time.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This particular basidiomycete yeast-like fungus produces primarily\nrespiratory and neurological disease.
