The 38-year-old man tested positive for the rare viral disease, which is primarily transmitted to humans from animals, on Wednesday (8 May [2019]), said the MOH on Thursday [9 May 2019]. It is the 1st case of monkeypox reported here.\n\nHe is currently in an isolation ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), and is in stable condition.\n\nMeanwhile, 22 of 23 individuals who have been identified as close contacts of the patient are also under quarantine as a precautionary measure. One of the close contacts, a workshop participant, had left Singapore on 5 May [2019] before the patient was diagnosed. He has reported to the MOH that he remains well with no symptoms.\n\n\"Nonetheless, as a precaution, MOH has informed the public health authority in his home country,\" said the ministry. The MOH added that while it is possible for the disease to be transmitted between humans, the risk of spread is low.\n\nThe MOH offers the following precautions to take when travelling to areas affected by monkeypox in central and western Africa:\n- Maintain a high standard of personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing after going to the toilet, or when hands are soiled.\n- Avoid direct contact with skin lesions of infected living or dead persons or animals, as well as objects that may have become contaminated with infectious fluids, such as soiled clothing or linens (e.g., bedding or towels) used by an infected person.\n- Avoid contact with wild animals, and consumption of bush meat.\n- Returning travellers from areas affected by monkeypox should seek immediate medical attention if they develop any disease symptoms (e.g., sudden onset of high fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash) within 3 weeks of their return. They should inform their doctor of their recent travel history.\n\nBefore coming to Singapore, the man attended a wedding in Nigeria, where he may have consumed bush meat -- a possible source of transmission of the monkeypox virus. Bush meat, the meat of wild animals hunted and sold for food, is a popular source of protein in some parts of Africa where meat from domesticated animals is scarce or expensive.\n\nUpon his arrival on 28 Apr [2019], he stayed at Hotel 81 Orchid in Geylang. In the following 2 days, he attended a workshop at the Samsung Hub in Church Street, in the Central Business District.\n\nOn 30 Apr [2019], he developed fever, muscle ache, chills and skin rash. Between 1 and 7 May [2019], the man reported that he stayed in his hotel room most of the time. On 7 May [2019], he was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital by ambulance and referred to NCID.\n\nSubsequently, the MOH identified the people who had come into close contact with the man, including 18 participants and trainers who attended the same workshop; one worker at the workshop venue; and 4 hotel staff. They have since been assessed by NCID and offered vaccination to prevent the disease or reduce the severity of symptoms, said the ministry.\n\n\"As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined and monitored for 21 days from their date of exposure to the patient,\" said MOH. Those who develop symptoms will be treated at NCID, and all others who came into contact with the man and have a low risk of being infected are being put under active surveillance, and will be contacted twice daily to monitor their health status, the ministry added. MOH's investigation and contact tracing operations are ongoing.\n\nCommon symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, muscle ache, backache, swollen lymph nodes and skin rash. In its statement, the MOH said monkeypox is usually self-limiting, with most patients recovering within 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n\"In some cases, however, the virus can cause serious complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis (brain inflammation) and eye infection with ensuing loss of vision,\" added the statement. \"There have been reported mortality rates of 1% to 10% during outbreaks, with most deaths occurring in younger age-groups.\"\n\nTransmission of monkeypox mainly occurs when a person comes into close contact with infected animals, usually rodents, through the hunting and consumption of bush meat. It added that transmission of the disease between humans is possible but limited, as a person is infectious only when he has symptoms, particularly skin rash.\n\n\"Transmission typically occurs from close contact with the respiratory tract secretions or skin lesions of an infected person, or objects recently contaminated by an infected person's fluids or lesion materials,\" it added.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is not the 1st time that a human monkeypox (MPX) virus infection has been imported into another country from Nigeria. In 2018, 2 cases of MPX virus infection were imported into the UK with an additional case ensuing from local transmission from the 2nd patient. The 1st monkeypox case involved a male Nigerian naval officer who was attending a training course at a naval base in Cornwall in southwestern England. The 2nd patient was a UK man who returned to the country from a 22-day vacation in Nigeria on 4 Sep 2018. A 3rd imported case was an Israeli who lived and worked in the Port Harcourt area of Rivers state in southern Nigeria (an endemic MPX region). The man got sick about a week after his return to Israel from Nigeria.\n\nMPX virus is endemic in Nigeria and has been actively transmitted this year (2019). Since the beginning of the outbreak in September 2017, 311 suspected cases and 7 deaths have been reported in 26 states in Nigeria. MPX virus transmission is currently occurring over a broad geographic area in Nigeria. This outbreak has been unusual. Rather than sporadic or rare cases, there have been over 100 cases scattered over a large geographic area since 2017 and again this year (2019). The reasons for this relatively sudden appearance are not clear. Perhaps there has been an epizootic of MPX virus infections among its rodent hosts, with spillover to people.\n\nMonkeypox is an orthopoxvirus infection and is related to smallpox. The disease can also be confused with chickenpox, which is caused by an unrelated virus.\n\nNon-human primates are not monkeypox virus reservoirs. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents (genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).\n\nMap of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nSingapore: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/150\nNigeria: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62]\nSee Also\nMonkeypox - Africa (02): Nigeria 20190220.6327203\n2018\n----\nMonkeypox - UK (05): ex Nigeria 20181004.6069282\nMonkeypox - Israel: ex Nigeria 20181013.6088822\n.................................................ty/rd/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "smallpox", "monkeypox", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2019-05-16 00:00:00", "2019-04-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-05-08 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2019-05-09 00:00:00", "2021-05-05 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-09-04 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-09-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Singapore", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cornwall", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "England", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Israel", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Geylang", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6841084", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Monkeypox - Africa (07): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6841084", "date": "2019-05-11 12:00:16", "main_text": "MONKEYPOX - SINGAPORE ex NIGERIA\n********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 9 May 2019\nSource: Straits Times [edited]\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/moh-confirms-one-imported-case-of-monkeypox-in-singapore\n\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed one imported case of monkeypox infection in Singapore, involving a Nigerian national who arrived last month [April 2019] for a workshop.

The 38-year-old man tested positive for the rare viral disease, which is primarily transmitted to humans from animals, on Wednesday (8 May [2019]), said the MOH on Thursday [9 May 2019]. It is the 1st case of monkeypox reported here.\n\nHe is currently in an isolation ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), and is in stable condition.\n\nMeanwhile, 22 of 23 individuals who have been identified as close contacts of the patient are also under quarantine as a precautionary measure. One of the close contacts, a workshop participant, had left Singapore on 5 May [2019] before the patient was diagnosed. He has reported to the MOH that he remains well with no symptoms.\n\n\"Nonetheless, as a precaution, MOH has informed the public health authority in his home country,\" said the ministry. The MOH added that while it is possible for the disease to be transmitted between humans, the risk of spread is low.\n\nThe MOH offers the following precautions to take when travelling to areas affected by monkeypox in central and western Africa:\n- Maintain a high standard of personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing after going to the toilet, or when hands are soiled.\n- Avoid direct contact with skin lesions of infected living or dead persons or animals, as well as objects that may have become contaminated with infectious fluids, such as soiled clothing or linens (e.g., bedding or towels) used by an infected person.\n- Avoid contact with wild animals, and consumption of bush meat.\n- Returning travellers from areas affected by monkeypox should seek immediate medical attention if they develop any disease symptoms (e.g., sudden onset of high fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash) within 3 weeks of their return. They should inform their doctor of their recent travel history.\n\nBefore coming to Singapore, the man attended a wedding in Nigeria, where he may have consumed bush meat -- a possible source of transmission of the monkeypox virus. Bush meat, the meat of wild animals hunted and sold for food, is a popular source of protein in some parts of Africa where meat from domesticated animals is scarce or expensive.\n\nUpon his arrival on 28 Apr [2019], he stayed at Hotel 81 Orchid in Geylang. In the following 2 days, he attended a workshop at the Samsung Hub in Church Street, in the Central Business District.\n\nOn 30 Apr [2019], he developed fever, muscle ache, chills and skin rash. Between 1 and 7 May [2019], the man reported that he stayed in his hotel room most of the time. On 7 May [2019], he was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital by ambulance and referred to NCID.\n\nSubsequently, the MOH identified the people who had come into close contact with the man, including 18 participants and trainers who attended the same workshop; one worker at the workshop venue; and 4 hotel staff. They have since been assessed by NCID and offered vaccination to prevent the disease or reduce the severity of symptoms, said the ministry.\n\n\"As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined and monitored for 21 days from their date of exposure to the patient,\" said MOH. Those who develop symptoms will be treated at NCID, and all others who came into contact with the man and have a low risk of being infected are being put under active surveillance, and will be contacted twice daily to monitor their health status, the ministry added. MOH's investigation and contact tracing operations are ongoing.\n\nCommon symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, muscle ache, backache, swollen lymph nodes and skin rash. In its statement, the MOH said monkeypox is usually self-limiting, with most patients recovering within 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n\"In some cases, however, the virus can cause serious complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis (brain inflammation) and eye infection with ensuing loss of vision,\" added the statement. \"There have been reported mortality rates of 1% to 10% during outbreaks, with most deaths occurring in younger age-groups.\"\n\nTransmission of monkeypox mainly occurs when a person comes into close contact with infected animals, usually rodents, through the hunting and consumption of bush meat. It added that transmission of the disease between humans is possible but limited, as a person is infectious only when he has symptoms, particularly skin rash.\n\n\"Transmission typically occurs from close contact with the respiratory tract secretions or skin lesions of an infected person, or objects recently contaminated by an infected person's fluids or lesion materials,\" it added.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is not the 1st time that a human monkeypox (MPX) virus infection has been imported into another country from Nigeria. In 2018, 2 cases of MPX virus infection were imported into the UK with an additional case ensuing from local transmission from the 2nd patient. The 1st monkeypox case involved a male Nigerian naval officer who was attending a training course at a naval base in Cornwall in southwestern England. The 2nd patient was a UK man who returned to the country from a 22-day vacation in Nigeria on 4 Sep 2018. A 3rd imported case was an Israeli who lived and worked in the Port Harcourt area of Rivers state in southern Nigeria (an endemic MPX region). The man got sick about a week after his return to Israel from Nigeria.\n\nMPX virus is endemic in Nigeria and has been actively transmitted this year (2019). Since the beginning of the outbreak in September 2017, 311 suspected cases and 7 deaths have been reported in 26 states in Nigeria. MPX virus transmission is currently occurring over a broad geographic area in Nigeria. This outbreak has been unusual. Rather than sporadic or rare cases, there have been over 100 cases scattered over a large geographic area since 2017 and again this year (2019). The reasons for this relatively sudden appearance are not clear.

The 38-year-old man tested positive for the rare viral disease, which is primarily transmitted to humans from animals, on Wednesday (8 May [2019]), said the MOH on Thursday [9 May 2019]. It is the 1st case of monkeypox reported here.\n\nHe is currently in an isolation ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), and is in stable condition.\n\nMeanwhile, 22 of 23 individuals who have been identified as close contacts of the patient are also under quarantine as a precautionary measure. One of the close contacts, a workshop participant, had left Singapore on 5 May [2019] before the patient was diagnosed. He has reported to the MOH that he remains well with no symptoms.\n\n\"Nonetheless, as a precaution, MOH has informed the public health authority in his home country,\" said the ministry. The MOH added that while it is possible for the disease to be transmitted between humans, the risk of spread is low.\n\nThe MOH offers the following precautions to take when travelling to areas affected by monkeypox in central and western Africa:\n- Maintain a high standard of personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing after going to the toilet, or when hands are soiled.\n- Avoid direct contact with skin lesions of infected living or dead persons or animals, as well as objects that may have become contaminated with infectious fluids, such as soiled clothing or linens (e.g., bedding or towels) used by an infected person.\n- Avoid contact with wild animals, and consumption of bush meat.\n- Returning travellers from areas affected by monkeypox should seek immediate medical attention if they develop any disease symptoms (e.g., sudden onset of high fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash) within 3 weeks of their return. They should inform their doctor of their recent travel history.\n\nBefore coming to Singapore, the man attended a wedding in Nigeria, where he may have consumed bush meat -- a possible source of transmission of the monkeypox virus. Bush meat, the meat of wild animals hunted and sold for food, is a popular source of protein in some parts of Africa where meat from domesticated animals is scarce or expensive.\n\nUpon his arrival on 28 Apr [2019], he stayed at Hotel 81 Orchid in Geylang. In the following 2 days, he attended a workshop at the Samsung Hub in Church Street, in the Central Business District.\n\nOn 30 Apr [2019], he developed fever, muscle ache, chills and skin rash. Between 1 and 7 May [2019], the man reported that he stayed in his hotel room most of the time. On 7 May [2019], he was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital by ambulance and referred to NCID.\n\nSubsequently, the MOH identified the people who had come into close contact with the man, including 18 participants and trainers who attended the same workshop; one worker at the workshop venue; and 4 hotel staff. They have since been assessed by NCID and offered vaccination to prevent the disease or reduce the severity of symptoms, said the ministry.\n\n\"As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined and monitored for 21 days from their date of exposure to the patient,\" said MOH. Those who develop symptoms will be treated at NCID, and all others who came into contact with the man and have a low risk of being infected are being put under active surveillance, and will be contacted twice daily to monitor their health status, the ministry added. MOH's investigation and contact tracing operations are ongoing.\n\nCommon symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, muscle ache, backache, swollen lymph nodes and skin rash. In its statement, the MOH said monkeypox is usually self-limiting, with most patients recovering within 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n\"In some cases, however, the virus can cause serious complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis (brain inflammation) and eye infection with ensuing loss of vision,\" added the statement. \"There have been reported mortality rates of 1% to 10% during outbreaks, with most deaths occurring in younger age-groups.\"\n\nTransmission of monkeypox mainly occurs when a person comes into close contact with infected animals, usually rodents, through the hunting and consumption of bush meat. It added that transmission of the disease between humans is possible but limited, as a person is infectious only when he has symptoms, particularly skin rash.\n\n\"Transmission typically occurs from close contact with the respiratory tract secretions or skin lesions of an infected person, or objects recently contaminated by an infected person's fluids or lesion materials,\" it added.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is not the 1st time that a human monkeypox (MPX) virus infection has been imported into another country from Nigeria. In 2018, 2 cases of MPX virus infection were imported into the UK with an additional case ensuing from local transmission from the 2nd patient. The 1st monkeypox case involved a male Nigerian naval officer who was attending a training course at a naval base in Cornwall in southwestern England. The 2nd patient was a UK man who returned to the country from a 22-day vacation in Nigeria on 4 Sep 2018. A 3rd imported case was an Israeli who lived and worked in the Port Harcourt area of Rivers state in southern Nigeria (an endemic MPX region). The man got sick about a week after his return to Israel from Nigeria.\n\nMPX virus is endemic in Nigeria and has been actively transmitted this year (2019). Since the beginning of the outbreak in September 2017, 311 suspected cases and 7 deaths have been reported in 26 states in Nigeria. MPX virus transmission is currently occurring over a broad geographic area in Nigeria. This outbreak has been unusual. Rather than sporadic or rare cases, there have been over 100 cases scattered over a large geographic area since 2017 and again this year (2019). The reasons for this relatively sudden appearance are not clear.

No indication is given about where in Nigeria these 2 cases might have acquired their infections. There are several possibilities. Nigeria has had many monkeypox cases in 2017-2018 in several states. The most recent cases were in June 2018 in Plateau state. These cases in Nigeria were caused by the West African clade of the monkeypox virus, presumably the same clade of the virus as infects the 2 UK cases.\n\nNon-human primates are not a monkeypox virus reservoir. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent, and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).\n\nMaps of Nigeria can be accessed at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED maps available at:\nUnited Kingdom: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40\nNigeria: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62]\nSee Also\nMonkeypox - UK: ex Nigeria 20180908.6017005\nMonkeypox - Africa (11): Nigeria (PL) 20180608.5847036\nMonkeypox - Africa (06): Nigeria 20180405.5728330\nMonkeypox - Africa (04) 20180327.5712702\nMonkeypox - Africa: Nigeria 20180120.5572204\n.................................................mhj/mpp/jh/ty/msp/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "monkeypox"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2018-09-11 00:00:00", "2017-09-16 00:00:00", "2018-09-11 00:00:00", "2018-06-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Cornwall", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "England", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "London", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6017005", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Monkeypox - UK: ex Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6017005", "date": "2018-04-05 15:29:28", "main_text": "MONKEYPOX - AFRICA (06): NIGERIA\n********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate Wed 4 Apr 2018 [ahead of print]\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [summ., edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/6/18-0017_article#suggestedcitation\n\n\nCitation\n-------\nYinka-Ogunleye A, Aruna O, Ogoina D, et al.

As of [17 Nov 2017], a total of 146 suspected cases had been reported from 22 of the 36 states in Nigeria (Figure [see URL]). Of the 134 samples (blood, lesion swab, and crust) collected during the reporting period, 107 samples were tested, and 42 samples from 14 states were laboratory confirmed as the West African clade of the monkeypox virus. Most (62 percent) of the laboratory-confirmed cases were in adults (21-40 years of age; median 30 years of age); the male:female ratio was 2:1. A 46-year-old male patient with confirmed monkeypox and a history of immunosuppressive illness died. For some patients with suspected (but ultimately deemed negative) cases of monkeypox, chickenpox (wild-type virus) was confirmed. Further analysis of the monkeypox-negative samples is ongoing.\n\nAlthough detailed epidemiologic investigations to ascertain the source and route of transmission are ongoing, 3 family clusters were found, which might suggest some level of human-to-human transmission in this outbreak. For 1 of the families, the secondary attack rate was 71 percent. However, most patients had no obvious epidemiologic linkage or person-to-person contact, indicating a probable multiple-source outbreak or possibly previously unrecognized endemic disease. The zoonotic source(s) of the outbreak are currently unknown, and it is unclear what, if any, environmental or ecologic changes might have facilitated its sudden reemergence.\n\nDisclaimer [from the URL]: Ahead of print articles are not considered as final versions.

As of [17 Nov 2017], a total of 146 suspected cases had been reported from 22 of the 36 states in Nigeria (Figure [see URL]). Of the 134 samples (blood, lesion swab, and crust) collected during the reporting period, 107 samples were tested, and 42 samples from 14 states were laboratory confirmed as the West African clade of the monkeypox virus. Most (62 percent) of the laboratory-confirmed cases were in adults (21-40 years of age; median 30 years of age); the male:female ratio was 2:1. A 46-year-old male patient with confirmed monkeypox and a history of immunosuppressive illness died. For some patients with suspected (but ultimately deemed negative) cases of monkeypox, chickenpox (wild-type virus) was confirmed. Further analysis of the monkeypox-negative samples is ongoing.\n\nAlthough detailed epidemiologic investigations to ascertain the source and route of transmission are ongoing, 3 family clusters were found, which might suggest some level of human-to-human transmission in this outbreak. For 1 of the families, the secondary attack rate was 71 percent. However, most patients had no obvious epidemiologic linkage or person-to-person contact, indicating a probable multiple-source outbreak or possibly previously unrecognized endemic disease. The zoonotic source(s) of the outbreak are currently unknown, and it is unclear what, if any, environmental or ecologic changes might have facilitated its sudden reemergence.\n\nDisclaimer [from the URL]: Ahead of print articles are not considered as final versions.

By mid-November 2017, a large outbreak caused by the West African clade resulted in 146 suspected cases and 42 laboratory-confirmed cases from 14 states. Although the source is unknown, multiple sources are suspected.\n\n[Selected summary]\n------------------\nOn [13 Oct 2017], the Nigeria CDC received laboratory confirmation of a human monkeypox outbreak in Nigeria. As of [17 Nov 2017], a total of 146 suspected cases had been reported from 22 of the 36 states in Nigeria (Figure [see URL]). Of the 134 samples (blood, lesion swab, and crust) collected during the reporting period, 107 samples were tested, and 42 samples from 14 states were laboratory confirmed as the West African clade of the monkeypox virus. Most (62 percent) of the laboratory-confirmed cases were in adults (21-40 years of age; median 30 years of age); the male:female ratio was 2:1. A 46-year-old male patient with confirmed monkeypox and a history of immunosuppressive illness died. For some patients with suspected (but ultimately deemed negative) cases of monkeypox, chickenpox (wild-type virus) was confirmed. Further analysis of the monkeypox-negative samples is ongoing.\n\nAlthough detailed epidemiologic investigations to ascertain the source and route of transmission are ongoing, 3 family clusters were found, which might suggest some level of human-to-human transmission in this outbreak. For 1 of the families, the secondary attack rate was 71 percent. However, most patients had no obvious epidemiologic linkage or person-to-person contact, indicating a probable multiple-source outbreak or possibly previously unrecognized endemic disease. The zoonotic source(s) of the outbreak are currently unknown, and it is unclear what, if any, environmental or ecologic changes might have facilitated its sudden reemergence.\n\nDisclaimer [from the URL]: Ahead of print articles are not considered as final versions. Any changes will be reflected in the online version in the month the article is officially released.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report provides a good summary of the recent monkeypox (MPX) outbreak in Nigeria. It substantiates the West African clade of MPX virus as the one involved, which explains the low (almost nil) case fatality rate compared to the Central African clade. The 3 family clusters indicate that person-to-person transmission can occur, but does not account for the origin of the majority of cases. The role of rodents as reservoirs and sources of human exposure in this outbreak are unknown.\n\nA previous report indicated that the MPXV of the index case was acquired within the country. With no cross-state relationships of cases and preliminary genetic sequencing, that suggests multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into human population. One wonders if a MPXV epizootic has been going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area in the country. Studies of prevalence of MPXV in rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).\n\nMaps of Nigeria can be accessed at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nNigeria: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62]\nSee Also\nMonkeypox - Africa (04) 20180327.5712702\nMonkeypox - Africa: Nigeria 20180120.5572204\n2017\n----\nMonkeypox - Africa (20): Nigeria 20171220.5516079\nMonkeypox - Africa (19): Nigeria 20171130.5475421\nMonkeypox - Africa (18): Nigeria 20171122.5458228\nMonkeypox - Africa (17): Nigeria (DE) conf & susp 20171120.5453985\nMonkeypox - Africa (16): Nigeria (DE) conf. susp. 20171112.5439201\nMonkeypox - Africa (15): Nigeria (15) (ED, BE) susp. 20171101.5419090\nMonkeypox - Africa (14): Nigeria 20171030.5412495\nMonkeypox - Africa (13): Nigeria (DE) 20171020.5393564\nMonkeypox - Africa (11): Nigeria 20171017.5386734\nMonkeypox - Africa (10): Nigeria 20171016.5384844\nMonkeypox - Africa (09): Nigeria, hospital cases NOT, other states' cases susp. 20171014.5380964\nMonkeypox - Africa (08): Nigeria 20171010.5369514\nMonkeypox - Africa (07): Nigeria 20171009.5368881\nMonkeypox - Africa (06): Nigeria 20171007.536663\n.................................................ty/ao/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "monkeypox"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "1978-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5726159", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Monkeypox - Africa (05): Central African Republic (HK)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5726159", "date": "2017-11-22 03:28:33", "main_text": "MONKEYPOX - AFRICA (18): NIGERIA\n********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 19 Nov 2017\nSource: Nigeria Center for Disease Control: Monkeypox outbreak in Nigeria situation report (No. 008) [edited]\nhttp://www.ncdc.gov.ng/themes/common/files/sitreps/72cb569d609098f0998f92d253c85e58.pdf\n\n\nHighlights\n- The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) continued to coordinate the response through its activated Emergency Operations Centre (EOC)\n- 4 new positive results were recorded from previously reported cases in Cross River (2), Imo (1) and Delta (1) states\n- 14 new suspected cases reported in the last one week\n- NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja continued laboratory diagnosis of monkeypox\n- There has been a decline in the number of new suspected cases reported over the last 3 weeks\n- Since the onset of the outbreak, a total of 146 cases have been recorded from 21 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)\n- No death attributable to monkeypox has been recorded so far\n- Laboratory investigation has so far confirmed 42 cases of monkeypox in 10 states (Akwa, Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Imo, Lagos, Rivers) and the FCT\n- Suspected cases reported from other states are being investigated\n- In furtherance of the one health approach to the outbreak response, a multi-sectoral team of human and animal epidemiologists have been deployed to some affected states to conduct detailed outbreak investigations among human and animal populations\n\nEpidemiological summary\n- 42 laboratory confirmed cases recorded since the onset of the outbreak\n- A total of 146 suspected cases have been reported from 21 states (Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Benue, Cross River, Delta, Ekiti, Edo, Enugu, Imo, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kwara, Kogi, Lagos, Ondo, Nasarawa, Niger, Oyo, Rivers) and the FCT\n- 9 of 12 monkeypox negative swab samples tested positive for chickenpox\n- A total of 134 samples have been collected and sent for testing\n- The male to female ratio is 2:1\n- The most affected age group is 21-40 years (median age = 30)\n- No deaths recorded among cases so far\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The number of confirmed monkeypox (MPX) cases continues to increase, although more slowly, from 38 cases in 8 states on 7 Nov 2017 to 42 cases in 10 states currently.

The MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak is not mentioned. With no reported fatalities, the West Africa clade may be the one involved in this outbreak. Interestingly, some of the cases reported above negative for MPX tested positive for chickenpox, so there appears to be a mixed outbreak involving these 2 unrelated but clinically similar viruses. As noted in the previous post, this is an unusually widespread outbreak of the disease. It would be of interest to know whether there is evidence of a monkeypox outbreak in these states in rodents that are the suspected reservoirs.

The disease is caused by monkeypox virus. It is closely related to the smallpox virus (variola), the virus used in the smallpox vaccine (vaccinia), and the cowpox virus. Infection with monkeypox is not as serious as its cousin, smallpox; however, human deaths have been attributed to monkeypox.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the symptoms of monkeypox are as follows:\n- About 12 days after people are infected with the virus, they will get a fever, headache, muscle aches, and backache; their lymph nodes will swell; and they will feel tired.\n- 1 to 3 days (or longer) after the fever starts, they will get a rash. This rash develops into raised bumps filled with fluid and often starts on the face and spreads, but it can start on other parts of the body too.\n- The bumps go through several stages before they get crusty, scab over, and fall off.\nThe illness usually lasts for 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nRodents, such as rope squirrels, door mice, and pouched rats, are the suspected reservoir hosts, with monkeys and humans as secondary, spill-over hosts. The monkeypox virus in the Congo has a higher case fatality rate than the virus in West Africa, where fatal cases are rare or absent, according to a ProMED moderator [Monkeypox, human - Congo DR: susp. 20120917.1297716].\n\nPeople at risk for monkeypox are those who get bitten by an infected animal or if you have contact with the animal's rash, blood, or body fluids. It can also be transmitted person to person through respiratory or direct contact and contact with contaminated bedding or clothing [this is extremely rare. - Mod.TY]. There is no specific treatment for monkeypox.\n\nA 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16262.full], says that since the last doses of smallpox vaccine were given in 1980 and smallpox was officially eradicated, cases of monkeypox have increased 20-fold according to the study.\n\nMuch of this is likely due to the immunity that smallpox vaccine granted to related viruses like monkeypox.

The disease is caused by monkeypox virus. It is closely related to the smallpox virus (variola), the virus used in the smallpox vaccine (vaccinia), and the cowpox virus. Infection with monkeypox is not as serious as its cousin, smallpox; however, human deaths have been attributed to monkeypox.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the symptoms of monkeypox are as follows:\n- About 12 days after people are infected with the virus, they will get a fever, headache, muscle aches, and backache; their lymph nodes will swell; and they will feel tired.\n- 1 to 3 days (or longer) after the fever starts, they will get a rash. This rash develops into raised bumps filled with fluid and often starts on the face and spreads, but it can start on other parts of the body too.\n- The bumps go through several stages before they get crusty, scab over, and fall off.\nThe illness usually lasts for 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nRodents, such as rope squirrels, door mice, and pouched rats, are the suspected reservoir hosts, with monkeys and humans as secondary, spill-over hosts. The monkeypox virus in the Congo has a higher case fatality rate than the virus in West Africa, where fatal cases are rare or absent, according to a ProMED moderator [Monkeypox, human - Congo DR: susp. 20120917.1297716].\n\nPeople at risk for monkeypox are those who get bitten by an infected animal or if you have contact with the animal's rash, blood, or body fluids. It can also be transmitted person to person through respiratory or direct contact and contact with contaminated bedding or clothing [this is extremely rare. - Mod.TY]. There is no specific treatment for monkeypox.\n\nA 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16262.full], says that since the last doses of smallpox vaccine were given in 1980 and smallpox was officially eradicated, cases of monkeypox have increased 20-fold according to the study.\n\nMuch of this is likely due to the immunity that smallpox vaccine granted to related viruses like monkeypox.

A new\nstudy suggests that the monkeypox virus, which\nthe smallpox vaccine also grants immunity\nagainst, is now at least 20 times as common as it\nwas shortly after victory over smallpox had been declared.\n\n\"The eradication of smallpox was one of the\ngreatest achievements known to man,\" lead\nresearcher Anne Rimoin of the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles School of Public Health\ntold Reuters Health. \"But a consequence of\nceasing smallpox vaccinations is that now the\nworld's population is vulnerable to other (related viruses) such as monkeypox.\"\n\nWhile the infection is somewhat less serious than\nsmallpox, it can still scar and even kill its\nvictims. And in contrast to its cousin, monkeypox\nis not only able to jump between humans, but can\ninfect through contact with small animals that\nharbor the virus. As a result, its control could\nbe all the more challenging, warned Rimoin.\n\nConverging political, social, economic and\nenvironmental factors make African nations -- in\nparticular, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n-- especially vulnerable to the infection, she\nexplained. The virus's favorite animal hosts such\nas squirrels and monkeys are endemic [abundant]\nthere, and civil war has forced many people to\nrely heavily on hunting wildlife for sustenance.\nSome have even migrated deep into the animals'\nforest habitats to seek refuge from the violence.\n\n\"The virus has probably been on the rise for\nyears, but the country lacked surveillance,\"\nRimoin noted. \"To find disease, you have to look\nfor it.\" So she and her colleagues, who included\nmany local Congolese, did just that. Using\nChinese bicycles like pack mules to transport\nsupplies, and with funding from the U.S. National\nInstitutes of Health, they surveyed 9 local\nhealth zones for signs of monkeypox between\nNovember 2005 and November 2007. They identified\n760 cases of laboratory-confirmed monkeypox.\n\nCompared to similar surveillance conducted in the\n1980s, Rimoin's team found a 20-fold increase in\nmonkeypox cases -- far more than they ever\nexpected to find. In a single health zone, the\naverage number of yearly cases rose from less\nthan 1 to roughly 14 per 10 000 people.\n\nMost of the victims were born after smallpox\nvaccination was officially discontinued in 1980.\nVaccinated individuals were more than 5 times\nless likely to become infected with monkeypox\ncompared to those without the vaccine's\nprotection, the researchers report in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [Abstract reproduced below].\n\n\"What we're seeing is a harbinger of things to\ncome,\" said Rimoin. She warned that the virus\ncould grow more widespread with further\ndeforestation, continued movement of people from\nrural to urban areas, bushmeat trafficking and\nimportation of exotic pets. \"And every new\ninfection provides the virus with the opportunity\nto evolve into a more serious or transmissible virus,\" she added.\n\nIt's already clear that the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo isn't the only home for the virus.\nThe Republic of the Congo and Sudan also reported\ncases in recent years. And in 2003, monkeypox\narrived in the U.S. Midwest with imported African\nrodents, before spreading among prairie dogs and\nsickening 90 people. Experts fear an even more\nvirulent and efficient virus could return to the western world.\n\n\"The higher the rate of new infections, the\ngreater the chance that travelers from the U.S.\nwill be exposed, and that the disease will be\nimported into the U.S. -- possibly establishing\nitself in U.S. rodent populations,\" Dr. Dan\nDiGiulio of Stanford University School of\nMedicine in California, who was not involved in\nthe study, noted in an e-mail message to Reuters Health.\n\nSo what can be done to keep the virus at bay?\nRimoin suggested that behavioral interventions\nmay be the most effective strategy at this point,\nincluding teaching people at risk of infection\nwhat animals may be most likely to carry\nmonkeypox and how to handle them to avoid\ninfection, as well as isolating infected\nindividuals. Continued active surveillance is\nalso important to better identify the animal\nreservoirs and rates of animal-to-human versus\nhuman-to-human transmission. \"Once we understand\nmore about this virus and what it may mean for\nus,\" she said, \"we may be able to consider\nspecific interventions, perhaps vaccinating\ngroups that are at significant risk of\ninfection.\" DiGiulio added the need for animal\nimportation policies, and research into effective\nantiviral treatments and vaccine development.\n\n\"Three decades after the eradication of smallpox,\npox viruses still deserve our close attention,\"\nsaid Rimoin. \"And we shouldn't only worry about\nits accidental introduction but also as a deliberate terrorist release.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is the reference and abstract for\nthe publication discussed in the above press report.\n\nTitle: Major increase in human monkeypox\nincidence 30 years after smallpox vaccination\ncampaigns cease in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nAuthors: Anne W.

Active,\npopulation-based surveillance was conducted in 9\nhealth zones in central DRC. Epidemiologic data\nand biological samples were obtained from\nsuspected cases. Cumulative incidence (per 10 000\npopulation) and major determinants of infection\nwere compared with data from active surveillance\nin similar regions from 1981 to 1986.\n\nBetween November 2005 and November 2007, 760\nlaboratory-confirmed human monkeypox cases were\nidentified in participating health zones. The\naverage annual cumulative incidence across zones\nwas 5.53 per 10 000 (2.18\u00ad14.42). Factors\nassociated with increased risk of infection\nincluded: living in forested areas, male gender,\nage <15, and no prior smallpox vaccination.\nVaccinated persons had a 5.2-fold lower risk of\nmonkeypox than unvaccinated persons (0.78 vs. 4.05 per 10,000).\n\nComparison of active surveillance data in the\nsame health zone from the 1980s (0.72 per 10 000)\nand 2006\u00ad07 (14.42 per 10 000) suggests a 20-fold\nincrease in human monkeypox incidence. 30 years\nafter mass smallpox vaccination campaigns ceased,\nhuman monkeypox incidence has dramatically\nincreased in rural DRC. Improved surveillance and\nepidemiological analysis is needed to better\nassess the public health burden and develop\nstrategies for reducing the risk of wider spread of infection.\"\n\nThe virus species _Monkeypox virus_ is a member\nof the genus _Orthopoxvirus_. Monkeypox virus can\ncauses a disease in humans that is clinically\nsimilar to smallpox and outbreaks in central\nAfrica have been associated with significant\nmortality, although none occurred in the outbreak\nin the USA in 2003 associated with introduced African rodents.\n\nAn important difference between monkeypox virus\nand smallpox virus (variola virus) is that\nmonkeypox virus has not transmitted from\nperson-to-person as efficiently as variola virus.\nIndeed monkeypox virus is normally resident in\nrodents and squirrels but can be transmitted to\nother species as zoonoses. Phylogenetically the\nspecies _Monkeypox virus_ is among the most\ndivergent viral species from the species _\nVariola virus_. Indeed variola virus is more\nclosely related to camelpox virus than to monkeypox virus.\n\nConsequently evolution of monkeypox virus into a\nvariola-like virus by mutation and selection is\nimprobable.

A new\nstudy suggests that the monkeypox virus, which\nthe smallpox vaccine also grants immunity\nagainst, is now at least 20 times as common as it\nwas shortly after victory over smallpox had been declared.\n\n\"The eradication of smallpox was one of the\ngreatest achievements known to man,\" lead\nresearcher Anne Rimoin of the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles School of Public Health\ntold Reuters Health. \"But a consequence of\nceasing smallpox vaccinations is that now the\nworld's population is vulnerable to other (related viruses) such as monkeypox.\"\n\nWhile the infection is somewhat less serious than\nsmallpox, it can still scar and even kill its\nvictims. And in contrast to its cousin, monkeypox\nis not only able to jump between humans, but can\ninfect through contact with small animals that\nharbor the virus. As a result, its control could\nbe all the more challenging, warned Rimoin.\n\nConverging political, social, economic and\nenvironmental factors make African nations -- in\nparticular, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n-- especially vulnerable to the infection, she\nexplained. The virus's favorite animal hosts such\nas squirrels and monkeys are endemic [abundant]\nthere, and civil war has forced many people to\nrely heavily on hunting wildlife for sustenance.\nSome have even migrated deep into the animals'\nforest habitats to seek refuge from the violence.\n\n\"The virus has probably been on the rise for\nyears, but the country lacked surveillance,\"\nRimoin noted. \"To find disease, you have to look\nfor it.\" So she and her colleagues, who included\nmany local Congolese, did just that. Using\nChinese bicycles like pack mules to transport\nsupplies, and with funding from the U.S. National\nInstitutes of Health, they surveyed 9 local\nhealth zones for signs of monkeypox between\nNovember 2005 and November 2007. They identified\n760 cases of laboratory-confirmed monkeypox.\n\nCompared to similar surveillance conducted in the\n1980s, Rimoin's team found a 20-fold increase in\nmonkeypox cases -- far more than they ever\nexpected to find. In a single health zone, the\naverage number of yearly cases rose from less\nthan 1 to roughly 14 per 10 000 people.\n\nMost of the victims were born after smallpox\nvaccination was officially discontinued in 1980.\nVaccinated individuals were more than 5 times\nless likely to become infected with monkeypox\ncompared to those without the vaccine's\nprotection, the researchers report in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [Abstract reproduced below].\n\n\"What we're seeing is a harbinger of things to\ncome,\" said Rimoin. She warned that the virus\ncould grow more widespread with further\ndeforestation, continued movement of people from\nrural to urban areas, bushmeat trafficking and\nimportation of exotic pets. \"And every new\ninfection provides the virus with the opportunity\nto evolve into a more serious or transmissible virus,\" she added.\n\nIt's already clear that the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo isn't the only home for the virus.\nThe Republic of the Congo and Sudan also reported\ncases in recent years. And in 2003, monkeypox\narrived in the U.S. Midwest with imported African\nrodents, before spreading among prairie dogs and\nsickening 90 people. Experts fear an even more\nvirulent and efficient virus could return to the western world.\n\n\"The higher the rate of new infections, the\ngreater the chance that travelers from the U.S.\nwill be exposed, and that the disease will be\nimported into the U.S. -- possibly establishing\nitself in U.S. rodent populations,\" Dr. Dan\nDiGiulio of Stanford University School of\nMedicine in California, who was not involved in\nthe study, noted in an e-mail message to Reuters Health.\n\nSo what can be done to keep the virus at bay?\nRimoin suggested that behavioral interventions\nmay be the most effective strategy at this point,\nincluding teaching people at risk of infection\nwhat animals may be most likely to carry\nmonkeypox and how to handle them to avoid\ninfection, as well as isolating infected\nindividuals. Continued active surveillance is\nalso important to better identify the animal\nreservoirs and rates of animal-to-human versus\nhuman-to-human transmission. \"Once we understand\nmore about this virus and what it may mean for\nus,\" she said, \"we may be able to consider\nspecific interventions, perhaps vaccinating\ngroups that are at significant risk of\ninfection.\" DiGiulio added the need for animal\nimportation policies, and research into effective\nantiviral treatments and vaccine development.\n\n\"Three decades after the eradication of smallpox,\npox viruses still deserve our close attention,\"\nsaid Rimoin. \"And we shouldn't only worry about\nits accidental introduction but also as a deliberate terrorist release.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is the reference and abstract for\nthe publication discussed in the above press report.\n\nTitle: Major increase in human monkeypox\nincidence 30 years after smallpox vaccination\ncampaigns cease in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nAuthors: Anne W.

Active,\npopulation-based surveillance was conducted in 9\nhealth zones in central DRC. Epidemiologic data\nand biological samples were obtained from\nsuspected cases. Cumulative incidence (per 10 000\npopulation) and major determinants of infection\nwere compared with data from active surveillance\nin similar regions from 1981 to 1986.\n\nBetween November 2005 and November 2007, 760\nlaboratory-confirmed human monkeypox cases were\nidentified in participating health zones. The\naverage annual cumulative incidence across zones\nwas 5.53 per 10 000 (2.18\u00ad14.42). Factors\nassociated with increased risk of infection\nincluded: living in forested areas, male gender,\nage <15, and no prior smallpox vaccination.\nVaccinated persons had a 5.2-fold lower risk of\nmonkeypox than unvaccinated persons (0.78 vs. 4.05 per 10,000).\n\nComparison of active surveillance data in the\nsame health zone from the 1980s (0.72 per 10 000)\nand 2006\u00ad07 (14.42 per 10 000) suggests a 20-fold\nincrease in human monkeypox incidence. 30 years\nafter mass smallpox vaccination campaigns ceased,\nhuman monkeypox incidence has dramatically\nincreased in rural DRC. Improved surveillance and\nepidemiological analysis is needed to better\nassess the public health burden and develop\nstrategies for reducing the risk of wider spread of infection.\"\n\nThe virus species _Monkeypox virus_ is a member\nof the genus _Orthopoxvirus_. Monkeypox virus can\ncauses a disease in humans that is clinically\nsimilar to smallpox and outbreaks in central\nAfrica have been associated with significant\nmortality, although none occurred in the outbreak\nin the USA in 2003 associated with introduced African rodents.\n\nAn important difference between monkeypox virus\nand smallpox virus (variola virus) is that\nmonkeypox virus has not transmitted from\nperson-to-person as efficiently as variola virus.\nIndeed monkeypox virus is normally resident in\nrodents and squirrels but can be transmitted to\nother species as zoonoses. Phylogenetically the\nspecies _Monkeypox virus_ is among the most\ndivergent viral species from the species _\nVariola virus_. Indeed variola virus is more\nclosely related to camelpox virus than to monkeypox virus.\n\nConsequently evolution of monkeypox virus into a\nvariola-like virus by mutation and selection is\nimprobable.

A new\nstudy suggests that the monkeypox virus, which\nthe smallpox vaccine also grants immunity\nagainst, is now at least 20 times as common as it\nwas shortly after victory over smallpox had been declared.\n\n\"The eradication of smallpox was one of the\ngreatest achievements known to man,\" lead\nresearcher Anne Rimoin of the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles School of Public Health\ntold Reuters Health. \"But a consequence of\nceasing smallpox vaccinations is that now the\nworld's population is vulnerable to other (related viruses) such as monkeypox.\"\n\nWhile the infection is somewhat less serious than\nsmallpox, it can still scar and even kill its\nvictims. And in contrast to its cousin, monkeypox\nis not only able to jump between humans, but can\ninfect through contact with small animals that\nharbor the virus. As a result, its control could\nbe all the more challenging, warned Rimoin.\n\nConverging political, social, economic and\nenvironmental factors make African nations -- in\nparticular, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n-- especially vulnerable to the infection, she\nexplained. The virus's favorite animal hosts such\nas squirrels and monkeys are endemic [abundant]\nthere, and civil war has forced many people to\nrely heavily on hunting wildlife for sustenance.\nSome have even migrated deep into the animals'\nforest habitats to seek refuge from the violence.\n\n\"The virus has probably been on the rise for\nyears, but the country lacked surveillance,\"\nRimoin noted. \"To find disease, you have to look\nfor it.\" So she and her colleagues, who included\nmany local Congolese, did just that. Using\nChinese bicycles like pack mules to transport\nsupplies, and with funding from the U.S. National\nInstitutes of Health, they surveyed 9 local\nhealth zones for signs of monkeypox between\nNovember 2005 and November 2007. They identified\n760 cases of laboratory-confirmed monkeypox.\n\nCompared to similar surveillance conducted in the\n1980s, Rimoin's team found a 20-fold increase in\nmonkeypox cases -- far more than they ever\nexpected to find. In a single health zone, the\naverage number of yearly cases rose from less\nthan 1 to roughly 14 per 10 000 people.\n\nMost of the victims were born after smallpox\nvaccination was officially discontinued in 1980.\nVaccinated individuals were more than 5 times\nless likely to become infected with monkeypox\ncompared to those without the vaccine's\nprotection, the researchers report in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [Abstract reproduced below].\n\n\"What we're seeing is a harbinger of things to\ncome,\" said Rimoin. She warned that the virus\ncould grow more widespread with further\ndeforestation, continued movement of people from\nrural to urban areas, bushmeat trafficking and\nimportation of exotic pets. \"And every new\ninfection provides the virus with the opportunity\nto evolve into a more serious or transmissible virus,\" she added.\n\nIt's already clear that the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo isn't the only home for the virus.\nThe Republic of the Congo and Sudan also reported\ncases in recent years. And in 2003, monkeypox\narrived in the U.S. Midwest with imported African\nrodents, before spreading among prairie dogs and\nsickening 90 people. Experts fear an even more\nvirulent and efficient virus could return to the western world.\n\n\"The higher the rate of new infections, the\ngreater the chance that travelers from the U.S.\nwill be exposed, and that the disease will be\nimported into the U.S. -- possibly establishing\nitself in U.S. rodent populations,\" Dr. Dan\nDiGiulio of Stanford University School of\nMedicine in California, who was not involved in\nthe study, noted in an e-mail message to Reuters Health.\n\nSo what can be done to keep the virus at bay?\nRimoin suggested that behavioral interventions\nmay be the most effective strategy at this point,\nincluding teaching people at risk of infection\nwhat animals may be most likely to carry\nmonkeypox and how to handle them to avoid\ninfection, as well as isolating infected\nindividuals. Continued active surveillance is\nalso important to better identify the animal\nreservoirs and rates of animal-to-human versus\nhuman-to-human transmission. \"Once we understand\nmore about this virus and what it may mean for\nus,\" she said, \"we may be able to consider\nspecific interventions, perhaps vaccinating\ngroups that are at significant risk of\ninfection.\" DiGiulio added the need for animal\nimportation policies, and research into effective\nantiviral treatments and vaccine development.\n\n\"Three decades after the eradication of smallpox,\npox viruses still deserve our close attention,\"\nsaid Rimoin. \"And we shouldn't only worry about\nits accidental introduction but also as a deliberate terrorist release.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is the reference and abstract for\nthe publication discussed in the above press report.\n\nTitle: Major increase in human monkeypox\nincidence 30 years after smallpox vaccination\ncampaigns cease in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nAuthors: Anne W.

Active,\npopulation-based surveillance was conducted in 9\nhealth zones in central DRC. Epidemiologic data\nand biological samples were obtained from\nsuspected cases. Cumulative incidence (per 10 000\npopulation) and major determinants of infection\nwere compared with data from active surveillance\nin similar regions from 1981 to 1986.\n\nBetween November 2005 and November 2007, 760\nlaboratory-confirmed human monkeypox cases were\nidentified in participating health zones. The\naverage annual cumulative incidence across zones\nwas 5.53 per 10 000 (2.18\u00ad14.42). Factors\nassociated with increased risk of infection\nincluded: living in forested areas, male gender,\nage <15, and no prior smallpox vaccination.\nVaccinated persons had a 5.2-fold lower risk of\nmonkeypox than unvaccinated persons (0.78 vs. 4.05 per 10,000).\n\nComparison of active surveillance data in the\nsame health zone from the 1980s (0.72 per 10 000)\nand 2006\u00ad07 (14.42 per 10 000) suggests a 20-fold\nincrease in human monkeypox incidence. 30 years\nafter mass smallpox vaccination campaigns ceased,\nhuman monkeypox incidence has dramatically\nincreased in rural DRC. Improved surveillance and\nepidemiological analysis is needed to better\nassess the public health burden and develop\nstrategies for reducing the risk of wider spread of infection.\"\n\nThe virus species _Monkeypox virus_ is a member\nof the genus _Orthopoxvirus_. Monkeypox virus can\ncauses a disease in humans that is clinically\nsimilar to smallpox and outbreaks in central\nAfrica have been associated with significant\nmortality, although none occurred in the outbreak\nin the USA in 2003 associated with introduced African rodents.\n\nAn important difference between monkeypox virus\nand smallpox virus (variola virus) is that\nmonkeypox virus has not transmitted from\nperson-to-person as efficiently as variola virus.\nIndeed monkeypox virus is normally resident in\nrodents and squirrels but can be transmitted to\nother species as zoonoses. Phylogenetically the\nspecies _Monkeypox virus_ is among the most\ndivergent viral species from the species _\nVariola virus_. Indeed variola virus is more\nclosely related to camelpox virus than to monkeypox virus.\n\nConsequently evolution of monkeypox virus into a\nvariola-like virus by mutation and selection is\nimprobable.

And in contrast to its cousin, monkeypox\nis not only able to jump between humans, but can\ninfect through contact with small animals that\nharbor the virus. As a result, its control could\nbe all the more challenging, warned Rimoin.\n\nConverging political, social, economic and\nenvironmental factors make African nations -- in\nparticular, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n-- especially vulnerable to the infection, she\nexplained. The virus's favorite animal hosts such\nas squirrels and monkeys are endemic [abundant]\nthere, and civil war has forced many people to\nrely heavily on hunting wildlife for sustenance.\nSome have even migrated deep into the animals'\nforest habitats to seek refuge from the violence.\n\n\"The virus has probably been on the rise for\nyears, but the country lacked surveillance,\"\nRimoin noted. \"To find disease, you have to look\nfor it.\" So she and her colleagues, who included\nmany local Congolese, did just that. Using\nChinese bicycles like pack mules to transport\nsupplies, and with funding from the U.S. National\nInstitutes of Health, they surveyed 9 local\nhealth zones for signs of monkeypox between\nNovember 2005 and November 2007. They identified\n760 cases of laboratory-confirmed monkeypox.\n\nCompared to similar surveillance conducted in the\n1980s, Rimoin's team found a 20-fold increase in\nmonkeypox cases -- far more than they ever\nexpected to find. In a single health zone, the\naverage number of yearly cases rose from less\nthan 1 to roughly 14 per 10 000 people.\n\nMost of the victims were born after smallpox\nvaccination was officially discontinued in 1980.\nVaccinated individuals were more than 5 times\nless likely to become infected with monkeypox\ncompared to those without the vaccine's\nprotection, the researchers report in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [Abstract reproduced below].\n\n\"What we're seeing is a harbinger of things to\ncome,\" said Rimoin. She warned that the virus\ncould grow more widespread with further\ndeforestation, continued movement of people from\nrural to urban areas, bushmeat trafficking and\nimportation of exotic pets. \"And every new\ninfection provides the virus with the opportunity\nto evolve into a more serious or transmissible virus,\" she added.\n\nIt's already clear that the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo isn't the only home for the virus.\nThe Republic of the Congo and Sudan also reported\ncases in recent years. And in 2003, monkeypox\narrived in the U.S. Midwest with imported African\nrodents, before spreading among prairie dogs and\nsickening 90 people. Experts fear an even more\nvirulent and efficient virus could return to the western world.\n\n\"The higher the rate of new infections, the\ngreater the chance that travelers from the U.S.\nwill be exposed, and that the disease will be\nimported into the U.S. -- possibly establishing\nitself in U.S. rodent populations,\" Dr. Dan\nDiGiulio of Stanford University School of\nMedicine in California, who was not involved in\nthe study, noted in an e-mail message to Reuters Health.\n\nSo what can be done to keep the virus at bay?\nRimoin suggested that behavioral interventions\nmay be the most effective strategy at this point,\nincluding teaching people at risk of infection\nwhat animals may be most likely to carry\nmonkeypox and how to handle them to avoid\ninfection, as well as isolating infected\nindividuals. Continued active surveillance is\nalso important to better identify the animal\nreservoirs and rates of animal-to-human versus\nhuman-to-human transmission. \"Once we understand\nmore about this virus and what it may mean for\nus,\" she said, \"we may be able to consider\nspecific interventions, perhaps vaccinating\ngroups that are at significant risk of\ninfection.\" DiGiulio added the need for animal\nimportation policies, and research into effective\nantiviral treatments and vaccine development.\n\n\"Three decades after the eradication of smallpox,\npox viruses still deserve our close attention,\"\nsaid Rimoin. \"And we shouldn't only worry about\nits accidental introduction but also as a deliberate terrorist release.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is the reference and abstract for\nthe publication discussed in the above press report.\n\nTitle: Major increase in human monkeypox\nincidence 30 years after smallpox vaccination\ncampaigns cease in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nAuthors: Anne W.

Active,\npopulation-based surveillance was conducted in 9\nhealth zones in central DRC. Epidemiologic data\nand biological samples were obtained from\nsuspected cases.

Monkeypox virus can\ncauses a disease in humans that is clinically\nsimilar to smallpox and outbreaks in central\nAfrica have been associated with significant\nmortality, although none occurred in the outbreak\nin the USA in 2003 associated with introduced African rodents.\n\nAn important difference between monkeypox virus\nand smallpox virus (variola virus) is that\nmonkeypox virus has not transmitted from\nperson-to-person as efficiently as variola virus.\nIndeed monkeypox virus is normally resident in\nrodents and squirrels but can be transmitted to\nother species as zoonoses. Phylogenetically the\nspecies _Monkeypox virus_ is among the most\ndivergent viral species from the species _\nVariola virus_. Indeed variola virus is more\nclosely related to camelpox virus than to monkeypox virus.\n\nConsequently evolution of monkeypox virus into a\nvariola-like virus by mutation and selection is\nimprobable.

The finding of so many mild cases\nand no deaths so far is surprising. Some have commented that it is the\n\"comorbidity\" present in Africa that enhances the impact of monkeypox. I\nfind this explanation to be facile; there is no evidence that any\nparticular disease impacts on the outcome of infection with the virus in\nAfrica and there is no evidence that concomitant malnutrition or other\ncondition is needed to make monkeypox a serious disease. This may be so,\nbut I don't know of any data.\nIn fact, the only cases of monkeypox I have seen were in pygmies in the mid\n1980s and the general health of the group was quite good, although the\nstate of the recovering children reminded me very much of that of persons\nrecovering from measles with the added visible lymphadenopathy. Which of\ncourse brings to mind another obvious explanation for the mild course in\nthe US. There is better supportive care. This doesn't wash because the\ncases seem to be quite mild and not snatched from the jaws of death by\nnursing, antipyretics, rehydrations, and antibiotic treatment of secondary\ninfections as we attribute to differences in measles mortality.\nThere are, of course, many possible speculations including host and viral\ngenetics, recent passage in prairie dogs, etc. I would like to suggest a\nrather off-the-wall, but not unreasonable, idea that should be factored\ninto the equation: route of inoculation. This idea originates from the old\npractice of smallpox prevention by \"variolation\" or \"inoculation\". Smallpox\nvirus was introduced into the skin or nasal mucous membrane of a\nsusceptible person and the resulting disease was relatively mild and\nimmunized. If one reads the old English literature, one finds that the low\nmortality of about two per cent was obtained by a shallow inoculation in\nthe skin. The subsequent local cutaneous lesion appeared quickly and\napparently initiated a vigorous immune response that attenuated the disease\nwith the result of few pocks (appearing later) and mild host impact. This\nseems to fit some of the situations floating about on the rumor mill,\nalthough I have had no contact with these cases.\n--\nClarence J Peters\n<cjpeters@utmb.edu>\nSee Also\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (10): Kentucky 20030617.1498\nMonkeypox - European Union: prevention (import ban) 20030617.1497\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (09) 20030615.1479\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (08): NJ NOT 20030614.1470\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (07): transmi... 20030613.1458\nMonkeypox - USA: recommendations for vets (02) 20030613.1457\nMonkeypox - USA: recommendations for vets 20030612.1446\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (06) 20030612.1450\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(05) 20030611.1442\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(04) 20030611.1436\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(03) 20030610.1433\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(02) 20030609.1422\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (WI, IL, IN) 20030608.1412\n2002\n---\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) (07) 20021025.5638\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) (06) 20020410.3926\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) 20020228.3654\n2001\n---\nMonkeypox, suspected - Congo DR (Equateur) (02) 20010927.2353\nMonkeypox, suspected - Congo DR (Equateur): RFI 20010315.0523\n2000\n---\nMonkeypox - Congo, Dem.

The finding of so many mild cases\nand no deaths so far is surprising. Some have commented that it is the\n\"comorbidity\" present in Africa that enhances the impact of monkeypox. I\nfind this explanation to be facile; there is no evidence that any\nparticular disease impacts on the outcome of infection with the virus in\nAfrica and there is no evidence that concomitant malnutrition or other\ncondition is needed to make monkeypox a serious disease. This may be so,\nbut I don't know of any data.\nIn fact, the only cases of monkeypox I have seen were in pygmies in the mid\n1980s and the general health of the group was quite good, although the\nstate of the recovering children reminded me very much of that of persons\nrecovering from measles with the added visible lymphadenopathy. Which of\ncourse brings to mind another obvious explanation for the mild course in\nthe US. There is better supportive care. This doesn't wash because the\ncases seem to be quite mild and not snatched from the jaws of death by\nnursing, antipyretics, rehydrations, and antibiotic treatment of secondary\ninfections as we attribute to differences in measles mortality.\nThere are, of course, many possible speculations including host and viral\ngenetics, recent passage in prairie dogs, etc. I would like to suggest a\nrather off-the-wall, but not unreasonable, idea that should be factored\ninto the equation: route of inoculation. This idea originates from the old\npractice of smallpox prevention by \"variolation\" or \"inoculation\". Smallpox\nvirus was introduced into the skin or nasal mucous membrane of a\nsusceptible person and the resulting disease was relatively mild and\nimmunized. If one reads the old English literature, one finds that the low\nmortality of about two per cent was obtained by a shallow inoculation in\nthe skin. The subsequent local cutaneous lesion appeared quickly and\napparently initiated a vigorous immune response that attenuated the disease\nwith the result of few pocks (appearing later) and mild host impact.

This doesn't wash because the\ncases seem to be quite mild and not snatched from the jaws of death by\nnursing, antipyretics, rehydrations, and antibiotic treatment of secondary\ninfections as we attribute to differences in measles mortality.\nThere are, of course, many possible speculations including host and viral\ngenetics, recent passage in prairie dogs, etc. I would like to suggest a\nrather off-the-wall, but not unreasonable, idea that should be factored\ninto the equation: route of inoculation. This idea originates from the old\npractice of smallpox prevention by \"variolation\" or \"inoculation\". Smallpox\nvirus was introduced into the skin or nasal mucous membrane of a\nsusceptible person and the resulting disease was relatively mild and\nimmunized. If one reads the old English literature, one finds that the low\nmortality of about two per cent was obtained by a shallow inoculation in\nthe skin. The subsequent local cutaneous lesion appeared quickly and\napparently initiated a vigorous immune response that attenuated the disease\nwith the result of few pocks (appearing later) and mild host impact. This\nseems to fit some of the situations floating about on the rumor mill,\nalthough I have had no contact with these cases.\n--\nClarence J Peters\n<cjpeters@utmb.edu>\nSee Also\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (10): Kentucky 20030617.1498\nMonkeypox - European Union: prevention (import ban) 20030617.1497\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (09) 20030615.1479\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (08): NJ NOT 20030614.1470\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (07): transmi... 20030613.1458\nMonkeypox - USA: recommendations for vets (02) 20030613.1457\nMonkeypox - USA: recommendations for vets 20030612.1446\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (06) 20030612.1450\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(05) 20030611.1442\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(04) 20030611.1436\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(03) 20030610.1433\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(02) 20030609.1422\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (WI, IL, IN) 20030608.1412\n2002\n---\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) (07) 20021025.5638\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) (06) 20020410.3926\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) 20020228.3654\n2001\n---\nMonkeypox, suspected - Congo DR (Equateur) (02) 20010927.2353\nMonkeypox, suspected - Congo DR (Equateur): RFI 20010315.0523\n2000\n---\nMonkeypox - Congo, Dem.

In humans, the\nillness produces a vesicular and pustular rash similar to that produced by\nsmallpox.\n\nThe incubation period from exposure to fever onset is about 12 days. In\nhumans, case-fatality ratios in Africa have ranged from 1 to 10 percent\n(for additional information about monkeypox, see\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3/hutin.htm>).\n\nThese interim guidelines will be updated as new information becomes\navailable and after consultation with additional public health partners.\n\nIn the current outbreak, illness in animals has been reported to include\nfever, cough, blepharoconjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, followed by a\nnodular rash. Some animals have died while others reportedly recovered.\n\nThe types of animals that may become ill with monkeypox are currently\nunknown; as a precaution, all mammals should be considered susceptible at\nthis time.\n\nPet owners who suspect their animal may have an illness compatible with\nmonkeypox should immediately isolate the animal from humans and other\nanimals and contact their state or local health department. In most cases,\nevaluation by a veterinarian will be recommended. Owners should notify the\nveterinarian before transporting the animal to the clinic so that\nappropriate infection control precautions can be implemented prior to arrival.\n\nOwners should consider wearing a mask and gloves when handling the animal.\nThe animal\u0092s bedding should be collected and bagged and brought with the\nanimal to the veterinary clinic for disposal as medically regulated waste.\n\nSoiled bedding should not be disposed of as household trash. Following\nidentification of an animal with suspect monkeypox in a household, any\nanimals (including dogs and cats) who may have come in contact with the\nsick animal should be closely observed for signs of illness for a period of\n1 month following the last date of exposure. Contaminated household\nsurfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. Standard household\ncleaning/disinfectants may be used in accordance with manufacturer\u0092s\ninstructions.\n\nTransport of the ill animal to a veterinary clinic should be done by a\nsingle individual to limit unnecessary exposure. At the time of animal\ntransport, the owner should also transport the sick animal\u0092s bagged bedding\nfor disposal. Care should be taken to minimize driver exposure during\ntransport. During transport animals should be confined in a closed\ncontainer such as a cardboard box. If available, the animal should be\nconfined in a separate compartment of the vehicle, such as the bed of a\npickup truck. Following transport, the area of the vehicle where the animal\nwas confined should be cleaned and disinfected. Standard household\ncleaning/disinfectants may be used in accordance with the manufacturer\u0092s\ninstructions.\n\nVeterinarians examining sick prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or other\nmammals that may have come in contact with a suspected monkeypox case,\nshould consider the diagnosis of monkeypox infection. Animals that\ncurrently appear healthy but have been implicated as a probable source of\ninfection for a human case should also be treated as a suspected case of\nmonkeypox. All suspected cases of monkeypox in animals should be reported\nimmediately to state or local health department officials.\n\nVeterinarians who have been notified of an arriving animal with suspected\nmonkeypox should admit the animal through a separate entrance to a private\nroom and place it in isolation; the animal should not be admitted to an\nopen waiting room.\n\nWhen examining or euthanizing sick rodents, lagomorphs, and exotic pets,\nespecially prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or any ill mammal known to\nhave been in contact with a case of monkeypox, the following precautions\nshould be used:\n\n* Hand hygiene after all contact with a sick animal and contaminated surfaces.\n* Use of gown and gloves for any contact with the sick animal and\ncontaminated surfaces.\n* Eye protection (e.g. goggles or face shield) if splash or spray of body\nfluids is likely.\n* Respiratory protection including a NIOSH-certified N95 filtering\ndisposable respirator for entering the exam room. If N95 respirators are\nnot available for health-care personnel, then surgical masks should be worn.*\n* Contain and dispose of contaminated waste in accordance with\nfacility-specific guidelines for medically regulated infectious waste.\n* Handle used patient-care equipment in a manner that prevents\ncontamination of skin and clothing. Ensure that used equipment has been\ncleaned and reprocessed appropriately.\n* Ensure that procedures are in place for cleaning and disinfecting\ncontaminated environmental surfaces. Any EPA-registered hospital\ndetergent-disinfectant currently used by health-care facilities for\nenvironmental sanitation may be used. Manufacturer\u0092s recommendations for\ndilution (i.e., concentration), contact time, and care in handling should\nbe followed.\n* Laundry (e.g., towels, clothing) may be washed in a standard washing\nmachine with warm water and detergent; bleach may be added but is not\nnecessary. Care should be used when handling soiled laundry to avoid direct\ncontact with contaminated material. Soiled laundry should not be shaken or\notherwise handled in a manner that may aerosolize infectious particles.\n\nAll animals with suspected monkeypox infection should be humanely\neuthanized to prevent further spread of the disease. Humane euthanasia\noptions include pentobarbital injection or gas chamber using isoflurane or\nhalothane for most animals. For small rodent species such as mice, cervical\ndislocation may be considered if performed by a trained person.\n\nCDC is not currently recommending euthanasia of asymptomatic animals that\nmay have been exposed to other infected animals. Exposed asymptomatic\nanimals should be confined to the home and not allowed to come into contact\nwith other animals. They should be observed for development of signs\ncompatible with monkeypox for one month. Should such signs develop, the\nanimal should then be evaluated and euthanized if indicated.\n\nCurrently, CDC is not routinely requesting animal samples for testing.\nHowever, specimens can be collected and stored for possible future testing.\n\nConsultation with the state epidemiologist and state health laboratory is\nnecessary for samples to be sent to CDC for testing.\n<http://www.cste.org/members/state_and_territorial_epi.asp>\n<http://www.aphl.org/public_health_labs/index.cfm>\n\nPrior to euthanasia, whole blood in EDTA tubes or serum can be collected\nand refrigerated at 4 deg C. CDC is not recommending necropsies of animals\nexcept in Biosafety level 3 laboratories by persons recently vaccinated\nwith vaccinia. Instead, the entire carcass may be preserved by freezing at\n\u00ad70 deg C, or submersing in 10 percent formalin and injecting the body\ncavity with as much formalin as it will hold.\n\nFor more information, contact your state or local health department or the\nCDC Emergency Operations Center 770-488-7100.

Owners should notify the\nveterinarian before transporting the animal to the clinic so that\nappropriate infection control precautions can be implemented prior to arrival.\n\nOwners should consider wearing a mask and gloves when handling the animal.\nThe animal\u0092s bedding should be collected and bagged and brought with the\nanimal to the veterinary clinic for disposal as medically regulated waste.\n\nSoiled bedding should not be disposed of as household trash. Following\nidentification of an animal with suspect monkeypox in a household, any\nanimals (including dogs and cats) who may have come in contact with the\nsick animal should be closely observed for signs of illness for a period of\n1 month following the last date of exposure. Contaminated household\nsurfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. Standard household\ncleaning/disinfectants may be used in accordance with manufacturer\u0092s\ninstructions.\n\nTransport of the ill animal to a veterinary clinic should be done by a\nsingle individual to limit unnecessary exposure. At the time of animal\ntransport, the owner should also transport the sick animal\u0092s bagged bedding\nfor disposal. Care should be taken to minimize driver exposure during\ntransport. During transport animals should be confined in a closed\ncontainer such as a cardboard box. If available, the animal should be\nconfined in a separate compartment of the vehicle, such as the bed of a\npickup truck. Following transport, the area of the vehicle where the animal\nwas confined should be cleaned and disinfected. Standard household\ncleaning/disinfectants may be used in accordance with the manufacturer\u0092s\ninstructions.\n\nVeterinarians examining sick prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or other\nmammals that may have come in contact with a suspected monkeypox case,\nshould consider the diagnosis of monkeypox infection. Animals that\ncurrently appear healthy but have been implicated as a probable source of\ninfection for a human case should also be treated as a suspected case of\nmonkeypox. All suspected cases of monkeypox in animals should be reported\nimmediately to state or local health department officials.\n\nVeterinarians who have been notified of an arriving animal with suspected\nmonkeypox should admit the animal through a separate entrance to a private\nroom and place it in isolation; the animal should not be admitted to an\nopen waiting room.\n\nWhen examining or euthanizing sick rodents, lagomorphs, and exotic pets,\nespecially prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or any ill mammal known to\nhave been in contact with a case of monkeypox, the following precautions\nshould be used:\n\n* Hand hygiene after all contact with a sick animal and contaminated surfaces.\n* Use of gown and gloves for any contact with the sick animal and\ncontaminated surfaces.\n* Eye protection (e.g. goggles or face shield) if splash or spray of body\nfluids is likely.\n* Respiratory protection including a NIOSH-certified N95 filtering\ndisposable respirator for entering the exam room. If N95 respirators are\nnot available for health-care personnel, then surgical masks should be worn.*\n* Contain and dispose of contaminated waste in accordance with\nfacility-specific guidelines for medically regulated infectious waste.\n* Handle used patient-care equipment in a manner that prevents\ncontamination of skin and clothing. Ensure that used equipment has been\ncleaned and reprocessed appropriately.\n* Ensure that procedures are in place for cleaning and disinfecting\ncontaminated environmental surfaces. Any EPA-registered hospital\ndetergent-disinfectant currently used by health-care facilities for\nenvironmental sanitation may be used. Manufacturer\u0092s recommendations for\ndilution (i.e., concentration), contact time, and care in handling should\nbe followed.\n* Laundry (e.g., towels, clothing) may be washed in a standard washing\nmachine with warm water and detergent; bleach may be added but is not\nnecessary. Care should be used when handling soiled laundry to avoid direct\ncontact with contaminated material. Soiled laundry should not be shaken or\notherwise handled in a manner that may aerosolize infectious particles.\n\nAll animals with suspected monkeypox infection should be humanely\neuthanized to prevent further spread of the disease. Humane euthanasia\noptions include pentobarbital injection or gas chamber using isoflurane or\nhalothane for most animals. For small rodent species such as mice, cervical\ndislocation may be considered if performed by a trained person.\n\nCDC is not currently recommending euthanasia of asymptomatic animals that\nmay have been exposed to other infected animals. Exposed asymptomatic\nanimals should be confined to the home and not allowed to come into contact\nwith other animals. They should be observed for development of signs\ncompatible with monkeypox for one month.

In humans, the\nillness produces a vesicular and pustular rash similar to that produced by\nsmallpox.\n\nThe incubation period from exposure to fever onset is about 12 days. In\nhumans, case-fatality ratios in Africa have ranged from 1 to 10 percent\n(for additional information about monkeypox, see\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3/hutin.htm>).\n\nThese interim guidelines will be updated as new information becomes\navailable and after consultation with additional public health partners.\n\nIn the current outbreak, illness in animals has been reported to include\nfever, cough, blepharoconjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, followed by a\nnodular rash. Some animals have died while others reportedly recovered.\n\nThe types of animals that may become ill with monkeypox are currently\nunknown; as a precaution, all mammals should be considered susceptible at\nthis time.\n\nPet owners who suspect their animal may have an illness compatible with\nmonkeypox should immediately isolate the animal from humans and other\nanimals and contact their state or local health department. In most cases,\nevaluation by a veterinarian will be recommended. Owners should notify the\nveterinarian before transporting the animal to the clinic so that\nappropriate infection control precautions can be implemented prior to arrival.\n\nOwners should consider wearing a mask and gloves when handling the animal.\nThe animal\u0092s bedding should be collected and bagged and brought with the\nanimal to the veterinary clinic for disposal as medically regulated waste.\n\nSoiled bedding should not be disposed of as household trash. Following\nidentification of an animal with suspect monkeypox in a household, any\nanimals (including dogs and cats) who may have come in contact with the\nsick animal should be closely observed for signs of illness for a period of\n1 month following the last date of exposure. Contaminated household\nsurfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. Standard household\ncleaning/disinfectants may be used in accordance with manufacturer\u0092s\ninstructions.\n\nTransport of the ill animal to a veterinary clinic should be done by a\nsingle individual to limit unnecessary exposure. At the time of animal\ntransport, the owner should also transport the sick animal\u0092s bagged bedding\nfor disposal. Care should be taken to minimize driver exposure during\ntransport. During transport animals should be confined in a closed\ncontainer such as a cardboard box. If available, the animal should be\nconfined in a separate compartment of the vehicle, such as the bed of a\npickup truck. Following transport, the area of the vehicle where the animal\nwas confined should be cleaned and disinfected. Standard household\ncleaning/disinfectants may be used in accordance with the manufacturer\u0092s\ninstructions.\n\nVeterinarians examining sick prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or other\nmammals that may have come in contact with a suspected monkeypox case,\nshould consider the diagnosis of monkeypox infection. Animals that\ncurrently appear healthy but have been implicated as a probable source of\ninfection for a human case should also be treated as a suspected case of\nmonkeypox. All suspected cases of monkeypox in animals should be reported\nimmediately to state or local health department officials.\n\nVeterinarians who have been notified of an arriving animal with suspected\nmonkeypox should admit the animal through a separate entrance to a private\nroom and place it in isolation; the animal should not be admitted to an\nopen waiting room.\n\nWhen examining or euthanizing sick rodents, lagomorphs, and exotic pets,\nespecially prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or any ill mammal known to\nhave been in contact with a case of monkeypox, the following precautions\nshould be used:\n\n* Hand hygiene after all contact with a sick animal and contaminated surfaces.\n* Use of gown and gloves for any contact with the sick animal and\ncontaminated surfaces.\n* Eye protection (e.g. goggles or face shield) if splash or spray of body\nfluids is likely.\n* Respiratory protection including a NIOSH-certified N95 filtering\ndisposable respirator for entering the exam room. If N95 respirators are\nnot available for health-care personnel, then surgical masks should be worn.*\n* Contain and dispose of contaminated waste in accordance with\nfacility-specific guidelines for medically regulated infectious waste.\n* Handle used patient-care equipment in a manner that prevents\ncontamination of skin and clothing. Ensure that used equipment has been\ncleaned and reprocessed appropriately.\n* Ensure that procedures are in place for cleaning and disinfecting\ncontaminated environmental surfaces. Any EPA-registered hospital\ndetergent-disinfectant currently used by health-care facilities for\nenvironmental sanitation may be used. Manufacturer\u0092s recommendations for\ndilution (i.e., concentration), contact time, and care in handling should\nbe followed.\n* Laundry (e.g., towels, clothing) may be washed in a standard washing\nmachine with warm water and detergent; bleach may be added but is not\nnecessary. Care should be used when handling soiled laundry to avoid direct\ncontact with contaminated material. Soiled laundry should not be shaken or\notherwise handled in a manner that may aerosolize infectious particles.\n\nAll animals with suspected monkeypox infection should be humanely\neuthanized to prevent further spread of the disease. Humane euthanasia\noptions include pentobarbital injection or gas chamber using isoflurane or\nhalothane for most animals. For small rodent species such as mice, cervical\ndislocation may be considered if performed by a trained person.\n\nCDC is not currently recommending euthanasia of asymptomatic animals that\nmay have been exposed to other infected animals. Exposed asymptomatic\nanimals should be confined to the home and not allowed to come into contact\nwith other animals. They should be observed for development of signs\ncompatible with monkeypox for one month. Should such signs develop, the\nanimal should then be evaluated and euthanized if indicated.\n\nCurrently, CDC is not routinely requesting animal samples for testing.\nHowever, specimens can be collected and stored for possible future testing.\n\nConsultation with the state epidemiologist and state health laboratory is\nnecessary for samples to be sent to CDC for testing.\n<http://www.cste.org/members/state_and_territorial_epi.asp>\n<http://www.aphl.org/public_health_labs/index.cfm>\n\nPrior to euthanasia, whole blood in EDTA tubes or serum can be collected\nand refrigerated at 4 deg C. CDC is not recommending necropsies of animals\nexcept in Biosafety level 3 laboratories by persons recently vaccinated\nwith vaccinia. Instead, the entire carcass may be preserved by freezing at\n\u00ad70 deg C, or submersing in 10 percent formalin and injecting the body\ncavity with as much formalin as it will hold.\n\nFor more information, contact your state or local health department or the\nCDC Emergency Operations Center 770-488-7100. Additional information and\nrecommendations will be released as they become available. Updated\ninformation will be available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox>.\n\n* Respirators should be used in the context of a complete respiratory\nprotection program in accordance with OSHA regulations.
