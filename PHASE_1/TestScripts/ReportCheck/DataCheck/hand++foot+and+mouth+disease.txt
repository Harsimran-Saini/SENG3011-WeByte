Most cases don't need medical attention, but mums and dads are being told if symptoms don't ease after a week to speak to a doctor.\n\nThere's been a recent spate of cases in Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale. The 1st signs are a high temperature, loss of appetite, a cough, and a sore throat. After a couple of days, spots can develop inside the mouth and on the tongue and they can become painful ulcers that make eating and drinking difficult. A rash can then develop on the hands and feet. They can become blisters, which are itchy and uncomfortable.\n\nHealth experts say the best way to treat the illness is to keep the child at home and keep them hydrated.\n\nIf ulcers in the mouth are painful, soft foods and paracetamol are recommended. Symptoms should last between a week and 10 days, and most cases won't need medical attention.\n\nIf symptoms last longer or children show signs of dehydration, have fits, a very high temperature, are unusually tired or unrousable, or if their skin is painful, red, swollen, or hot to the touch, then parents are being told to speak to the doctor.\n\nTo minimise the spread of the illness, health experts say you should wash your hands and disinfect contaminated surfaces.\n\nThere's more information at https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hand-foot-mouth-disease/\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is most common in children under 10, especially those under 4 years of age. HFMD is extremely contagious; it often spreads among groups of children, particularly in nurseries and schools. The viruses that cause the disease are usually spread in mucus or saliva droplets, when someone who has it coughs or sneezes. It can also be transmitted by direct contact with the fluid from the blisters of a person infected with the virus. An infected person can also spread the virus if they don't wash their hands properly after going to the toilet, as the virus can be passed in faeces.\n\nPatients are most contagious while they still have blisters and mouth ulcers, which is usually for up to 7 to 10 days. However patients can continue to pass the virus in their faeces for several weeks, and may still be mildly infectious during this time.\n\nHFMD is spread very easily. There are some things you can do to reduce your risk of catching or spreading it:\n- wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before you eat and after you go to the toilet;\n- cover mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Use a tissue and wash your hands afterwards;\n- clean surfaces that may have been in contact with saliva or faeces with cleaning products containing bleach;\n- dispose properly of used tissues and nappies after changing your baby;\n- wash soiled clothing, towels, and bedding at a hot temperature;\n- don't share cups, utensils, or towels with people who are infected;\n- don't deliberately pierce blisters.\n- try to avoid contact with other people -- particularly pregnant women -- as much as you can while you have symptoms.\n- Mod.UBA\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nGreater Manchester, England, United Kingdom: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31512]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (11): USA 20181026.6108435\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (10): Viet Nam, USA (CT), Australia (QL) 20181020.6100738\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (09): Europe (Ireland ex Mallorca, Spain) 20181009.6081390\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (08): Viet Nam (HC) 20180929.6059772\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (07): Southeast Asia (Singapore) USA (VA) 20180819.5975210\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (06): USA 20180729.5934295\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (05): China (HK) EV71 20180529.5821814\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (04): China 20180518.5804254\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (03): China 20180430.5774368\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (02): Caribbean (Cayman Islands) 20180221.5641051\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (01): Japan, research 20180130.5594550\n2017\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (10): Caribbean, WHO (Western Pacific), USA (midwest) 20171103.5423054\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (09): comment 20170906.5299733\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (08): Thailand (BT) 20170904.5294390\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (07) - Mexico 20170704.5150139\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (06): Thailand 20170701.5144249\nHand, foot, & mouth disease update (05): Thailand (SK) 20170623.5125187\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (04): Australia (VI) 20170520.5050110\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (03): Pakistan (PB), comment 20170316.4905767\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (02): Thailand, Viet Nam 20170303.4875744\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (01): Southeast Asia, UK, USA, Domin.

HFMD is extremely contagious; it often spreads among groups of children, particularly in nurseries and schools. The viruses that cause the disease are usually spread in mucus or saliva droplets, when someone who has it coughs or sneezes. It can also be transmitted by direct contact with the fluid from the blisters of a person infected with the virus. An infected person can also spread the virus if they don't wash their hands properly after going to the toilet, as the virus can be passed in faeces.\n\nPatients are most contagious while they still have blisters and mouth ulcers, which is usually for up to 7 to 10 days. However patients can continue to pass the virus in their faeces for several weeks, and may still be mildly infectious during this time.\n\nHFMD is spread very easily. There are some things you can do to reduce your risk of catching or spreading it:\n- wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before you eat and after you go to the toilet;\n- cover mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Use a tissue and wash your hands afterwards;\n- clean surfaces that may have been in contact with saliva or faeces with cleaning products containing bleach;\n- dispose properly of used tissues and nappies after changing your baby;\n- wash soiled clothing, towels, and bedding at a hot temperature;\n- don't share cups, utensils, or towels with people who are infected;\n- don't deliberately pierce blisters.\n- try to avoid contact with other people -- particularly pregnant women -- as much as you can while you have symptoms.\n- Mod.UBA\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nGreater Manchester, England, United Kingdom: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31512]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (11): USA 20181026.6108435\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (10): Viet Nam, USA (CT), Australia (QL) 20181020.6100738\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (09): Europe (Ireland ex Mallorca, Spain) 20181009.6081390\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (08): Viet Nam (HC) 20180929.6059772\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (07): Southeast Asia (Singapore) USA (VA) 20180819.5975210\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (06): USA 20180729.5934295\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (05): China (HK) EV71 20180529.5821814\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (04): China 20180518.5804254\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (03): China 20180430.5774368\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (02): Caribbean (Cayman Islands) 20180221.5641051\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (01): Japan, research 20180130.5594550\n2017\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (10): Caribbean, WHO (Western Pacific), USA (midwest) 20171103.5423054\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (09): comment 20170906.5299733\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (08): Thailand (BT) 20170904.5294390\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (07) - Mexico 20170704.5150139\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (06): Thailand 20170701.5144249\nHand, foot, & mouth disease update (05): Thailand (SK) 20170623.5125187\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (04): Australia (VI) 20170520.5050110\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (03): Pakistan (PB), comment 20170316.4905767\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (02): Thailand, Viet Nam 20170303.4875744\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (01): Southeast Asia, UK, USA, Domin.

Most cases don't need medical attention, but mums and dads are being told if symptoms don't ease after a week to speak to a doctor.\n\nThere's been a recent spate of cases in Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale. The 1st signs are a high temperature, loss of appetite, a cough, and a sore throat. After a couple of days, spots can develop inside the mouth and on the tongue and they can become painful ulcers that make eating and drinking difficult. A rash can then develop on the hands and feet. They can become blisters, which are itchy and uncomfortable.\n\nHealth experts say the best way to treat the illness is to keep the child at home and keep them hydrated.\n\nIf ulcers in the mouth are painful, soft foods and paracetamol are recommended. Symptoms should last between a week and 10 days, and most cases won't need medical attention.\n\nIf symptoms last longer or children show signs of dehydration, have fits, a very high temperature, are unusually tired or unrousable, or if their skin is painful, red, swollen, or hot to the touch, then parents are being told to speak to the doctor.\n\nTo minimise the spread of the illness, health experts say you should wash your hands and disinfect contaminated surfaces.\n\nThere's more information at https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hand-foot-mouth-disease/\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is most common in children under 10, especially those under 4 years of age. HFMD is extremely contagious; it often spreads among groups of children, particularly in nurseries and schools. The viruses that cause the disease are usually spread in mucus or saliva droplets, when someone who has it coughs or sneezes. It can also be transmitted by direct contact with the fluid from the blisters of a person infected with the virus. An infected person can also spread the virus if they don't wash their hands properly after going to the toilet, as the virus can be passed in faeces.\n\nPatients are most contagious while they still have blisters and mouth ulcers, which is usually for up to 7 to 10 days. However patients can continue to pass the virus in their faeces for several weeks, and may still be mildly infectious during this time.\n\nHFMD is spread very easily. There are some things you can do to reduce your risk of catching or spreading it:\n- wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before you eat and after you go to the toilet;\n- cover mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Use a tissue and wash your hands afterwards;\n- clean surfaces that may have been in contact with saliva or faeces with cleaning products containing bleach;\n- dispose properly of used tissues and nappies after changing your baby;\n- wash soiled clothing, towels, and bedding at a hot temperature;\n- don't share cups, utensils, or towels with people who are infected;\n- don't deliberately pierce blisters.\n- try to avoid contact with other people -- particularly pregnant women -- as much as you can while you have symptoms.\n- Mod.UBA\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nGreater Manchester, England, United Kingdom: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31512]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (11): USA 20181026.6108435\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (10): Viet Nam, USA (CT), Australia (QL) 20181020.6100738\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (09): Europe (Ireland ex Mallorca, Spain) 20181009.6081390\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (08): Viet Nam (HC) 20180929.6059772\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (07): Southeast Asia (Singapore) USA (VA) 20180819.5975210\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (06): USA 20180729.5934295\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (05): China (HK) EV71 20180529.5821814\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (04): China 20180518.5804254\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (03): China 20180430.5774368\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (02): Caribbean (Cayman Islands) 20180221.5641051\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (01): Japan, research 20180130.5594550\n2017\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (10): Caribbean, WHO (Western Pacific), USA (midwest) 20171103.5423054\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (09): comment 20170906.5299733\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (08): Thailand (BT) 20170904.5294390\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (07) - Mexico 20170704.5150139\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (06): Thailand 20170701.5144249\nHand, foot, & mouth disease update (05): Thailand (SK) 20170623.5125187\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (04): Australia (VI) 20170520.5050110\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (03): Pakistan (PB), comment 20170316.4905767\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (02): Thailand, Viet Nam 20170303.4875744\nHand, foot & mouth disease update (01): Southeast Asia, UK, USA, Domin.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has also been associated with cases and outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease. Less often, EV71 has been associated with severe disease, such as encephalitis. Several types of enteroviruses may be identified in outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease; however, most of the time, one or 2 enteroviruses are identified.\n\nSince the initial description of EV71 in 1974 [1], outbreaks of infection with this virus have occurred periodically throughout the world [2-8]. EV71 infection manifests most frequently as the childhood exanthem known as \"hand, foot, and mouth disease\" (HFMD), and it is clinically indistinguishable from HFMD caused by Coxsackie virus A16 (CA16). A molecular study of the evolution of human enteroviruses has shown that EV71 and CA16 have a close genetic relationship, and, together with CA7 and CA14, they form a distinct genetic subgroup within cluster A of the _Enterovirus_ genus of the family Picornaviridae [9]. Despite the close genetic relationship between EV71 and CA16, EV71 has a propensity to cause neurological disease during acute infection [2, 3], a feature not observed in CA16 infections. Children under 4 years of age are particularly susceptible to the most severe forms of EV71-associated neurological disease, including meningitis, brain-stem and/or cerebellar encephalitis, and poliomyelitis-like paralysis. The neurological complications of EV71 infection may occasionally cause permanent paralysis or death. Several large epidemics of severe EV71 infection in young children, including numerous cases of fatal brain-stem encephalitis, have recently been reported in Southeast Asia [10-12; excerpted and edited from Peter McMinn et al.

A molecular study of the evolution of human enteroviruses has shown that EV71 and CA16 have a close genetic relationship, and, together with CA7 and CA14, they form a distinct genetic subgroup within cluster A of the _Enterovirus_ genus of the family Picornaviridae [9]. Despite the close genetic relationship between EV71 and CA16, EV71 has a propensity to cause neurological disease during acute infection [2, 3], a feature not observed in CA16 infections. Children under 4 years of age are particularly susceptible to the most severe forms of EV71-associated neurological disease, including meningitis, brain-stem and/or cerebellar encephalitis, and poliomyelitis-like paralysis. The neurological complications of EV71 infection may occasionally cause permanent paralysis or death. Several large epidemics of severe EV71 infection in young children, including numerous cases of fatal brain-stem encephalitis, have recently been reported in Southeast Asia [10-12; excerpted and edited from Peter McMinn et al.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has also been associated with cases and outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease. Less often, EV71 has been associated with severe disease, such as encephalitis. Several types of enteroviruses may be identified in outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease; however, most of the time, one or 2 enteroviruses are identified.\n\nSince the initial description of EV71 in 1974 [1], outbreaks of infection with this virus have occurred periodically throughout the world [2-8]. EV71 infection manifests most frequently as the childhood exanthem known as \"hand, foot, and mouth disease\" (HFMD), and it is clinically indistinguishable from HFMD caused by Coxsackie virus A16 (CA16). A molecular study of the evolution of human enteroviruses has shown that EV71 and CA16 have a close genetic relationship, and, together with CA7 and CA14, they form a distinct genetic subgroup within cluster A of the _Enterovirus_ genus of the family Picornaviridae [9]. Despite the close genetic relationship between EV71 and CA16, EV71 has a propensity to cause neurological disease during acute infection [2, 3], a feature not observed in CA16 infections. Children under 4 years of age are particularly susceptible to the most severe forms of EV71-associated neurological disease, including meningitis, brain-stem and/or cerebellar encephalitis, and poliomyelitis-like paralysis. The neurological complications of EV71 infection may occasionally cause permanent paralysis or death. Several large epidemics of severe EV71 infection in young children, including numerous cases of fatal brain-stem encephalitis, have recently been reported in Southeast Asia [10-12; excerpted and edited from Peter McMinn et al.

[CHCC] Chief Executive Officer Esther Muna says there have been 7 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) confirmed at the Commonwealth Health Center's emergency department in the past month, and 1 case at the hospital's Children's Clinic.\n\nBut there have been no cases identified since 20 Oct 2016, she said.\n\nHFMD is a viral infection that can be spread through close personal contact, coughing or sneezing, contact with feces or sharing of straws, cups, and other contaminated surfaces.\n\nIt is usually a mild, common childhood disease with limited consequences, according to CHCC.\n\n\"The viral illness usually affects infants and children younger than age 5.\n\n\"Of the 8 cases diagnosed at CHC in the last month, 5 or 63 percent were under the age of 5.\"\n\nSometimes adults can get the illness, but this is much less common.\n\nHFMD symptoms include a fever, reduced appetite and sore throat.\n\nOne or 2 days after the fever, painful sores can develop in the mouth (called herpangina). They are usually in the back of the mouth as small red spots that blister and become ulcers. A skin rash with red spots and at times blisters can occur on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\n\n\"Not everyone will develop all the symptoms. Some people may show no symptoms but still pass on the virus.\"\n\nAccording to CHCC, \"A person with HFMD is most contagious during the 1st week of illness.\"\n\nThere is no vaccine for HFMD, but members of the public can prevent/reduce their risk of being infected by:\n- Washing their hands often with soap and water.\n- Cleaning and disinfecting touched surfaces including toys.\n- Avoid close contact including kissing, hugging, or sharing utensils/cups with a person suffering from HFMD.\n\n\"For the painful mouth sores, you can use over-the-counter mouthwashes or sprays that numb mouth pain. Take over-the-counter Tylenol or Ibuprofen to relieve pain and fever. Aspirin should not be given to children.\"\n\nCommunity members are advised to stay home if they have HFMD. Talk to your primary care doctor if you are unsure when you should return to work.

[CHCC] Chief Executive Officer Esther Muna says there have been 7 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) confirmed at the Commonwealth Health Center's emergency department in the past month, and 1 case at the hospital's Children's Clinic.\n\nBut there have been no cases identified since 20 Oct 2016, she said.\n\nHFMD is a viral infection that can be spread through close personal contact, coughing or sneezing, contact with feces or sharing of straws, cups, and other contaminated surfaces.\n\nIt is usually a mild, common childhood disease with limited consequences, according to CHCC.\n\n\"The viral illness usually affects infants and children younger than age 5.\n\n\"Of the 8 cases diagnosed at CHC in the last month, 5 or 63 percent were under the age of 5.\"\n\nSometimes adults can get the illness, but this is much less common.\n\nHFMD symptoms include a fever, reduced appetite and sore throat.\n\nOne or 2 days after the fever, painful sores can develop in the mouth (called herpangina). They are usually in the back of the mouth as small red spots that blister and become ulcers. A skin rash with red spots and at times blisters can occur on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\n\n\"Not everyone will develop all the symptoms. Some people may show no symptoms but still pass on the virus.\"\n\nAccording to CHCC, \"A person with HFMD is most contagious during the 1st week of illness.\"\n\nThere is no vaccine for HFMD, but members of the public can prevent/reduce their risk of being infected by:\n- Washing their hands often with soap and water.\n- Cleaning and disinfecting touched surfaces including toys.\n- Avoid close contact including kissing, hugging, or sharing utensils/cups with a person suffering from HFMD.\n\n\"For the painful mouth sores, you can use over-the-counter mouthwashes or sprays that numb mouth pain. Take over-the-counter Tylenol or Ibuprofen to relieve pain and fever. Aspirin should not be given to children.\"\n\nCommunity members are advised to stay home if they have HFMD. Talk to your primary care doctor if you are unsure when you should return to work. It also applies to taking children back to school and/or daycare.\n\n[Byline: Bryan Manabat]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of Northern Mariana Islands (United States) can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/381. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] Grenada: daycare and preschools\nDate: Thu 27 Oct 2016\nSource: Jamaica Observer [edited]\nhttp://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Health-ministry-confirms-outbreak-of-hand--foot-and-mouth-disease-in-Grenada\n\n\nThe Ministry of Health on Thursday [27 Oct 2016] confirmed reports of an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) at some daycare and preschool centres across the island [Grenada, in the Caribbean].\n\nChief Medical Officer, Dr George Mitchell, says the ministry has received reports of 12 cases and going forward public education and direct intervention will be the main focus.\n\n\"Several education/information brochures relating to the disease are being distributed in electronic and print format to the various institutions,\" Mitchell said in a release.\n\nMedical practitioners have also been reminded that the disease is endemic in Grenada and they need to notify the ministry once a case is diagnosed.\n\nRecords at the Ministry of Health indicate that during the same period last year [2015] there were similar outbreaks of the disease among toddlers.\n\n\"Already, health surveillance and public health teams are gathering information and at the same time responding to reports of mild outbreaks among children at daycare and pre and primary schools.\n\nThe release said while a decision has not been made to close the institutions, health authorities are reminding parents and operators of daycares and kindergartens that frequent hand washing is still the best way of managing the disease.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of Grenada can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34. - Mod.LK]\n\n[HFMD is frequently reported, and is generally a mild disease, predominantly of children.

The 18 241 infections so far is the 2nd highest for the 1st 21 weeks of a year, exceeded only by the 21 102 in 2012. In contrast, the median number for the 1st 21 weeks over the past 5 years is 8193.\n\nAssociate Professor Chong Chia Yin, senior infectious disease consultant at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said more than 200 children have been hospitalised at KKH for HFMD this year [2016]. She said: \"Most of these children were admitted for fever and poor feeding, mild dehydration or febrile fits due to their high fever. None suffered serious complications.\"\n\nSerious complications are rare, but the infection could damage the brain, lungs or heart. Symptoms of HFMD include fever, ulcers in the mouth and tongue, blisters on hand, feet and bum, poor appetite and lethargy. A child can get dehydrated from not drinking enough because it hurts to do so.\n\nDuring an outbreak of HFMD in 2000-2001 associated with the more dangerous EV71 strain, there were 7 deaths.\n\nThe current epidemic has been fuelled in part by parents who send their sick kids to childcare centres, and refuse to take them home when asked to. Marjorie Zaccheus, principal of Presbyterian Community Services Tampines Childcare Centre, which has been hit by a spate of cases, said that when she suspects a child has HFMD, she keeps them away from other children and asks their parents to take them home. \"The parents say they are coming but they don't turn up until closing time. Others don't answer the phone,\" said Madam Zaccheus. She said holding full-time jobs is no excuse.\n\nThe children are checked for fever and ulcers or rash when they arrive. But Madam Zaccheus said sometimes, the person bringing the child is not a parent or guardian. \"In these cases, I have to accept them. I have no alternative.\" But the centre, which has 79 children, does not have the resources to effectively quarantine a sick child. It had 20 cases in the last month and a half.\n\n[A parent], 38, whose daughter, aged 3, was one of the 20 infected, said: \"It's irresponsible for parents to leave a sick child here.\" He added: \"Not only is the child already uncomfortable because of the sickness, they would feel lonely and isolated if they have to be separated from the other children.\" Despite the high rates of infection at the centre, many parents have chosen not to keep their children away.\n\nAdults too can get HFMD, and it is usually more severe. [The parent] recalls when his wife caught the infection from their infant son some years back. She was sick in bed for a week with a high fever and had a hard time eating because her mouth was full of ulcers.\n\n[byline: salma@sph.com.sg and rkurohi@sph.com.sg]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See discussion of HFMD in Singapore in ProMED-mail post Hand, foot & mouth disease - Singapore 20160505.4203981. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/150.]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam: (HC) 20160516.4225752\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Singapore 20160505.4203981\nHand foot & mouth disease - Australia: (NS) coxsackievirus, corr. 20160413.4158303\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China: (BJ, GX) vaccine 20160329.4124126\n2015\n---\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (06): (HK) update, children residential home 20151202.3834826\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (05): (HK) update, school outbreaks, EV71 20151126.3821764\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (04): (HK) school outbreaks 20151118.3799693\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03): update 20151117.3797744\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Oman 20151116.3794098\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02): treatment delay, RFI 20150916.3649429\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) school outbreak 20150927.3674603\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (02): (HK) police recruits 20150829.3609404\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (HK) 20150623.3459638\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20150121.3104144\n2014\n---\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (02): (HK) 20140701.2580144\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140630.2577434\nHerpangina & hand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140623.2556756\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20140610.2530751\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03) 20140608.2527551\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02) 20140518.2481104\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20140430.2440155\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Cambodia 20140424.2427419\n2013\n---\nHand, foot & mouth disease - India: (MH) etiologic agents 20131128.2080891\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia: (SK) 20131009.1992927\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) increased incidence 20131005.1984319\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20130823.1898229\nand other items in the archives\n.................................................sb/lk/je/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hand, foot and mouth disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2012-03-16 00:00:00", "8193-03-16 00:00:00", "2038-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Singapore", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4388808", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand (02): alert", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4388808", "date": "2016-06-10 17:16:40", "main_text": "HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE - SINGAPORE (02)\n*********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 9 Jun 2016\nSource: AsiaOne Health\nhttp://health.asiaone.com/health/health-news/hfmd-cases-reported-hits-more-18000\n\n\nHFMD [hand, foot and mouth disease] cases reported exceed 18 000\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSingapore could be heading for one of its worst hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) outbreaks, with infections hitting near-record numbers over the past few months.

None suffered serious complications.\"\n\nSerious complications are rare, but the infection could damage the brain, lungs or heart.

Marjorie Zaccheus, principal of Presbyterian Community Services Tampines Childcare Centre, which has been hit by a spate of cases, said that when she suspects a child has HFMD, she keeps them away from other children and asks their parents to take them home. \"The parents say they are coming but they don't turn up until closing time. Others don't answer the phone,\" said Madam Zaccheus. She said holding full-time jobs is no excuse.\n\nThe children are checked for fever and ulcers or rash when they arrive. But Madam Zaccheus said sometimes, the person bringing the child is not a parent or guardian. \"In these cases, I have to accept them. I have no alternative.\" But the centre, which has 79 children, does not have the resources to effectively quarantine a sick child.

The airborne virus is highly contagious and causes those affected to develop blisters on their hands, feet, and mouths. These lesions can be accompanied by a fever, sore throat, and severe discomfort. The blisters, which can last up to a week and be quite painful, can make doing everyday activities difficult.\n\n\"She couldn't walk for a couple days because she had so many blisters on her feet,\" says a local mom about her one-year-old daughter. \"So she was in the stroller or in our arms, which was really hard. It's just really hard to see our kid in pain and not really be able to do anything to help them.\"\n\nAlthough people of any age can catch it, the virus is especially common among very young populations. \"Eventually, 100 percent of the children will be exposed to the coxsackievirus virus,\" says Dr. Rene Bravo of Bravo Pediatrics. However, this does not mean all children will develop symptoms. About 20 percent of those exposed to the virus will catch it.\n\nDr. Bravo recommends that children who catch the virus be taken out of school or daycare to prevent the spread of the disease. \"Wait until the blisters heal and no new one shows up, and then you are welcome to come back to daycare,\" says owner of Little Blossoms Daycare and Preschool.\n\nAlthough there is no immediate cure, at-home treatments can be used to make the affected person more comfortable. According to Dr. Bravo, over-the-counter medicines like Tylenol and Advil can help with pain, while calamine lotion can help calm the skin. If you suspect that your child has hand, foot and mouth disease, take a picture on your phone and email it to your pediatrician to save yourself a trip into the doctor's office.\n\n[Byline: Amanda Starrantino]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common human syndrome caused by highly contagious intestinal viruses. HFMD is often confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also called hoof-and-mouth disease), which affects cattle, sheep, and swine. However, the 2 diseases are caused by different viruses and are not related. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by an enterovirus, most commonly coxsackievirus A16. However, other enteroviruses like coxsackievirus A10 or A6 have also been detected in outbreaks. Internationally, enterovirus 71 is another common etiologic agent.\n\nHFMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by nasopharyngeal secretions such as saliva or nasal mucus, by direct contact, or by fecal-oral transmission. Preventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures have been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD.\n\nA diagnosis usually can be made by the presenting signs and symptoms alone. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture.\n\nMedications are usually not needed as hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral disease that typically gets better on its own. Currently, there is no specific curative treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease.\n\nReference: Sarma, N (March-April 2013): \"Hand, foot and mouth disease: current scenario and Indian perspective.\" Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology, and Leprology 79 (2): 165-175. doi:10.4103/0378-6323.107631. PMID 23442455.\n\nDisease management typically focuses on achieving symptomatic relief. Pain from the sores may be eased with the use of analgesic medications.

HFMD is often confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also called hoof-and-mouth disease), which affects cattle, sheep, and swine. However, the 2 diseases are caused by different viruses and are not related. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by an enterovirus, most commonly coxsackievirus A16. However, other enteroviruses like coxsackievirus A10 or A6 have also been detected in outbreaks. Internationally, enterovirus 71 is another common etiologic agent.\n\nHFMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by nasopharyngeal secretions such as saliva or nasal mucus, by direct contact, or by fecal-oral transmission. Preventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures have been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD.\n\nA diagnosis usually can be made by the presenting signs and symptoms alone. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture.\n\nMedications are usually not needed as hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral disease that typically gets better on its own.

The airborne virus is highly contagious and causes those affected to develop blisters on their hands, feet, and mouths.

The blisters, which can last up to a week and be quite painful, can make doing everyday activities difficult.\n\n\"She couldn't walk for a couple days because she had so many blisters on her feet,\" says a local mom about her one-year-old daughter. \"So she was in the stroller or in our arms, which was really hard.

About 20 percent of those exposed to the virus will catch it.\n\nDr. Bravo recommends that children who catch the virus be taken out of school or daycare to prevent the spread of the disease. \"Wait until the blisters heal and no new one shows up, and then you are welcome to come back to daycare,\" says owner of Little Blossoms Daycare and Preschool.\n\nAlthough there is no immediate cure, at-home treatments can be used to make the affected person more comfortable. According to Dr. Bravo, over-the-counter medicines like Tylenol and Advil can help with pain, while calamine lotion can help calm the skin.

HFMD is often confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also called hoof-and-mouth disease), which affects cattle, sheep, and swine. However, the 2 diseases are caused by different viruses and are not related. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by an enterovirus, most commonly coxsackievirus A16. However, other enteroviruses like coxsackievirus A10 or A6 have also been detected in outbreaks. Internationally, enterovirus 71 is another common etiologic agent.\n\nHFMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by nasopharyngeal secretions such as saliva or nasal mucus, by direct contact, or by fecal-oral transmission. Preventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures have been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD.\n\nA diagnosis usually can be made by the presenting signs and symptoms alone. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture.\n\nMedications are usually not needed as hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral disease that typically gets better on its own.

The airborne virus is highly contagious and causes those affected to develop blisters on their hands, feet, and mouths. These lesions can be accompanied by a fever, sore throat, and severe discomfort. The blisters, which can last up to a week and be quite painful, can make doing everyday activities difficult.\n\n\"She couldn't walk for a couple days because she had so many blisters on her feet,\" says a local mom about her one-year-old daughter. \"So she was in the stroller or in our arms, which was really hard. It's just really hard to see our kid in pain and not really be able to do anything to help them.\"\n\nAlthough people of any age can catch it, the virus is especially common among very young populations. \"Eventually, 100 percent of the children will be exposed to the coxsackievirus virus,\" says Dr. Rene Bravo of Bravo Pediatrics. However, this does not mean all children will develop symptoms. About 20 percent of those exposed to the virus will catch it.\n\nDr. Bravo recommends that children who catch the virus be taken out of school or daycare to prevent the spread of the disease. \"Wait until the blisters heal and no new one shows up, and then you are welcome to come back to daycare,\" says owner of Little Blossoms Daycare and Preschool.\n\nAlthough there is no immediate cure, at-home treatments can be used to make the affected person more comfortable. According to Dr. Bravo, over-the-counter medicines like Tylenol and Advil can help with pain, while calamine lotion can help calm the skin. If you suspect that your child has hand, foot and mouth disease, take a picture on your phone and email it to your pediatrician to save yourself a trip into the doctor's office.\n\n[Byline: Amanda Starrantino]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common human syndrome caused by highly contagious intestinal viruses. HFMD is often confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also called hoof-and-mouth disease), which affects cattle, sheep, and swine. However, the 2 diseases are caused by different viruses and are not related. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by an enterovirus, most commonly coxsackievirus A16. However, other enteroviruses like coxsackievirus A10 or A6 have also been detected in outbreaks. Internationally, enterovirus 71 is another common etiologic agent.\n\nHFMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by nasopharyngeal secretions such as saliva or nasal mucus, by direct contact, or by fecal-oral transmission. Preventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures have been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD.\n\nA diagnosis usually can be made by the presenting signs and symptoms alone. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture.\n\nMedications are usually not needed as hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral disease that typically gets better on its own. Currently, there is no specific curative treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease.\n\nReference: Sarma, N (March-April 2013): \"Hand, foot and mouth disease: current scenario and Indian perspective.\" Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology, and Leprology 79 (2): 165-175. doi:10.4103/0378-6323.107631. PMID 23442455.\n\nDisease management typically focuses on achieving symptomatic relief. Pain from the sores may be eased with the use of analgesic medications. Infection in older children, adolescents, and adults is typically mild and lasts approximately one week but may occasionally run a longer course. Fever reducers and lukewarm baths can help decrease body temperature.\n\nA minority of individuals with hand, foot and mouth disease may require hospital admission due to uncommon neurologic complications such as inflammation of the brain, inflammation of the meninges, or acute flaccid paralysis. Non-neurologic complications such as inflammation of the heart, fluid in the lungs, or bleeding into the lungs may also occur.\n\nCurrently, there is no vaccine available against coxsackievirus-associated HFMD. - Mod.UBA\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/284.]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China: (BJ, GX) vaccine 20160329.4124126\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Canada (02): ex Dominican Republic, sups., RFI 20160307.4074052\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Canada: ex Mexico (QR) resort 20160229.4057670\n2015\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (06): (HK) update, children residential home 20151202.3834826\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (05): (HK) update, school outbreaks, EV71 20151126.3821764\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (04): (HK) school outbreaks 20151118.3799693\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03): update 20151117.3797744\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Oman 20151116.3794098\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02): treatment delay, RFI 20150916.3649429\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) school outbreak 20150927.3674603\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (02): (HK) police recruits 20150829.3609404\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (HK) 20150623.3459638\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20150121.3104144\n2014\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (02): (HK) 20140701.2580144\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140630.2577434\nHerpangina & hand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140623.2556756\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20140610.2530751\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03) 20140608.2527551\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02) 20140518.2481104\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20140430.2440155\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Cambodia 20140424.2427419\n2013\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease - India: (MH) etiologic agents 20131128.2080891\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia: (SK) 20131009.1992927\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) increased incidence 20131005.1984319\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20130823.1898229\n.................................................sb/uba/msp/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hand, foot and mouth disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Tylenol", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Dominican Republic", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4140713", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hand, foot & mouth disease - Bhutan", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4140713", "date": "2015-11-18 14:47:16", "main_text": "HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE - CHINA (04): (HONG KONG) SCHOOL OUTBREAKS\n************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 16 Nov 2015\nSource: 7th Space Interactive, HKSAR Government report [edited]\nhttp://7thspace.com/headlines/520440/chp_investigates_three_outbreaks_of_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease.html\n\n\nThe [Hong Kong] Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [16 Nov 2015] investigating 3 outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) at 2 secondary schools in Wan Chai District and Central and Western District, and a kindergarten on Lamma Island, and hence appealed to the public to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene.\n\nThe 1st case involved a secondary school in Wan Chai District affecting 19 male students and a staff member. The affected students, aged from 11 to 17, have developed fever, rash, and vesicles on their hands or feet, as well as oral ulcers, since [23 Oct 2015]. All of them sought medical attention while 1 student required hospitalisation and has been discharged. The nasopharyngeal swab of the hospitalised student tested positive for enterovirus (EV) by the hospital.\n\nThe 2nd case involved a secondary school in Central and Western District affecting 25 male students. The affected students, aged from 14 to 17, have developed similar symptoms since [31 Oct 2015]. All of them sought medical attention but did not require hospitalisation.\n\nThe 3rd case involved a kindergarten on Lamma Island affecting 23 pupils. The affected pupils, 10 boys and 13 girls aged from 3 to 5, have developed similar symptoms since [4 Nov 2015]. All of them sought medical attention but did not require hospitalisation.\n\nAll of the affected persons are now in a stable condition.\n\nOfficers of the CHP have conducted site visits and advised the staff of the schools on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The schools have been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.\n\n\"HFMD is common in children and is usually caused by EVs such as coxsackievirus and EV-71. It is clinically characterised by maculopapular rash or vesicular lesions occurring on the palms, soles and other parts of the body such as the buttocks and thighs. Vesicular lesions and ulcers may also be found in the oral cavity. Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet,\" a spokesman for the CHP said.\n\nTo prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures: maintain good air circulation; wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials; keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing; cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly; clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding one part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water; children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted; avoid going to overcrowded places; and parents should maintain close communication with schools to let them know the latest situation of the sick children.\n\nThe public may visit the CHP's page on HFMD and EV-71 infection (http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/16354.html) for more information.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of hand-foot-mouth disease, please see moderator comments in the prior ProMED-mail post Hand, foot & mouth disease - Oman 20151116.3794098. - Mod.ML\n\nMaps of Hong Kong can be seen at http://www.travelchinaguide.com/images/map/hongkong/hongkong-map.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03): update 20151117.3797744\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Oman 20151116.3794098\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02): treatment delay, RFI 20150916.3649429\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) school outbreak 20150927.3674603\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (02): (HK) police recruits 20150829.3609404\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (HK) 20150623.3459638\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20150121.3104144\n2014\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (02): (HK) 20140701.2580144\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140630.2577434\nHerpangina & hand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140623.2556756\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20140610.2530751\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03) 20140608.2527551\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02) 20140518.2481104\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20140430.2440155\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Cambodia 20140424.2427419\n2013\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease - India: (MH) etiologic agents 20131128.2080891\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia: (SK) 20131009.1992927\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) increased incidence 20131005.1984319\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20130823.1898229\n2012\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand (02): EV71 fatality 20120727.1217890\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand: (BM) 20120714.1201907\n.................................................sb/ml/mj/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hand, foot and mouth disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Thailand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hong Kong ] Centre for Health Protection", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "HONG KONG", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Lamma Island", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4124126", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hand, foot & mouth disease - China: (BJ, GX) vaccine", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4124126", "date": "2015-11-18 14:47:16", "main_text": "HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE - CHINA (04): (HONG KONG) SCHOOL OUTBREAKS\n************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 16 Nov 2015\nSource: 7th Space Interactive, HKSAR Government report [edited]\nhttp://7thspace.com/headlines/520440/chp_investigates_three_outbreaks_of_hand_foot_and_mouth_disease.html\n\n\nThe [Hong Kong] Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [16 Nov 2015] investigating 3 outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) at 2 secondary schools in Wan Chai District and Central and Western District, and a kindergarten on Lamma Island, and hence appealed to the public to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene.\n\nThe 1st case involved a secondary school in Wan Chai District affecting 19 male students and a staff member.

The affected students, aged from 11 to 17, have developed fever, rash, and vesicles on their hands or feet, as well as oral ulcers, since [23 Oct 2015].

All of them sought medical attention but did not require hospitalisation.\n\nThe 3rd case involved a kindergarten on Lamma Island affecting 23 pupils. The affected pupils, 10 boys and 13 girls aged from 3 to 5, have developed similar symptoms since [4 Nov 2015]. All of them sought medical attention but did not require hospitalisation.\n\nAll of the affected persons are now in a stable condition.\n\nOfficers of the CHP have conducted site visits and advised the staff of the schools on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The schools have been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.\n\n\"HFMD is common in children and is usually caused by EVs such as coxsackievirus and EV-71. It is clinically characterised by maculopapular rash or vesicular lesions occurring on the palms, soles and other parts of the body such as the buttocks and thighs. Vesicular lesions and ulcers may also be found in the oral cavity. Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet,\" a spokesman for the CHP said.\n\nTo prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures: maintain good air circulation;

The affected students, aged from 11 to 17, have developed fever, rash, and vesicles on their hands or feet, as well as oral ulcers, since [23 Oct 2015]. All of them sought medical attention while 1 student required hospitalisation and has been discharged. The nasopharyngeal swab of the hospitalised student tested positive for enterovirus (EV) by the hospital.\n\nThe 2nd case involved a secondary school in Central and Western District affecting 25 male students. The affected students, aged from 14 to 17, have developed similar symptoms since [31 Oct 2015]. All of them sought medical attention but did not require hospitalisation.\n\nThe 3rd case involved a kindergarten on Lamma Island affecting 23 pupils. The affected pupils, 10 boys and 13 girls aged from 3 to 5, have developed similar symptoms since [4 Nov 2015]. All of them sought medical attention but did not require hospitalisation.\n\nAll of the affected persons are now in a stable condition.\n\nOfficers of the CHP have conducted site visits and advised the staff of the schools on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The schools have been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.\n\n\"HFMD is common in children and is usually caused by EVs such as coxsackievirus and EV-71. It is clinically characterised by maculopapular rash or vesicular lesions occurring on the palms, soles and other parts of the body such as the buttocks and thighs. Vesicular lesions and ulcers may also be found in the oral cavity. Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet,\" a spokesman for the CHP said.\n\nTo prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures: maintain good air circulation; wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials; keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing; cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly; clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding one part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water;

Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet,\" a spokesman for the CHP said.\n\nTo prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures: maintain good air circulation; wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials; keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing; cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly; clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding one part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water; children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted; avoid going to overcrowded places; and parents should maintain close communication with schools to let them know the latest situation of the sick children.\n\nThe public may visit the CHP's page on HFMD and EV-71 infection (http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/16354.html) for more information.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of hand-foot-mouth disease, please see moderator comments in the prior ProMED-mail post Hand, foot & mouth disease - Oman 20151116.3794098. - Mod.ML\n\nMaps of Hong Kong can be seen at http://www.travelchinaguide.com/images/map/hongkong/hongkong-map.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03): update 20151117.3797744\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Oman 20151116.3794098\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02): treatment delay, RFI 20150916.3649429\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) school outbreak 20150927.3674603\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (02): (HK) police recruits 20150829.3609404\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (HK) 20150623.3459638\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20150121.3104144\n2014\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (02): (HK) 20140701.2580144\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140630.2577434\nHerpangina & hand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140623.2556756\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20140610.2530751\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03) 20140608.2527551\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02) 20140518.2481104\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20140430.2440155\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Cambodia 20140424.2427419\n2013\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease - India: (MH) etiologic agents 20131128.2080891\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia: (SK) 20131009.1992927\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) increased incidence 20131005.1984319\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20130823.1898229\n2012\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand (02): EV71 fatality 20120727.1217890\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand: (BM) 20120714.1201907\n.................................................sb/ml/mj/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hand, foot and mouth disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Thailand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hong Kong ] Centre for Health Protection", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "HONG KONG", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Lamma Island", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3797744", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03): update", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3797744", "date": "2015-09-12 18:18:14", "main_text": "HAND, FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - INDIA: (KARNATAKA) SPREADING\n*********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 11 Sep 2015\nSource: The Times of India [summ., edited]\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Infection-spreads-among-kids-docs-say-dont-worry/articleshow/48909183.cms\n\n\nRamyashree (name changed), age 4, of Vijayanagar [Karnataka state] has been in bed for 2 days with blisters on her feet, arms and mouth and mild fever.

They have developed fever, oral ulcers and rash on their hands or feet since 14 June 2014. All of those affected sought medical attention, while 3 children were admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital for management, and 2 of them have been discharged. They are all currently in stable condition.\n\nThe rectal swab of an affected child tested positive for enterovirus (EV) upon laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch. Officers of the CHP have conducted a site visit and advised the staff of the residential child care centre on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The centre has been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.\n\n\"HFMD is common in children and is usually caused by EVs such as Coxsackie virus and EV71. It is clinically characterised by maculopapular rash or vesicular lesions occurring on the palms, soles and other parts of the body such as the buttocks and thighs. Vesicular lesions and ulcers may also be found in the oral cavity. Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet,\" a spokesman for the CHP explained.\n\nTo prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures:\n* Maintain good air circulation;\n* Wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials;\n* Keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;\n* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly;\n* Clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding 1 part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water;\n* Children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted;\n* Avoid going to overcrowded places; and\n* Parents should maintain close communication with schools to let them know the latest situation of the sick children.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The WHO Surveillance Summary includes information from countries where transmission of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) occurs and case counts are routinely reported.\n\nNorthern Hemisphere/ China: As of 31 May, there were reported 630 391 cases of HFMD, including 26 deaths in China for 2015. From 1 to 31 May 2015, 304 863 cases of HFMD had been reported, a 42 percent decrease compared with the same period in 2014 (528 777). The number of HFMD cases reported monthly in 2015 is following the seasonal pattern displayed in 2012, 2013 and 2014 (Figure 1). It is likely that the figures for Hong Kong (SARI) follow the same seasonal pattern as elsewhere in China http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd_biweekly_20150616.pdf?ua=1.\n\nHFMD usually begins with a low-grade fever and general fatigue. A rash of tiny, painful red spots will appear within a couple of days and will soon begin to blister and sometimes form ulcers. These spots may appear:\n- inside the mouth (on the tongue, gums, or cheeks)\n- on the palms of the hands or on the fingers\n- on the soles of the feet or on the toes\n- on the buttocks\n\nThe rash is not generally itchy and, in some cases, may develop on other parts of the body. Lymph nodes in the neck may also become swollen. The virus can cause the throat to feel sore and painful. Rarely, dehydration may occur as the pain due to the blisters in the mouth can make drinking difficult. Infection by EV71 has been known to cause encephalitis or viral meningitis in rare cases.\n\nChildren and adolescents are the most commonly affected people. Adults are rarely infected, although pregnant women who have not been exposed to the virus before have a higher chance of becoming infected. Daycare centres, parks, nursery schools, and other places where children play with each other are potential sites for the infection to be transmitted among children. HFMD is most common in the summer and early fall.\n\nA pregnant woman who is infected may show mild or no signs of illness. If she is infected just before her delivery, the infection can be transmitted to the newborn, resulting in only a mild illness in the baby. Rarely, multiple-organ infections occur.\n\nDuring the acute phase, a person can infect others through secretions from the nose and throat. Discharge due to coughing and sneezing can cause the virus to be transmitted easily. Young children, who tend to drool, can also transmit the infection through their saliva.\n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease affects mainly children 5 years old and under, is caused by different types of enterovirus and in most forms is normally not severe. However, 1 type of hand, foot, and mouth disease, caused by the virus EV71, can have dramatic effects, including nerve damage, paralysis or death. EV71 also appears to be very pathogenic, and in recent years has caused large and worrying outbreaks in children in Asian countries, especially in China.

They have developed fever, oral ulcers and rash on their hands or feet since 14 June 2014. All of those affected sought medical attention, while 3 children were admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital for management, and 2 of them have been discharged. They are all currently in stable condition.\n\nThe rectal swab of an affected child tested positive for enterovirus (EV) upon laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch. Officers of the CHP have conducted a site visit and advised the staff of the residential child care centre on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The centre has been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.\n\n\"HFMD is common in children and is usually caused by EVs such as Coxsackie virus and EV71. It is clinically characterised by maculopapular rash or vesicular lesions occurring on the palms, soles and other parts of the body such as the buttocks and thighs. Vesicular lesions and ulcers may also be found in the oral cavity. Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet,\" a spokesman for the CHP explained.\n\nTo prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures:\n* Maintain good air circulation;\n* Wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials;\n* Keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;\n* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly;\n* Clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding 1 part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water;\n* Children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted;\n* Avoid going to overcrowded places; and\n* Parents should maintain close communication with schools to let them know the latest situation of the sick children.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The WHO Surveillance Summary includes information from countries where transmission of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) occurs and case counts are routinely reported.\n\nNorthern Hemisphere/ China: As of 31 May, there were reported 630 391 cases of HFMD, including 26 deaths in China for 2015. From 1 to 31 May 2015, 304 863 cases of HFMD had been reported, a 42 percent decrease compared with the same period in 2014 (528 777). The number of HFMD cases reported monthly in 2015 is following the seasonal pattern displayed in 2012, 2013 and 2014 (Figure 1). It is likely that the figures for Hong Kong (SARI) follow the same seasonal pattern as elsewhere in China http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd_biweekly_20150616.pdf?ua=1.\n\nHFMD usually begins with a low-grade fever and general fatigue. A rash of tiny, painful red spots will appear within a couple of days and will soon begin to blister and sometimes form ulcers. These spots may appear:\n- inside the mouth (on the tongue, gums, or cheeks)\n- on the palms of the hands or on the fingers\n- on the soles of the feet or on the toes\n- on the buttocks\n\nThe rash is not generally itchy and, in some cases, may develop on other parts of the body. Lymph nodes in the neck may also become swollen. The virus can cause the throat to feel sore and painful. Rarely, dehydration may occur as the pain due to the blisters in the mouth can make drinking difficult. Infection by EV71 has been known to cause encephalitis or viral meningitis in rare cases.\n\nChildren and adolescents are the most commonly affected people. Adults are rarely infected, although pregnant women who have not been exposed to the virus before have a higher chance of becoming infected. Daycare centres, parks, nursery schools, and other places where children play with each other are potential sites for the infection to be transmitted among children. HFMD is most common in the summer and early fall.\n\nA pregnant woman who is infected may show mild or no signs of illness. If she is infected just before her delivery, the infection can be transmitted to the newborn, resulting in only a mild illness in the baby. Rarely, multiple-organ infections occur.\n\nDuring the acute phase, a person can infect others through secretions from the nose and throat. Discharge due to coughing and sneezing can cause the virus to be transmitted easily. Young children, who tend to drool, can also transmit the infection through their saliva.\n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease affects mainly children 5 years old and under, is caused by different types of enterovirus and in most forms is normally not severe. However, 1 type of hand, foot, and mouth disease, caused by the virus EV71, can have dramatic effects, including nerve damage, paralysis or death.

They have developed fever, oral ulcers and rash on their hands or feet since 14 June 2014. All of those affected sought medical attention, while 3 children were admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital for management, and 2 of them have been discharged. They are all currently in stable condition.\n\nThe rectal swab of an affected child tested positive for enterovirus (EV) upon laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch. Officers of the CHP have conducted a site visit and advised the staff of the residential child care centre on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The centre has been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.\n\n\"HFMD is common in children and is usually caused by EVs such as Coxsackie virus and EV71. It is clinically characterised by maculopapular rash or vesicular lesions occurring on the palms, soles and other parts of the body such as the buttocks and thighs. Vesicular lesions and ulcers may also be found in the oral cavity. Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet,\" a spokesman for the CHP explained.\n\nTo prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures:\n* Maintain good air circulation;\n* Wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials;\n* Keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;\n* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly;\n* Clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding 1 part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water;\n* Children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted;\n* Avoid going to overcrowded places; and\n* Parents should maintain close communication with schools to let them know the latest situation of the sick children.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The WHO Surveillance Summary includes information from countries where transmission of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) occurs and case counts are routinely reported.\n\nNorthern Hemisphere/ China: As of 31 May, there were reported 630 391 cases of HFMD, including 26 deaths in China for 2015. From 1 to 31 May 2015, 304 863 cases of HFMD had been reported, a 42 percent decrease compared with the same period in 2014 (528 777). The number of HFMD cases reported monthly in 2015 is following the seasonal pattern displayed in 2012, 2013 and 2014 (Figure 1). It is likely that the figures for Hong Kong (SARI) follow the same seasonal pattern as elsewhere in China http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd_biweekly_20150616.pdf?ua=1.\n\nHFMD usually begins with a low-grade fever and general fatigue. A rash of tiny, painful red spots will appear within a couple of days and will soon begin to blister and sometimes form ulcers. These spots may appear:\n- inside the mouth (on the tongue, gums, or cheeks)\n- on the palms of the hands or on the fingers\n- on the soles of the feet or on the toes\n- on the buttocks\n\nThe rash is not generally itchy and, in some cases, may develop on other parts of the body. Lymph nodes in the neck may also become swollen. The virus can cause the throat to feel sore and painful. Rarely, dehydration may occur as the pain due to the blisters in the mouth can make drinking difficult. Infection by EV71 has been known to cause encephalitis or viral meningitis in rare cases.\n\nChildren and adolescents are the most commonly affected people. Adults are rarely infected, although pregnant women who have not been exposed to the virus before have a higher chance of becoming infected. Daycare centres, parks, nursery schools, and other places where children play with each other are potential sites for the infection to be transmitted among children. HFMD is most common in the summer and early fall.\n\nA pregnant woman who is infected may show mild or no signs of illness. If she is infected just before her delivery, the infection can be transmitted to the newborn, resulting in only a mild illness in the baby. Rarely, multiple-organ infections occur.\n\nDuring the acute phase, a person can infect others through secretions from the nose and throat. Discharge due to coughing and sneezing can cause the virus to be transmitted easily. Young children, who tend to drool, can also transmit the infection through their saliva.\n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease affects mainly children 5 years old and under, is caused by different types of enterovirus and in most forms is normally not severe. However, 1 type of hand, foot, and mouth disease, caused by the virus EV71, can have dramatic effects, including nerve damage, paralysis or death.

Adverse events, such as fever (which occurred in 41.6 percent of the participants who received vaccine vs. 35.2 percent of those who received placebo) were significantly more common in the week after vaccination among children who received the vaccine than among those who received placebo.\" - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198.]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140630.2577434\nHerpangina & hand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140623.2556756\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20140610.2530751\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03) 20140608.2527551\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02) 20140518.2481104\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20140430.2440155\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Cambodia 20140424.2427419\n2013\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease - India: (MH) etiologic agents 20131128.2080891\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia: (SK) 20131009.1992927\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) increased incidence 20131005.1984319\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20130823.1898229\n2012\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand (02): EV71 fatality 20120727.1217890\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand: (BM) 20120714.1201907\n.................................................ll/msp/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hand, foot and mouth disease", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-06-02 00:00:00", "2014-06-03 00:00:00", "2014-05-20 00:00:00", "2014-05-24 00:00:00", "2014-05-26 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Thailand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "HONG KONG", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hong Kong SAR Government", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2577434", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2577434", "date": "2013-11-28 20:39:20", "main_text": "HAND, FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - INDIA: (MAHARASHTRA) ETIOLOGIC AGENTS\n******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 23 Nov 2013\nSource: The Times of India, Pune [edited]\nhttp://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-11-23/pune/44389035_1_niv-samples-mouth-ulcers\n\n\nScientists from the [Pune]city-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) have confirmed the presence of enterovirus which, they said, has been causing hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children in Pune [Maharashtra state; the city was formerly known as Poona]. The contagious viral illness has been spreading among children below 5 years of age in the last 2 months. Of the 79 samples drawn by the scientists, 40 per cent tested positive for enterovirus.\n\n\"The circulating virus in the city, causing HFMD in infants and children, is enterovirus. The infection caused by the virus is usually mild. Hence, there is no need to panic,\" said senior scientist D T Mourya, director of NIV. The viral infection, benign but irritating, is characterised by painful rashes along with throat [pain] and fever. Coxsackieviruses and enteroviruses are the major causative agents of HFMD in India. This is the 1st time that the Virology Institute investigated HFMD cases in Pune after doctors reported a spurt [of cases] since October [2013]. Earlier, it had carried out HFMD investigations in Kerala, West Bengal, Odisha, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu in 2009-2010. Scientist V Gopalkrishna, Deputy Director of NIV, who spearheaded the HFMD study along with paediatricians, said, \"79 clinical samples comprising throat swabs, rectal swabs, vesicular swabs and blood samples were collected from children below 7 years of age with suspected HFMD in Pune who went to paediatricians' clinics and hospitals for treatment in the last 2 months. Nearly 40 per cent of the samples tested positive for the etiological agent enterovirus. Now, cases are on the decline.\" Paediatricians from Shaishav clinic, Chiranjeev clinic, Bharati Hospital and Ajinkya Hospital from the city were involved in this study with NIV scientists.\n\n\"If a child is not eating and shows loss of appetite and has mouth ulcers, then it is time to consult a doctor,\" said paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar. Paediatrician Jayant Navarange, who is part of the NIV study and has been treating kids with HFMD in the last 2 months, said, \"HFMD is contagious. Hence, infected children should stay away from schools till they completely recover,\" he added.\n\n[Byline: Umesh Isalkar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HFMD is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in adults. Symptoms of HFMD include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (herpangina) and a skin rash. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Enterovirus 71 has been associated with more severe outbreaks of HFMD (see: http://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/index.html).\n\nHFMD is prevalent globally and infects children in all communities. Since normally the infection is mild and of short duration, there has been little incentive to identify the specific etiologic agent. Normally ProMED-mail does not record these outbreaks unless the specific etiologic agent has been identified, or there is some unusual feature. The outbreak in Pune is exceptional in that the etiologic agents have been identified. Curiously the etiologic agent was only identified in less than 40 per cent of cases.\n\nThe Western Pacific Region of WHO routinely publishes data on the incidence of HFMD throughout East Asia (but not India) [see: http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/]. The most recent update (13 Nov 2013) reported that HFMD is declining. Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Japan and Republic of Korea (South Korea) have reported a higher cumulative number of cases in 2013 than in 2012 for the same time period. The recent trend, following seasonal patterns, is showing a decrease in China, Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Viet Nam.\n\nChina: Monthly average of cases has decreased from September (183 187 cases and 14 deaths) to October (134 032 cases and 8 deaths) 2013. There were 1 651 959 cases with 265 deaths reported up to the end of October in 2013.\n\nHong Kong (China): Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. Based on the 3 week moving average, weekly trends in hospitalized cases, general practitioners, and general outpatient clinics decreased. In the week 27 Oct to 2 Nov 2013, 4 HFMD inpatients (relative to 5 cases in the same period in 2012) were reported by the Hospital Authority; 0.1 cases per 1000 consultations among general out-patient clinics and 0.9 cases per 1000 consultations among general practitioners.\n\nMacao (China): Weekly trend has decreased based on the 3 week moving average. 19 cases were reported from 29 Oct to 4 Nov 2013 compared with 30 cases in the same period for 2012. The cumulative report for 2013 to the week ending 4 Nov was 2078 cases.\n\nJapan: Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. The weekly trend decreased based on the 3 week moving average. 4071 cases (1.29 cases per sentinel unit) were reported from 14 to 20 Oct 2013 compared with 1998 cases in the same period for 2012. Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 20 Oct was 281 149 cases.\n\nRepublic of Korea (South Korea): Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. The weekly trend is decreasing based on the 3 week moving average; 3.0 cases per 1000 outpatients for the week ending 5 Oct 2013. Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 5 Oct was 6.3 cases per 1000 outpatients.\n\nSingapore: The weekly trend increased based on the 3 week moving average; 914 cases were reported between 27 Oct to 2 Nov 2013 (relative to 265 for the same period in 2012). Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 2 Nov 2013 was 26 473 cases.\n\nViet Nam: The weekly number of reported cases during 7 to 13 Oct 2013 was 1610 relative to 1656 during the previous week. 63 109 cases with 19 deaths have been reported from across 63 provinces up to 13 Oct 2013.\n\nIt is unfortunate that there is so little determination of the etiologic agent(s) involved.\n\nFor further information on the HFMD situation or its surveillance, please visit the following links:\nChina (in Chinese): http://www.moh.gov.cn/wsb/pyqxx/list.shtml\nHong Kong (China): http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/data/1/26/44/292/1303.html\nJapan: http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/survaillance-data-table-english.html\nRepublic of Korea: http://www.cdc.go.kr/CDC/info/CdcKrInfo0301.jsp?menuIds=HOME001-MNU0004-MNU0036-MNU0037&q_type=B&q_value=2013\nSingapore: http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/diseases_and_conditions/h/hfmd.html\nThailand: http://www.boe.moph.go.th/index.php\n- Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1*Oa.]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia: (SK) 20131009.1992927\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) increased incidence 20131005.1984319\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Maldives 20130228.1564772\n2011\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Viet Nam (04): HCM 20110613.1804\n2006\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak)(04) 20060319.0854\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak)(03) 20060313.0792\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Brunei 20060308.0744\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak) 20060303.0671\n2005\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Taiwan (central) (02) 20050531.1503\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Taiwan (Central) 20050523.1417\n2000\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - South Korea: comment 20000615.0969\n.................................................sb/cp/jejw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hand, foot and mouth disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-10-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-09-16 00:00:00", "2021-10-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2078-03-16 00:00:00", "1998-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "1656-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Bengal", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taiwan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pune", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kerala", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Republic of Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "weekly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Singapore", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Odisha", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gujarat", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Macao", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2556756", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Herpangina & hand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2556756", "date": "2013-11-28 20:39:20", "main_text": "HAND, FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - INDIA: (MAHARASHTRA) ETIOLOGIC AGENTS\n******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 23 Nov 2013\nSource: The Times of India, Pune [edited]\nhttp://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-11-23/pune/44389035_1_niv-samples-mouth-ulcers\n\n\nScientists from the [Pune]city-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) have confirmed the presence of enterovirus which, they said, has been causing hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children in Pune [Maharashtra state; the city was formerly known as Poona].

However, it can sometimes occur in adults. Symptoms of HFMD include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (herpangina) and a skin rash. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Enterovirus 71 has been associated with more severe outbreaks of HFMD (see: http://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/index.html).\n\nHFMD is prevalent globally and infects children in all communities. Since normally the infection is mild and of short duration, there has been little incentive to identify the specific etiologic agent. Normally ProMED-mail does not record these outbreaks unless the specific etiologic agent has been identified, or there is some unusual feature. The outbreak in Pune is exceptional in that the etiologic agents have been identified. Curiously the etiologic agent was only identified in less than 40 per cent of cases.\n\nThe Western Pacific Region of WHO routinely publishes data on the incidence of HFMD throughout East Asia (but not India) [see: http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/]. The most recent update (13 Nov 2013) reported that HFMD is declining. Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Japan and Republic of Korea (South Korea) have reported a higher cumulative number of cases in 2013 than in 2012 for the same time period. The recent trend, following seasonal patterns, is showing a decrease in China, Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Viet Nam.\n\nChina: Monthly average of cases has decreased from September (183 187 cases and 14 deaths) to October (134 032 cases and 8 deaths) 2013. There were 1 651 959 cases with 265 deaths reported up to the end of October in 2013.\n\nHong Kong (China): Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. Based on the 3 week moving average, weekly trends in hospitalized cases, general practitioners, and general outpatient clinics decreased. In the week 27 Oct to 2 Nov 2013, 4 HFMD inpatients (relative to 5 cases in the same period in 2012) were reported by the Hospital Authority; 0.1 cases per 1000 consultations among general out-patient clinics and 0.9 cases per 1000 consultations among general practitioners.\n\nMacao (China): Weekly trend has decreased based on the 3 week moving average. 19 cases were reported from 29 Oct to 4 Nov 2013 compared with 30 cases in the same period for 2012. The cumulative report for 2013 to the week ending 4 Nov was 2078 cases.\n\nJapan: Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. The weekly trend decreased based on the 3 week moving average. 4071 cases (1.29 cases per sentinel unit) were reported from 14 to 20 Oct 2013 compared with 1998 cases in the same period for 2012. Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 20 Oct was 281 149 cases.\n\nRepublic of Korea (South Korea): Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. The weekly trend is decreasing based on the 3 week moving average; 3.0 cases per 1000 outpatients for the week ending 5 Oct 2013. Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 5 Oct was 6.3 cases per 1000 outpatients.\n\nSingapore: The weekly trend increased based on the 3 week moving average; 914 cases were reported between 27 Oct to 2 Nov 2013 (relative to 265 for the same period in 2012). Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 2 Nov 2013 was 26 473 cases.\n\nViet Nam: The weekly number of reported cases during 7 to 13 Oct 2013 was 1610 relative to 1656 during the previous week. 63 109 cases with 19 deaths have been reported from across 63 provinces up to 13 Oct 2013.\n\nIt is unfortunate that there is so little determination of the etiologic agent(s) involved.\n\nFor further information on the HFMD situation or its surveillance, please visit the following links:\nChina (in Chinese): http://www.moh.gov.cn/wsb/pyqxx/list.shtml\nHong Kong (China): http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/data/1/26/44/292/1303.html\nJapan: http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/survaillance-data-table-english.html\nRepublic of Korea: http://www.cdc.go.kr/CDC/info/CdcKrInfo0301.jsp?menuIds=HOME001-MNU0004-MNU0036-MNU0037&q_type=B&q_value=2013\nSingapore: http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/diseases_and_conditions/h/hfmd.html\nThailand: http://www.boe.moph.go.th/index.php\n- Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1*Oa.]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia: (SK) 20131009.1992927\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) increased incidence 20131005.1984319\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Maldives 20130228.1564772\n2011\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Viet Nam (04): HCM 20110613.1804\n2006\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak)(04) 20060319.0854\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak)(03) 20060313.0792\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Brunei 20060308.0744\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak) 20060303.0671\n2005\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Taiwan (central) (02) 20050531.1503\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Taiwan (Central) 20050523.1417\n2000\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - South Korea: comment 20000615.0969\n.................................................sb/cp/jejw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hand, foot and mouth disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-10-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-09-16 00:00:00", "2021-10-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2078-03-16 00:00:00", "1998-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "1656-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Bengal", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taiwan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pune", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kerala", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Republic of Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "weekly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Singapore", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Odisha", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gujarat", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Macao", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2527551", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2527551", "date": "2013-11-28 20:39:20", "main_text": "HAND, FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - INDIA: (MAHARASHTRA) ETIOLOGIC AGENTS\n******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 23 Nov 2013\nSource: The Times of India, Pune [edited]\nhttp://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-11-23/pune/44389035_1_niv-samples-mouth-ulcers\n\n\nScientists from the [Pune]city-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) have confirmed the presence of enterovirus which, they said, has been causing hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children in Pune [Maharashtra state; the city was formerly known as Poona].

The contagious viral illness has been spreading among children below 5 years of age in the last 2 months. Of the 79 samples drawn by the scientists, 40 per cent tested positive for enterovirus.\n\n\"The circulating virus in the city, causing HFMD in infants and children, is enterovirus. The infection caused by the virus is usually mild. Hence, there is no need to panic,\" said senior scientist D T Mourya, director of NIV. The viral infection, benign but irritating, is characterised by painful rashes along with throat [pain] and fever. Coxsackieviruses and enteroviruses are the major causative agents of HFMD in India. This is the 1st time that the Virology Institute investigated HFMD cases in Pune after doctors reported a spurt [of cases] since October [2013]. Earlier, it had carried out HFMD investigations in Kerala, West Bengal, Odisha, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu in 2009-2010. Scientist V Gopalkrishna, Deputy Director of NIV, who spearheaded the HFMD study along with paediatricians, said, \"79 clinical samples comprising throat swabs, rectal swabs, vesicular swabs and blood samples were collected from children below 7 years of age with suspected HFMD in Pune who went to paediatricians' clinics and hospitals for treatment in the last 2 months. Nearly 40 per cent of the samples tested positive for the etiological agent enterovirus.

Paediatrician Jayant Navarange, who is part of the NIV study and has been treating kids with HFMD in the last 2 months, said, \"HFMD is contagious.

However, it can sometimes occur in adults. Symptoms of HFMD include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (herpangina) and a skin rash. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Enterovirus 71 has been associated with more severe outbreaks of HFMD (see: http://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/index.html).\n\nHFMD is prevalent globally and infects children in all communities. Since normally the infection is mild and of short duration, there has been little incentive to identify the specific etiologic agent. Normally ProMED-mail does not record these outbreaks unless the specific etiologic agent has been identified, or there is some unusual feature. The outbreak in Pune is exceptional in that the etiologic agents have been identified. Curiously the etiologic agent was only identified in less than 40 per cent of cases.\n\nThe Western Pacific Region of WHO routinely publishes data on the incidence of HFMD throughout East Asia (but not India) [see: http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/]. The most recent update (13 Nov 2013) reported that HFMD is declining. Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Japan and Republic of Korea (South Korea) have reported a higher cumulative number of cases in 2013 than in 2012 for the same time period. The recent trend, following seasonal patterns, is showing a decrease in China, Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Viet Nam.\n\nChina: Monthly average of cases has decreased from September (183 187 cases and 14 deaths) to October (134 032 cases and 8 deaths) 2013. There were 1 651 959 cases with 265 deaths reported up to the end of October in 2013.\n\nHong Kong (China): Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. Based on the 3 week moving average, weekly trends in hospitalized cases, general practitioners, and general outpatient clinics decreased. In the week 27 Oct to 2 Nov 2013, 4 HFMD inpatients (relative to 5 cases in the same period in 2012) were reported by the Hospital Authority; 0.1 cases per 1000 consultations among general out-patient clinics and 0.9 cases per 1000 consultations among general practitioners.\n\nMacao (China): Weekly trend has decreased based on the 3 week moving average. 19 cases were reported from 29 Oct to 4 Nov 2013 compared with 30 cases in the same period for 2012. The cumulative report for 2013 to the week ending 4 Nov was 2078 cases.\n\nJapan: Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. The weekly trend decreased based on the 3 week moving average. 4071 cases (1.29 cases per sentinel unit) were reported from 14 to 20 Oct 2013 compared with 1998 cases in the same period for 2012.

The contagious viral illness has been spreading among children below 5 years of age in the last 2 months. Of the 79 samples drawn by the scientists, 40 per cent tested positive for enterovirus.\n\n\"The circulating virus in the city, causing HFMD in infants and children, is enterovirus. The infection caused by the virus is usually mild. Hence, there is no need to panic,\" said senior scientist D T Mourya, director of NIV. The viral infection, benign but irritating, is characterised by painful rashes along with throat [pain] and fever. Coxsackieviruses and enteroviruses are the major causative agents of HFMD in India. This is the 1st time that the Virology Institute investigated HFMD cases in Pune after doctors reported a spurt [of cases] since October [2013]. Earlier, it had carried out HFMD investigations in Kerala, West Bengal, Odisha, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu in 2009-2010. Scientist V Gopalkrishna, Deputy Director of NIV, who spearheaded the HFMD study along with paediatricians, said, \"79 clinical samples comprising throat swabs, rectal swabs, vesicular swabs and blood samples were collected from children below 7 years of age with suspected HFMD in Pune who went to paediatricians' clinics and hospitals for treatment in the last 2 months. Nearly 40 per cent of the samples tested positive for the etiological agent enterovirus. Now, cases are on the decline.\" Paediatricians from Shaishav clinic, Chiranjeev clinic, Bharati Hospital and Ajinkya Hospital from the city were involved in this study with NIV scientists.\n\n\"If a child is not eating and shows loss of appetite and has mouth ulcers, then it is time to consult a doctor,\" said paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar. Paediatrician Jayant Navarange, who is part of the NIV study and has been treating kids with HFMD in the last 2 months, said, \"HFMD is contagious. Hence, infected children should stay away from schools till they completely recover,\" he added.\n\n[Byline: Umesh Isalkar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HFMD is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in adults. Symptoms of HFMD include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (herpangina) and a skin rash. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Enterovirus 71 has been associated with more severe outbreaks of HFMD (see: http://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/index.html).\n\nHFMD is prevalent globally and infects children in all communities. Since normally the infection is mild and of short duration, there has been little incentive to identify the specific etiologic agent. Normally ProMED-mail does not record these outbreaks unless the specific etiologic agent has been identified, or there is some unusual feature. The outbreak in Pune is exceptional in that the etiologic agents have been identified. Curiously the etiologic agent was only identified in less than 40 per cent of cases.\n\nThe Western Pacific Region of WHO routinely publishes data on the incidence of HFMD throughout East Asia (but not India) [see: http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/]. The most recent update (13 Nov 2013) reported that HFMD is declining. Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Japan and Republic of Korea (South Korea) have reported a higher cumulative number of cases in 2013 than in 2012 for the same time period. The recent trend, following seasonal patterns, is showing a decrease in China, Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Viet Nam.\n\nChina: Monthly average of cases has decreased from September (183 187 cases and 14 deaths) to October (134 032 cases and 8 deaths) 2013. There were 1 651 959 cases with 265 deaths reported up to the end of October in 2013.\n\nHong Kong (China): Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. Based on the 3 week moving average, weekly trends in hospitalized cases, general practitioners, and general outpatient clinics decreased. In the week 27 Oct to 2 Nov 2013, 4 HFMD inpatients (relative to 5 cases in the same period in 2012) were reported by the Hospital Authority; 0.1 cases per 1000 consultations among general out-patient clinics and 0.9 cases per 1000 consultations among general practitioners.\n\nMacao (China): Weekly trend has decreased based on the 3 week moving average. 19 cases were reported from 29 Oct to 4 Nov 2013 compared with 30 cases in the same period for 2012. The cumulative report for 2013 to the week ending 4 Nov was 2078 cases.\n\nJapan: Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. The weekly trend decreased based on the 3 week moving average. 4071 cases (1.29 cases per sentinel unit) were reported from 14 to 20 Oct 2013 compared with 1998 cases in the same period for 2012. Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 20 Oct was 281 149 cases.\n\nRepublic of Korea (South Korea): Surveillance for HFMD is conducted through sentinel reporting units. The weekly trend is decreasing based on the 3 week moving average; 3.0 cases per 1000 outpatients for the week ending 5 Oct 2013. Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 5 Oct was 6.3 cases per 1000 outpatients.\n\nSingapore: The weekly trend increased based on the 3 week moving average; 914 cases were reported between 27 Oct to 2 Nov 2013 (relative to 265 for the same period in 2012). Cumulative total for 2013 to the week ending 2 Nov 2013 was 26 473 cases.\n\nViet Nam: The weekly number of reported cases during 7 to 13 Oct 2013 was 1610 relative to 1656 during the previous week. 63 109 cases with 19 deaths have been reported from across 63 provinces up to 13 Oct 2013.\n\nIt is unfortunate that there is so little determination of the etiologic agent(s) involved.\n\nFor further information on the HFMD situation or its surveillance, please visit the following links:\nChina (in Chinese): http://www.moh.gov.cn/wsb/pyqxx/list.shtml\nHong Kong (China): http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/data/1/26/44/292/1303.html\nJapan: http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/survaillance-data-table-english.html\nRepublic of Korea: http://www.cdc.go.kr/CDC/info/CdcKrInfo0301.jsp?menuIds=HOME001-MNU0004-MNU0036-MNU0037&q_type=B&q_value=2013\nSingapore: http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/diseases_and_conditions/h/hfmd.html\nThailand: http://www.boe.moph.go.th/index.php\n- Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1*Oa.]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia: (SK) 20131009.1992927\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) increased incidence 20131005.1984319\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Maldives 20130228.1564772\n2011\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Viet Nam (04): HCM 20110613.1804\n2006\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak)(04) 20060319.0854\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak)(03) 20060313.0792\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Brunei 20060308.0744\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak) 20060303.0671\n2005\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Taiwan (central) (02) 20050531.1503\nHand, foot and mouth disease - Taiwan (Central) 20050523.1417\n2000\n----\nHand, foot and mouth disease - South Korea: comment 20000615.0969\n.................................................sb/cp/jejw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hand, foot and mouth disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-10-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-09-16 00:00:00", "2021-10-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2078-03-16 00:00:00", "1998-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "1656-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Bengal", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taiwan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pune", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kerala", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Republic of Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "weekly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Singapore", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Odisha", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gujarat", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Macao", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1992927", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia: (SK)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1992927", "date": "2013-06-06 17:26:13", "main_text": "HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE - NEW ZEALAND (02): (AUCKLAND)\n***********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 6 Jun 2013\nSource: 3 News [edited]\nhttp://www.3news.co.nz/Starship-admissions-up-on-diseases-spread/tabid/423/articleID/300475/Default.aspx\n\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is being blamed for an increase in admissions at Auckland's Starship Children's Hospital, as many as 3 a day.

In these outbreaks, most children have typical symptoms of HFMD and recover without complications. However, a small number of children with this disease have developed severe complications requiring prolonged hospitalization or, rarely, death.

It causes fevers, rashes on hands and feet, and blisterlike sores in the mouth, which can make drinking and eating extremely uncomfortable. It usually clears up on its own in about a week.\n\nNow, though, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting that an unusual version has hit the country, with more severe fevers and rashes, some leading to hospitalization for dehydration and pain.\n\nThe severe strain was 1st noticed in Alabama, Connecticut, California, and Nevada last winter [2011-2012], which was odd because HFMD typically appears in summer and early fall.\n\nAlthough several pediatricians in the Washington area say they haven't seen the atypical virus, \"it's pretty much all over the country at this point,\" says Steven Oberste, laboratory chief in CDC's viral disease division.\n\nHFMD is usually caused by coxsackievirus A16; the more severe illness is caused by coxsackievirus A6, which has popped up in this country only a few times in the past 40 years, according to the CDC. Both are spread through saliva, mucus, fluid from the blisters, and stool.\n\nThe CDC has received about 100-150 reports of severe cases. \"Since there's no required reporting of hand-foot-mouth disease, it's difficult to estimate how many cases are out there,\" Oberste says. \"We have 100-150 reports, but clearly it's a lot more than that.\"\n\nMelissa Arca, a pediatrician in Sacramento, where the disease seems to have hit hard, says there were times during the summer when she saw 3 or 4 children every day with severe HFMD, and she only works half days at her clinic. Researchers don't know if the A6 wave has peaked with the end of summer, so they're unsure whether the new school year will cause a spike in cases. Outbreaks of HFMD occur around the globe, but in recent years they have mostly been in Asia, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nDaniel Levy, a pediatrician in Owings Mills, Maryland, says that he has seen a normal amount of HFMD and the cases don't seem any more severe than usual. Pediatricians at Children's National Medical Center and one in Columbia Heights both echoed Levy's experience. \"I have yet to see any child hospitalized or sent to the ER [for HFMD] in my career; it is just not that serious,\" Levy says. \"It sounds a lot worse than it is.\"\n\nThe A6 version is odd, for a number of reasons. It causes more severe rashes up the legs, around the mouth and, especially for toddlers, on the buttocks. Arca reports that in some cases, after the rash has gone away, the skin can peel and the fingernails and toenails can fall off. \"It's scary, but they'll grow back,\" she says.\n\nAlso, more adults than usual seem to be catching the new strain, according to the CDC. That's probably because A6 has circulated only sporadically in the United States since 1970, so fewer adults were exposed to it when they were younger, according to Oberste. A6 was big in Japan in the spring and summer of 2011.\n\n[Byline: Rachel Saslow]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The coxsackie A6 virus has circulated sporadically in the USA, and may produce somewhat more severe disease. A ProMED-mail report of 14 Aug 2012 (archive no. 20120816.1248050) quoted Phil Ulibarri, public information officer for the Washoe county, Nevada, health district saying, \"This [coxsackie A6] strain is not [affecting] just the hands, feet, and mouth.

Researchers don't know if the A6 wave has peaked with the end of summer, so they're unsure whether the new school year will cause a spike in cases.

Health Ministry director general Datuk Seri Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman said this week. Selangor had the highest number of HMFD cases (354 cases), followed by Sarawak (343 cases), Johor (195 cases), Penang (128 cases), Kuala Lumpur (100 cases) and Sabah (91 cases). Other states reported less than 60 cases.\n\nMost of the cases reported are mild. This week, 180 cases nationwide have been hospitalised for observation and rehydration treatment and no deaths were reported, the Health Ministry Director said in a statement on Friday [18 May 2012]. The increase in cases had been observed since January this year, and 17 221 cases have been reported since then. Dr Hasan added that the Ministry's measures to curb the spread were to temporarily shut down premises or institutions where HMFD was spreading, and urged medical practitioners to report HFMD cases to the ministry.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. Unfortunately this report does not identify the causative agent (or agents) responsible for this outbreak of HFMD. The uniformly mild symptoms observed suggests that this outbreak is not caused by human enterovirus 71, which in the past has been accompanied by cases of severe disease in Malaysia.\n\nHFMD usually starts with a fever, poor appetite, a vague feeling of being unwell (malaise), and sore throat. One or 2 days after fever starts, painful sores usually develop in the mouth (herpangina). They begin as small red spots that blister and that often become ulcers. The sores are often in the back of the mouth. A skin rash develops over 1 to 2 days. The rash has flat or raised red spots, sometimes with blisters. The rash is usually on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; it may also appear on the knees, elbows, buttocks or genital area. Some people, especially young children, may get dehydrated if they are not able to swallow enough liquids because of painful mouth sores.\n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease is spread from person to person by direct contact with the infectious viruses that cause this disease. These viruses are found in the nose and throat secretions (such as saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus), fluid in blisters, and stool of infected persons. The viruses may be spread when infected persons touch objects and surfaces that are then touched by others.\n\nThere is no specific treatment. There is no vaccine to protect against the viruses that cause HFMD.

We are especially worried about South Viet Nnam, where lots of children are in informal [hygienically unregulated] cr\u00e8ches while their parents work,\" Bhupinder Tomar, representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in Viet Nam, told IRIN.\n\nHFMD\u2019s symptoms are fever, sores in the mouth and blisters on the hands and feet. The disease spreads by direct contact with fluids from infected persons and there is no specific treatment. Most of the viruses that cause HFMD are benign, but EV71 can be fatal. The new strain appeared in Viet Nam over the past year and since then it has become a serious public health issue for children, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe risk of catching HFMD is greatly reduced by improving hygiene, which IFRC is trying to promote through an existing public education campaign.\n\nIn 2011 there were 110 000 reported infections and 169 deaths linked to EV71, mostly in the south of the country. The disease is active year-round and peaks between April-May and then again in September-October. In March 2012 there were twice as many deaths and seven times as many infections as in the same period last year.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n\n[HFMD is a common, mild and self-limiting rash-associated illness in most children, with Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) or Enterovirus 71 (EV71) the predominant causative agents. Since first described in California in 1969, EV71 has been reported to be responsible for many large outbreaks all over the world, including outbreaks that occurred in South and East Asia from 1997 onwards. Generally, these outbreaks were accompanied by a small number of cases with severe neurologic disease such as acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema, myocarditis, and fatal encephalitis. The EV71 viruses have been classified into three independent lineages, A, B, and C, based on the structural VP1 gene; each group has at least 15% divergence from the others. Consequently the epidemiology of EV71-associated HFMD in South and East Asia is proving to be very complex. For example a recent study of Enterovirus 71 strains from severe and mild disease patients in North-eastern China identified seven circulating EV71 viruses (see: Xiaomei Wang et al., PLoS ONE 7(3): e32405. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0032405, 29 Mar 2012 http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0032405). These EV71 viruses contained genetic recombination events between four distinct EV71 strains. Most of the structural protein region (P1) of these viruses resembled that of the prototype EV71 C1 strain.

Since first described in California in 1969, EV71 has been reported to be responsible for many large outbreaks all over the world, including outbreaks that occurred in South and East Asia from 1997 onwards. Generally, these outbreaks were accompanied by a small number of cases with severe neurologic disease such as acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema, myocarditis, and fatal encephalitis. The EV71 viruses have been classified into three independent lineages, A, B, and C, based on the structural VP1 gene; each group has at least 15% divergence from the others. Consequently the epidemiology of EV71-associated HFMD in South and East Asia is proving to be very complex. For example a recent study of Enterovirus 71 strains from severe and mild disease patients in North-eastern China identified seven circulating EV71 viruses (see: Xiaomei Wang et al., PLoS ONE 7(3): e32405. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0032405, 29 Mar 2012 http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0032405). These EV71 viruses contained genetic recombination events between four distinct EV71 strains. Most of the structural protein region (P1) of these viruses resembled that of the prototype EV71 C1 strain.

Since first described in California in 1969, EV71 has been reported to be responsible for many large outbreaks all over the world, including outbreaks that occurred in South and East Asia from 1997 onwards. Generally, these outbreaks were accompanied by a small number of cases with severe neurologic disease such as acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema, myocarditis, and fatal encephalitis. The EV71 viruses have been classified into three independent lineages, A, B, and C, based on the structural VP1 gene; each group has at least 15% divergence from the others. Consequently the epidemiology of EV71-associated HFMD in South and East Asia is proving to be very complex. For example a recent study of Enterovirus 71 strains from severe and mild disease patients in North-eastern China identified seven circulating EV71 viruses (see: Xiaomei Wang et al., PLoS ONE 7(3): e32405. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0032405, 29 Mar 2012 http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0032405). These EV71 viruses contained genetic recombination events between four distinct EV71 strains. Most of the structural protein region (P1) of these viruses resembled that of the prototype EV71 C1 strain. The non-structural protein domains (P2 and P3) showed a high degree of similarity with Coxsackieviruses A4 and A5. The 5\u2032UTR (untranslated region) showed a high degree of similarity to Coxsackievirus A16. However, irrespective of genotype no correlation was observed between genotype and virulence. In the immediate future education and control of hygiene and sanitation may remain the best options for containment of HFMD, rather than vaccine development.\n\nThe interactive HealthMap of Vet Nam can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/008c. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (04): HCM 20110613.1804\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03): HCM 20110607.1739\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02): (QN, HCM) 20110604.1712\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Croatia: (ZG) childcare centre\n20110527.1624\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Hong Kong, nursery school 20110523.1567\nHand, foot & mouth disease - USA: (AR) 20110519.1513\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam: (HCM) 20110409.1119\nHand, foot & mouth disease - India: (MH) 20110101.0009\n.................................................cp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hand, foot and mouth disease", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "1969-03-16 00:00:00", "1997-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Vet Nam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "North - eastern", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1104577", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (06), Mekong Delta", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1104577", "date": "2012-04-08 13:20:06", "main_text": "HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE - VIET NAM (05)\n********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 5 Apr 2012\nSource: IRIN Asia [edited]\nhttp://www.irinnews.org/Report/95244/VIETNAM-Mild-disease-turns-deadly-for=\n\nViet nam: Mild disease turns deadly for children\n----------------------------------------\nBANGKOK: A dangerous strain of the typically non-lethal hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) [virus] has affected more than 21 000 persons -- mostly children younger than five -- killing 16 thus far in Viet Nam, according to the Ministry of Health.\n\n\"Despite being a benign viral infection in developed countries, the strain EV71 [Human enterovirus 71] of HFMD is causing multiple deaths of children under five here in Asia.

The risks are\nhigher for children attending kindergartens, since the new school year\nhas begun, it said.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has asked the education sector to take active\nmeasures to sterilize [decontaminate] kindergartens, day care centers\nand schools to prevent the spread of the HFMD virus.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Since the end of June 2011 the number of cases of HFMD in Viet Nam\nhas risen from around 23 000 to 32 588, and death toll has risen from\n70 to 81.\n\nIt has been established previously (see ProMED-mail posts referenced\nbelow) that human enterovirus 71 is the dominant HFMD-associated virus\ncirculating in Viet Nam currently. HFMD caused by this virus can\nresult in a more serious form of this common childhood disease leading\nto paralysis, encephalitis or death.

HFMD caused\nby enterovirus 71 has shown a higher incidence of neurologic\ninvolvement and fatal cases of encephalitis have occurred during\noutbreaks. However, such serious outcomes are still very rare.\n\nHFMD infection is spread from person to person by direct contact.\nInfectious virus is found in the nose and throat secretions, saliva,\nblister fluid and stool of infected persons. The virus is most often\nspread by persons with unwashed, virus-contaminated hands and by\ncontact with virus-contaminated surfaces. Infected persons are most\ncontagious during the 1st week of the illness, but may remain a source\nof infection for others after symptoms have resolved.\n\nComplications from virus infections that cause HFMD are uncommon;\n\"aseptic\" meningitis can occur rarely with HFMD causing fever,\nheadache, stiff neck, or back pain. Some patients may require\nhospitalization for a short time. Other more serious conditions, such\nas encephalitis, are very rare although encephalitis can be fatal.\nThere have been reports of fingernail and toenail loss occurring\nmostly in children within 4 weeks of having HFMD (see: ProMED-mail\npostings Onychomadesis, coxsackievirus - USA: (MI), RFI 20080729.2317;\nOnychomadesis - Spain: (Valencia), coxsackievirus 20080709.2099; and\nOnychomadesis - Spain: (Valencia), coxsackievirus (02) 20080711.2120).\nAt this time, it is not known whether the reported nail loss is or is\nnot a result of the infection. However, nail loss has been temporary\nand nail growth has resumed without medical treatment.\n\nFurther information about HFMD can be obtained from the CDC website\nat http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/enterovirus/hfhf.htm.\n\nIt is difficult to assess the seriousness of the outbreak of HFMD at\nFort Smith in the absence of information on the number of children\n(and adults) affected and without identification of the causative\nagent. - Mod.CP]\n\n[Fort Smith can be located via the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive\nmap at http://healthmap.org/r/0Rit. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam: (HCM) 20110409.1119\nHand, foot & mouth disease - India: (MH) 20110101.0009\n2010\n----\nHand, foot & mouth disease (07): Viet Nam 20100801.2586\nHand foot & mouth disease (06): Thailand 20100721.2451\nHand, foot & mouth disease (05): China, rural areas 20100625.2121\nHand, foot & mouth disease (04): China (GI) 20100507.1489\nHand, foot & mouth disease (03): China (Beijing) 20100416.1235\nHand, foot & mouth disease (02): China 20100412.1184\nHand foot & mouth disease: Singapore, China (HN), Viet Nam\n20100329.0985\n.................................................sb/cp/mj/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hand, foot and mouth disease", "encephalitis", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis", "meningitis"], "event_date": ["1997-03-16 00:00:00", "1971-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Thailand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Fort Smith", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Arkansas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Singapore", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "695546", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam: (HCM)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=695546", "date": "2010-07-21 17:00:09", "main_text": "HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE (06): THAILAND\n******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Tue 20 Jul 2010\nSource: Phuket Gazette, Daily News [edited]\n<http://www.phuketgazette.net/archives/articles/2010/article8979.html>\n\n\nWith more than 70 children in Phuket having contracted Hand, Foot and\nMouth Disease (HFMD) already this year [2010], Phuket City\nMunicipality has issued an advisory urging parents to be aware of the\nhighly contagious disease.\n\nNittaya Panchamedithee, an officer at the municipality's health\nsection, said: \"There is more chance of an outbreak in the rainy\nseason as the virus can live longer when the weather is cool and\nhumid.\" The onset of the rainy season also coincides with the start\nof the 1st school semester, which also makes it easy for the virus to\nspread, she said.\n\nMs Nittaya urged parents to keep an eye on all children, especially\nthose under 3 years old and infants.

Some 3000 children in Viet Nam caught the\ndisease last year [2008] and at least 10 died.\n\nChildren's Hospital No. 1, for example, reported on Friday [11 Sep\n2009] that 60 patients were under treatment for the disease, which is\ncaused by the enterovirus 71, with fever, blisters, mouth ulcers, and rashes.\n\nDr Truong Huu Khanh from the hospital said nearly 90 percent of the\nchildren, mainly from other provinces, were admitted to the hospital\nin already serious condition.\n\n[Byline: Lien Chau, Thanh Tung]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPRO/MBDS\n<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of\ninfants and children. The disease causes fever and blister-like\neruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. HFMD is caused by viruses\nthat belong to the enterovirus genus. This group of viruses includes\npolioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.\nEnteroviruses, including enterovirus 71, have also been associated\nwith HFMD and with outbreaks of the disease. Enterovirus 71 may be\nassociated with fatalities due to viral meningitis or encephalitis\n(see <https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/index.html>).\n\nDuring 2009, HFMD outbreak in Viet Nam started in April 2009, with\nincreasing numbers of patients reported in hospitals from Ho Chi Minh\nCity, Dong Nai, Binh Duong, Binh Phuoc, Tay Ninh and An Giang\nprovinces (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Hand, foot & mouth disease -\nViet Nam: RFI 20090411.1387).\n\nPeaks of HFMD were usually during the dry seasons from March to May\nand September to December. As of 22 May 2009, there were 50 children\ninfected with HFMD and 3 of them were in a serious condition (see\nprior PRO/MBDS posting Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02)\n20090524.1942). As of 12 May 2008, 2300 cases of HFMD had been\nreported in Viet Nam with 10 fatalities during 2008 and most of the\nreported cases were from the southern regions (see prior PRO/MBDS\nposting Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03) 20080516.1634).\n\nSince the beginning of 2009 to 11 Sep 2009, there had been 60\npatients under treatment for HFMD.

More cases are expected, as the\ndisease normally peaks between May and July. In\nthe absence of a drug treatment, the ministry is\nfocusing on prevention and containment.\n\nThe outbreak is the latest in a series to have\nhit China in recent years, caused by a\nfast-spreading virus called enterovirus 71. \"The\npersistence of enterovirus 71 outbreaks in China\nis a wake-up call,\" says Jane Cardosa, a\nvirologist at the University Malaysia Sarawak in\nKota Samarahan. In 1997, Sarawak saw the 1st\noutbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease in the\nAsia-Pacific region. The disease causes flu-like\nsymptoms, along with rashes on the hands and\nfeet, and mouth ulcers. It can be caused by many\ntypes of human enterovirus belonging to the\nfamily _Picornaviridae_, which are mainly\ntransmitted through fecal or oral routes.\nAlthough normally mild, the disease can be\nlife-threatening: some viruses, particularly\nenterovirus 71, can cause inflammation of the\nbrain stem, resulting in heart failure and fluid accumulation in the lungs.\n\nIn 1997 in Sarawak, more than 2600 cases of the\ndisease were reported and 29 people died. The\nnext year in Taiwan, there were 129 000 reported\ncases and 78 deaths. In mainland China, the 1st\nreported case was in Shenzhen, Guangdong\nprovince, in 1999. At 1st, outbreaks were local\nand there were no reported fatalities. But since\n2004, the outbreaks have become more severe and\nwidespread, says Xu Wenbo, an infectious-disease\nexpert at the Beijing-based China Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn May 2008, the country's health ministry added\nhand, foot and mouth to its category 'C' of\nnotifiable diseases, meaning that all diagnosed\ncases must be reported through a national\nWeb-based system for disease surveillance, and\ntook measures to streamline reporting\nrequirements. The Ministry also vowed to take a\ntough stance against cover-ups and last month\n[fired] 4 health officials in Henan province for\nconcealing the number of infections and deaths.\n\nThis year, enterovirus 71 has caused nearly all\nof the laboratory-confirmed cases in 2 hot-spots,\nthe provinces of Henan and Shandong.\n\nXu suspects that the disease's increasing\nvirulence may be due to a genetic change in the\ncirculating virus strain. Before 2004 the\npredominant strain was called C4b; since then, a\ndifferent strain, C4a, has been most common (see:\nY. Zhang et al. J. Clin. Virol. 44, 262\u00ad267;\n2009). What caused this switch isn't clear, says\nXu, as little is known about the genetics and\ntransmission trends of the fast-mutating virus.\nMost studies have been clinical, aimed at, for\nexample, identifying the strains behind a given\noutbreak and the disease's clinical features,\nespecially when there are neurological\ncomplications.

More cases are expected, as the\ndisease normally peaks between May and July. In\nthe absence of a drug treatment, the ministry is\nfocusing on prevention and containment.\n\nThe outbreak is the latest in a series to have\nhit China in recent years, caused by a\nfast-spreading virus called enterovirus 71. \"The\npersistence of enterovirus 71 outbreaks in China\nis a wake-up call,\" says Jane Cardosa, a\nvirologist at the University Malaysia Sarawak in\nKota Samarahan. In 1997, Sarawak saw the 1st\noutbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease in the\nAsia-Pacific region. The disease causes flu-like\nsymptoms, along with rashes on the hands and\nfeet, and mouth ulcers. It can be caused by many\ntypes of human enterovirus belonging to the\nfamily _Picornaviridae_, which are mainly\ntransmitted through fecal or oral routes.\nAlthough normally mild, the disease can be\nlife-threatening: some viruses, particularly\nenterovirus 71, can cause inflammation of the\nbrain stem, resulting in heart failure and fluid accumulation in the lungs.\n\nIn 1997 in Sarawak, more than 2600 cases of the\ndisease were reported and 29 people died. The\nnext year in Taiwan, there were 129 000 reported\ncases and 78 deaths. In mainland China, the 1st\nreported case was in Shenzhen, Guangdong\nprovince, in 1999. At 1st, outbreaks were local\nand there were no reported fatalities. But since\n2004, the outbreaks have become more severe and\nwidespread, says Xu Wenbo, an infectious-disease\nexpert at the Beijing-based China Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn May 2008, the country's health ministry added\nhand, foot and mouth to its category 'C' of\nnotifiable diseases, meaning that all diagnosed\ncases must be reported through a national\nWeb-based system for disease surveillance, and\ntook measures to streamline reporting\nrequirements. The Ministry also vowed to take a\ntough stance against cover-ups and last month\n[fired] 4 health officials in Henan province for\nconcealing the number of infections and deaths.\n\nThis year, enterovirus 71 has caused nearly all\nof the laboratory-confirmed cases in 2 hot-spots,\nthe provinces of Henan and Shandong.\n\nXu suspects that the disease's increasing\nvirulence may be due to a genetic change in the\ncirculating virus strain. Before 2004 the\npredominant strain was called C4b; since then, a\ndifferent strain, C4a, has been most common (see:\nY. Zhang et al. J. Clin. Virol. 44, 262\u00ad267;\n2009). What caused this switch isn't clear, says\nXu, as little is known about the genetics and\ntransmission trends of the fast-mutating virus.\nMost studies have been clinical, aimed at, for\nexample, identifying the strains behind a given\noutbreak and the disease's clinical features,\nespecially when there are neurological\ncomplications.

More cases are expected, as the\ndisease normally peaks between May and July. In\nthe absence of a drug treatment, the ministry is\nfocusing on prevention and containment.\n\nThe outbreak is the latest in a series to have\nhit China in recent years, caused by a\nfast-spreading virus called enterovirus 71. \"The\npersistence of enterovirus 71 outbreaks in China\nis a wake-up call,\" says Jane Cardosa, a\nvirologist at the University Malaysia Sarawak in\nKota Samarahan. In 1997, Sarawak saw the 1st\noutbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease in the\nAsia-Pacific region. The disease causes flu-like\nsymptoms, along with rashes on the hands and\nfeet, and mouth ulcers. It can be caused by many\ntypes of human enterovirus belonging to the\nfamily _Picornaviridae_, which are mainly\ntransmitted through fecal or oral routes.\nAlthough normally mild, the disease can be\nlife-threatening: some viruses, particularly\nenterovirus 71, can cause inflammation of the\nbrain stem, resulting in heart failure and fluid accumulation in the lungs.\n\nIn 1997 in Sarawak, more than 2600 cases of the\ndisease were reported and 29 people died. The\nnext year in Taiwan, there were 129 000 reported\ncases and 78 deaths. In mainland China, the 1st\nreported case was in Shenzhen, Guangdong\nprovince, in 1999. At 1st, outbreaks were local\nand there were no reported fatalities. But since\n2004, the outbreaks have become more severe and\nwidespread, says Xu Wenbo, an infectious-disease\nexpert at the Beijing-based China Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn May 2008, the country's health ministry added\nhand, foot and mouth to its category 'C' of\nnotifiable diseases, meaning that all diagnosed\ncases must be reported through a national\nWeb-based system for disease surveillance, and\ntook measures to streamline reporting\nrequirements. The Ministry also vowed to take a\ntough stance against cover-ups and last month\n[fired] 4 health officials in Henan province for\nconcealing the number of infections and deaths.\n\nThis year, enterovirus 71 has caused nearly all\nof the laboratory-confirmed cases in 2 hot-spots,\nthe provinces of Henan and Shandong.\n\nXu suspects that the disease's increasing\nvirulence may be due to a genetic change in the\ncirculating virus strain. Before 2004 the\npredominant strain was called C4b; since then, a\ndifferent strain, C4a, has been most common (see:\nY. Zhang et al. J. Clin. Virol. 44, 262\u00ad267;\n2009). What caused this switch isn't clear, says\nXu, as little is known about the genetics and\ntransmission trends of the fast-mutating virus.\nMost studies have been clinical, aimed at, for\nexample, identifying the strains behind a given\noutbreak and the disease's clinical features,\nespecially when there are neurological\ncomplications. Many researchers say it is time to\nstep up efforts to understand the basic biology\nof enterovirus 71 to speed vaccine development.\n\nIn a major push financed by the Chinese Health\nMinistry and the Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Xu and his colleagues measured the\ninfection rate in adults and children during last\nyear's outbreak and analysed stool samples and\nthroat swabs taken from more than 18 000\npatients. Preliminary results suggest that the\ninfection rate is alarmingly high, meaning that\nthere are large populations of virus carriers who\ndo not show any symptoms of the disease.\n\nExperts are divided as to how worried the world\nshould be about the virus.

More cases are expected, as the\ndisease normally peaks between May and July. In\nthe absence of a drug treatment, the ministry is\nfocusing on prevention and containment.\n\nThe outbreak is the latest in a series to have\nhit China in recent years, caused by a\nfast-spreading virus called enterovirus 71. \"The\npersistence of enterovirus 71 outbreaks in China\nis a wake-up call,\" says Jane Cardosa, a\nvirologist at the University Malaysia Sarawak in\nKota Samarahan. In 1997, Sarawak saw the 1st\noutbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease in the\nAsia-Pacific region. The disease causes flu-like\nsymptoms, along with rashes on the hands and\nfeet, and mouth ulcers. It can be caused by many\ntypes of human enterovirus belonging to the\nfamily _Picornaviridae_, which are mainly\ntransmitted through fecal or oral routes.\nAlthough normally mild, the disease can be\nlife-threatening: some viruses, particularly\nenterovirus 71, can cause inflammation of the\nbrain stem, resulting in heart failure and fluid accumulation in the lungs.\n\nIn 1997 in Sarawak, more than 2600 cases of the\ndisease were reported and 29 people died. The\nnext year in Taiwan, there were 129 000 reported\ncases and 78 deaths. In mainland China, the 1st\nreported case was in Shenzhen, Guangdong\nprovince, in 1999. At 1st, outbreaks were local\nand there were no reported fatalities. But since\n2004, the outbreaks have become more severe and\nwidespread, says Xu Wenbo, an infectious-disease\nexpert at the Beijing-based China Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn May 2008, the country's health ministry added\nhand, foot and mouth to its category 'C' of\nnotifiable diseases, meaning that all diagnosed\ncases must be reported through a national\nWeb-based system for disease surveillance, and\ntook measures to streamline reporting\nrequirements. The Ministry also vowed to take a\ntough stance against cover-ups and last month\n[fired] 4 health officials in Henan province for\nconcealing the number of infections and deaths.\n\nThis year, enterovirus 71 has caused nearly all\nof the laboratory-confirmed cases in 2 hot-spots,\nthe provinces of Henan and Shandong.\n\nXu suspects that the disease's increasing\nvirulence may be due to a genetic change in the\ncirculating virus strain. Before 2004 the\npredominant strain was called C4b; since then, a\ndifferent strain, C4a, has been most common (see:\nY. Zhang et al. J. Clin. Virol. 44, 262\u00ad267;\n2009). What caused this switch isn't clear, says\nXu, as little is known about the genetics and\ntransmission trends of the fast-mutating virus.\nMost studies have been clinical, aimed at, for\nexample, identifying the strains behind a given\noutbreak and the disease's clinical features,\nespecially when there are neurological\ncomplications. Many researchers say it is time to\nstep up efforts to understand the basic biology\nof enterovirus 71 to speed vaccine development.\n\nIn a major push financed by the Chinese Health\nMinistry and the Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Xu and his colleagues measured the\ninfection rate in adults and children during last\nyear's outbreak and analysed stool samples and\nthroat swabs taken from more than 18 000\npatients. Preliminary results suggest that the\ninfection rate is alarmingly high, meaning that\nthere are large populations of virus carriers who\ndo not show any symptoms of the disease.\n\nExperts are divided as to how worried the world\nshould be about the virus. Tom Solomon, a\nneurologist at the University of Liverpool, UK,\nargues that enterovirus 71 infection is\nunderappreciated on a global scale and may pose a\nbigger risk to public health than is currently\nthought. But Hans Troedsson, the World Health\nOrganization's representative in China, says\n\"there is no cause for alarm.\" The public-health\nimpact of hand, foot and mouth disease, including\ncases caused by enterovirus 71, is no more\nserious than other common childhood diseases, he\nsays.

Last\nweek, 553 people came down with the normally mild childhood disease\nthat usually causes fever and rashes on the hands, feet and buttocks.\nThat is just 12 fewer than the Health Ministry's official 'epidemic level.'\n\nThe tally last week was up from 415 over the previous 7 days, and\nhealth officials warn the numbers are likely to rise between now and\nOctober, traditionally a peak period for HFMD. This peak, though,\nusually affects fewer people than the 1st one from March to May, said\nDr. Lyn James, director of the Health Ministry's communicable\ndiseases division. The reasons for the peaks are not known.\n\nStill, the latest surge has already proven deadly. On 6 Aug 2008,\nSingapore registered its 1st death from HFMD [see: Hand, foot & mouth\ndisease - Asia (23): Singapore 20080808.2447] since a severe\noutbreak from 2000 to 2001 killed 7 children. Like most of those\nvictims, the 3-year-old child died from a severe form of HFMD caused by\na virus called EV71 [human enterovirus 71]. This virus has been of\nparticular concern to countries in Asia, which have been battling\noutbreaks of HFMD in recent years. This year, it has killed 44 in\nChina, 10 in Taiwan and 11 in Viet Nam.\n\nThe Health Ministry and the Regional Emerging Disease Intervention\n(Redi) Centre organised a 2-day regional forum on HFMD, which was\nattended by more than 80 scientists and public health officers from\n12 countries. At the forum's last day yesterday [25 Aug 2008], local\nvaccine company SingVax, Chinese vaccine company Sinovac Biotech and\nTaiwan's Centres for Disease Control gave updates on their progress\nin developing the world's first HFMD vaccine. Both SingVax and\nTaiwan's CDC said they have seen good results in the laboratories and\nhope to start clinical trials next year [2009].\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine, parents should ensure their children\nwash their hands, because the disease is often spread through saliva\nand faecal matter. They should also take their children to the doctor\nat the 1st sign of symptoms, and keep them away from schools and\ncrowded places, Dr. James said.\n\nMeanwhile, the school that the deceased child attended, Elias\nKindergarten in Woodlands, reopened earlier this week after a 10-day\nclosure to clean up. When The Straits Times visited yesterday, about\n20 to 30 children were in a queue waiting to have their teachers\ncheck their temperatures as well as hands and mouths to look for signs\nof HFMD.\n\n[Byline: Lee Hui Chieh and Ang Yiying]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As elsewhere in Asia the current outbreak of HFMD is predominantly a\nconsequence of enterovirus 71 infection.

EV71 has been associated with acute febrile\nillness, myocarditis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis,\nand encephalitis as well as with HFMD. Children under 5 years of age\nare particulalry susceptible to these conditions and may develop\npermanent neurological damage or, rarely, may succumb to these\ndisorders. The largest EV71 epidemic to date occurred in Taiwan in\n1998 with nearly 130 000 cases. Since then there have been recurrent\nHFMD epidemics of varying severity and intensity throughout the\nAsia-Pacific region. This year (2008) until recently Singapore has\nescaped the worst effects of the current outbreak, but this pattern\nmay be changing.

Last\nweek, 553 people came down with the normally mild childhood disease\nthat usually causes fever and rashes on the hands, feet and buttocks.\nThat is just 12 fewer than the Health Ministry's official 'epidemic level.'\n\nThe tally last week was up from 415 over the previous 7 days, and\nhealth officials warn the numbers are likely to rise between now and\nOctober, traditionally a peak period for HFMD. This peak, though,\nusually affects fewer people than the 1st one from March to May, said\nDr. Lyn James, director of the Health Ministry's communicable\ndiseases division. The reasons for the peaks are not known.\n\nStill, the latest surge has already proven deadly. On 6 Aug 2008,\nSingapore registered its 1st death from HFMD [see: Hand, foot & mouth\ndisease - Asia (23): Singapore 20080808.2447] since a severe\noutbreak from 2000 to 2001 killed 7 children. Like most of those\nvictims, the 3-year-old child died from a severe form of HFMD caused by\na virus called EV71 [human enterovirus 71]. This virus has been of\nparticular concern to countries in Asia, which have been battling\noutbreaks of HFMD in recent years. This year, it has killed 44 in\nChina, 10 in Taiwan and 11 in Viet Nam.\n\nThe Health Ministry and the Regional Emerging Disease Intervention\n(Redi) Centre organised a 2-day regional forum on HFMD, which was\nattended by more than 80 scientists and public health officers from\n12 countries. At the forum's last day yesterday [25 Aug 2008], local\nvaccine company SingVax, Chinese vaccine company Sinovac Biotech and\nTaiwan's Centres for Disease Control gave updates on their progress\nin developing the world's first HFMD vaccine. Both SingVax and\nTaiwan's CDC said they have seen good results in the laboratories and\nhope to start clinical trials next year [2009].\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine, parents should ensure their children\nwash their hands, because the disease is often spread through saliva\nand faecal matter. They should also take their children to the doctor\nat the 1st sign of symptoms, and keep them away from schools and\ncrowded places, Dr. James said.\n\nMeanwhile, the school that the deceased child attended, Elias\nKindergarten in Woodlands, reopened earlier this week after a 10-day\nclosure to clean up. When The Straits Times visited yesterday, about\n20 to 30 children were in a queue waiting to have their teachers\ncheck their temperatures as well as hands and mouths to look for signs\nof HFMD.\n\n[Byline: Lee Hui Chieh and Ang Yiying]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As elsewhere in Asia the current outbreak of HFMD is predominantly a\nconsequence of enterovirus 71 infection. The preceding report from\nSingapore suggested that the small HFMD outbreak in the country was\nwaning, but that inference may be premature.\n\nEnterovirus 71 (EV71) was initially identified in Calfornia in 1969\nand outbreaks of EV71 infection have been recorded throughout the\nworld since then. EV71 has been associated with acute febrile\nillness, myocarditis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis,\nand encephalitis as well as with HFMD. Children under 5 years of age\nare particulalry susceptible to these conditions and may develop\npermanent neurological damage or, rarely, may succumb to these\ndisorders. The largest EV71 epidemic to date occurred in Taiwan in\n1998 with nearly 130 000 cases.

Last\nweek, 553 people came down with the normally mild childhood disease\nthat usually causes fever and rashes on the hands, feet and buttocks.\nThat is just 12 fewer than the Health Ministry's official 'epidemic level.'\n\nThe tally last week was up from 415 over the previous 7 days, and\nhealth officials warn the numbers are likely to rise between now and\nOctober, traditionally a peak period for HFMD. This peak, though,\nusually affects fewer people than the 1st one from March to May, said\nDr. Lyn James, director of the Health Ministry's communicable\ndiseases division. The reasons for the peaks are not known.\n\nStill, the latest surge has already proven deadly. On 6 Aug 2008,\nSingapore registered its 1st death from HFMD [see: Hand, foot & mouth\ndisease - Asia (23): Singapore 20080808.2447] since a severe\noutbreak from 2000 to 2001 killed 7 children. Like most of those\nvictims, the 3-year-old child died from a severe form of HFMD caused by\na virus called EV71 [human enterovirus 71]. This virus has been of\nparticular concern to countries in Asia, which have been battling\noutbreaks of HFMD in recent years. This year, it has killed 44 in\nChina, 10 in Taiwan and 11 in Viet Nam.\n\nThe Health Ministry and the Regional Emerging Disease Intervention\n(Redi) Centre organised a 2-day regional forum on HFMD, which was\nattended by more than 80 scientists and public health officers from\n12 countries. At the forum's last day yesterday [25 Aug 2008], local\nvaccine company SingVax, Chinese vaccine company Sinovac Biotech and\nTaiwan's Centres for Disease Control gave updates on their progress\nin developing the world's first HFMD vaccine. Both SingVax and\nTaiwan's CDC said they have seen good results in the laboratories and\nhope to start clinical trials next year [2009].\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine, parents should ensure their children\nwash their hands, because the disease is often spread through saliva\nand faecal matter. They should also take their children to the doctor\nat the 1st sign of symptoms, and keep them away from schools and\ncrowded places, Dr. James said.\n\nMeanwhile, the school that the deceased child attended, Elias\nKindergarten in Woodlands, reopened earlier this week after a 10-day\nclosure to clean up. When The Straits Times visited yesterday, about\n20 to 30 children were in a queue waiting to have their teachers\ncheck their temperatures as well as hands and mouths to look for signs\nof HFMD.\n\n[Byline: Lee Hui Chieh and Ang Yiying]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As elsewhere in Asia the current outbreak of HFMD is predominantly a\nconsequence of enterovirus 71 infection. The preceding report from\nSingapore suggested that the small HFMD outbreak in the country was\nwaning, but that inference may be premature.\n\nEnterovirus 71 (EV71) was initially identified in Calfornia in 1969\nand outbreaks of EV71 infection have been recorded throughout the\nworld since then. EV71 has been associated with acute febrile\nillness, myocarditis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis,\nand encephalitis as well as with HFMD. Children under 5 years of age\nare particulalry susceptible to these conditions and may develop\npermanent neurological damage or, rarely, may succumb to these\ndisorders. The largest EV71 epidemic to date occurred in Taiwan in\n1998 with nearly 130 000 cases.

The Public Health Office in\nnorthern Lampang Province Friday [23 Nov 2007] ordered the Prachawit\nSchool to close its kindergarten classes after about 10 kids were\nfound to have contracted the disease, local news network \"The Nation\" reported.\n\nOn Thursday [22 Nov 2007], the office ordered Assumption School in\nLampang to close its kindergarten classes following the outbreak of\nthe disease.

It is a human disease unrelated to the\nfoot-and-mouth disease affecting ruminants and other animals. HFMD is\ncharacterised by fever and vesicles in the mouth and on distal\nextremities. Complications are uncommon in most outbreaks, but rare\nneurological damage has been associated with some outbreaks. HFMD is\nmoderately contagious. Infection is spread from person to person by\ndirect contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from\nblisters, or the stool of infected persons.

It is a human disease unrelated to the\nfoot-and-mouth disease affecting ruminants and other animals. HFMD is\ncharacterised by fever and vesicles in the mouth and on distal\nextremities. Complications are uncommon in most outbreaks, but rare\nneurological damage has been associated with some outbreaks. HFMD is\nmoderately contagious. Infection is spread from person to person by\ndirect contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from\nblisters, or the stool of infected persons. A child is most\ncontagious during the first week of the illness. Individual cases and\noutbreaks of HFMD occur worldwide, more frequently in summer and early autumn.\n\nA variety of enteric picornaviruses has been associated with HFMD,\nthe most frequently observed being Human coxsackievirus A16 and Human\nenterovirus 71. The etiologic agent in the current outbreak of HFMD\nin Thailand has not been determined as yet; previously a virus\nidentified as Echovirus type 11 was the cause of a HFMD outbreak in a\nhospital nursery in Thailand (Clin Infect Dis. 2005 Nov 1;41(9):\n1361-2).

The outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease\n(HFMD) began in late April 2007 in the city of Linyi in Shandong province,\nthe Xinhua News Agency said.\nAbout 470 patients had recovered by Friday [18 May 2007], and another 393\npeople -- mostly children -- were still sick, with more than half still in\nthe hospital, the Xinhua News Agency said, citing Bao Wenhui, the deputy\ndirector of the provincial health department.\nThe latest information was probably a response to media reports earlier\nthis week that said more than 2 dozen children had died and that there had\nbeen a cover-up. The reports also said the true figures had not been\nreleased to prevent public panic. Local health officials dismissed those\nreports as rumors.\nChina has in the past been accused of foot-dragging in releasing\ninformation about outbreaks of diseases such as bird flu and severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome, or SARS. A 2 year old girl diagnosed as a probable\nHFMD patient died on 29 Apr 2007, but no other deaths have been reported\nsince, Xinhua stated. HFMD is common in young children and is characterized\nby fever, mouth sores and a rash with blisters. It is not related to foot\nand mouth disease, which infects cattle, sheep and swine. The US Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes HFMD as mild and says\nnearly all patients recover in 7 to 10 days without medical treatment. But\n[rarely] the disease may also lead to more serious and fatal diseases such\nas encephalitis or a type of paralysis, according to CDC.\nXinhua said local health departments have launched a public awareness\ncampaign and quarantined children who are sick. Shandong [province]\nreported 2477 cases of HFMD in 2005, including one death, and 3030 cases in\n2006, 2 of which were fatal, the report said.\n--\ncommunicated by\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n[This thread is hereby now cut. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (Shandong) (02) 20070516.1560\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (Shandong) 20070514.1540\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Singapore 20070424.1338\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Sri Lanka (Colombo) 20070311.0869\n2006\n---\nHand, foot & mouth disease - India (Kerala) 20061024.3044\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20060907.2535\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak) (08) 20060821.2355\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak) (07) 20060730.2103\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak) (06) 20060725.2050\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak) (06) 20060717.1961\nHand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak) (05) 20060714.1946\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (HK), Malaysia (Sarawak) 20060711.1909\n..................cp/msp/sh\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Among the new cases reported up to 10 a.m. local\ntime (0200 GMT) on Sunday, 10 children have been hospitalized, said\nState Deputy Chief Minister George Chan. Six of the children were\nadmitted to the Miri hospital, 2 to the hospital in Bintulu and the\nrest in Sibu and Limbang, said Chan, who is also Chairman of the\nState Disaster Relief Management Committee.\nThe latest figure brought the total number of children infected since\nthe disease broke out early this year [2006] to 13 800, Chan said at\na news conference in Kuching, capital of the state. Throughout the\nstate, Sibu registered the highest number with 3025 cases, followed\nby Miri (2872), Kuching (2125), Bintulu (1761) and Sarikei (946). So\nfar, the disease has claimed 13 lives, including 7 who have tested\npositive for Enterovirus 71 (EV71).\nHFMD can be spread from person to person by direct contact with the\nnasal discharge, saliva, feces and fluid from the rash of an infected\nperson and indirectly by contaminated articles. Children are more\nvulnerable to the disease, while adults can carry the virus without\nshowing any symptoms of infection, said local health authorities.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[According to Podin et al. (BMC Public Health. 2006 Jul 7;6:18),\nsince 1997, Sarawak has experienced 3 major outbreaks of human\nenterovirus 71 infection, in 1997, 2000 and 2003.

An encouraging development was\nthat none of the enterovirus strains have mutated significantly, Hou said.\nAs the outbreak is expected to peak in 2 week's time, Hou urged medical\npersonnel and parents with young children to keep alert to prevent any\nfurther spread of the disease. Noting that enteroviruses are transmitted\nvia direct contact with secretions from an infected person or contact with\ncontaminated surfaces or objects, Hou said practicing good personal hygiene\nis critical to preventing infections.\n[Byline: Sofia Wu]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Hou Sheng-mao was quoted as saying that none of the enterovirus strains\n(isolated from the patients) have mutated significantly. Generally\nspeaking, genetic mutation of a viral genome takes place all the time. And\nit happens more readily in RNA viruses (such as EV71 in the family of\npciornaviridae) than in DNA viruses. However, in the context of the current\noutbreak, what Hou meant regarding absence of significant mutation was not\nelaborated, either by himself or by the media. What epidemiologists,\nclinicians and public health authorities are most concerned about are\npathogenicity and/or severity of the disease prior to medication and drug\nresistance of the causative agents responsible for the outbreak when\nsubjected for treatment. Since no unusual trend of the seasonal HFMD\nepidemic was noted, it could be implicated in the aspect of anti-EV71 drug\nresistance. Pyridyl imidazolidinone is a novel class of potent and\nselective human enterovirus 71 inhibitors which target enterovirus 71\ncapsid protein VP1. Site-directed mutagenesis of enterovirus 71 infectious\ncDNA revealed that a single amino acid alteration at the position 192 of\nVP1 can confer resistance to the inhibitory effects of the antiviral drug\n[see reference: Shin-Ru Shih et al.

Parents should look for bumps, some even blister-like,\non the palms of the hands, or on top or between the fingers, Cooney\nreported. Such bumps or blisters also can pop up on the tops of the feet.\nAnd mouth sores can show up on the gums, tongue and throat.\nSummit Pediatrics spokeswoman Dr. Robin Warner said on Monday that they've\nseen many children and taken numerous calls lately. She added that hand,\nfoot and mouth disease is a seasonal illness that usually spreads in\nchildren 6 months to 4 years old. It's also highly contagious, and moves\nthrough day-care groups quickly, Cooney reported.\n\"The fever is usually low-grade, and will last a few days, anywhere from\n100 to 102 degrees,\" she said. A children's fever reducer and pain reliever\nwill help. And when the fever's gone, children can go back to day-care or\nschool. But the mouth sores may need more attention, Cooney reported.\n\"What we usually recommend is a little antacid like Maalox or Mylanta in\nthe mouth,\" Warner said. \"On the younger (patients), you can get an oral\nsponge and kind of swish it around on the blisters.\"\nThe disease is difficult to prevent because the virus is airborne.

The outbreak is the most common cause of mouth sores that are\noften so painful that children won't want to eat. Consequently, they can\nbecome dehydrated. Parents should look for bumps, some even blister-like,\non the palms of the hands, or on top or between the fingers, Cooney\nreported. Such bumps or blisters also can pop up on the tops of the feet.\nAnd mouth sores can show up on the gums, tongue and throat.\nSummit Pediatrics spokeswoman Dr. Robin Warner said on Monday that they've\nseen many children and taken numerous calls lately. She added that hand,\nfoot and mouth disease is a seasonal illness that usually spreads in\nchildren 6 months to 4 years old. It's also highly contagious, and moves\nthrough day-care groups quickly, Cooney reported.\n\"The fever is usually low-grade, and will last a few days, anywhere from\n100 to 102 degrees,\" she said. A children's fever reducer and pain reliever\nwill help. And when the fever's gone, children can go back to day-care or\nschool. But the mouth sores may need more attention, Cooney reported.\n\"What we usually recommend is a little antacid like Maalox or Mylanta in\nthe mouth,\" Warner said. \"On the younger (patients), you can get an oral\nsponge and kind of swish it around on the blisters.\"\nThe disease is difficult to prevent because the virus is airborne.

Parents should look for bumps, some even blister-like,\non the palms of the hands, or on top or between the fingers, Cooney\nreported.

It's also highly contagious, and moves\nthrough day-care groups quickly, Cooney reported.\n\"The fever is usually low-grade, and will last a few days, anywhere from\n100 to 102 degrees,\" she said. A children's fever reducer and pain reliever\nwill help. And when the fever's gone, children can go back to day-care or\nschool. But the mouth sores may need more attention, Cooney reported.\n\"What we usually recommend is a little antacid like Maalox or Mylanta in\nthe mouth,\" Warner said. \"On the younger (patients), you can get an oral\nsponge and kind of swish it around on the blisters.\"\nThe disease is difficult to prevent because the virus is airborne.

The Star and New Straits Times reported that the boy\ndied on Tue 3 Oct 2000 in the southern city of Johor Baru, just across the\nborder from Singapore. Senior state health official Nooraini Baba was\nquoted by the Star as saying the results of blood tests were still awaited.\nBut she said the boy had symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease; i.e.,\nlesions on his hands, feet and around his mouth.\nIn Singapore, a total of 30 children have been hospitalized with the virus\nin the past week and doctors have reported a total of 408 children showing\nsymptoms of the disease since Sun 1 Oct 2000, when authorities ordered them\nto report all cases. The move followed the deaths on Saturday of a toddler\nand his 14- month-old sister. The 2 victims had rashes on their hands and\nmouth and foot ulcers. The 2 two-year-olds who died last month are also\nbelieved to have succumbed to the virus.\nChild-care centers and kindergartens remain closed across Singapore while a\ngovernment task force investigates the deaths. Hand, foot and mouth disease\nis a viral infection usually confined to children below 10 years of age and\nspread by direct contact with bodily fluids. The virus normally has only a\nmild impact on affected children but in certain cases can provoke a fatal\nreaction. An outbreak of the disease left 50 children dead in the Malaysian\nstate of Sarawak in 1997 and 78 died from the virus in Taiwan in 1998.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n......................jw/cp/ds\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The Ministry of Environment (MENV) has\nshut down the centre as a precautionary measure until further notice. The\ncondition of the 4 children is unknown because an investigation into the\noutbreak is on-going.\nThe MENV said in a statement last night that it was notified yesterday\nafternoon of the outbreak of the disease after investigations confirmed\nthat the death of the boy was linked to the disease. The boy had developed\na high fever and rashes on his body on Friday On Sunday afternoon, he\nstarted to vomit blood and he was taken to the Kandang Kerbau Women's and\nChildren's Hospital. Doctors pronounced the boy dead about 12 hours later.\nThe MENV is in the process of contacting parents of children who are\nenrolled at the centre to advise them to take their children to a doctor if\nthey suffer from symptoms of the disease. Symptoms include a fever lasting\nfor 2 to 3 days, a sore throat and runny nose, mouth ulcers and rashes.\nSufferers may also feel nauseous, weak and suffer from diarrhea. HFMD is\nnot serious usually, although it can cause rare complications which result\nin death, the MENV stated. It usually spreads through direct contact with\nbodily fluids of patients or items used by them. Those who want more\ninformation should call the Quarantine and Epidemiology Department on\n7319-758 or 7319-751.\n--\nDr. Hwee-Pin CHIA\nAssistant Professor\nDept of Community, Occupational and Family Medicine\nNational University of Singapore\n<cofchp@nus.edu.sg>\n[HFMD is predominantly a disease of childhood. It can be a consequence of\ninfection by Enterovirus 71 or one of several coxsackieviruses,\nCoxsackievirus A16 being the most common. Enterovirus 71 has been the most\nfrequent cause of HFMD in Southeast Asia and the Far East in recent years.\nTypical cases of HFMD exhibit vesicles and ulcers in the mouth, and a\nvesicular exanthema affecting the palms and soles of feet. The course of\nthe disease is usually mild and death is unusual. The vomiting of blood\ndescribed in this case suggests that other factors may have been involved.\nIt is not clear why HFMD is suspected in this case. Virus can be readily\nisolated from vesicular lesions and laboratory confirmation of infection is\nstraightforward. Further information is awaited. -Mod.CP\n.........................................cp/ds\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The Ministry of Environment (MENV) has\nshut down the centre as a precautionary measure until further notice. The\ncondition of the 4 children is unknown because an investigation into the\noutbreak is on-going.\nThe MENV said in a statement last night that it was notified yesterday\nafternoon of the outbreak of the disease after investigations confirmed\nthat the death of the boy was linked to the disease. The boy had developed\na high fever and rashes on his body on Friday On Sunday afternoon, he\nstarted to vomit blood and he was taken to the Kandang Kerbau Women's and\nChildren's Hospital. Doctors pronounced the boy dead about 12 hours later.\nThe MENV is in the process of contacting parents of children who are\nenrolled at the centre to advise them to take their children to a doctor if\nthey suffer from symptoms of the disease. Symptoms include a fever lasting\nfor 2 to 3 days, a sore throat and runny nose, mouth ulcers and rashes.\nSufferers may also feel nauseous, weak and suffer from diarrhea. HFMD is\nnot serious usually, although it can cause rare complications which result\nin death, the MENV stated. It usually spreads through direct contact with\nbodily fluids of patients or items used by them. Those who want more\ninformation should call the Quarantine and Epidemiology Department on\n7319-758 or 7319-751.\n--\nDr. Hwee-Pin CHIA\nAssistant Professor\nDept of Community, Occupational and Family Medicine\nNational University of Singapore\n<cofchp@nus.edu.sg>\n[HFMD is predominantly a disease of childhood. It can be a consequence of\ninfection by Enterovirus 71 or one of several coxsackieviruses,\nCoxsackievirus A16 being the most common. Enterovirus 71 has been the most\nfrequent cause of HFMD in Southeast Asia and the Far East in recent years.\nTypical cases of HFMD exhibit vesicles and ulcers in the mouth, and a\nvesicular exanthema affecting the palms and soles of feet. The course of\nthe disease is usually mild and death is unusual. The vomiting of blood\ndescribed in this case suggests that other factors may have been involved.\nIt is not clear why HFMD is suspected in this case. Virus can be readily\nisolated from vesicular lesions and laboratory confirmation of infection is\nstraightforward.

Vadivale <vale@pop.jaring.my>\nSource: Straits Times <http://straitstimes.asia1.com/pages/sin6_0627.html>\n[edited - ES\n\nA 2-1/2-year-old Singapore boy has died of severe complications from hand,\nfoot and mouth disease, the first death of its kind here since 1993.\nThe disease is caused by a virus that is from the same family as\nenterovirus 71, which is linked to the deaths of 50 children in Taiwan.\nHowever, the boy and his family have not travelled to Taiwan recently, so\nhealth authorities believe the death may be a sporadic case of hand, foot\nand mouth disease with severe complications.\nThe Health (MOH) and Environment (ENV) ministries said in a joint statement\nyesterday that it will take one to four weeks for laboratory tests to\nconfirm which virus was responsible for the infection. In the meantime,\nthey have taken several steps: Doctors have been alerted to look out for\nsuch cases, refer serious ones to a hospital and notify ENV's Quarantine\nand Epidemiology Department. All hospitals have been alerted and are\nprepared to handle patients with severe hand, foot and mouth disease.\nGuidelines for collecting and handling specimens for laboratory testing\nhave been issued to all hospitals and paediatricians. Child-care centres\nand kindergartens have been told to maintain high hygiene and health\nstandards.\nWhile the World Health Organisation has not called for travel restrictions\nto Taiwan, health authorities here suggest taking precautions, such as\npractising a high standard of hygiene and avoiding crowded places and the\nsharing of personal items.\nTouching on the case of the dead boy, Dr Phua Kong Boo, clinical head,\npaediatric medicine at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said that\nthe boy suffered from a fever, mouth ulcers and was vomiting on June 16.\nBy June 18, he became very drowsy. A day later he was breathless and taken\nto a hospital. He went into a fit, collapsed and was taken to KK in a\ncritical condition, later the same day.\nHe was diagnosed to have enterovirus infection with complications of\nencephalitis and myocarditis. His condition did not improve and he died on\nThursday. Investigations showed that two cousins and an elder sister had\nrecovered from similar but mild infections, several days to about six weeks\nbefore the boy came down with the symptoms.\nDr Phua added that the disease in its mild form is very common. According\nto MOH, there were 358 cases last year and 290 so far this year. MOH added\nthat it has not detected any case of enterovirus 71 infection here so far\nthis year.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n......................................jw/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
