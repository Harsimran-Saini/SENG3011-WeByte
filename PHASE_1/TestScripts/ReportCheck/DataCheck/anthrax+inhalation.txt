A sample is sent to the Pennsylvania Department of Health\nfor further testing.\n21 Feb: The Pennsylvania Dept of Health detects anthrax, and a public\nhealth investigation begins. Officials notify the New York City\nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Centers for Disease\nControl & Prevention, and the F.B.I. The CDC receives a sample for\nits own testing.\n22 Feb: The CDC confirms the diagnosis of anthrax. New York City\nofficials announce that Mr Diomande has inhalation anthrax. They say\nthey have sealed his workplace in Brooklyn and his apartment building\nin the West Village. Officials suggest that the case is isolated, and\ndiscount terrorism. At least 3 other people are given antibiotics.\n[2] Possible prior exposure:\nDr. Melanie A. MacLennan, a friend and personal physician of Mr.\nDiomande, said she believed that he had been infected with anthrax\noverseas in the past. In December 2003, she said, he was hospitalized\nfor 6 weeks in the Netherlands with a skin infection so severe that\nhe had to receive several skin grafts on his left thigh. She said he\nprobably contracted the bacteria in Africa. \"When he became ill in\n2003, in the Netherlands with a serious skin infection, his friends\nworried whether he would live. He was deathly ill, almost to the\npoint where people didn't think he was going to survive,\" Ms. Becker\nsaid. \"He was very, very, very sick. Somehow he came through it, and\nis back in tiptop form.\"\n[3] Hide handling by Diomande:\nIn his work as a maker of drums, Mr. Diomande has used both domestic\nand imported skins, but he and his relatives have told investigators\nthat he worked with the imported skins in the Brooklyn warehouse in\nthe days preceding his trip to Pennsylvania.\nHe made the drums by \"soaking the hide and then stretching and\nscraping it to remove the hair, which is potentially a scenario where\nhe could aerosolize any spores,\" said Dr. Lisa Rotz, a medical\nepidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in\nAtlanta. [This is the traditional means of removing hair from a\nsun-dried hide. - Mod.MHJ] [But] Mr. Diomande told investigators that\nhe uses a razor to strip off the hair, then pours water over it so he\ncan more easily manipulate the skin.\nIn fact, the [CDC] officials said they could not rule out the\npossibility that the germs had come from some of the domestic animal\nskins that Mr. Diomande also worked with in his Brooklyn warehouse.\nThe authorities were just beginning their search and examination of\nthe musician's warehouse and his Manhattan home last night.\nEven though Mr. Diomande might have traveled across the city with\ncontaminated hides, officials said that it likely took aggressive\nhandling to release enough anthrax spores to do any damage. The\nprocess of making a drum is ideal for such a release.\n[4] Hide importation:\nMayor Bloomberg and officials in Pennsylvania said the chain of\nevents leading to Mr. Diomande's illness began on 21 Dec 2005, when\nhe returned from a 2-week trip to Ivory Coast. There, he obtained raw\nanimal hides to bring home with him, the mayor said. A city official\nwho is close to the investigation and spoke on the condition of\nanonymity because of the sensitivity of the case said Mr. Diomande\narrived at Kennedy International Airport with 4 goat skins and took\nthem in suitcases directly to his studio in Brooklyn. The skins were\nprobably never taken to his Manhattan apartment, the official said. A\nrelative disputed the officials' account. \"I think the officials are\nconfused,\" said a brother-in-law, Alexander Harman, 43, a computer\nanimator in Jersey City. \"He is not importing, by hand this quantity\nof skins. I've always understood that he buys them from local\ndistributors, and I am positive that he does not carry skins through\ncustoms himself. They are heavy, and he goes through sometimes 100 in\na month. He's only made 2 trips to Africa in the last 14 years.\"\nMark J. Mershon, the assistant director in charge of the F.B.I. field\noffice in New York City, said there was no indication that the skins\nwere smuggled into the country.\n[5] Official Responses:\n(a) NYC Building:\nYesterday [22 Feb.] morning, federal authorities concluded\ndefinitively that Mr. Diomande had inhalational anthrax. About 5 p.m.\nyesterday, federal agents, police officers, firefighters and other\ncity workers surrounded Mr. Diomande's apartment building at 31\nDowning Street in the West Village of Manhattan and the warehouse at\n2 Prince Street, near the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn,\nwhere he used animal skins to make drums for his dance troupe and for\nother musicians. Mr. Diomande's 5th-floor apartment was sealed.\nResidents on the first 4 floors were allowed to enter the building.\nThe officials set up a command post near the warehouse, an 8-story\nbuilding, and police cordoned off the area as workers -- some\ncarrying radiation detectors, others wearing protective suits --\nprepared for a floor-to-floor search.\nAt 8:30 p.m. [22 Feb], Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman, said the\ntests at both the apartment building and the warehouse were complete\nand showed no evidence that anthrax had been produced there. Outside\nMr. Diomande's apartment building, city health officials distributed\nfliers saying the residents were not \"at risk for anthrax,\" but\nfederal officials said they were actively investigating whether any\nof the hides were passed along to others.\nThe warehouse, identified as Pinnacle Storage on a sign, is mostly\nused for storage, but parts of several floors have been converted to\nrecording and art studios and other commercial uses over the past\nyear or so, according to occupants.\n(b) USDA/APHIS:\nOfficials with the United States Department of Agriculture said no\nanimals or animal products are allowed into the country from Africa.\nCustoms officials said agents generally questioned anyone trying to\nimport animal skins and seized any untanned or partially tanned hides.\nAmong the animals plagued by anthrax are goats, which are prized for\ntheir skins. When stretched tight, those skins provide the perfect\nacoustical top for a drum. And that most pre-modern of instruments is\nwildly popular in the most modern of cities, sold on street corners\nfrom London to New York. It is through this bit of commerce, the\nauthorities now suspect, that the germ was brought to New York in\nDecember 2005, lurking in the hairs of a hide that was carried in a\nsuitcase through Kennedy International Airport by an unsuspecting\nAfrican musician. Now, officials are investigating how that musician,\nVado Diomande, was able to transport infected animal carcasses\nthousands of miles without being detected.\nRegulations on the importation of animals or animal byproducts from\nAfrica are clear, said Teresa Howes, a spokeswoman for the United\nStates Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Inspection\nService. \"We restrict the importation of animal product from\nslaughtered animals, including hides, skins, wool, hair, and bristles\nfrom countries where anthrax infections occur,\" she said, noting that\nshe was based in Colorado and not familiar with the details of Mr.\nDiomande's case. \"African animals and animal byproducts are\nprohibited entry into this country entirely.\"\nJudging, however, by even a cursory survey of the brisk trade among\nsidewalk vendors, shop owners and Internet vendors in drums made with\nAfrican animal skins, it seems to be a difficult ban to enforce.\nThe agency responsible for regulating the importation of animal\nskins, along with the Agriculture Department, is Customs and Border\nProtection, part of the Department of Homeland Security. \"If you're\ntrying to come into the country and you have animal skins, we're\ngoing to question you about your use of them,\" said Kelly Klundt, a\nspokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection. The goal, she said, is\nto determine whether the goods are illegal and whether they pose any\ndanger. [Note the FBI comment above.]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[It would seem that Mr. Diomande's good fortune may have resulted\nfrom a prior exposure in 2003. The print version has him having a\nskin transplant to his thigh at some point in the Netherlands in\n2003. It is not unusual for physicians without prior experience\nattending a cutaneous anthrax case to see the grossly inflamed\noedematous lesion as worse than it is and resort to surgery. Left to\nthemselves and antibiotics, cutaneous lesions do heal well if slowly.\nIn the weeks to come we will hear much about the official speed or\nlack of it in responding to this incident.\nHaiti has long been recognised as a source of anthrax-contaminated\ngoat hides for drums. We can clearly add West Africa to this list of\nrisky sources. Regardless of what is said, the USDA's major concern\nregarding importing raw animal products is not anthrax but serious\ncontagious diseases such as foot & mouth. Until the industry went\nabroad, New England imported enormous volumes of hides, hair, and\nwool for processing, with resultant risks to downstream livestock\nfrom the contaminated washwater. Since that industry shut down in the\n1960s, anthrax has disappeared from the eastern states.

He is taken to Solders & Sailors\nMemorial Hospital in Wellsboro, PA.\n17 Feb: The hospital takes a blood sample to determine if Mr Diomande\nhas an infection.\n18 Feb: Mr Diomande is transferred from Solders & Sailors Memorial\nHospital to Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA.\n20 Feb: The samples of Mr. Diomande's blood begin to show signs of\nanthrax. A sample is sent to the Pennsylvania Department of Health\nfor further testing.\n21 Feb: The Pennsylvania Dept of Health detects anthrax, and a public\nhealth investigation begins. Officials notify the New York City\nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Centers for Disease\nControl & Prevention, and the F.B.I. The CDC receives a sample for\nits own testing.\n22 Feb: The CDC confirms the diagnosis of anthrax. New York City\nofficials announce that Mr Diomande has inhalation anthrax. They say\nthey have sealed his workplace in Brooklyn and his apartment building\nin the West Village. Officials suggest that the case is isolated, and\ndiscount terrorism. At least 3 other people are given antibiotics.\n[2] Possible prior exposure:\nDr. Melanie A. MacLennan, a friend and personal physician of Mr.\nDiomande, said she believed that he had been infected with anthrax\noverseas in the past. In December 2003, she said, he was hospitalized\nfor 6 weeks in the Netherlands with a skin infection so severe that\nhe had to receive several skin grafts on his left thigh. She said he\nprobably contracted the bacteria in Africa. \"When he became ill in\n2003, in the Netherlands with a serious skin infection, his friends\nworried whether he would live. He was deathly ill, almost to the\npoint where people didn't think he was going to survive,\" Ms. Becker\nsaid. \"He was very, very, very sick. Somehow he came through it, and\nis back in tiptop form.\"\n[3] Hide handling by Diomande:\nIn his work as a maker of drums, Mr. Diomande has used both domestic\nand imported skins, but he and his relatives have told investigators\nthat he worked with the imported skins in the Brooklyn warehouse in\nthe days preceding his trip to Pennsylvania.\nHe made the drums by \"soaking the hide and then stretching and\nscraping it to remove the hair, which is potentially a scenario where\nhe could aerosolize any spores,\" said Dr. Lisa Rotz, a medical\nepidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in\nAtlanta. [This is the traditional means of removing hair from a\nsun-dried hide. - Mod.MHJ] [But] Mr. Diomande told investigators that\nhe uses a razor to strip off the hair, then pours water over it so he\ncan more easily manipulate the skin.\nIn fact, the [CDC] officials said they could not rule out the\npossibility that the germs had come from some of the domestic animal\nskins that Mr. Diomande also worked with in his Brooklyn warehouse.\nThe authorities were just beginning their search and examination of\nthe musician's warehouse and his Manhattan home last night.\nEven though Mr. Diomande might have traveled across the city with\ncontaminated hides, officials said that it likely took aggressive\nhandling to release enough anthrax spores to do any damage. The\nprocess of making a drum is ideal for such a release.\n[4] Hide importation:\nMayor Bloomberg and officials in Pennsylvania said the chain of\nevents leading to Mr. Diomande's illness began on 21 Dec 2005, when\nhe returned from a 2-week trip to Ivory Coast. There, he obtained raw\nanimal hides to bring home with him, the mayor said. A city official\nwho is close to the investigation and spoke on the condition of\nanonymity because of the sensitivity of the case said Mr. Diomande\narrived at Kennedy International Airport with 4 goat skins and took\nthem in suitcases directly to his studio in Brooklyn. The skins were\nprobably never taken to his Manhattan apartment, the official said. A\nrelative disputed the officials' account. \"I think the officials are\nconfused,\" said a brother-in-law, Alexander Harman, 43, a computer\nanimator in Jersey City. \"He is not importing, by hand this quantity\nof skins. I've always understood that he buys them from local\ndistributors, and I am positive that he does not carry skins through\ncustoms himself. They are heavy, and he goes through sometimes 100 in\na month. He's only made 2 trips to Africa in the last 14 years.\"\nMark J. Mershon, the assistant director in charge of the F.B.I. field\noffice in New York City, said there was no indication that the skins\nwere smuggled into the country.\n[5] Official Responses:\n(a) NYC Building:\nYesterday [22 Feb.] morning, federal authorities concluded\ndefinitively that Mr. Diomande had inhalational anthrax. About 5 p.m.\nyesterday, federal agents, police officers, firefighters and other\ncity workers surrounded Mr. Diomande's apartment building at 31\nDowning Street in the West Village of Manhattan and the warehouse at\n2 Prince Street, near the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn,\nwhere he used animal skins to make drums for his dance troupe and for\nother musicians. Mr. Diomande's 5th-floor apartment was sealed.\nResidents on the first 4 floors were allowed to enter the building.\nThe officials set up a command post near the warehouse, an 8-story\nbuilding, and police cordoned off the area as workers -- some\ncarrying radiation detectors, others wearing protective suits --\nprepared for a floor-to-floor search.\nAt 8:30 p.m. [22 Feb], Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman, said the\ntests at both the apartment building and the warehouse were complete\nand showed no evidence that anthrax had been produced there. Outside\nMr. Diomande's apartment building, city health officials distributed\nfliers saying the residents were not \"at risk for anthrax,\" but\nfederal officials said they were actively investigating whether any\nof the hides were passed along to others.\nThe warehouse, identified as Pinnacle Storage on a sign, is mostly\nused for storage, but parts of several floors have been converted to\nrecording and art studios and other commercial uses over the past\nyear or so, according to occupants.\n(b) USDA/APHIS:\nOfficials with the United States Department of Agriculture said no\nanimals or animal products are allowed into the country from Africa.\nCustoms officials said agents generally questioned anyone trying to\nimport animal skins and seized any untanned or partially tanned hides.\nAmong the animals plagued by anthrax are goats, which are prized for\ntheir skins. When stretched tight, those skins provide the perfect\nacoustical top for a drum. And that most pre-modern of instruments is\nwildly popular in the most modern of cities, sold on street corners\nfrom London to New York. It is through this bit of commerce, the\nauthorities now suspect, that the germ was brought to New York in\nDecember 2005, lurking in the hairs of a hide that was carried in a\nsuitcase through Kennedy International Airport by an unsuspecting\nAfrican musician. Now, officials are investigating how that musician,\nVado Diomande, was able to transport infected animal carcasses\nthousands of miles without being detected.\nRegulations on the importation of animals or animal byproducts from\nAfrica are clear, said Teresa Howes, a spokeswoman for the United\nStates Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Inspection\nService. \"We restrict the importation of animal product from\nslaughtered animals, including hides, skins, wool, hair, and bristles\nfrom countries where anthrax infections occur,\" she said, noting that\nshe was based in Colorado and not familiar with the details of Mr.\nDiomande's case. \"African animals and animal byproducts are\nprohibited entry into this country entirely.\"\nJudging, however, by even a cursory survey of the brisk trade among\nsidewalk vendors, shop owners and Internet vendors in drums made with\nAfrican animal skins, it seems to be a difficult ban to enforce.\nThe agency responsible for regulating the importation of animal\nskins, along with the Agriculture Department, is Customs and Border\nProtection, part of the Department of Homeland Security. \"If you're\ntrying to come into the country and you have animal skins, we're\ngoing to question you about your use of them,\" said Kelly Klundt, a\nspokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection. The goal, she said, is\nto determine whether the goods are illegal and whether they pose any\ndanger. [Note the FBI comment above.]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[It would seem that Mr. Diomande's good fortune may have resulted\nfrom a prior exposure in 2003. The print version has him having a\nskin transplant to his thigh at some point in the Netherlands in\n2003. It is not unusual for physicians without prior experience\nattending a cutaneous anthrax case to see the grossly inflamed\noedematous lesion as worse than it is and resort to surgery. Left to\nthemselves and antibiotics, cutaneous lesions do heal well if slowly.\nIn the weeks to come we will hear much about the official speed or\nlack of it in responding to this incident.\nHaiti has long been recognised as a source of anthrax-contaminated\ngoat hides for drums. We can clearly add West Africa to this list of\nrisky sources. Regardless of what is said, the USDA's major concern\nregarding importing raw animal products is not anthrax but serious\ncontagious diseases such as foot & mouth. Until the industry went\nabroad, New England imported enormous volumes of hides, hair, and\nwool for processing, with resultant risks to downstream livestock\nfrom the contaminated washwater. Since that industry shut down in the\n1960s, anthrax has disappeared from the eastern states.

He is taken to Solders & Sailors\nMemorial Hospital in Wellsboro, PA.\n17 Feb: The hospital takes a blood sample to determine if Mr Diomande\nhas an infection.\n18 Feb: Mr Diomande is transferred from Solders & Sailors Memorial\nHospital to Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA.\n20 Feb: The samples of Mr. Diomande's blood begin to show signs of\nanthrax. A sample is sent to the Pennsylvania Department of Health\nfor further testing.\n21 Feb: The Pennsylvania Dept of Health detects anthrax, and a public\nhealth investigation begins. Officials notify the New York City\nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Centers for Disease\nControl & Prevention, and the F.B.I. The CDC receives a sample for\nits own testing.\n22 Feb: The CDC confirms the diagnosis of anthrax. New York City\nofficials announce that Mr Diomande has inhalation anthrax. They say\nthey have sealed his workplace in Brooklyn and his apartment building\nin the West Village. Officials suggest that the case is isolated, and\ndiscount terrorism. At least 3 other people are given antibiotics.\n[2] Possible prior exposure:\nDr. Melanie A. MacLennan, a friend and personal physician of Mr.\nDiomande, said she believed that he had been infected with anthrax\noverseas in the past. In December 2003, she said, he was hospitalized\nfor 6 weeks in the Netherlands with a skin infection so severe that\nhe had to receive several skin grafts on his left thigh. She said he\nprobably contracted the bacteria in Africa. \"When he became ill in\n2003, in the Netherlands with a serious skin infection, his friends\nworried whether he would live. He was deathly ill, almost to the\npoint where people didn't think he was going to survive,\" Ms. Becker\nsaid. \"He was very, very, very sick. Somehow he came through it, and\nis back in tiptop form.\"\n[3] Hide handling by Diomande:\nIn his work as a maker of drums, Mr. Diomande has used both domestic\nand imported skins, but he and his relatives have told investigators\nthat he worked with the imported skins in the Brooklyn warehouse in\nthe days preceding his trip to Pennsylvania.\nHe made the drums by \"soaking the hide and then stretching and\nscraping it to remove the hair, which is potentially a scenario where\nhe could aerosolize any spores,\" said Dr. Lisa Rotz, a medical\nepidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in\nAtlanta. [This is the traditional means of removing hair from a\nsun-dried hide. - Mod.MHJ] [But] Mr. Diomande told investigators that\nhe uses a razor to strip off the hair, then pours water over it so he\ncan more easily manipulate the skin.\nIn fact, the [CDC] officials said they could not rule out the\npossibility that the germs had come from some of the domestic animal\nskins that Mr. Diomande also worked with in his Brooklyn warehouse.\nThe authorities were just beginning their search and examination of\nthe musician's warehouse and his Manhattan home last night.\nEven though Mr. Diomande might have traveled across the city with\ncontaminated hides, officials said that it likely took aggressive\nhandling to release enough anthrax spores to do any damage. The\nprocess of making a drum is ideal for such a release.\n[4] Hide importation:\nMayor Bloomberg and officials in Pennsylvania said the chain of\nevents leading to Mr. Diomande's illness began on 21 Dec 2005, when\nhe returned from a 2-week trip to Ivory Coast. There, he obtained raw\nanimal hides to bring home with him, the mayor said. A city official\nwho is close to the investigation and spoke on the condition of\nanonymity because of the sensitivity of the case said Mr. Diomande\narrived at Kennedy International Airport with 4 goat skins and took\nthem in suitcases directly to his studio in Brooklyn. The skins were\nprobably never taken to his Manhattan apartment, the official said. A\nrelative disputed the officials' account. \"I think the officials are\nconfused,\" said a brother-in-law, Alexander Harman, 43, a computer\nanimator in Jersey City. \"He is not importing, by hand this quantity\nof skins. I've always understood that he buys them from local\ndistributors, and I am positive that he does not carry skins through\ncustoms himself. They are heavy, and he goes through sometimes 100 in\na month. He's only made 2 trips to Africa in the last 14 years.\"\nMark J. Mershon, the assistant director in charge of the F.B.I. field\noffice in New York City, said there was no indication that the skins\nwere smuggled into the country.\n[5] Official Responses:\n(a) NYC Building:\nYesterday [22 Feb.] morning, federal authorities concluded\ndefinitively that Mr. Diomande had inhalational anthrax. About 5 p.m.\nyesterday, federal agents, police officers, firefighters and other\ncity workers surrounded Mr. Diomande's apartment building at 31\nDowning Street in the West Village of Manhattan and the warehouse at\n2 Prince Street, near the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn,\nwhere he used animal skins to make drums for his dance troupe and for\nother musicians. Mr. Diomande's 5th-floor apartment was sealed.\nResidents on the first 4 floors were allowed to enter the building.\nThe officials set up a command post near the warehouse, an 8-story\nbuilding, and police cordoned off the area as workers -- some\ncarrying radiation detectors, others wearing protective suits --\nprepared for a floor-to-floor search.\nAt 8:30 p.m. [22 Feb], Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman, said the\ntests at both the apartment building and the warehouse were complete\nand showed no evidence that anthrax had been produced there. Outside\nMr. Diomande's apartment building, city health officials distributed\nfliers saying the residents were not \"at risk for anthrax,\" but\nfederal officials said they were actively investigating whether any\nof the hides were passed along to others.\nThe warehouse, identified as Pinnacle Storage on a sign, is mostly\nused for storage, but parts of several floors have been converted to\nrecording and art studios and other commercial uses over the past\nyear or so, according to occupants.\n(b) USDA/APHIS:\nOfficials with the United States Department of Agriculture said no\nanimals or animal products are allowed into the country from Africa.\nCustoms officials said agents generally questioned anyone trying to\nimport animal skins and seized any untanned or partially tanned hides.\nAmong the animals plagued by anthrax are goats, which are prized for\ntheir skins. When stretched tight, those skins provide the perfect\nacoustical top for a drum. And that most pre-modern of instruments is\nwildly popular in the most modern of cities, sold on street corners\nfrom London to New York. It is through this bit of commerce, the\nauthorities now suspect, that the germ was brought to New York in\nDecember 2005, lurking in the hairs of a hide that was carried in a\nsuitcase through Kennedy International Airport by an unsuspecting\nAfrican musician. Now, officials are investigating how that musician,\nVado Diomande, was able to transport infected animal carcasses\nthousands of miles without being detected.\nRegulations on the importation of animals or animal byproducts from\nAfrica are clear, said Teresa Howes, a spokeswoman for the United\nStates Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Inspection\nService. \"We restrict the importation of animal product from\nslaughtered animals, including hides, skins, wool, hair, and bristles\nfrom countries where anthrax infections occur,\" she said, noting that\nshe was based in Colorado and not familiar with the details of Mr.\nDiomande's case. \"African animals and animal byproducts are\nprohibited entry into this country entirely.\"\nJudging, however, by even a cursory survey of the brisk trade among\nsidewalk vendors, shop owners and Internet vendors in drums made with\nAfrican animal skins, it seems to be a difficult ban to enforce.\nThe agency responsible for regulating the importation of animal\nskins, along with the Agriculture Department, is Customs and Border\nProtection, part of the Department of Homeland Security. \"If you're\ntrying to come into the country and you have animal skins, we're\ngoing to question you about your use of them,\" said Kelly Klundt, a\nspokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection. The goal, she said, is\nto determine whether the goods are illegal and whether they pose any\ndanger. [Note the FBI comment above.]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[It would seem that Mr. Diomande's good fortune may have resulted\nfrom a prior exposure in 2003. The print version has him having a\nskin transplant to his thigh at some point in the Netherlands in\n2003. It is not unusual for physicians without prior experience\nattending a cutaneous anthrax case to see the grossly inflamed\noedematous lesion as worse than it is and resort to surgery. Left to\nthemselves and antibiotics, cutaneous lesions do heal well if slowly.\nIn the weeks to come we will hear much about the official speed or\nlack of it in responding to this incident.\nHaiti has long been recognised as a source of anthrax-contaminated\ngoat hides for drums. We can clearly add West Africa to this list of\nrisky sources. Regardless of what is said, the USDA's major concern\nregarding importing raw animal products is not anthrax but serious\ncontagious diseases such as foot & mouth. Until the industry went\nabroad, New England imported enormous volumes of hides, hair, and\nwool for processing, with resultant risks to downstream livestock\nfrom the contaminated washwater. Since that industry shut down in the\n1960s, anthrax has disappeared from the eastern states.
