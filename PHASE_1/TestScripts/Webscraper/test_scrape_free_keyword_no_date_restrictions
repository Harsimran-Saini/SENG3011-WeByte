A smaller percentage tested positive for _Anaplasma_ and _Babesia_, 2 other causes of common tick-borne diseases.\n\nIn addition to providing information about the prevalence of tick-borne diseases in Maine, the report gives a picture of where and when people are encountering ticks throughout the state.\n\n'This will serve as a sort of baseline to make comparisons as we move forward, to see how fast [ticks] are spreading and establishing new populations throughout Maine,' said Griffin Dill, who manages the Tick Lab, located in the new UMaine Cooperative Extension Diagnostic and Research Laboratory in Orono.\n\nThis is a first-of-its-kind study for Maine. With additional data points in future years, it will give researchers a clearer look at the ticks roaming Maine, the types of diseases they carry and how this could impact Maine residents. They will also be able to see how tick populations and risks vary from year to year, allowing for better predictions of tick season outcomes.\n\nThe new report summarizes information that was gathered by the lab in 2019, which is the 1st year that the lab accepted tick samples from the public to test for tick-borne pathogens. It's free to send in ticks for identification. For USD 15, Maine residents could have deer ticks tested for causative agents of Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis -- the 3 most common tick-borne diseases in Maine.\n\nA total of 2697 ticks were submitted to the lab in 2019. The samples came from 358 towns, including ones from each of the state's 16 counties.\n\nThe majority of the submissions -- 2056 specimens -- were identified as deer ticks, and these were tested for disease. According to the report, 759 (38.8%) of the deer ticks tested positive for Lyme disease. About 8% tested positive for _Anaplasma_. And about 6% tested positive for _Babesia_.\n\nAmerican dog ticks also made up a significant portion of the submissions, with 585 specimens. In addition, 37 woodchuck ticks, 10 lone star ticks, one squirrel tick and one mouse tick were sent to the lab in 2019.\n\nThese species were not tested for diseases in 2019. But in 2020, the lab plans to expand the program and start testing American dog ticks and lone star ticks for the causative agents of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis and tularemia. The lab also plans to start testing deer ticks for _Borrelia miyamotoi_, which is similar to Lyme disease and has been diagnosed in Maine residents.\n\n'The woodchuck tick is a little bit of an issue in that it's known to transmit Powassan virus,' Dill said. 'Unfortunately we aren't going to be testing for Powassan virus this coming year. It's an entirely different type of testing that needs to be done for that.'\n\nCollecting information from the public in this way is called 'passive surveillance' and can potentially result in a bias toward certain geographic locations.\n\n'We're relying on people to actually find the ticks and send them in. We're not actually going out and systematically searching the entire state,' Dill said. 'That can lead to some biases in the information itself. For example, you'll notice there is some clustering around Bangor and the Orono area. That's where our lab is located, so it's easier to bring in a tick around there.'\n\nNevertheless, Dill said that the maps generated for the report give a fairly good representation of where ticks and tick-borne diseases are found in Maine.\n\nThe report also includes information gathered from the survey that people fill out before sending in a tick for testing. This survey includes questions about where the ticks are found (often on a human body) and under what circumstances.\n\n'We wanted to know a little bit about how ticks are behaving on the body,' Dill said. 'That generated some interesting information about the difference of how ticks attach on adults versus children, which we somewhat expected.'\n\nThe data show that ticks were more frequently found higher on the bodies of children than adults. Dill believes this is because children are shorter, so ticks have less of a distance to travel to reach areas like the neck and head.\n\nIn addition, the report includes what activities people were engaged in when they encountered ticks. 'Gardening-yard work' was the most common activity by far, accounting for about 38% of the ticks sent to the lab. 'Walking' came in second, accounting for about 20% of the ticks.\n\nFurthermore, the report showed when people encountered ticks in Maine in 2019. The data showed that Maine residents found the most adult deer ticks in late October and early November, with a smaller peak in April and May. Nymph deer ticks, which are smaller and younger than adult deer ticks, peaked in June and early July. And the number of American dog ticks found peaked in early summer, then dropped off.\n\nThe full report can be found at https://extension.umaine.edu/ticks/, where you can also learn how to submit a tick for testing.\n\nThe USD 15 test for tick-borne pathogens will continue to be available to the public for 2020. In addition, the public can send ticks to the lab for free identification, a service that the lab has offered for several years. The lab also plans to increase field monitoring for disease-carrying ticks throughout Maine.\n\n[Byline: Aislinn Sarnacki]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When a larva of the tick _Ixodes scapularis_ feeds on an infected rodent, after molting to nymph it can transmit the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the causative agent of Lyme disease) to the next host it feeds on. Adult ticks can also transmit the pathogen if they fed on infected rodents at an earlier stage. A prevalence near 40% is high, and it means that there are many infected white-footed mice (_Peromyscus leucopus_) on which ticks fed in their prior life stage. White-footed mice are the reservoir of _B. burgdorferi_. If ticks feed predominantly on that host, infection rates in ticks are to rise. When the rodent community is richer (i.e., it is composed by more rodent species), ticks are less likely to feed on infected white-footed mice and the prevalence may decrease. This is known as the 'dilution' effect. It would be interesting to link these surveillance efforts to studies on the community of mammals that are hosts to _I. scapularis_. - Mod.PMB\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106\nMaine, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/222]",

'Investigations are still being carried out and authorities cannot yet confirm what pathogen is causing this illness,' said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic. He added that there are several potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than SARS.\n\nChinese municipal health officials in Wuhan said in a statement on their website on Friday [3 Jan 2020] that they had ruled out common respiratory diseases, such as influenza, bird flu and adenovirus infection, as the cause.\n\nEleven of those infected were in critical condition and the rest stable, they said, adding that all had been isolated and doctors were observing 121 people with whom they had been in close contact.\n\nCleanup efforts at a seafood market where some victims were vendors have been completed, the city officials said, adding that no obvious human-to-human transmission had been seen and no medical staff had been infected.\n\nOn Friday [3 Jan 2020], Singapore's health ministry said it would begin temperature screening on passengers arriving on flights from Wuhan.\n\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic, apologize and vow full candour regarding future outbreaks.\n\nThe disease, which emerged in southern China late in 2002, spread rapidly to other cities and countries in 2003. More than 8000 people were infected and 775 died.\n\nWuhan police this week said they had summoned 8 people who 'posted and forwarded false information online, causing adverse social impact.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n******\n[2] Hong Kong letter to physicians - Center for Health Protection\nDate: Fri 3 Jan 2020\nSource: Hong Kong Center for Health Protection [edited]\nhttps://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/letters_to_doctors_20200103.pdf\n\n\n[3 Jan 2020]\nDear Doctor,\nUpdates on the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan of Mainland\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health writes to update you on the latest situation of the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan of Hubei Province.\n\nAccording to the latest information available from the National Health Commission (NHC) on [3 Jan 2020], there were a total of 44 pneumonia cases with unknown cause detected in Wuhan since December 2019 (as of 8 am, [3 Jan 2020]). Among them, 11 cases (25%) were in serious condition and the remaining cases were in stable condition. Symptoms were mainly fever while a few had presented with shortness of breath. All patients have been isolated and receiving treatment. Contact tracing has identified 121 close contacts and medical surveillance by the Wuhan health authority is ongoing. Epidemiological investigations revealed that some cases were persons working in the market called 'South China Seafood City' [machine translation]. It remained unknown whether the other cases had epidemiological linkage to this market.\n\nHowever, the NHC reported that no obvious human-to-human transmission has been observed and no healthcare workers have been infected for the time being. Influenza viruses, avian influenza viruses and other common respiratory pathogens like adenovirus have been excluded as the cause. The causative pathogen and cause of infection are still under investigation.\n\nIn light of the latest situation, the CHP has revised the reporting criteria today [3 Jan 2020] in order to widen the scope of surveillance. Please kindly report cases fulfilling the following updated reporting criteria to the CHP for prompt investigation:\n- Patient presented with fever and acute respiratory illness, or with pneumonia; and\n- Travel history to Wuhan within 14 days before onset of symptom (irrespective of any exposure to wet market or seafood market).\n\nIt is very important to obtain travel and exposure history from all patients presenting with fever and acute respiratory symptoms. If you identify any cases fulfilling the above criteria, please report to the Central Notification Office (CENO) of the CHP via fax (2477 2770), phone (2477 2772) or CENO On-line (https://cdis.chp.gov.hk/CDIS_CENO_ONLINE/ceno.html). Please use the attached form (see Annex) for reporting.\n\nPrivate doctors should call the Medical Control Officer (MCO) of the Department of Health at Pager 7116 3300 call 9179 when reporting any case. The CHP will make arrangement to transfer the patient to a public hospital for isolation, testing and treatment. While waiting for transfer, please isolate the patient to minimise contact/exposure to staff and other patients, and advise the patient to wear a surgical mask.\n\nThe CHP has set up a designated webpage (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/102465.html) to provide updated information and health advice. Information of the cases reported under the above enhanced surveillance will be updated on a daily basis on the above webpage.\n\nWe would also like to seek your assistance in providing health advice on personal and environmental hygiene to your patients. In particular, patients with respiratory symptoms are reminded to wear surgical masks.\n\nWe will closely monitor the situation and review the reporting criteria as appropriate. Please draw the attention of the healthcare professionals and supporting staff in your institution/working with you to the above. Thank you for your ongoing support in combating communicable diseases.\n\nYours faithfully,\n(Dr. SK Chuang)\nfor Controller, Centre for Health Protection\nDepartment of Health\n\n[The reporting form is available at the source URL (see Annex). - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[3] Singapore, Taiwan screening - media report\nDate: Thu 2 Jan 2020; updated Fri 3 Jan 2020 at 06:20 EST\nSource: Bloomberg News [edited]\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-03/pneumonia-outbreak-spurs-fever-checks-from-singapore-to-taiwan\n\n\nThe cause of a mysterious lung infection in China continues to elude disease-trackers as the number of reported cases in the outbreak climbs. As of Friday [3 Jan 2020], 44 people have been diagnosed with pneumonia, the cause of which is unknown, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement. That's up from 27 three days ago. Eleven are in serious condition.\n\nThe World Health Organization has been in touch the Chinese government and investigations are underway, though officials cannot yet confirm which pathogen is responsible, said spokesman Tarik Jasarevic in Geneva.\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Health said temperature screening will be implemented at Changi Airport for all travelers arriving from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. In Hong Kong, thermal imaging systems will be deployed as part of increased fever surveillance at boundary check points, authorities said. Taiwan has implemented similar measures, its Centers for Disease Control said Tuesday [31 Dec 2019].\n\nPathogen studies have ruled out common respiratory diseases, including influenza, avian flu and adenovirus infections, Wuhan health authorities said. Some of those with pneumonia worked at a fresh seafood and produce market in the city. All the patients are being treated under quarantine, according to the commission.\n\nThe market, which has since been closed, sold birds, pheasants, and snakes, along with organs of rabbits and other wildlife, the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy said Thursday [2 Jan 2020], citing media reports. That's triggered worries about the potential jump of an unknown virus to humans -- reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which killed almost 800 people about 17 years ago. The Wuhan Institute of Virology didn't respond to an emailed request for comment on the infectious source.\n\nSeveral people were arrested for circulating fake news online about the viral spread of pneumonia, provincial authorities said, adding that rumors on social media alleging that there had been an outbreak of SARS are untrue, and no person-to-person transmission has been found so far.\n\nThree travelers from Wuhan were admitted to hospitals in Hong Kong, though 2 were subsequently released, the South China Morning Post reported late Thursday [2 Jan 2020]. The city hasn't received any Wuhan-related severe pneumonia cases, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan told reporters Thursday.\n\nSingapore asked doctors to look out for suspected cases of pneumonia among people who have recently returned from Wuhan. 'Suspect cases with fever and acute respiratory illness or pneumonia and with travel history to Wuhan within 14 days before onset of symptoms will be isolated as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission,' the city-state's Ministry of Health said in a Facebook post.\n\n[Byline: Jason Gale]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] Vietnam response to outbreak - media report\nDate: Fri 3 Jan 2020\nSource: VN Express [edited]\nhttps://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-wary-as-china-pneumonia-outbreak-could-be-linked-to-sars-4036786.html\n\n\nThe Vietnamese Ministry of Health is closely monitoring the situation on the China border following news of a pneumonia outbreak in that country.\n\nChina has reported several cases of acute pneumonia in Hubei Province's Wuhan City, 1500 km (932 mi) northeast of the border, since December [2019], according to the ministry's General Department of Preventative Medicine.\n\nAs of Tuesday [31 Dec 2019], 27 cases have been confirmed, with 7 people reportedly in critical condition, it added. The Chinese Ministry of Health is investigating the source of the infection and seeks to contain the outbreak.\n\nThere is no clear evidence yet that it has been transmitted between humans, with preliminary tests indicating it is an outbreak of viral pneumonia, according to the Vietnamese department. The Vietnamese Ministry of Health is collaborating with the World Health Organization to keep its citizens updated on the situation and devise preventive measures.\n\nThe outbreak is suspected to be linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China in 2002 and spread to other countries, including Vietnam, in 2003, Chinese media reported. More than 8000 people were infected and 775 died.\n\n[Byline: Phan Anh]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Well, we are still in the speculation stage. We do know that there are more cases that have been identified, but we do not know how many of these individuals have known contact/time spent in the seafood market. We also now know that avian influenza, influenza, and adenovirus have been eliminated. We do not know if a SARS-like coronavirus has been identified, albeit there have been numerous unsubstantiated reports mentioning a novel coronavirus that is SARS-like. A Twitter thread mentioned a report from the lab in Wuhan saying such a virus had been identified.

'We are trying everything and anything that can save children's lives. Everything is being made available from medicines to doctors. We have even called doctors and nurses from AIIMS in Patna,' he said. 'There is a protocol regarding what kind of medicines and facilities should be given and we are doing the same. We are monitoring things regularly and trying to save our children.'\n\nRecalling the situation that prevailed 5 years ago, Pandey said a team that was formed to ascertain the cause of this disease concluded that sleeping empty stomach at night, dehydration due to humidity and eating lychee on empty stomach were some of the causes of encephalitis.\n\n'Our government has tried to spread awareness which will be beneficial as well. Advertisement in newspapers, radio jingles, pamphlets and mic [microphone] announcements are going to spread awareness regarding the disease. Health ministry is also working on it,' he said.\n\nOn being asked about spread of ASE in Gorakhpur last year [2018], he said, 'From Gorakhpur to Muzaffarpur region, this disease had spread last year and the Union government had worked on this and we will continue to fight it now.'\n\n'This incident in Muzaffarpur is very saddening and we also feel bad when children of our nation die like this. Not the whole district is affected but a large part is suffering from it,' he added.\n\nFrom [1 Jan 2019], until now [5 Dec 2019], 220 children were admitted in Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital in Muzaffarpur due to AES, out of which 62 lost their lives.\n\nAs per the data of SKMCH hospital, 235 children were admitted, of which 89 died; in 2013 - 90 children were admitted, of which 35 died; in 2014 - 334 children were admitted, of which 117 died; in 2015 - 37 children were admitted, of which 15 died; in 2016 - 31 children were admitted, of which 6 died; in 2017 - 44 children were admitted, of which 18 died; and in 2018 - 43 children were admitted, of which 12 died.\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of State for Union ministry for home affairs, Nityanand Rai, visited Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital to review the situation after the outbreak of AES.\n\nEncephalitis is a viral disease, which causes mild flu-like symptoms such as high fever, convulsions and headaches and has been claiming lives in the district for the past few weeks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The dates within which these AES cases have occurred is not stated. The urgency that has prompted Behar health officials to request the aid of physicians and nurses from adjoining Patna suggests that the AES outbreak is going on currently. The uncertainty about the etiology of AES continues. It is curious that the above report makes no mention of negative or positive tests for Japanese encephalitis among the AES patients, although that virus is endemic in northeastern India, including Bihar state. Neighboring Uttar Pradesh state has had JE cases as well this summer (2019) but has intensified its JE vaccination program.\n\nThe issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. Lychee fruit contain toxins. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit contains phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, the current cases cannot be due to lychee consumption, since the season for that fruit has passed.\n\nAES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication (reference below) states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible.\n\nReference:\nRavi V, Hameed SKS, Desai A, et al.
