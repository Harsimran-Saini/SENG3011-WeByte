Between September and December 2020, 6 people fell ill with infections from _E. coli_ O146:H28. Those sick live in 5 federal states. Two people needed hospital treatment. As yet, there is no indication as to the source of the outbreak, according to the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES). It is understood other countries in Europe have not reported related infections.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection (BMSGPK) has instructed AGES to investigate the outbreak with the relevant state authorities. Austrian food testing in 2018 found _E. coli_ O146 in 3 samples of fresh game meat and one sample of fermented sausage. In 2017, 4 isolates were typed as _E. coli_ O146 from 2 samples of raw meat from wild ruminants, fresh bovine meat and a fermented sausage.\n\nThe latest Zoonoses Report from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows _E. coli_ O146 was the 5th most frequent serogroup reported in confirmed human infections in 2018.\n\nAnyone who has developed symptoms of EHEC infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses. The symptoms of _E. coli_ infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Most patients recover within 5 to 7 days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAbout 5% to 10% of those diagnosed with EHEC infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor.\n\nMany people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than 5 years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients. People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Shiga toxin-producing O146 is one of the non-O157 serotypes causing enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ disease.

'Cameron Elementary School and Hilltop Elementary School have a high percentage of reported cases,' said Shelby Haines, superintendent of schools. The outbreak, though, isn't limited to those 2 schools.\n\n'There are around 50 reported cases,' said Thomas Cook, Marshall County Health Department administrator. The majority of cases are occurring 'in a couple of schools,' he said, but added, this illness 'is not just confined to Marshall County.\n\nThere are other cases of this throughout the state,' said Tony Wood, spokesman for Marshall County Schools.\n\nIt has yet to be determined whether the cases of pneumonia are caused by a virus or bacteria, Cook said. State epidemiologists are sending testing kits to the health department for distribution to rapid care facilities, Cook said. Swabs taken from patients will be sent to the West Virginia Bureau of Public Health for testing and diagnosis of the form of infection affecting local residents.\n\nTreating the symptoms is recommended for either form of pneumonia. Antibiotics, however, are prescribed only for bacterial pneumonia. Doctors 'are not going to give antibiotics unless you have a bacteria that you want to eradicate,' Cook explained.\n\nExtensive cleaning is being done in school buildings to prevent additional cases. 'Last week [week of 14 Oct 2019], we began getting phone calls of reported cases of illness in a number of schools,' Haines said. 'When those reports came, we began cleaning with an approved disinfectant to try to get a jump on it. We increased the custodial staff to clean with approved methods. 'The superintendent said the school district has bought its own ionizer, a machine that is being used for cleaning during after-school hours. 'In the evening, we run a cleaning device that sprays disinfectant on all surfaces, on top of regular cleaning. It sprays a mist and sticks to surfaces,' she said.\n\nIn addition, school personnel and health educators are training children on the importance of hand washing, using facial tissues. and coughing into one's elbow. 'Hand washing is the key to everything,' Cook said.\n\nThe health department has sent a sanitarian to Cameron and Hilltop schools to check the facilities. 'The county (school system) has really been pro-active in cleaning and education,' the health administrator said.\n\nWhen the outbreak began, 'we started to receive calls from the parents, from the urgent care (centers) with people coming in with some difficulty breathing, wheezing, lethargy, fever. Chest X-rays were showing congestion in lungs and classical signs of pneumonia,' Cook said.\n\nThe health official predicted that pneumonia also will affect the adult population and younger children. Patients can go back to school or work when their fever subsides for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication, he said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[We are told that about 50 cases of pneumonia are being reported among children, mainly in 2 elementary schools in the Wheeling, West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area, Marshall County, West Virginia, although additional cases are also being reported throughout the state. Patients are said to be school children with difficulty breathing, wheezing, lethargy, fever, and chest X-rays findings consistent with pneumonia. No further details about this outbreak are given in the news report above. The microbial etiology is as yet unknown.\n\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and, less commonly, fungi. Viruses, such as influenza, can cause of outbreaks of CAP. Other viruses that cause CAP in school-aged children include adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus capable (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/5/681.full.pdf). Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus are more common in children under 5 years of age (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/15750086). Common bacterial causes of CAP in this age group include _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, and _Chlamydia pneumoniae_. Outbreaks of CAP caused by _M. pneumoniae_ occur mostly in crowded environments, like households, schools, college dormitories, and military barracks, when coughing releases small droplets of respiratory secretions into the air that are inhaled by close contacts.\n\nFungi rarely cause pneumonia in otherwise healthy people, but outbreaks of CAP caused by environmental fungi that are characteristic of certain regions of the US, such as _Histoplasma_, _Coccidioides_, and _Blastomyces_, can occasionally occur, when soil harboring these fungi are disturbed. Although unlikely in elementary school children, the opioid epidemic in the US could also cause CAP as a result of aspiration of anaerobic bacterial mouth flora or as a result of injection drug use giving rise to hematogenous _Staphylococcus aureus_ pneumonia.\n\nThe Wheeling Metropolitan Statistical Area, with a population of a 147 950 residents in 2010, consists of 2 counties in the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia and one in eastern Ohio, anchored by the city of Wheeling, which is about 90 miles (about 145 km) southwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeling,_West_Virginia_metropolitan_area).

There are some reports in the news of this drug being imported from East Asia (I believe it may have 1st surface in Ohio?). Carfentanil is 10 000 times more potent than morphine (100 times more potent than fentanyl).

The legal carfentanil drug is approximately 700 times more potent than heroin so naloxone has a difficult time reversing such a potent opioid. In dealing with large ungulates immobilized with carfentanil, veterinarians learned that naloxone couldn't cut it 30 years ago. Naltrexone is the reversal agent of choice with veterinary use of carfentanil.\n\n--\nKen Waldrup DVM\n[email withheld on request]\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: Jun 9, 2017 2:33 PM\nFrom: 'Powell, Ryan' <RPowell@rdn.bc.ca>\n\n\nRe: Drug Abuse - USA: (GA) pot. lethal unknown substance, RFI\n\nThe article 'Drug Abuse - USA: (GA) pot. lethal unknown substance, RFI' resonated with me because of the fentanyl crisis occurring in British Columbia, Canada.

However, I would be skeptical that the lab is not aware of carfentanil.\n\nThe lab has mentioned the product is a fentanyl analogue so it seems unlikely that it would just be fentanyl as described in the article/video from Canada.

'You're thinking of folks that live in crowded conditions, like dorms. You're thinking of folks with maybe less than optimal eating habits, less than optimal sleep habits. Folks that maybe aren't practicing the best hand hygiene,' Burick said. Those who smoke or have asthma also have an increased risk of contracting the flu or pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection that can cause fluid buildup in the lungs, and in severe cases can cause breathing difficulties.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 184 individuals ages 15 to 24 in the United States who died from influenza and pneumonia in 2015, which is a small fraction of the more than 57 000 people who died from influenza and pneumonia among all ages that year.\n\nAnd MedExpress locations in the area have already seen more pneumonia cases this year [2017] than in all of 2016. Symptoms can sometimes vary with pneumonia, and it can evolve from the flu due to a compromised immune system.\n\n'When you're thinking of the classic symptoms, it's a cough that is persistent, and you're thinking of a fever. Typically a higher fever within that 100-point mark; most folks tend to have that fatigue, that malaise, just not feeling well sensation,' Burick said. 'At the same point, it's not always isolation of symptoms. Some people are also coming in with those flu-like symptoms.'\n\nThe most common form of pneumonia is bacterial, meaning it can be treated with antibiotics. But other forms can be viral or fungal, meaning the illness needs to run its course. The most important thing people should be aware of is prevention techniques, Burick said. 'Practicing great hand hygiene, being cautious not to share food or drinks,' she said. 'It might sound silly, but making sure you're getting adequate sleep and paying attention to your diet.'\n\n[Byline: Kate Malongowski]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above says that there has been 74 percent more cases of young adults with pneumonia between 2015 and 2016 than previously in a 9-county region that includes Beaver County in the US state of Pennsylvania, but fails to indicate what these counties are or to give the microbial causes for this increase.\n\nCenter Township, a suburban community approximately 25 mi (40 km) northwest of Pittsburgh, is located in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Township,_Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania). Beaver County is on the border with the states of West Virginia and Ohio (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania#Adjacent_counties) and is part of the Pittsburgh, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. Adjacent counties are Lawrence (north), Butler (east), Allegheny (southeast), Washington (south), Hancock, West Virginia (west) and Columbiana, Ohio (west).\n\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and, less commonly, fungi. Common bacterial causes of CAP in the United States are _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (also called pneumococcus), _Legionella pneumophila_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, and _Chlamydia pnueumoniae_. Outbreaks of CAP caused by M. pneumoniae occur mostly in crowded environments, like households, schools, college dormitories, and military barracks, when coughing releases small droplets of respiratory secretions into the air that are inhaled by close contacts. The opioid epidemic in the U.S. could also be causing an increase in cases of CAP as a result of aspiration of anaerobic bacterial mouth flora or as a result of injection drug use giving rise to hematogenous _Staphylococcus aureus_ pneumonia.\n\nViruses, such as influenza, also can cause of outbreaks of CAP. Travel-associated pneumonia may be caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) indigenous to the Arabian Peninsula or H5N1 or H7N9 strains of avian influenza indigenous to Asia.

After hospitalized, 19 patients show improvement in symptoms.\n\nEpidemiology studies: time and place of occurrence, and the contacts of 50 suspected cases were conducted for basic data analysis.\nThe date of the 1st suspected case is 19 Oct 2015, and the outbreak occurred intensively in between 25-27 Oct 2015 (29 cases, 58 per cent of total cases)\nAfter the building shutdown, occurrence of new cases decreased.\n\nDaily update on the outbreak (28 Oct 2015: building shutdown):\nPlace of occurrence: the 50 suspected cases are all the workers from Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building. 50 are laboratory workers on the 3rd -7th floor.\nIt is estimated that the outbreak happened because they were exposed to contaminants through laboratory environment.\n* Number of laboratories in the building: 24 (a total of 234 workers, subject to monitoring)\n\nCase distribution: location (floor, room numbers), incidence (percentages)\nCategory 3rd floor, 318\nPatients 1 (subtotal 11)\nWorkers 1 (subtotal 41)\nIncidence -\nCategory 4th floor / 403 / 406-1 / 407 / 409\nPatients 1 / 3 / 5 / 2\nWorkers 5 / 6 / 14 / 16\nIncidence 20 / 50 / 36 / 13\nCategory 5th floor / 501 / 502 / 503 / 504 / 505\nPatients 1 / 3 / 9 / 8 / 4\nWorkers 5 / 7 / 13 / 12 / 14\nIncidence 14 / 62 / 67 / 21\nCategory 6th floor, 602\nPatients 1\nWorkers 15\nIncidence 7\nCategory 7th floor / 708 / 708-1 / 708-3 / 708-4 / 710-1\nPatients 4 / 1 / 4 / 2 / 1\nWorkers 6 / 8 / 6 / 5 / 3\nIncidence 67 / 13 / 67 / 40 / 33\n* The report may change depending on the research progress.\n\nDaily update on the outbreak:\n87 individuals who are living with the 50 suspected patients show no sign of respiratory symptoms or fever.\nSince there are no confirmed cases in close contacts, there is low probability that the disease spreads between people, and yet, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of spread.\nIn order to identify the cause of the outbreak and trace the routes of disease transmission, KCDC will proceed with a case control study.\nOn 1 Nov 2015, a group of patients (suspected patients) were surveyed. On 2 Nov 2015, controlled group (the building workers without symptoms) were investigated with the same survey, and it is planned to compare the 2 groups.\n\nClinical aspects: at the initial stage, mild symptoms such as fever, muscle pain appeared; and respiratory symptoms showed relatively rare pneumonia findings\n\nClinical features\nTotal: Fever / Chills / Muscle pain / Headache / Cough / Body ache / Sputum / Chest ache / Sore throat / Diarrhea\n(number (percentage) of patients with particular features)\n50: 48 / 22 / 20 / 18 / 16 / 10 / 7 / 4 / 4 / 2 / 1 /- /\n(100): (96) / (44) / (40 ) / (36) / (32) / (20) / (14) / (8) / (8) / (4) / (2)\n\nNon-specific pneumonia findings appear common on chest x-ray\nAfter hospitalization, 48 cases showed symptoms of fever initially; but now only 2 remain with fever. It is estimated that the disease has low severity since its progression is relatively slow.\n* 2 out of 50 suspected patients who did not show symptoms of a fever initially:\nCase 1: (initial) headache, muscle aches, chills, (currently) no fever, improvement in symptoms, improvement in pneumonia findings.\nCase 2: (initial) cough, headache, (currently) no fever, but the presence of symptoms and pneumonia findings\nFor the abnormalities found in some lung CT scans, lung tissues are collected for testing.\nPathogen test: There is 90 per cent progress on genetic and antibody testing for the 7 kinds of bacteria and 9 kinds of virus of all the suspected patients. Brucellosis, Q fever, legionellosis shall be reassayed through secondary antibody inspection after 3 weeks.\nIn addition, the test for fungal culture is in progress for 30 suspected patients using the remaining samples after bacteria and virus scan. This may take a few days to few months, and it usually takes 2 to 4 weeks of observation.\nEnvironmental studies: environmental samples were collected from inside the building, which is currently under investigation (started 28 Oct 2015), and it will take about 2 weeks.\nOn the other hand, another 192 students from other departments who entered the building are currently monitored by the KCDC Call Center (109) (a total of 1664).\n* Number of people who are subjected to be monitored: (30 Oct 2015) 964; (31 Oct 2015) 1472; (1 Nov 15) 1664\n87 individuals who are living with the 50 suspected patients are being monitored by public health center for unusual symptoms.\nSo far, unusual cases are not confirmed from the result of monitoring.\n* The system to encourage 527 applicants of the SK Group employment exam to report to the KCDC Call Center (109) is retained.\nKCDC are investigating and taking necessary steps to find the cause and manage the respiratory disease.\nKCDC will actively cooperate with relevant ministries and academic-medical specialists, and will plan to inform the public and the media often.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The translations were requested of colleagues in Seoul by ProMED-mail consultant, Daniel Lucey, MD of Georgetown University and Jayoung Park.

All cases have been hospitalized in isolation, but all apparently have mild illness. 96 per cent had fever (temperature above 37.5 C) (99 F), but we are not told the height of the fever. Only 32 per cent had a cough, and only 14 per cent had a cough productive of sputum. We are not told if any had difficulty breathing. Though we are told 8 per cent had 'chest aches', we are not told if the chest pain was pleuritic in nature.\n\nThe 1st reports of the outbreak at Konkuk University said only graduate students in the veterinary school were affected, but now the affected individuals are only characterized as 'workers' in the university's Animal Life Sciences Building; however, we are not told the nature of their work. The outbreak has involved workers on the 3rd-7th floors, but the attack rates were usually highest among workers on the 5th and 7th floors.\n\nThere are an additional 26 cases who were in the Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building after 8 Oct 2015 with fever, but apparently failed to have radiographic evidence of pneumonia. There has been no evidence of secondary spread among contacts of the patients.\n\nThe 1st case became symptomatic on 19 Oct 2015, and the outbreak intensified between 25 and 27 Oct 2015 (29 cases, 58 per cent of total cases). The Animal Life Sciences building was closed on 28 Oct 2015 and there have been no new cases in the past 2 days. So far, no etiologic agent has been identified. We await further reports of the investigation.\n\nKonkuk University is a private university located in Seoul and Chungju. Gyeonggi Province surrounds Seoul.

People who visited the building from 8-28 Oct 2015 and have fever are encourged to report to the KCDC Call Center (109).\n From 19-28 Oct 2015, 21 patients showed symptoms such as pneumonia, respiratory symptoms, and fever, and they will receive treatment in the National Inpatient Hospital until the pathogen is confirmed. As of 29 Oct 2015 0:00 KST, the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (director, Yang Byung Guk) investigated a total of 31 unknown-cause respiratory disease cases in relation to Konkuk University, which are 10 more cases than the previous day's numbers. As of today (28 Oct 15), according to the central epidemiology investigation team, they confirmed that patients are concentrically from 3 laboratories inside the building, so they will focus on finding co-exposure factors. \n- Starting this afternoon (30 Oct 15), the KCDC Call Center (109) will carry out a monitoring system to check on individuals who have symptoms twice a day. \n\n\nReport on the 2nd day respiratory disease investigation arising from Konkuk University\n \n- Konkuk University Animal Life Science Building (7-story building) is maintaining a state of disinfection and completely controlling access as preventative measures. As of 30 Oct 2015 0 PM KST, a total of 45 cases are currently being investigated, and there are confirmed pneumonia radiological patterns in 34 cases who are identified as the suspected patients. The Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (director, Yang Byung Guk) said specific findings were not found from the result of the human samples test (conducted until 29 Oct 15) for 16 species of bacterial and viral pathogens in relation to Konkuk University's respiratory disease outbreak. In order to research bacterial and viral, as well as environmental and chemical factors, experts from various fields, including infectious diseases and toxicology, will cooperate with an epidemiology investigation team, and the causes of the respiratory disease will be identified through a comprehensive review. \n- KCDC are investigating and taking necessary steps to find the cause and manage the respiratory disease. Suspected Patients: people who visited Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building after 8 Oct 2015 with fever of 37.5 C [99 F] and a chest radiological pneumonia pattern. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n In addition, the KCDC asked the Korean Medical Association and Korean Hospital Association for cooperation to check patients with fever and respiratory symptoms [if] they have ever visited Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences building.

Health authorities have placed all 21 in quarantine and closed off the school building. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [KCDC] on Wednesday [28 Oct 2015] said the victims started coming down with pneumonia last week, and a team of epidemiologists have been dispatched to the university.\n\nAccording to the KCDC, those infected are master's and doctoral candidates who used the school's lab from [19 to 28 Oct 2015]. They are being treated in isolation at state-run hospitals.\n\nThe 1st 4 graduate students who showed symptoms were hospitalized at Konkuk University Medical Center and then transferred to the National Medical Center on Wednesday [28 Oct 2015]. All of them visited a cattle fair in Gyeonggi Province last week as well as an animal farm owned by the university in Chungju, North Chungcheong Province.\n\nA university official said they may have contracted brucellosis, which infects cattle and can be transmitted to humans. But some experts suspect Q fever, caused by the _Coxiella burnetii_ bacteria found in the droppings of cattle, swine and sheep. It causes airborne infections among humans. Symptoms such as fever, headache and muscle aches appear after a 2-week gestation period. But Song Dae-sup at Korea University said, 'Brucellosis and Q fever are not commonly found in Korea and are rarely passed on to humans. We need to look at the possibility of pneumonia caused by germs or other toxic agents.'\n\nLee Jae-gap at Hallym University Medical Center said since only the 4 visited the animal farm, the infection could be mycoplasma pneumonia or whooping cough, which sometimes occur in schools or communities.\n\nKonkuk University sealed off the veterinary school building and told the school's 850 staff and students to report any suspicious symptoms. The building was thoroughly disinfected on Wednesday [28 Oct 2015] morning as well, according to school officials.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This news report was also submitted by Dan Silver, ProMED-mail Rapporteur.]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 30 Oct 2015\nSource: The Chosun Ilbo [edited]\nhttp://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2015/10/30/2015103001031.html\n\n\n10 more graduate students have come down with a mysterious pneumonia attack at Konkuk University's Seoul campus on Thursday [29 Oct 2015], bringing the total to 31.\n\n21 people were diagnosed with the same symptoms earlier. But all have so far tested negative for a dozen well-known infectious diseases.\n\n'We're still trying to figure out the cause,' a spokesman for the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [KCDC] said Thursday.\n\nStudents look at instructions in front of a makeshift clinic at Konkuk University in Seoul on Thursday [29 Oct 2015]. The school said all patients are graduate students at the school of veterinary science and most have mild symptoms.\n\n23 are in isolation at state-run hospitals, while 8 with very mild symptoms are quarantined at home. All have tested negative for brucellosis, Q fever, and _Legionella_, which were among the prime suspects of the mysterious infection. They also tested negative for bacterial diseases like _Mycoplasma_ and _Chlamydia_ and viruses like Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] and flu.\n\nMeanwhile, it has emerged that the SK Group conducted recruitment exams on the campus last Sunday [25 Oct 2015], when the outbreak was probably already underway. Authorities asked 500 people who took the exams to report to the KCDC if they have symptoms like high fever.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This news report was also submitted by Dan Silver, ProMED-mail Rapporteur.]\n\n[The fact that a large group of veterinary graduate students became ill with pneumonia over a short period of time suggests a point source outbreak, i.e., they were all exposed to the same source over a brief time. The development of additional cases over time and geographic areas will be very useful in determining whether the cases are related to a point source.\n\nWe are not told exactly the severity of the illness, but almost 75 percent of cases were ill enough to require hospitalization. The fact that the illness seems at the present time to be limited to graduate veterinary students suggests a zoonosis. Brucellosis, Q fever, MERS, and influenza, as well as legionellosis, chlamydiosis, and _Mycoplasma_ infection were said to have been ruled out, but the report does not mention SARS. I don't know how legionellosis was ruled out, but Pontiac fever, a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis, occurs as a point source outbreak with high attack rates following exposure to aerosolized _Legionella_. Pontiac fever is diagnosed serologically; culture and legionella urinary antigen are usually negative. However, the severity of the Pontiac fever is so mild that it usually does require hospitalization. Other etiologies to be considered should include psittacosis (again I am unsure how a chlamydial infection was ruled out), tularemia, pneumonic plague, and anthrax. Histoplasmosis, although very rare in South Korea, can also cause a point source outbreak of an acute respiratory illness. More information is obviously needed from knowledgeable sources to develop a list of potential etiologies.\n\nKonkuk University is a private university located in Seoul and Chungju.

Worldwide, more than 220 variant CJD patients have been reported, with a majority of them in the United Kingdom (177 cases) and France (27 cases).\n\nThis case is the 4th to be reported in the United States. In each of the 3 previous cases, infection likely occurred outside the United States, including the United Kingdom (2 cases) and Saudi Arabia (1 case). The history of this 4th patient, including extensive travel to Europe and the Middle East, supports the likelihood that infection occurred outside the United States.

The H5N8 strain was discovered early in 2014 in Korea and China, and reached Japan soon afterwards. 'From there the strain probably spread with migratory wild birds to India, Europe, Canada and later the United States of America,' the OIE said in its statement.\n\nThe Paris-based organisation [OIE] urged its 180 member countries to better apply biosecurity measures in farms, live bird markets and in trade, and step up surveillance to curb the spread of the disease. The OIE data shows 28 countries were hit by outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5 and H7 [antigenic] types of bird flu since the start of 2015, up from 19 countries affected in 2014 and 14 countries in 2013.\n\nA global epizootic -- an epidemic outbreak in animals -- of H5N1 bird flu, which emerged in early 2004, led to several cases in humans, of which more than half proved fatal.

The Departments of Meurthe-et-Moselle and Moselle seem particularly concerned. 'The GDS [National Federation of Animal Health Protection Groups] and veterinary practitioners have developed a framework for investigations in cooperation with Prof Schelcher, Veterinary School, Toulouse.\n\nThe phenomenon has been observed since the beginning of the lambing season. On 14 Dec 2012, GDS Meurthe-et-Moselle identified agalactia in 15 out of a total of about 200 farms. Affected farms were visited, the attack rate of the lambing ewes was recorded as 50 to 100 percent. The reported cases appear scattered in the departments concerned, demonstrating absence of colostrum/milk during the 1st post-parturition days. This leads to the need to hand-feed the lambs.

According to this report, the Israeli, who recently arrived in China after travelling [in] India, contacted an Israeli businessman a few days ago and told him he was feeling ill, was suffering from severe back pain, had difficulty drinking and was vomiting constantly.\n\nThe businessman rushed the Israeli to a local hospital where he underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure. While at the hospital the Israeli suffered from hallucinations during which he claimed the Chinese doctors were trying to harvest his organs.\n\nThe physicians initially thought the man was suffering from some sort of mental illness and tried to determine whether he used drugs. Some doctors suggested transferring the Israeli to a psychiatric hospital after he recuperated, but his condition quickly deteriorated. He slipped in and out of consciousness, and the doctors hooked him up to a ventilator.\n\nThe mystery was solved when an infectious disease specialist was rushed to the Israeli's room and determined that he had contracted rabies. It remains unclear whether the Israeli, who died on Wed 19 Sep 2012, [had been] bitten by a dog and if so when [and where].\n\nMore than 55 000 people dies of rabies each year, [many] in India.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[People contract rabies predominantly following a deep bite or scratch by an infected animal. Dogs are the main host and transmitter of rabies in Asia. The initial symptoms of rabies are fever and often pain or an unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site. As the virus spreads through the central nervous system, progressive, fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. 2 forms of the disease can follow. People with furious rabies exhibit signs of hyperactivity, excited behaviour, hydrophobia and sometimes aerophobia. After a few days, death occurs by cardio-respiratory arrest. Paralytic rabies accounts for about 30 percent of the total number of human cases.\n\nNo tests are available to diagnose rabies infection in humans before the onset of clinical disease, and unless the rabies-specific signs of hydrophobia or aerophobia are present, the clinical diagnosis may be difficult. Human rabies can be confirmed intra-vitam and post mortem by various diagnostic techniques aimed at detecting whole virus, viral antigens or nucleic acids in infected tissues (brain, skin, urine or saliva).

The report lacks information on the date of arrival of the patient in Beijing or the length of his stay India [or elsewhere]. Hence it cannot be determined whether he contracted infection prior to or after his arrival in Beijing. It is also possible that he may have been infected elsewhere (possibly even in Israel) prior to his arrival in India.

But if the bears live together in\nconfined spaces, contagious diseases can quickly spread.\n\nA delegate who asked not to be named said 10 pandas at the Wolong\nNature Reserve this year [2007] became infected with a rare\ncontagious disease from which 2 of them later died [Could the nature\nof the suspected 'rare' disease be specified?

Zhihe Zhang stated that population safety is one\nof the most important issues affecting the survival of the giant\npanda. To avoid the emergence of vicious infectious diseases similar\nto SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] or avian influenza in the\ngiant panda population, it is extremely important to immediately\nstrengthen monitoring, prevention, and treatment/research of canine\ndistemper virus and other known and unknown infectious diseases.

Serological evidence of exposure to\ncanine viruses such as morbillivirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, and\ncoronavirus has been reported. Of course, test validation for pandas\nis unlikely and the possibility of cross-reaction to related viruses\nis quite possible. Bacterial septicemias due to _E. coli_ have been\nreported in captive pandas also.\n\nGiven the behavioral ecology (mostly solitary animals except during\nan extremely brief breeding season and living at low densities)\ncontact rates among wild pandas would be very low. Though not\nimpossible, it would seem unlikely that that same infectious agent\nwas spreading among pandas unless it had an extremely long incubation\nand/or period of shedding and not rapidly fatal. More likely is that\nthey are being exposed to organisms from other species, including\ndomestic animals that may be contaminating the limited remaining\npanda habitat, which may lead to cross-species transmission of the\nagents. Non-infectious causes such as environmental contaminants\nshould not be completely discounted either.\n\nPossibly, the more valuable piece of information in this news report\nis the official recognition for the need for better surveillance and\nresponse teams to investigate morbidity and mortality. If coordinated\nwith local domestic animal health monitoring or reporting systems\naround protected areas, it may shed light on prevalence of a number\nof diseases and sources of infection.\n\nWilliam B.

There is no link to a\nspecific product, but illnesses from this pathogen can be associated\nwith consumption of raw or undercooked ground beef. Illnesses have\nbeen found in California, Iowa, New York, Ohio, Michigan, Rhode\nIsland and Wisconsin. These illnesses occurred over a 6-month period,\nbeginning in September 2005 through March 2006, and FSIS is working\nclosely with State and local health officials to determine the\nexposure that led to illness.\nTherefore, FSIS wants to remind all consumers of the proper handling\nand cooking of meat products. Safe steps in food handling, cooking,\nand storage are essential to prevent foodborne illness. Consumers\nshould follow the 4 guidelines to keep food safe:\n1. Clean: Wash hands and surfaces often. Wash your hands with warm,\nsoapy water for 20 seconds before and after handling food. Wash your\ncutting boards, dishes, etc. with hot, soapy water after preparing\neach food item. Wash fruits and vegetables with cold water before\nusing. There is no need to wash or rinse meat or poultry.\n2. Separate: Don't cross-contaminate. Separate raw, cooked, and\nready-to-eat foods while shopping, preparing, or storing. Never place\ncooked food on a plate which previously held raw meat, poultry, or\nseafood.\n3. Cook: Cook food to proper temperatures. To be sure bacteria and\npathogens are destroyed, cook ground beef products to 160 F. Use a\nfood thermometer to be sure!\n4. Chill: Refrigerate promptly. Refrigerate or freeze perishables,\nprepared foods, and leftovers within 2 hours or sooner.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Matching microbiological profiles (presumably genetic matches)\noccurring over 6 months and scattered across the USA suggest a common\nreservoir that is nonperishable, such as frozen ground beef rather\nthan unpasteurized milk or produce.

AIMS scientists working in the long-term monitoring\nprogram say the disease they have documented is in a broad category\nknown as White Syndrome. Soon they hope to learn exactly what White\nSyndrome is.\nCathie Page, a deep ocean ecologist on the AIMS long term monitoring\nteam, says, 'It's more common on table corals. It starts at the base\nand works its way up. The disease breaks the coral tissue down,\neventually killing it.'\n'It doesn't fit the description of diseases found anywhere else in\nthe world, so it might be specific to the Pacific,' she says. In the\n3 years Page has been on the monitoring team, she has logged about\n450 dives spanning 48 reefs. She has seen White Syndrome kill at\nvarying rates.\n'It could kill a colony of 2 metres (6.5 feet) in diameter in 2 weeks\nbut in some other cases, it takes months to kill a large colony,' she\nsaid.\nThe first record of coral diseases came from reefs off Belize and\nFlorida in 1973. In 1993 coral diseases were noticed on the Great\nBarrier Reef. When the diseases worsened in the late 1990s, the\nlong-term monitoring team started documenting their activity. In\n1999 only 7 reefs were infected with White Syndrome; in 2002 33\nreefs were affected out of the 48 studied by the AIMS long-term\nmonitoring team.\nThe highest number of infected colonies within one reef was 101 in a\n1500-square-meter area. That was on Carter Reef, an outer shelf reef\nin the Cooktown/Lizard Island sector. The syndrome killed those\ncolonies infected and caused a decline in hard coral cover on this\nreef.\nAIMS scientists together with researchers from James Cook University\nwho are collaborating on the project have recorded the disease in\nnorthern waters during the winter months. Outer-shelf reefs near\nLizard Island off Cooktown in the northern Great Barrier Reef and the\nCapricorn Bunker reefs in the southern Great Barrier Reef are the\nworst affected areas.\nWhite Syndrome outbreaks are happening in pristine areas of the Great\nBarrier Reef, the AIMS teams says, on outer reefs untouched by\ncoastal development and tourism. This means the reef diseases are not\nlinked to pollution, as are other coral diseases around the world.\nCoral bleaching is also affecting the great reef, and scientists fear\nWhite Syndrome could be spreading more quickly in corals weakened by\nbleaching.\nCoral bleaching is the name given to an event in which coral expel\ntheir symbiotic algae due to extreme stress, such as unusually hot\nwater, according to AIMS bleaching expert Dr. Terry Done.\nThe bleached corals die if the stress is extreme or prolonged. With\nrising water temperatures over the tropical summers, coral bleaching\nevents are more widespread and happening more often, leaving little\ntime for coral to recover.\n'Bleached coral is not healthy and potentially more susceptible to\ndiseases,' said Page. 'We don't know what's causing this disease.\nIt's microscopic; it could be a range of things.'\nAIMS has sent samples of corals affected by White Syndrome away for\ntesting. When the results come back, AIMS will search for solutions\nthat might save the corals of the Great Barrier Reef.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The coral reef bleaching is a serious problem for the ocean life\nthat live in and around the reef, but the devastation of the reef has\nconsequences for the land mass that the reef protects as well. There\nare many theories, including the rise in ocean water temperatures as\nreflected by our warming climate, a potential effect of El Nino, and\neven contamination due to human waste. It may be a combination of\nthese that has allowed the problem to escalate, but whatever the\ncause, it is affecting the reefs on almost a worldwide basis. -\nMod.TG]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail, a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Outer-shelf reefs near\nLizard Island off Cooktown in the northern Great Barrier Reef and the\nCapricorn Bunker reefs in the southern Great Barrier Reef are the\nworst affected areas.

He\nmentioned botulism as one disease that might match the symptoms.\n\nTwo people were in critical condition and on life support, Mayor John\nSpencer said. The others were listed as stable, said Dr. Nicholas\nDeRobertis of St. Joseph's Medical Center.\n\n``It's definitely something they ingested, that they ate or drank, but we\ndon't know what,'' he said. Tests that might determine the cause of the\nillness would not be finished until much later Friday, the hospital said.\n\nThe hospital closed briefly when emergency room workers reported rashes\nthat may have been caused by contact with the victims. But tests showed no\nairborne contamination or contagion, Spencer said. He urged residents to be\ncalm, saying, ``It looks like everything is going to be all right.''\n\nThe New York City anti-terrorism task force was called in Thursday night\n``due to the sensitivity of it and the times we live in,'' the mayor said.\n\nSpencer initially said the illness seemed to be caused by ``some kind of\npoison,'' and cyanide was considered a possibility.

A sixth person was treated\nand released. The six went into respiratory arrest after eating dinner in a\nYonkers apartment. Others in the apartment who did not eat the meal did not\nbecome sick, the police said.\nBecause an ambulance worker developed a rash after lifting one of the\nvictims, the police initially thought the incident could have been a far\nmore serious outbreak or attack. The rash is now believed to have been\neither a coincidence or a result of contact with a victim's bodily fluids.\nUntil medical officials can pinpoint the cause of the illness, the\nauthorities are treating the case as a possible crime. 'We are looking at\nsubstances in the food,' said the Yonkers police commissioner, Charles A.\nCola. 'There are preservatives that can cause these symptoms. But at this\nlate date, we can say it wasn't cyanide.'\nThe police responded to a call at 6:17 Thursday night for what appeared to\nbe an incident of food poisoning in a modest four-story row house, not far\nfrom the city's downtown. But because of the severity of the symptoms and\nthe skin reaction of the medical technician, city officials went into full\ncrisis mode.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Westchester County district\nattorney's office and a team of hazardous materials experts were all called\nin. The neighborhood surrounding the apartment building was closed off, as\nwas St. Joseph's emergency room. And the American Red Cross started to set\nup an emergency shelter at a nearby church.\n'We're dealing with so many unknowns in our society, as we're all painfully\naware of,' Mayor John D. Spencer said at a news conference. 'As a\ngovernment, as a city, we have to be prepared to be overly cautious when\ndealing with issues such as chemicals or strange occurrences, which this\nwas yesterday.'\nThe six victims \u0097 four men and two women of Egyptian heritage who range in\nage from 23 to 60 \u0097 apparently used some ingredients that were brought to\nthe United States from Egypt, Commissioner Cola said. 'Right now I'm\nleaning toward this being a non-crime, based on medical advice that it\ncould have happened naturally,' he said.\nThere was no move to recall any particular food item because a number of\ningredients were used in the dinner. 'We don't know what it is, so how do I\nsay, `It's the A.& P.'?' Commissioner Cola said.\nDr. Nicholas E. DeRobertis, director of emergency services at St. Joseph's\nMedical Center, said the list of substances that could provoke such a\nreaction was 'pretty extensive,' including certain antibiotics and food\npreservatives. The patients suffered from a condition he called\nmethemoglobinemia, which changes the red blood cells so that they cannot\ncarry oxygen to the body's tissues.\n'When that happens, people come in with severe respiratory distress, a\nbluish color and altered mental state,' Dr. DeRobertis said at the news\nconference.\nMr. Cola said the patients were immediately given an antidote for cyanide\npoisoning as a precaution.\nFoods from the meal were being tested at a federal Food and Drug\nAdministration laboratory in Queens, said Heather McGill, a spokeswoman for\nthe Westchester County Health Department.

The police commissioner said he doubted there had been any foul\nplay. Two of the victims remained in critical condition a day after the\noutbreak of a rare blood-cell disease. Three were in stable condition and\none was released from the hospital.\n'I'm leaning toward non-crime based on medical advice,' said Commissioner\nCharles Cola. 'Nobody has told us this is something that somebody put in\nthe food.' He added, however, that police were still treating the victims'\napartment as a crime scene and that 'It would be presumptuous of me to rule\nout foul play.'\nMayor John Spencer said Yonkers was 'back to normalcy' after spinning into\nemergency mode Thursday night. The six victims had been taken to St.\nJoseph's Medical Center with severe breathing problems, a bluish pallor and\nan altered mental state. Some emergency workers reported picking up a rash\nas they treated the patients, adding to the concern.\nThe hospital was closed briefly and police, firefighters,\nhazardous-materials workers and even anti-terrorist agents streamed into\nthe area. The mayor mentioned the possibility of cyanide poisoning. A\ndecontamination shower was set up outside the victims' home. Air tests in\nthe building and at the hospital found no airborne contamination, however.\nWhen police learned that people in the apartment who had not eaten did not\nget sick, the investigation focused on the food. Cola said the victims,\nwho were identified only as being adults and of Egyptian heritage, were at\na dinner party featuring a dish with many ingredients, including a\nprocessed food that they had brought in from Egypt.\n'They became concerned about the taste of the food and quickly became ill,'\nhe said. He said the investigation was concentrating 'on the apartment and\nthe food itself and the way it was prepared,' rather than looking into\nwhether the victims had enemies who might have tampered with the food.\nDr. Nicholas DeRobertis, emergency director at St. Joseph's, said something\nthe victims ingested had changed their red blood cells into abnormal cells\nthat blocked the transfer of oxygen to tissue, a condition called\nmethemoglobinemia. It is unlike ordinary food poisoning, he said, in that\nit is a respiratory rather than gastrointestinal illness. He said he had\nseen it only once before, 15 or 20 years ago.\nThe doctor said the condition has more than 100 known causes, including\nunsafe levels of nitroglycerin; the antibiotics known as sulfonamides; or\nnaphthalene, which is used in mothballs. It is also used in some food\npreservatives, he said, but in that form would have to be ingested in 'very\nlarge quantities' to inflict the illness. He said tests that might show if\nthe food was tampered with could take weeks. The mayor said it was\npremature to try recalls or other warnings about tainted food because\n'there could be 100 different ways' that the toxin got into the food.\n[By Jim Fitzgerald]\n--\nCarol H. Knott\n<ctn43074@centurytel.net>\n\n[The earlier reports on this event suggested cyanide poisoning and then\nlater botulism. The present reports state that the clinical picture was\nconsistent with methemoglobinemia. Cyanide poisoning can present with a\nclinical picture similar to that seen with acquired methemoglobinemia. The\nearlier report on possible botulism is difficult to understand other than a\nclinical presentation of respiratory distress. A good review of\nmethemoglobinemia can be found at the Vanderbilt Medical College website:\n<http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/peds/pidl/hemeonc/index.htm>\nMethemoglobin is an abnormal hemoglobin that is not capable of carrying\noxygen or carbon dioxide. In adults and normal children the level of\nmethemoglobin is less than 1% of the total hemoglobin. Acquired\nmethemoglobinemia (presence of methemoglobin in the blood) results when the\nrate of formation of methemoglobin exceeds the rate of reduction after\nexposure to certain compounds. Nitrites and aniline derivatives are\nsubstances which most frequently produce methemoglobinemia. Because of its\nuse as a meat preservative and its similarity in appearance to table salt,\nsodium nitrite is frequently the cause of methemoglobinemia. Nitrites are\nalso present in many medicinal agents. Mosts reports of nitrate- induced\nmethemoglobinemia, however, are due to infants fed well water contaminated\nwith high levels of nitrates. Nitrate salts are converted by enteric\nbacteria to nitrites which are then rapidly absorbed from the\ngastrointestinal tract. Silver nitrate used on burns is also a common\nsource as bacteria infecting burns may similarly cause nitrite production.\nAniline and its derivitives are found in many household products such as\ninks, shoe polishes, paints and varnishes, and in some red and orange wax\ncrayons. Other drugs commonly associated with methemoglobinemia include\nphenacetin, sulfonamides, and pyridium. Benzocaine, a common ingredient of\ntopical anesthetics has also been known to cause marked cyanosis from\nmethemoglobinemia.\nSymptoms of methemoglobinemia include headaches, fatigue, coma, and death.\nHeadache, fatigue, tachycardia (fast heartrate), weakness and dizziness do\nnot appear until levels reach 30- 40%. At 50- 60% oxygenation of tissues\nbecomes truly inadequate resulting in dyspnea (shortness of breath),\nacidosis, arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms), coma, and convulsions.\nDeath occurs with concentrations of about 70% and greater. Treatment\ninvolves general supportive care and removal of any offending toxins. The\ndrug of choice for treating severe methemoglobinemia is methylene\nblue. Severe cases may require exchange transfusion or the use of\nascorbic acid.\nMethemoglobinemia has been associated with ingestion of food products\ncontaining toxic levels of nitrites/nitrates or other substances. An\noutbreak in India (ref.1) was associated with ingestion of rice\ncontaminated with metanil yellow used for coloring the rice. Other\noutbreaks have been associated with the use of excessive amounts of sodium\nnitrate (saltpetre) in the preparation of sausages and other meat products\n(refs. 2,3).\nMore information on the etiology of the methemoglobinemia in this outbreak\nwould be appreciated.\n1: Sachdeva SM, Mani KV, Adaval SK, Jalpota YP, Rasela KC, Chadha\nDS.

They've dubbed it\n'black water', and have called local, state, and national government\nagencies to investigate.\nScientists who have heard of the phenomenon say they need answers too.'It's\nkilled a lot of the bottom because recently a lot of little bottom plants\nare coming to the surface dead and rotten out in the Gulf,' said Tim\nDaniels, 58, a Marathon Key fish-spotting pilot who has been flying over\nthe Gulf for more than 20 years. Experienced fishermen say they've often\nseen red tide but they've never seen anything like this 'it doesn't have a\nfoul smell, it isn't red tide and it isn't oil. They describe it as viscous\nand slimy water with what looks like spider webs in it.'\nFirst sighted in January, the mass of black-colored water reached from 20\nmiles north of Marathon Key halfway to Naples. It stretched west almost 20\nmiles into the Gulf of Mexico.\nThough somewhat smaller now than descriptions from January, the mass of\nwater is still quite large and is moving into the Florida Keys National\nMarine Sanctuary, a 2800 square-mile sanctuary adjacent to the Keys, which\nis the largest coral reef in the United States. It includes the productive\nwaters of Florida Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean. Part of\nthe ecosystem is an extensive nursery, feeding, and breeding ground,\nsupporting a variety of marine species and a multimillion dollar fishing\nindustry bringing in almost 20 million pounds of seafood each year.\nBilly Causey, superintendent of the sanctuary, told the Naples Daily News\nrecently that there is real concern in the scientific community about the\noverall health of the Gulf. Causey said contributing to the problems\nafflicting the shallow body is global warming, extended periods when the\nGulf waters aren't cooling in the winter, and the growing impact of human\nactivity along coastlines. Those problems, beginning in the early 1980s,\ninclude more frequent and longer lasting coral bleaching events that by\n1990 were affecting stouter coral reefs closer to shore and more adapted to\nwide temperature swings.\n'There are places that are still beautiful but the shallow reefs would make\nyou cry,' said Causey, a Keys diver since the 1950s. Scientists with Mote\nMarine Laboratory based in Sarasota said they are aware of the black water\nphenomenon but have not yet been able to test water samples. Mote is\nwilling to send out testing kits to fishermen who might encounter the black\nwater zone but, in the absence of a kit, fishermen could put a sample in a\nclean bottle and keep it in a cool, dark place until they could get it to a\nlab.\nDaniels said he first noticed the black water when he went out in\nmid-January, ahead of kingfish season, to see what fishermen had in store\nfor 2002. When he was flying over water that was 50 feet deep and north of\nthe Keys, Daniels began to notice a change in the water color. When pilots\nfrom the air see boats move through a red tide zone, they often cut the\nreddish or brownish water to reveal green below. That doesn't occur in the\nblack water. 'This (dark) stuff goes all the way to the bottom,' Richardson\nsaid. Boats that have 4 to 5 feet of hull below the surface cut through 35\nto 40 feet of water and leave nothing but the same black water in their\nwakes. It's the same at depths of 15 feet, he said.\nAlong with the newly discovered black water and coral bleaching, there have\nbeen other problems with the Gulf having been documented for years. They\ninclude a New Jersey-sized dead zone coming off the Mississippi River\noutlet to the Gulf that consumes a larger area each summer. There are\nincidences of a contamination known as fibro papilloma [any information\nabout this condition? - Mod.SH] in green turtles that live in Florida Bay.\nThere are other problems in shrimp and an entire marine ecosystem appears\nto be sick.\n\u00ad\u00ad\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The black water is a mystery requiring more water testing but apparently\ndefying life.

Ed. DS] that causes skin rashes and affects the liver and\npancreas, he told a state investigative commission.\nHigh concentrations of nitrates have been found in 57 percent of drinking\nwater supplied through a pipe system, 98 percent of water from wells and\nevery tenth food product checked, Moskalenko said in comments cited by the\nInterfax news agency.\nOfficials said Ukraine would appeal to the World Health Organization and\nforeign governments to help it deal with the emergency. The government,\nmeanwhile, appeared split on what caused the illness, with some officials\nblaming rocket fuel and others denying the possibility. In the region is a\nbase holding solid-fuel SS-24 nuclear missiles, which are to be dismantled\nin 2001. It once housed other Soviet missiles powered by liquid fuel.\nHealth experts have said the area's soil and water contained substances\nthat are usually produced by decomposing rocket fuel, but Kuchma's\nspokesman Oleksandr Martynenko insisted on Wednesday that rocket fuel could\nnot be blamed. Instead, he suggested that the illness could have resulted\nfrom high amounts of nitrates in the soil. But the head of the government\ncommission, deputy premier Mykola Zhulynskyi, said missile silos in the\narea had remained open after liquid-fuel rockets were dismantled there in\nthe late 1970s. Fuel spills could have occurred during the missiles'\ndismantling, he said. Ukraine inherited 46 SS-24 and 130 SS-19 nuclear\nmissiles following the 1991 Soviet collapse. Kiev has since surrendered all\nits nuclear warheads to Russia and eliminated the last SS-19 missile in\n1999. Most of the SS-24s along with missile silos remain to be destroyed\nunder a disarmament plan running through 2001.\n[Byline: Sergei Shargorodsky]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n***\n[2]\nDate: 31 Aug 2000 20:38:33 -0400\nFrom: Marjorie P.

Health experts have said the area's soil and water contained substances\nthat are usually produced by decomposing rocket fuel, but Kuchma's\nspokesman Oleksandr Martynenko insisted on Wednesday that rocket fuel could\nnot be blamed. President Leonid Kuchma on Thursday declared 4\nsouthern Ukrainian villages an ecological disaster zone, following an\noutbreak of a mysterious illness some have blamed on leaks of Soviet-era\nrocket fuel. But the head of the government\ncommission, deputy premier Mykola Zhulynskyi, said missile silos in the\narea had remained open after liquid-fuel rockets were dismantled there in\nthe late 1970s. High concentrations of nitrates have been found in 57 percent of drinking\nwater supplied through a pipe system, 98 percent of water from wells and\nevery tenth food product checked, Moskalenko said in comments cited by the\nInterfax news agency. In the letter to Putin, Kuchma deplores the fact that Ukraine lacks\ninformation about such dumps, specifically about the burials of radioactive\nand chemical waste that pose ecological hazard.\n [Byline: Sergei Shargorodsky]\n--\nProMED-mail\n< About 400 residents of the villages near Mykolaiv, 320 miles south of the\ncapital Kiev, have been reported sick since 4 Jul 2000, but only a few new\ncases were registered this week, Health Minister Vitaliy Moskalenko said. The government,\nmeanwhile, appeared split on what caused the illness, with some officials\nblaming rocket fuel and others denying the possibility. In the letter to the Russian president, Kuchma asked him to call\nappropriate Russian structures for information about the burial in 1991 in\nUkraine of military equipment and radioactive and chemical waste. In the region is a\nbase holding solid-fuel SS-24 nuclear missiles, which are to be dismantled\nin 2001. Kuchma\nalso sees the need for consultations of experts of the 2 countries on these\nmatters, the Ukrainian president's press service reported to Tass on Thursday. [it is not established on\nthe basis of this and the next report that the illness is due to chemical\nexposure -Man. Most of the SS-24s along with missile silos remain to be destroyed\nunder a disarmament plan running through 2001.\n A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\n --\nProMED-mail\n< Kiev has since surrendered all\nits nuclear warheads to Russia and eliminated the last SS-19 missile in\n1999.

Diffuse hypotonia and\nhyporeflexia were noted. Babinski test was negative. Lungs were clear and\nheart sounds normal. The liver edge was smooth and palpated 3cm below the\ncostal margin; spleen was not enlarged. No icterus was noted. Urine was\nnegative for bilirubin. A spinal tap revealed 2 white cells and 408 red\ncells, no trypanosomes were found on a centrifuged specimen. Malaria smear\nagain was negative. A blood sugar was 97. An anticholinesterase agent\n(neostigmine) was given without effect. The child was started empirically\non intravenous quinine and dextrose.

One suggests a real world cause, one\nsuggests sorcery. As attempted sorcery is no less real than attempted\ndiagnosis, the reports are combined. - Mod.CHC]\n[1]\n[Digested] report by Dr Stephen Flew, Senior Medical Office, Ok Tedi Mining\nLtd, (written for Papua New Guinea Department of Health); Re: Outbreak of\nunknown disease /excess deaths, Sandaun Province\n[Investigation] indicated the [people] at Tapsie village were mostly\naffected by the usual skin afflictions common to the area such as grille\n(tinea imbicata), tropical ulcers, yaws, etc. as well as malaria,\nfilariasis, tropical splenomegaly and pneumonia. However there did not\nappear to be any excess of morbidity or mortality at this time, nor during\nthe drought. [The investigators] were told that the most affected areas were\nUrapmin and Ibikmen but that people had fled their usual dwellings due to\nfear of sorcery and were living in bush houses. They were strongly advised\nnot to go to these areas on foot by the people at Yapsie, because of the\ndangers of sorcery. The team were willing to go into Urapmin by chopper so\nwe flew them [there], accompanied by a local guide. The main village of\nUrapmin appeared deserted so we proceeded up the Aki river to an isolated\nhamlet and managed to land the chopper on a tiny beach in a nearby creek.\nThere seemed to be about 20-30 people living here, many covered in 'grille'\nand with swollen bellies but seemed to be saying they were all OK, as far as\nI could make out above the noise of the chopper. The terrain here is very\nbroken and mountainous and I believe these people must be in a chronic state\nof poor health, with no ready access to any form of health care. There did\nnot appear to have been any deaths there but we left a team behind to\ninvestigate further.\nThe other team (from the Health Dept. in Vanimo) had gone to Ibikmin\nvillage. When we arrived they had already left; apparently there were no\nproblems there either.\nWe proceeded to another isolated hamlet on a heavily forested ridge, known\nas Finyaksolmin. The second team had only just arrived the night before and\nhad had no chance to check the local population yet. They were told there\nhad been no deaths here but 2 people had died at nearby Firayabamin, one\nolder woman of COAD [?] and a young man of malaria (?).\nBack at Yapsie [the health worker] who had been left in charge for the last\nfew months reported that health-wise things [were bad but] hadn't really got\nany worse during the drought, with a high prevalence of childhood\nmalnutrition (30-50%) and many patients with chronic anaemia and\nhepatosplenomegaly (secondary to filariasis and malaria). There is a high\nproportion of refugees now residing amongst the locals at Yapsie who have\n[come] from over the border with Irian Jaya (just 10 kms away). The\npresence of the refugees in an already marginally productive environment\nexacerbates the malnutrition problem, and malnutrition is accepted as the\nnorm for growing children. No doubt the maternal, infant and childhood\nmortality rates must be amongst the highest in PNG, even under normal\nclimatological conditions. Even in October Yapsie appeared fairly green and\nnot much affected by drought. Now the Sepik river is in flood and there is\nlittle evidence of drought except for the extensive bushfires in the high\ncountry between here and Tabubil.\nA review of the Health Centre monthly reports at Yapsie indicates there was\nnot much change in outpatient illness rates for the common conditions of\ncough, pneumonia, other respiratory disease, diarrhoea, malaria, anaemia,\nyaws and other skin diseases during October-November (total of 1200\nattendances each month). During the first 3 weeks of December there appears\nto have been an increase in malaria, 'flu, diarrhoea and skin diseases (the\nlatter esp. from Munbil, ?some ulcers requiring skin grafts). However there\nhas been no increase in deaths recorded at Yapsie and the [administrator]\nfrom Fiak was also surprised to hear of the 10 deaths which were reported\nfrom his area, none of which he was aware of.\nIt would appear that the lay reporting of 19 deaths and 24-30 people\ncritically ill or comatose in the Yapsie and Fiak subdistricts of Telefomin\nhas been grossly exaggerated. The reporting of these deaths may have come\nabout due to the rumours of sorcery and the confusion arising from the\nabandonment of villages in the area. [He goes on to suggest that additional\nresources be made available to these isolated communities so that the\nincidence of filariasis, malaria, and other vector-borne diseases could be\nreduced.]\n\nDr. Stephen Flew, SMO\nOk Tedi Mining Ltd\nFlew.Stephen.S@bhp.com.au\n--\nDr J A Ballard, Visiting Fellow\nGraduate School, Australian National University, Canberra ACT 0200, Australia\nTel +61 2 6249 5487 Fax +61 2 6249 4829\nGraduate School web page http://online.anu.edu.au/academia/graduate/\ne-mail: john.ballard@anu.edu.au\n\n[2]\nDate: Wed, 24 Dec 1997 17:11:46 +0700 (JAVT)\nFrom: zulfian <ZULFIAN@JAYAPURA.WASANTARA.NET.ID>\nWe thank you for the attention and consideration on what happen in Irian\nJaya, especially in the highland of Jayawijaya.\nThe El Nino has affected the area to cause the drought since April 1997.
