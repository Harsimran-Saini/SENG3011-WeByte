They studied 62 cases, 34 exposed controls, and 18 nonexposed controls. Illness duration was significantly longer in people age 70 or older than in younger patients. Norovirus was detected in stool in 42 cases (68 percent). Shedding of norovirus in stool, which occurred for at least 21 days in 16 of 35 cases (47 percent), was significantly more likely if the initial stool sample had over 1010 copies of virus per gram than if it had fewer copies per gram. For GII.4 viruses, the researchers found no association between secretor status or blood type and symptomatic infection.\n\n[Byline: Doug Powell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail and Healthmap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Noroviruses are highly contagious. A person with norovirus infection can shed billions of norovirus particles, but it only takes as few as 18 viral particles to infect another person.\n\nPrimarily, noroviruses are spread through\n- close personal contact with an infected person, or\n- the fecal-oral route when a person consumes contaminated food or water.\n\nThe virus can also spread through touching contaminated surfaces, objects, or substances.\n\nIt is possible for norovirus to spread through aerosolized vomit that lands on surfaces or enters a person's mouth, which then he or she swallows. There is no evidence showing that people can become infected by breathing in the virus (excerpted from http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/hcp/clinical-overview.html).\n\nNoroviruses are responsible for more than 90 percent of viral gastroenteritis and about 50 percent of all-cause gastroenteral outbreaks worldwide. In the post above, illness duration was found to be significantly longer in people aged 70 or older, likely a consequence of diminishment of immune response in older individuals.\n\nIn another review of norovirus shedding (Milbrath MO, Spicknall IH, Zelner JL, et al. 2013. Heterogeneity in norovirus shedding duration affects community risk.

The impact of the latter on the epidemiology of the virus was found to increase the outbreak potential (measured by the reproductive number) by 50-80 percent, the probability of an outbreak by 33 percent, the severity of transmission (measured by the attack rate) by 20 percent, and transmission duration by 100 percent. - Mod.LK]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n The impact of the latter on the epidemiology of the virus was found to increase the outbreak potential (measured by the reproductive number) by 50-80 percent, the probability of an outbreak by 33 percent, the severity of transmission (measured by the attack rate) by 20 percent, and transmission duration by 100 percent.
