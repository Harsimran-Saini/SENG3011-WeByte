Last week, after a 23 year old man tested positive in Kerala, 318 people (including everyone in contact the patient) have been kept under observation, and 52 of them have been added to the high-risk category. Several states like Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and districts such as Kanyakumari, Coimbatore, Mysuru, Udupi sharing the border with Kerala are on high alert.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, fruit bats are the carriers of the deadly virus. The rare brain-damaging infection transmits through the partially-eaten fruits by infected bats.\n\nLast year in May [actually 2018. - Mod.SH], the virus claimed 17 lives in Kerala. The fear crept in internationally as well when the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment issued a ban on imports of fruits and vegetables from Kerala.\n\nWhile summer fruits are delicious and irresistible, you might want to exercise caution before indulging in them. Here are certain steps you must follow before eating mangoes, lychees, and dates:\n- prefer fresh, ripe and non-withered fruits;\n- avoid over-ripe and wet fruits, especially their colour appears different;\n- look for visible defects like cuts, dirt, or deformities before eating them;\n- ensure the fruits don't have a strange smell;\n- if you are buying fruits from the supermarket, don't opt for box that has damaged produce;\n- wash fruits and vegetables properly before eating;\n- it would be wiser to peel fruits before consuming them.\n\nYou might want to go easy on guavas this summer. While there is no confirmation yet, a young Kerala student recently claimed to have contracted the virus after eating guavas. A team of medical professionals from Thiruvananthapuram are investigating the matter.\n\nDrinking date palm sap, palm toddy, or juice can also [result in] infection. For a non-vegetarian, partially-cooked meat of an infected animal can lead to the spread of the virus.\n\nSteps to ensure you are consuming the right thing:\n- avoid fruit juices unless you know the source;\n- avoid consuming unpasteurised fruit juices;\n- boil freshly collected date palm juice before consuming.\n\nThe Nipah virus symptoms are flu-like, ranging from fever, headaches, myalgia (muscle pain), vomiting, sore throat, dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, to severe signs like seizures and neurological indications (indicating acute encephalitis).\n\nOther preventive measures:\n- avoid close (unprotected) physical contact with infected people;\n- wear NH95-grade and higher masks that protect the wearer from breathing in small particles in the air;\n- wash hands regularly with soap;\n- avoid being around animal pens;\n- maintain your and children's personal hygiene.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nipah virus (NIV) infections occurred in Kerala in 2018.

Fruit bats of the family Pteropodidae -- particularly species belonging to the _Pteropus_ genus -- are the natural hosts for Nipah virus. There is no apparent disease in fruit bats.\n\nIn more recent outbreaks of the disease, person-to-person transmission has been seen in Bangladesh and India. The disease in humans can range from asymptomatic infection to fatal encephalitis. Encephalitis and seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to coma within 24 to 48 hours. The case fatality rate is estimated at 40% to 75%; however, this rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for surveillance investigations, according to WHO.\n\nMost of those who survive acute encephalitis make a full recovery, but around 20% are left with residual neurological consequences such as persistent convulsions and personality changes.\n\nTable.

This is still early in the Nipah season, so more cases can be expected. Nipah virus infections occur sporadically in Bangladesh as documented in the 2001-2020 case numbers in the above table. Cases occur in a geographic area termed the Nipah belt and during certain seasons of the year when the reservoir fruit bat is abundant. As noted in the previous comment (ProMED-mail archive no. 20150204.3143251) and noted in the above report, giant fruit bats or flying foxes (_Pteropus_ of several species) are reservoirs of Nipah virus, and they contaminate date palm sap or fruit. This is the season for cases of Nipah virus infection to occur. The transmission season is usually January to April.\n\nAs noted earlier, it is unfortunate that the public awareness efforts have not prevented these cases from occurring. Perhaps because cases are sporadic and geographically scattered there is little public perception of risk of infection and serious disease. Until effective public education to prevent infection by avoiding eating contaminated fruit or date palm sap is implemented, sporadic cases will continue to occur.\n\nInterestingly, a simple skirt constructed out of locally available materials can prevent access of the bats to the palm sap collecting pots, but apparently they are not commonly used. Boiling the palm sap would inactivate the virus, but local consumers indicated that it alters the flavor of the sap.\n\nAn image of a pteropus fruit bat can be found at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Pteropus_giganteus_fg01.JPG. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nBangladesh: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/153]", "summary": "2003 / 12 / 0 / 0\n2004 / 67 / 50 / 75\n2005 / 13 / 11 / 85\n2006 / 0 / 0 / 0\n2007 / 18 / 9 / 50\n2008 / 11 / 9 / 82\n2009 / 4 / 0 / 0\n2010 / 18 / 16 / 69\n2011 / 42 / 36 / 86\n2012 / 18 / 13 / 72\n2013 / 26 / 22 / 85\n2014 / 38 / 15 / 39\n2015 / 18 / 11 / 61\n2016 / 0 / 0 / 0\n2017 / 3 / 2 / 67\n2018 / 4 / 3 / 75\n2019 / 8 / 7 / 88\n2020 / 6 / 4 / 67\nTotals / 319 / 225 / 71\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The total number of cases so far this year (2020) has reached 6.

The youth was admitted to hospital on 30 May [2019] and was in no condition to stand on his feet. He has now completely recovered.\n\nA year ago, the Nipah virus had claimed 18 lives in Kozhikode, Kerala. Unlike last year [2018], no loss of life has been reported so far in 2019. Health minister KK Shailaja is expected to be present during the discharge of the youth.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Institute of Virology has identified the presence of the deadly Nipah virus in 12 fruit bats out of the 36 samples tested at the institute. The medical department had collected hundreds of sputum samples of fruit bats from different parts of Kerala.\n\nTraining on preventive measures to avoid contracting the virus was imparted to 1293 persons in the state. The labour department inspected 12 migrant labour camps at North Paravur, Perumbavur, and Kakkanad areas to ensure hygiene standards were met.

As her infection is a risk to other patients, she is being treated separately at the hospital's Medicine unit 1,' said SM Kamal Hossain, chief of KMCH Medicine Department.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the Bangladesh and India outbreaks, consumption of fruits or fruit products (e.g. raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats was the most likely source of infection. Fruit bats of the family Pteropodidae -- particularly species belonging to the _Pteropus_ genus -- are the natural hosts for Nipah virus. There is no apparent disease in fruit bats.\n\nIn more recent outbreaks of the disease, person-to-person transmission has been seen in Bangladesh and India.\n\nThe disease in humans can range from asymptomatic infection to fatal encephalitis. Encephalitis and seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to coma within 24 to 48 hours.\n\nThe case fatality rate is estimated at 40% to 75%; however, this rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for surveillance investigations, according to the WHO.\n\nThose who survive acute encephalitis make a full recovery, but around 20% are left with residual neurological consequences, such as persistent convulsions and personality changes.\n\nThere is no treatment or vaccine available for either people or animals.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nand\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Nipah virus infections occur sporadically in Bangladesh in a geographic area termed the Nipah belt and during certain seasons of the year when the reservoir fruit bat is abundant.

These bats are well-adapted to living with people, and are common across the Indian subcontinent, 'extending all the way up to Nepal. In villages, we see hundreds to thousands of these bats roosted in hardwood trees. The size and density of these colonies matters,' Epstein said.\n\nHe cautioned that chasing the bats away will not solve the problem, since it would only redistribute them to other trees, creating denser colonies.\n\nThe scientists said as long as 60 to 70 percent of the bats in a population have protective antibodies against the virus, there's unlikely to be an outbreak.\n\n'What this study showed for the 1st time is that, over time, bats in the wild lose the antibodies which protect them from NiV reinfection,' Epstein said.\n\nWhen a great enough proportion of bats are immune to the virus, there's not much transmission, but when this fraction drops below a threshold, the whole colony becomes susceptible, he said.\n\nWhen that level drops, sometimes as low as 20 percent, the population is like a pile of dry wood, and as soon as someone throws a match on -- which is to say when NiV is introduced by an infected bat -- you get a bonfire, an outbreak, Epstein explained.\n\nThe scientists said outbreaks among bats in Bangladesh seem to occur every 2 years, adding that it is important to understand this periodicity.\n\nWhen there is an outbreak among bats, 'the greatest number of them' will be shedding the virus in their feces, urine, and other body fluids and create an opportunity for NiV to jump to people, Epstein said.\n\nStudies have shown that the virus may spill over to humans via date-palm saps or fruits contaminated by infected bats. 'In an earlier outbreak in Malaysia, pigs amplified the virus. They got infected and generated a lot more virus than bats do. So, people were getting infected by a large viral load,' Epstein said.\n\nThe researchers said people can be protected from exposure to the virus by 'simply preventing date palms from contamination, or by not eating fruits with bat bite marks, and making sure such fruits are not fed to livestock. Fortunately, the government of India has been starting to pay attention since the Kerala outbreak, and is also conducting investigation in bats,' Epstein added.\n\nThis is vital to determine the spectrum of NiV strains circulating in India and South Asia, to knowing whether there are more-virulent forms of the virus, and to making generalizable predictions on when bats experience outbreaks, Epstein said. He added that even if NiV outbreaks among fruit bats in India may follow a similar cyclic pattern, the periodicity may be different.\n\nCommenting on the study, virologist Upasana Ray, who was unrelated to the research team, said the findings highlight the importance of surveillance of animal pathogens to predict their odds of spilling over to humans.\n\n'NiV is one of the many viruses transmitted by bats and is seen to hit the headlines every year, or every other year, in countries including India,' Ray, a senior scientist at CSIR-IICB, Kolkata, told PTI.\n\nShe believes the identification of such viruses, and development of therapeutic strategies from early on, might help decrease their effects on human lives.\n\n'Nipah viruses continue to jump from bats to people, and we can't afford to wait for another pandemic to take actions,' Epstein said. 'Those actions don't mean killing bats but rather protecting our food from contamination with bat droppings,' he added.\n\n[1. Epstein JH, Anthony SJ, Islam A, Kilpatrick AM, et al.

Science Translational Medicine 2019: 11; 494, eaau9242, DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aau9242\n\nAbstract\n--------\nNipah virus is an emerging pathogen in the _Paramyxoviridae_ family. Upon transmission of Nipah virus from its natural reservoir, _Pteropus_ spp. fruit bats, to humans, it causes respiratory and neurological disease with a case fatality rate about 70%. Human-to-human transmission has been observed during Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. A therapeutic treatment for Nipah virus disease is urgently needed. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir (GS-5734), a broad-acting antiviral nucleotide prodrug, against Nipah virus Bangladesh genotype in African green monkeys. Animals were inoculated with a lethal dose of Nipah virus, and a once-daily intravenous remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 hours later and continued for 12 days. Mild respiratory signs were observed in 2 of 4 treated animals, whereas all control animals developed severe respiratory disease signs. In contrast to control animals, which all succumbed to the infection, all remsdesivir-treated animals survived the lethal challenge, indicating that remdesivir represents a promising antiviral treatment for Nipah virus infection.\n\nIntroduction [abridged]\n-----------------------\nNipah virus causes severe and often fatal respiratory and neurological disease in humans (1). The recent Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, India, involving 23 cases and 21 deaths (2), again stressed the urgent need to develop prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures against Nipah virus. The World Health Organization has listed Nipah virus as an emerging pathogen likely to cause major epidemics or even pandemics (3). Very few antivirals have demonstrated efficacy in animal models of Nipah virus disease.\n\nDiscussion [abridged]\n---------------------\nAlthough histologic evidence of meningoencephalitis was seen in one of 4 remdesivir-treated animals, remdesivir is distributed to the brain upon intravenous administration (15), and thus, remdesivir treatment may be reinitiated in cases of late-onset or relapse Nipah virus encephalitis. Intravenous remdesivir treatment was administered to a patient with acute Ebola virus meningitis that developed 9 months after the initial discharge (16), and a similar approach could potentially be used in late-onset or relapse encephalitis cases of Nipah virus infection. Remdesivir is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial in Liberia and Guinea to determine whether it can affect the persistent Ebola virus shedding in semen of Ebola male survivors (17). Likewise, treating survivors of Nipah virus infection with remdesivir could be considered to aid in completely clearing the virus, thereby preventing future relapses. If our finding of differential neutralizing antibody responses in persistently infected animals versus animals that apparently cleared the virus can be confirmed in human Nipah virus survivors, then a cohort of patients that may benefit from remdesivir treatment may be determined using a standard serological assay.\n\n--\ncommunicated by Mary Marshall\n\n[The results of this limited experiment indicate that further tests are justified and needed. The authors point out that the treatment was administered relatively soon (1 day) after infection was initiated. It will be important to know how long into the infection, drug administration will be effective. Seeking medical attention and treatment very early in the course of an infection may not be practical in the field and limit usefulness of the drug. However, because the virus can be transmitted from infected to susceptible individuals, prophylactic treatment of contacts may be effective. The authors point out that the drug may be useful to prevent relapse encephalitis among survivors of the infection. Nipah virus infections occur almost every year in Bangladesh and practical and effective treatment is needed. Results of further studies are awaited with interest. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nBangladesh: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/153]", "summary": "If our finding of differential neutralizing antibody responses in persistently infected animals versus animals that apparently cleared the virus can be confirmed in human Nipah virus survivors, then a cohort of patients that may benefit from remdesivir treatment may be determined using a standard serological assay.

The result came this morning [4 Jun 2019], she added. Earlier, blood samples examined at 2 virology institutes -- Manipal Institute of Virology and Kerala Institute of Virology and Infectious Diseases -- had indicated Nipah [virus].\n\nShailaja said the condition of the student, who is being treated at a private hospital [in Kochi], is stable and he was not put under any support system like a ventilator. 'Good care is being given to the patient. The patient sometimes become restless due to fever...We expect a good result,' she said.\n\nThe minister further said a list of 86 people who have interacted with the student has been prepared and they were under medical observation. Out of the 86, 2 are suffering from fever and one has been shifted to the isolation ward set up at the Kalamassery Medical College Hospital [in Kochi], she added. Also under observation of the health department are 2 nurses who had initially attended to the patient, complained of sore throat and fever. The Minister urged people not to panic and take precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n'We have confidence that we can face it. We have faced it in Kozhikode last year [2018] and contained it,' she said trying to instil confidence among people. Appealing to social media users not to spread panic among the public, she said stringent action would be taken against those indulging in such acts.\n\nUnion Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has given an assurance that an anti-NiV drug developed in Australia would be provided to the state to deal with the disease, she noted. Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are the natural host of the Nipah virus. Nipah virus can be transmitted to humans from animals (such as bats or pigs), or contaminated foods and can also be transmitted directly from human-to-human.\n\nMedical experts from Kozhikode have already reached Kochi and there were enough medicines and medical equipment to deal with the situation, she said.\n\nA control room has been opened in Ernakulam district headquarters. Health authorities in Thrissur had said the student, who was suffering from fever, had sought medical assistance at 2 private hospitals in that city when he had come to Kochi for a training programme recently as part of his course. The infected student from Ernakulam district is studying in Thodupuzha in Idukki district.\n\nOfficials said the family and neighbours of the young man were also under observation. On 19 May 2018, a Nipah virus disease (NiV) outbreak was reported from Kozhikode in Malappuram district.\n\nAs per state government figures, the Nipah virus had claimed 17 lives -- 14 in Kozhikode and 3 in neighbouring Malappuram in May last year [2018]. According to the WHO, Nipah virus is a newly emerging disease that can be transmitted from its reservoir (natural wildlife host), the flying foxes (fruit bats), to both animals and humans. It takes its name from Sungai Nipah, a village in Malaysia where it was first identified.\n\nSymptoms range from asymptomatic infection, acute respiratory infection (mild, severe), and fatal encephalitis. Infected people initially develop influenza-like symptoms of fever, headache, myalgia, vomiting, and sore throat. This can be followed by dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurological signs that indicate acute encephalitis.\n\nSome people can also experience atypical pneumonia and severe respiratory problems, including acute respiratory distress. Encephalitis and seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to coma within 24 to 48 hours.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The exact circumstances under which the case above acquired his infection and date the illness began are not stated in the report.

Earlier, blood samples examined at 2 virology institutes -- Manipal Institute of Virology and Kerala Institute of Virology and Infectious Diseases -- had indicated Nipah [virus]. \n\nUnion Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has given an assurance that an anti-NiV drug developed in Australia would be provided to the state to deal with the disease, she noted. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The exact circumstances under which the case above acquired his infection and date the illness began are not stated in the report.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "nipah virus"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2018-05-19 00:00:00", "2018-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Assam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Bengal 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Thrissur", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kerala", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ernakulam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malappuram", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pune", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kochi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Idukki", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5909148", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Nipah virus - India (16): (KL) review", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5909148", "date": "2018-07-17 02:29:38", "main_text": "NIPAH VIRUS - INDIA (16): (KERALA) REVIEW\n*****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 16 Jul 2018\nSource: The Hindu, Press Trust of India (PTI) [edited]\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/17-picked-nipah-virus-from-first-victim-finds-kerala-govt-study/article24428589.ece\n\n\nA detailed study by the Kerala government on the recent outbreak of Nipah virus has suggested that 17 of the 19 infected people might have contracted the deadly virus from the 1st victim, 26 year old [MS].

The outbreak was localized to 2 districts in Kerala state: Kozhikode and Malappuram. No new cases or deaths have been reported since 1 Jun 2018 and, as of 30 Jul [2018], human-to-human transmission of NiV has been contained in Kerala State.\n\nAs reported in the Disease Outbreak News published on 31 May 2018, 3 deaths due to NiV infection were reported on 19 May [2018] from Kozhikode District, Kerala State; 3 of the 4 reported deaths were confirmed positive for NiV by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and IgM ELISA for NiV.\n\n[Of these,] 2 patients recovered completely and were discharged from the hospital. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and encephalitis were observed among the patients infected. This was the 1st NiV outbreak reported in Kerala State and the 3rd NiV outbreak known to have occurred in India; the 2 previous outbreaks occurred in the state of West Bengal in 2001 and 2007.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nGovernment response\n- A multidisciplinary central team from the National Centre for Disease Control was sent to Kerala to investigate and respond, in close coordination with state government officials.\n- More than 2600 contacts were identified and followed up during the outbreak. All symptomatic contacts were investigated and tested for NiV.\n- Syndromic surveillance was enhanced in Kerala State. Hospital and community surveillance were also strengthened in Kerala. The Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory at Manipal Hospital and the National Institute of Virology conducted laboratory testing to confirm and rule out cases.\n- The central team provided Kerala officials with the following guidelines and reference materials for Nipah virus, which were made publically available during the outbreak: case definitions; guidelines for hospital infection prevention and control; guidelines for sample collection and transportation; clinical management guidelines for suspected and confirmed cases; guidelines for safe disposal of dead bodies of confirmed Nipah virus cases; and information for the general public and for health care personnel. Risk communication messages were delivered to the community, public, partners and other stakeholders.\n- Training and capacity building for health care personnel were done in the following areas: sample collection and transportation; safe disposal of dead bodies; contact tracing; hospital waste management; hospital infection prevention and control; and the use of personal protective equipment.\n- The government coordinated [activities among] all relevant sectors including zoonoses, wildlife, animal husbandry, human health, clinicians, pulmonologists, neurologists and the private sector.\n- The Strategic Health Operations Centre (SHOC) at the National Centre for Disease Control was activated to monitor the outbreak.\n- The Ministry of Health provided the Kerala government with 5000 personal protective equipment kits and 100 body bags.\n- Samples from animals (bats, pigs, cows, and goats) tested at National High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory at Bhopal early in the outbreak tested negative for NiV. Later, _Pteropus giganteus_ bats (the reservoir of NiV infection) were collected from areas around the house of the index case in Kozhikode, Kerala to understand the circulation of NiV in bats in the affected area; 19 per cent (10 of 52) of the bats were found positive by RT-PCR for NiV.\n\nWHO response\n- As per the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the event was notified to WHO on 23 May 2018 and WHO published a Disease Outbreak News on 31 May 2018.\n- WHO provided technical materials and guidance on Nipah virus disease to the Ministry of Health and Kerala State health authorities, and provided technical support to the Ministry of Health.\n- WHO continues to work closely with the Ministry of Health to strengthen overall indicator- and event-based surveillance for epidemic-prone diseases and strengthen overall IHR (2005) capacities.\n- WHO is also working with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to advance the research agenda for the Nipah research and development (R&D) blueprint. WHO will continue working closely with the Ministry of Health to ensure that health systems preparedness for emerging zoonoses is strengthened in the country.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nNiV infection is an emerging zoonotic disease of public health importance in the WHO South East Asia Region with a high case fatality rate estimated to range between 40 and 75 per cent; however, this rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management. NiV was first recognized in 1998-1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore. No subsequent outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia or Singapore since 1999. NiV was first recognized in India and Bangladesh in 2001; since then, nearly annual outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh. The disease has been identified periodically in eastern India (2001, 2007).\n\nLimited human-to-human transmission of NiV can occur among unprotected family members and health workers who treat infected patients. Fruit bats of the genus _Pteropus_ are the natural reservoirs of NiV. Possible routes of transmission of NiV include consumption of fruit contaminated by the saliva of infected bats, from direct contact with infected bats or their feces/urine, or human-to-human transmission through unprotected close contact with an infected patient in the community or hospital. Many cases identified in the current outbreak were infected through direct unprotected contact with other infected persons.\n\nThis outbreak is the 3rd Nipah virus outbreak in India. The country demonstrated its capacity to rapidly contain the outbreak, including by the identification of cases, verifying cases with laboratory testing and caring for patients.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nCurrently, there is no evidence of NiV infection in humans in Kerala state; however, surveillance for NiV in humans and fruit bats should be maintained in endemic areas.\n\nWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on India based on the information currently available on this event.\n\nCurrently, there are no specific treatments available for Nipah virus disease and care is supportive. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications.\n\nNiV infection can be prevented by avoiding exposure to bats and sick pigs in endemic areas, and by avoiding consuming fruits partially-eaten by infected bats or drinking raw date palm sap/toddy/juice. The risk of international transmission via fruit contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats can be prevented by washing them thoroughly and peeling them before consumption. Fruit with signs of bat bites should be discarded.\n\nIn healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. Health care workers caring for a patient suspected to have NiV fever should immediately contact local and national experts for guidance and to arrange for laboratory testing.\n\nResearch is needed to better understand the ecology of bats and NiV.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The report above provides what one hopes is a final summary of the Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala and it is also to be hoped that the WHO recommendations will be adopted. No additional cases have been reported recently.\n\nThe distribution of Nipah virus in the bat reservoir requires further study. As mentioned earlier, although Nipah virus was not found in bats in the area in Kerala state where the infections occurred, a subsequent report of a study stated that _Pteropus giganteus_ bats with Nipah virus had been found in Assam's Dhubri and West Bengal's Cooch Behar districts.

Health minister J P Nadda was informed about the findings in a meeting last week.\n\nIn the meeting, scientists from ICMR and public health officials also told the minister that circumstances have now improved enough for the state to be declared Nipah free. The incubation period of Nipah is 5 to 14 days.

As was mentioned earlier, it is not surprising that the bats taken from the well were negative for the virus. Giant fruit bats (flying foxes genus _Pteropus_), the reservoir of Nipah virus in Bangladesh and Malaysia, do not roost in wells. They roost in tree tops. The species sampled in the 2nd batch of bats was not mentioned, but were likely flying foxes. It is fortunate that virus positive bats were found in this 2nd sampling. As commented earlier, bats 'may only be infectious for a week or 2, and then they clear the virus and they're no longer infectious,' said Jonathan Epstein, a veterinarian and epidemiologist at EcoHealth Alliance, New York, who has, for over a decade, studied Nipah outbreaks and the bats that cause them, in Malaysia, India and Bangladesh.

Despite the Union Health Ministry maintaining that the virus outbreak is a localised occurrence and there is no need to panic, fear runs high across the country.\n\nPanic gripped Himachal Pradesh when several bats were found dead at Government Senior Secondary School in Barmapapri in Sirmaur district this week.

A report submitted by a central medical team to the Union Health Ministry also ruled out pigs to be the primary source of the virus.\n\nThe medical team led by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is now looking into other possible reasons behind the outbreak following the report findings.\n\nA total of 21 samples, including those from 7 species of bats, 2 species of pigs, one bovine, and one caprine, were sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal and the National Institute of Virology in Pune, said an official from the Ministry. 'These included the samples of the bats which were found in the well in a house in Kerala's Perambra from where the initial death was reported. They have tested negative for the Nipah virus,' he said.\n\nSamples from humans suspected of contracting Nipah virus have tested negative, 'which means there are only 15 confirmed cases, which include 12 deaths, and 3 persons are undergoing treatment,' the official added. Similarly, the samples from bats found dead in Himachal Pradesh, which were sent to the Pune Institute, have been found negative, and the 2 samples of suspected cases from Hyderabad were also negative.\n\nThe Health Ministry has urged people not to panic, asserting that the outbreak is 'localised' to Kerala.

The deceased, who hails from Naduvannur, was earlier tested negative for the virus. His results came back positive after a 2nd test.\n\nAccording to reports, this case had been shifted to Kozhikode Medical College on 26 May [2018] from Balussery Taluk Hospital following severe fever and symptoms of Nipah [virus infection]. He is reported to have been in the list of those who were in contact with the 1st victims of Nipah.

The number of deaths resulting from the outbreak of the Nipah virus infection had stabilised at 13, with 2 others undergoing treatment at the Kozhikode Medical College showing signs of recovery.\n\nMore than 150 blood and fluid samples of suspected patients sent for testing had come back negative and there were no new positive cases. Health officials and doctors had heaved a sigh of relief believing the storm had passed. But, with 3 more deaths reported in the last 2 days, Kozhikode and its adjoining district of Malappuram have once again sunk into a state of consternation.\n\nAs per the latest figures of the health department updated as of [Thu 31 May 2018] evening, 16 patients have now succumbed to the virus [now increased to 17], excluding the 1st victim whose samples were never sent for testing. He is believed to be the 'index' case from whom the virus spread but since his death occurred before the samples could be sent for testing, it was never confirmed by medical officials.\n\nA total of 18 cases have been deemed positive for the virus, with 14 in Kozhikode and 4 in Malappuram district. Out of a total of 196 fluid samples sent for testing to National Institute of Virology in Pune, 178 samples have come back negative. As of [Thu 31 May 2018] evening, a total of 11 people are under observation and being routinely checked for any signs of the virus.\n\nThe health department on [Fri 1 Jun 2018] issued an advisory asking those who were at the Medical College in Kozhikode visiting the casualty, CT scan room and waiting room on [Mon 14 May 2018] between 10 am and 5 pm to immediately contact the state Nipah cell for directions. It also asked those who visited the Balussery Taluk Hospital on [Fri 18 and Sat 19 May 2018] till 2 pm to do the same. Those, who were in contact with the deceased on [Wed 30 and Thu 31 May 2018], must also get in touch with the Nipah cell, the department said.\n\nTill now, health officials were under the impression that the point of contact between the infected and ordinary patients was limited to the Medical College and the Perambra Taluk Hospital, where the 1st victim was initially admitted. But now, the surveillance has been extended to the Balussery hospital as well, where the 25-year-old man, the latest victim, was 1st admitted. With his death, the health department has realised that it has to substantially expand the contact list and bring more people, who may have been in contact at these hospitals at those specific hours, into it.\n\nContact list widens beyond govt's expectations, large health squads being raised\n\nA senior health official, requesting anonymity, said the recent death a truck driver, who is believed to have contracted the infection from the 'index' case at the casualty ward of the Medical College, has given the health department reason to worry. The truck driver's name was never present in the 'contact' list of those who were in close touch with the earlier deceased. But officials say he had visited the casualty section of the Medical College when he was a bystander for another patient, around the same time the 'index' case visited the hospital.\n\n'Initially, our contact list had around 800 persons, but now after the truck driver's death, the list has expanded beyond our expectations. So the department is now raising large health squads with officials from the panchayat and revenue teams to individually monitor these people. It is a huge task. We will 1st divide these contacts based on high-risk and low-risk. Then we will use our resources to individually contact them and ask them about their conditions. If they report any sort of uneasiness in the last few days, then we can get them to the hospital right away,' he said.\n\nIt is clear that the source of the outbreak originated from the family who resided in Soopikada in Changaroth panchayat. The 1st suspected victim of the virus (suspected because his sample was never tested) was a 23-year-old, who may have come in contact with an infected fruit-bat, considered the natural carriers of the NiV. While that man, initially admitted to Perambra taluk hospital, passed away on [Sat 5 May 2018], his elder brother and his paternal aunt too died in quick succession in the 3rd week of May. It was these deaths, all within the same family, that sparked concerns in the health department and prompted them to send samples for testing, all of which came back positive. Last week [week of Sun 20 May 2018], the 3rd death in the family occurred when one, who had been put on ventilator at the Medical College, also passed away.\n\nA senior doctor, a member of the core team, confirmed to India Express that all except one of the 16 casualties had contracted the virus through primary contact with any of the members of the involved family. These transmissions are likely to have taken place either at the Perambra hospital or the Medical College's CT scan area, the ICU and the corridors of the radiology department. Some cases include a nurse who had taken care of 2 of the victims as well as a 3rd who had been admitted.\n\nOnly the latest victim is believed to have got [the virus] transmitted from a secondary contact -- one of the earlier victims of the virus. It is being suspected that both men had slept on beds beside each other at the hospital in Balussery. While the other was admitted to the Medical College [hospital] on [Thu 31 May 2018] with symptoms of encephalitis; he died the same day.\n\n'Every unnatural death needs to be investigated. We were able to make early diagnosis and early detection, but it is true that the surveillance and measures to contain the infection especially at the Medical College should have been strengthened,' an official admitted. 'Infection progresses fast leaving little time for recovery'.\n\nDr G Arunkumar, head of the Department for Virus Research at Manipal, said the strain of virus detected in Kerala is very similar to the cases found in Bangladesh. 'Our preliminary analysis suggests that the strain found here is closer to the Bangladeshi virus strain, almost 98 percent similar. The Bangladeshi strain had a much higher mortality rate than the strain which was 1st discovered in Malaysia,' he said.\n\nWith only 2 patients, who were tested positive for the virus, recovering, the mortality rate in Kerala has been a shocking 90 percent. Even though the incubation period is quite long, ranging from 4 days to 21 days, sometimes even extending in rare cases to 60 days, the rate of the spread of the infection is very fast, leaving little time for the patient to recover. Death, in most cases, happens due to cerebral haemorrhage.\n\n'By the time we identify the case, the recovery period may be less,' he added. However, Dr Arunkumar stressed that there is no need to panic as the infection has not gone out of control. 'It is still under our control because it has not gone into the community.

The 3 deaths occurred in a family cluster and a 4th death was subsequently reported in a health care worker who was involved in treatment of the family in the local hospital. Laboratory testing of throat swabs, urine and blood samples collected from 4 suspected patients has been conducted by the National Institute of Virology in Pune; 3 of the 4 reported deaths were confirmed positive for Nipah virus (NiV) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and IgM Elisa for NiV.\n\nThe field investigation team found bats living in the abandoned water well on the premises of a new house where the family had plans to move after renovation. One bat was caught and sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune for laboratory testing. [These were insectivorous bats and unlikely reservoirs of the virus. - Mod.TY]\n\nAs of 28 May 2018 and since the beginning of the outbreak, as a result of further investigations and contact tracing, 15 people have tested positive for NiV in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts, Kerala State. Of the 15 laboratory-confirmed cases, 2 are hospitalized and 13 have died, including the health care worker who was involved in treatment of the deceased. As of 28 May [2018], 13 deaths have been reported: 3 from Malappuram District and 10 from Kozhikode District. One deceased case, the index case, could not be tested but was epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case. There are 16 suspected cases identified through contact tracing who are under observation while their laboratory results are pending and at least 753 additional people, including health care workers, under observation. Laboratory testing is being conducted by the Manipal Institute of Virus Research and the National Institute of Virology, Pune; both laboratories have advanced capacity for RT-PCR.\n\nIn the current outbreak, acute respiratory distress syndrome and encephalitis have been observed.\n\nThis is the 1st NiV outbreak reported in Kerala State and 3rd NiV outbreak known to have occurred in India, with the most recent outbreak reported in 2007.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nGovernment response:\n- A multi-disciplinary central team from the National Centre for Disease Control was sent to Kerala to investigate and respond. Contact tracing has been initiated. Infection prevention and control measures have been strengthened in health facilities.\n- Acute fever and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) surveillance have been enhanced across the state. Hospital and community surveillance have also been strengthened in Kerala.\n- The Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory at Manipal Hospital and the National Institute of Virology are conducting laboratory testing to confirm cases.\n- The government is coordinating with all relevant sectors including zoonosis, wildlife, animal husbandry, human health, clinicians, pulmonologists, neurologists and private sector.\n- Risk communication messages are being delivered to the community, public, stakeholders, and partners. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has shared guidelines drafted by the National Centre for Disease Control with states and relevant stakeholders and also posted them on the MoHFW website.\n\nWHO response:\n- WHO is in contact with national authorities and continues to closely monitor this event.\n- At the request of the MoHFW, WHO has shared materials, especially risk communication materials on Nipah virus, including those used in Bangladesh.\n- The MoHFW is conducting preliminary investigations and may request that WHO support the response.\n- The MoHFW is coordinating a multi-dimensional investigation and may request support from WHO.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nNiV infection is an emerging zoonotic disease of public health importance in the WHO South-East Asia Region with a high case fatality rate estimated to be between 40 and 75 percent; however, this rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management. NiV was 1st recognized in 1998-1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore. No subsequent outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia or Singapore since 1999. NiV was 1st recognized in India and Bangladesh in 2001; since then, nearly annual outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh. The disease has been identified periodically in eastern India (2001, 2007).\n\nLimited human-to-human transmission of NiV can occur among family members and health workers who treat infected patients. Large fruit bats of the genus _Pteropus_ are the natural reservoirs of NiV and given the wide distribution of the species and migration of the locally-abundant fruit bats in India, the risk of exposure to NiV is high. Nevertheless, previous outbreaks in affected countries have had a strong seasonal pattern and a limited geographical range.\n\nPossible routes of transmission for this outbreak include consumption of fruits partially eaten by the bats, exposure to the virus by bats or human-to-human transmission through unprotected close contact in the community or hospital. Many cases identified in the current outbreak were infected through direct unprotected contact with other infected persons.\n\nGiven that India has faced and contained Nipah virus outbreaks before, the country has the capacity to rapidly respond and verify cases with laboratory testing. At the moment, the outbreak is localized and WHO assesses the risk to be low at the national and regional levels.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nCurrently, there are no specific treatments available for Nipah virus disease and care is supportive. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications.\n\nNiV infection can be prevented by avoiding exposure to sick pigs and bats in endemic areas, and by avoiding consuming fruits partially-eaten by infected bats or drinking raw date palm sap/toddy/juice.\n\nIn health care settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. Health care workers caring for a patient suspected to have NiV fever should immediately contact local and national experts for guidance and to arrange for laboratory testing.\n\nResearch is needed to better understand the ecology of bats and NiV.\n\nWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on India based on the information currently available on this event.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[This outbreak is moving along fast enough that the WHO numbers of fatalities and individuals under observation are out-of-date. However, the responses, risk assessments and advice are of interest.

They reached the conclusion after decoding the full genome of the virus drawn from the throat swab sample of an infected patient.\n\nThe Nipah virus has 2 strains -- Malaysia (NiVM) and Bangladesh (NiVB). Both the strains have high fatality rates, between 60 and 85 percent, the scientists said.\n\n'Sequencing of the genetic make-up of the virus revealed that the Indian Nipah virus genome is genetically similar to the Bangladesh strain,' senior scientist and NIV-Pune director Devendra Mourya told TOI on [Tue 29 May 2018]. Both the strains have more or less an equal mortality rate and are responsible for local outbreaks. 'No study has so far proved that the Bangladesh strain is more lethal or pathogenic than the Malaysia strain,' Mourya said.\n\nNipah [virus] was 1st reported in Bangladesh's Meherpur district as a cause of an outbreak of encephalitis in 2001. Since then, Nipah [virus] outbreaks have been reported almost every year in some districts of the neighbouring country. 'Studies in Bangladesh have revealed that consumption of palm sap infected with bat urine and saliva was mostly responsible for the transmission of the infection from bats to humans and then humans to humans as well,' NIV scientist Pragya Yadav said.\n\nSince the outbreak of the virus earlier this month [May 2018], 13 people have died of Nipah [virus infection] in Kerala .\n\nA central team comprising experts from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the NIV has visited the Government Medical College in Kozhikode to understand gaps in the hospital's infection control measures and medical management. 'Our specialized team is working with the central team on the field and also at the hospital to contain the outbreak. They are also working in and around houses of people diagnosed with the infection in the beginning to find the possible links of infection,' Mourya said.\n\nThe samples of bats found in the well of a house in Perambra, considered the epicentre of the outbreak in Kerala, tested negative for the virus at the designated laboratory in Bhopal. 'The bats whose samples were tested at the Bhopal lab were not fruit bats (_Pteropus giganteus_ [medius_]).

Last week [week of Sun 20 May 2018], the state animal husbandry department captured and tested insectivorous bats (_Megaderma spasma_) from a well in the compound belonging to a family whose members were the virus's 1st victims - and found no virus in them.\n\nNews reports have pointed out that the virus's reservoir is different: fruit bats of the species _Pteropus medius_ (formerly _Pteropus giganteus_). A fresh effort is underway to capture and test fruit bats - but the delay could mean that the virus may not be found in them at all. Should this happen, it still wouldn't mean that bats were not the source of the virus.\n\nThis is because it is difficult to find a bat that is infected.\n\nBats 'may only be infectious for a week or 2, and then they clear the virus and they're no longer infectious,' said Jonathan Epstein, a veterinarian and epidemiologist at EcoHealth Alliance, New York, who has, for over a decade, studied Nipah outbreaks and the bats that cause them, in Malaysia, India and Bangladesh. 'That's why these outbreaks are relatively rare events, given the fact that these bats are so abundant and so common but very few of them are ever actually shedding virus at a given time.'\n\nEpstein and others had conducted an experimental study of _Pteropus_ bats in 2011 and found that the time window in which the bats are capable of passing on the infection to other animals or humans is quite small. In fact, the virus can't be found in experimentally infected bats after a few weeks. The few bats in an infected population that could be shedding the virus may be doing so in low quantities and for a short duration.\n\n'Finding that bats don't have Nipah virus at the time of sampling certainly doesn't mean that it didn't come from those bats, particularly _P. medius_,' Epstein said. 'The overwhelming abundance of evidence really shows that this bat is the reservoir for Nipah virus on the subcontinent in Bangladesh and in India.'\n\nThe National Centre for Disease Control, which is involved in investigating the Kerala outbreak, is aware of this, too.\n\nIn Bangladesh, Nipah virus infections arise from consuming date palm sap contaminated by bat urine or saliva. On the other hand, the outbreak in Malaysia in 1998 was traced to pigs that ate fruits infected by bats; the pigs had then passed the infection on to humans. Domesticated animals sampled in the area of the Kerala outbreak have so far not been found to carry the virus.\n\nIt is possible that the virus may have arrived in Kerala in infected fruits, some of which the 1st victim might have consumed. But it's more likely that the virus has always been silently circulating in the wild.\n\n_Pteropus_ bats are known to be the reservoir species for the Nipah and the closely related Hendra viruses, collectively called henipaviruses. And evidence of a henipavirus infection has been found in _Pteropus_ bats in a wide region, from Australia to Madagascar. This, along with the fact that infected bats do not show any overt signs of illness, suggests that these bats have co-evolved with henipaviruses.\n\nIn India, fruit bats have been tested for the Nipah virus. A 2012 study by researchers from the National Institute of Virology, Pune, and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention had found the virus in only one of 140 bats tested in Maharashtra and West Bengal. The other 139 bats were not found to have even the antibodies necessary to fight the virus. (The paper noted the need for a systematic survey to understand the Nipah virus's distribution.)\n\nA 2008 paper had found that 20 of 41 bats tested in Haryana had antibodies to the Nipah virus. Apart from the difference in location, this disparity in the proportion of bats with antibodies to the virus is not surprising, according to Epstein.\n\n'In Pteropid bats and _P. medius_ in particular, we find that there are different proportions of bats in any given colony exposed to the Nipah virus when we look,' he said. This proportion is always changing, and what such surveys reveal will only be a snapshot.\n\nIn Kerala, the state department of animal husbandry has been criticised for having sampled insectivorous bats 1st. The bats had been captured from a well reportedly cleaned by the 1st victims of the virus before they had fallen ill. But this choice - seemingly done in a bid to allay public anxiety - and the negative result has now sowed confusion, with news reports claiming wrongly that bats have been proven to not be the source of the infection.\n\nThe virus's 1st victim (although he wasn't tested for it) died on [Sat 5 May 2018]. Since then, fruit bats in the area that may have been the source of the virus could have cleared the virus from their bodies.\n\n'Depending on when bats are sampled, it really does make a difference as to whether we will or won't detect the virus,' said Epstein. This delay, together with the fact that only a small number of bats in any given colony are infectious to begin with, means that it's possible the virus won't be found from fruit bats in the area.\n\nOne workaround is to sample a larger number of bats at a time. However, only 3 insectivorous bat samples from the well were tested, according to Scroll. The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal, which is testing the samples, has now asked for 50 fruit bat samples. Further, the test results of samples displayed in the news report show that they were tested for viral genetic material, not antibodies. Arun Zachariah, of the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Wayanad, confirmed this. He had been involved in capturing the bats and collecting blood, urine, saliva and faecal samples. If deliberate, it's unclear why this choice of test was made.\n\nAntibodies are easier to detect, and if Nipah antibodies are found in bats in the area, it would be evidence that the virus has indeed been circulating among them. (Bats are known to lose antibodies too, Epstein said, though the period over which this happens is unknown.)\n\nDifferences between various outbreaks\nAnalysis of Nipah outbreaks in Bangladesh between 2001 and 2007 suggests that there have been more than 20 instances of bat-to-human transmissions of the virus. In Malaysia in 1998, it seems there had been a single transmission from bat to pig, which was responsible for an epidemic that killed 105 people and led to the mass culling of pigs.\n\nAnimals - cattle and goats apart from pigs - in the vicinity of affected areas in Bangladesh were found to have antibodies to a virus similar to Nipah, and many humans infected in these outbreaks had had contact with sick animals. After the outbreak in Siliguri, West Bengal, by contrast, domestic animals were not tested to see if they could have been intermediate hosts - nor were bats.\n\nHalf the patients in the numerous outbreaks in Bangladesh had been infected by other people. The human-to-human transmission during the 2001 outbreak in Siliguri was also high, about 75 percent. The ratio was similarly high in the Kerala outbreak as well, with the 1st confirmed patient suspected to have acquired it from his brother, the latter died on [Sat 5 May 2018].\n\nAll known cases since then have either been family members of the index case, people who had had contact with him or those who had shared a hospital ward with others who had acquired the infection from him. Thus far, the virus has claimed 14 lives, with 3 more infected people in intensive care.\n\nA more disastrous outbreak may have been averted partly because not all patients appeared to transmit the virus. In the 1998 outbreak in Malaysia, no confirmed case of human-to-human transmission was recorded, while in Bangladesh only 7 percent of patients had infected others.\n\nThere is another difference: the Malaysia strain of the virus caused neurological symptoms - below normal or absent reflexes, involuntary contractions of muscles, difficulty in eye movement - in humans. The Bangladesh and West Bengal strains (similar to each other) appeared to cause more severe respiratory symptoms in addition to neurological ones. Further, patients who had difficulty breathing had been found to be more likely to infect others.\n\nKnown unknowns\nThat not all Nipah-infected patients transmit the virus appears to be the case in the present outbreak in Kerala as well, according to observations made by G. Arunkumar of the Manipal Centre for Virus Research, Manipal. He noted that only patients in the disease's acute stage appeared to infect others.\n\nWhy this is so is unknown. 'I think one of the things we're still working to learn in the scientific community,' said Epstein, 'is how the genetics of the virus translates into the clinical outcomes for patients in terms of how easily it spreads from person to person and how severe the disease is.'\n\nThere remain other mysteries about the virus and its ecology. 'Disease emergence,' one paper noted, 'is fundamentally an ecological process - the challenge is to identify the underlying drivers, and counter them.'\n\nWe don't yet know what these drivers are. What are the mechanisms by which the virus is kept in circulation among bats? What are the particular factors that must occur together for the virus to 'spill over' from bats to other animals or humans? To add to the mystery: an individual bat that has cleared the infection may experience recrudescence - the virus may have been present all along, untraceably, and may reappear later and circulate in the otherwise healthy bat once again.\n\nRegardless of whether bats in Kerala are found to carry the virus, culling them - which some news reports suggest might be underway - is not a solution.\n\n'These bats, _P. medius_, are incredibly important ecologically in terms of pollination and seed dispersal,' Epstein said. 'In every case where there's a Nipah virus outbreak, the transmission from bats to humans is accidental - usually contamination of some type of food resource, whether it's date palm sap or fruit. And so this is really an opportunity for people to understand that we do share habitat and food with many different types of wildlife. But the answer is not to try to exterminate bats or to get rid of them.'\n\n[Byline: Nithyanand Rao]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The report above provides an interesting and thorough overview of _Pteropus_ bats and their relationship to Nipah virus.

The other 139 bats were not found to have even the antibodies necessary to fight the virus. \n\n_Pteropus_ bats are known to be the reservoir species for the Nipah and the closely related Hendra viruses, collectively called henipaviruses. The bats had been captured from a well reportedly cleaned by the 1st victims of the virus before they had fallen ill. \n\nOne workaround is to sample a larger number of bats at a time. In India, fruit bats have been tested for the Nipah virus. \n\nDifferences between various outbreaks\n promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The timely response of health authorities in this outbreak has doubtless contributed to its limited spread. \n\nMaps of India can be accessed at: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/308;\nKarnataka State, India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/307. - Mod.

Its natural reservoir is the bat. Harmless to them, the virus has caused serious infections in other animals, including pigs. It is also potentially transmissible to humans. 'Infection occurs via secretions from the bats and the pigs, so it is best to avoid direct contact with these animals,' Grangeon added.\n\nSome safety precautions need to be observed when handling fruits and meat. Make sure the bats did not nibble on fruits, and cook the meat of bats and pigs thoroughly before consumption.\n\n'As far as we know, the risk of animal-to-human infection is very low,' Grangeon said.\n\nNo human case of Nipah virus infection was reported to date in New Caledonia. 'The presence of this virus was previously unknown in New Caledonia,' said Almudena Lorenzo, director of the Noumea National Park. These fruit bats may have been infected for many years. According to Almudena Lorenzo, it is unlikely that they contracted the virus in the park.\n\nThe 3 bats that tested positive for the Nipah virus were killed on Wednesday [6 May 2015] morning.

A nurse, who treated them at a government hospital, has died as well.\n\n[The father], a collections agent at a small educational institute, is on life-support with fever and Nipah symptoms. He lost one son to a road accident 2 years ago.\n\nAmong those being treated for Nipah virus in the state is a woman, 19, the fianc\u00e9e of the man's eldest son, a civil engineer who was about to leave for a job in Qatar. The young man succumbed to the infection on 19 May [2018].\n\n'The father had asked his son to clean the well before he left the country, which he did with the help of his brothers. Little did they know what fate awaited them,' said one of their relatives, who runs a small grocery shop in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe bats living in Moosa's well have been identified as the source of the outbreak by the National Institute of Virology in Pune and the well has been sealed, along with many others in the neighbourhood.\n\nFruit bats are considered to be natural hosts of the virus.\n\nBats are common in this part of Kerala and have never before been identified as a source of infection. Changaroth residents said bats usually seek small cracks and wedges inside wells to beat the summer heat. Some people cover their wells with nets to keep them out, but most don't bother.\n\nThe infection appears to have spared the father's wife and another son, who have shown no symptoms of the disease but have been kept under observation for 2 weeks, according to World Health Organization protocol.\n\n[Byline: Ramesh Babu]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This unfortunate situation is the 1st reported outbreak of Nipah virus infection in Kerala state, although cases have occurred in West Bengal state as recently as last year (2017).\n\nThe implication of Nipah virus in bats recovered from the well is surprising. The species of bats in which the virus was found is not indicated. The reservoirs of Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and presumably in India, are giant fruit bats ('flying foxes' in the genus _Pteropus_). These bats roost in large trees and not in wells. Either the positive bats recovered from the well are another species not in the genus _Pteropus_ or are giant fruit bats with very different roosting behavior. It would be helpful to know whether the virus was confirmed present in the bats by laboratory testing or presumed positive by association with the human cases. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/308]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 22 May 2018\nSource: The Times of India [edited]\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/kerala-nipah-virus-toll-rises-to-11/articleshow/64273140.cms\n\n\nThe number of deaths due to Nipah virus rose to 11 with the reporting of 2 more deaths here on Tuesday [22 May 2018].

The Piniyari Government too has asked travellers to avoid visiting 4 northern districts Kozhikode, Malappuram, Wayanad and Kannur, in Kerala, even though the Union Health Ministry has said that the Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala is a localised occurrence and there is no threat of it spreading.\n\nAccording to reports, one patient is a 20-year-old woman from Kasargod and the other patient is a 75-year-old man from Mangaluru in Karnataka. It is suspected that the woman probably could have been exposed to the virus when she had visited the Perambra hospital in Kozhikode district of Kerala where a nurse was undergoing treatment for Nipah virus infection. The woman had been in close contact with the nurse. The nurse succumbed to the infection on [Mon 21 May 2018]. However, the 75-year-old man has no history of travel.\n\nSamples from both the patients have been sent to the Manipal Centre for Virus Research (MCVR), Manipal. The samples will be sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune if the results from MCVR turn positive for Nipah Virus.\n\nTamil Nadu, Karnataka and Puducherry Governments have said that there is no need to panic in these States, but officials have been asked to be on alert in case of any suspected outbreak. Meanwhile, the central team has devised draft guidelines, case definitions, advisory for healthcare workers, information to the general public, advisories for sample collection and transportation and a brief on Nipah virus disease.\n\nIn an advisory issued by Kerala Health Secretary Rajeev Sadanandan, it was stated that travelling to any part of Kerala was safe.

Of the 13 confirmed cases, 10 people have died.\n\nIsolation wards have also been set up in Thalassery government hospital in Kannur, according to media reports.\n\nIn Kozhikode, from where 7 deaths have been reported, District Collector U V Jose has ordered temporary stoppage of all training programmes and summer camps in affected areas such as Changaroth, Koorachund, Kottur, Cheruvannur, Chekyad, Chakkittapara and Olavanna.\n\nThe anganwadis [a center that provides basic health care in Indian villages] in these regions too have been asked to close down to avoid the spread of the virus among children.\n\nHowever, no decision has been taken yet concerning the reopening of schools after the summer vacation. The administration is hoping that the situation will be under control by the time schools reopen after a week. 'The number of newly infected cases is very low now', Mr. Jose said in a statement.\n\nIn neighbouring Malappuram, where 3 persons have died due to the virus, orders have been issued in 4 panchayats [basic units of local administration] to stop Anganwadi classes for the time being.\n\nA crisis management group has been constituted to coordinate the response of government agencies following the deaths in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts.

'Three outbreaks in Bangladesh were caused\nwhen people ate fresh date palm sap, a local sweet delicacy, which had been\ncontaminated by bats,' Hossain said in a statement issued by the Society\nfor General Microbiology.

According to local media reports the virus has killed at\nleast 89 people in Bangladesh since 2001. Hossain said the first outbreaks\nin Malaysia started when pigs on farms ate fruit which had been bitten by\ninfected bats. The pigs later developed coughs and breathing difficulties,\nand the virus soon spread to pig farmers and abattoir workers.\n\nThe deadly brain and lung disease is now spreading into rural India and\nBangladesh. In one outbreak in Bangladesh, people became infected after\ncontact with sick cows, while close contact with pig herds was associated\nwith another outbreak.\n\nHossain's team is working with date palm sap collectors to stop bats from\ncontaminating date palm sap. 'If we can identify the fact to be passed from\nbats to humans so frequently, we might be able to help intervene and\ninterfere with the transmission pathways,' he said.

A later outbreak in\nthe Faridpur district killed 18 of a total 30 cases -- a 60 per cent\nmortality rate .\n\nNipah virus is an emerging zoonotic virus (a virus transmitted to humans\nfrom animals). In infected people, Nipah virus causes severe illness\ncharacterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or respiratory\ndiseases.

Transmission is thought to have occurred via\nrespiratory droplets, contact with throat or nasal secretions from the\npigs, or contact with the tissue of a sick animal. In the Bangladeshi and\nIndia outbreaks, consumption of fruits or fruit products (such as raw date\npalm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats was\nthe most likely source of infection.

On the index farm of that\noutbreak, fruit trees were planted directly above pigs sties, and\ntransmission could have occurred via dropped fruit, as suggested in\nthe news report, or through contamination of the pig sties with urine\nor feces from fruit bats feeding in the trees above. Virus viability\nexperiments suggest that Nipah virus remains viable for up to 4 days\nin fruit bat urine at 22 deg C / 71.6 deg F (and up to one day at 37\ndeg C / 98.6 deg F) [1], so contamination of sties via urine from\ninfected bats is a plausible route of transmission. In Malaysia, the\nvirus has been isolated from swabs of fruit bat urine and partially\neaten fruit dropped by Island flying foxes (_Pteropus hypomelanus_) [2].\n\nI do not know the status of virus isolation from bats in Bangladesh;\nhowever, I am familiar with the literature on risk factors for human\ninfection in Bangladesh. The statement that: 'In one outbreak in\nBangladesh, people became infected after contact with sick cows' is\nmost likely a reference to the finding that contact with sick cows\nwas identified as a significant risk factor in a case-control study\nof an outbreak that occurred in 2001 in Chandpur village, Meherpur,\nBangladesh [3]. The role of date palm sap contamination in Nipah\nvirus transmission in Bangladesh was first suggested by Luby et al.\nin relation to an outbreak occurring in Tangail District, Bangladesh\nin 2004-2005 [4]. The article gives an interesting description and\ndiscussion of date palm sap harvesting practices for anyone who is\ninterested in further details.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Nipah induces flu-like symptoms that often lead to\nencephalitis and coma, with at least a 70 percent mortality rate in\nBangladesh. The latest outbreak was confirmed on Friday [29 Feb 2008].\n\n'So far 8 people including 4 children have died in the latest\noutbreak of the Nipah virus in (central) Manikganj and Rajbari\ndistricts,' said Mahmudur Rahman, a senior health official. 'Several\nothers are in critical condition. We told people not to be panicked.\nWe have also increased surveillance in the affected area,' he said.\n\nAt least 89 people have died of the virus since the 1st outbreak in\n2001. The Bangladesh government has set up a detection laboratory to\nspeed up testing for any outbreak. In 2004, the same 2 districts\nreported the worst outbreak, when nearly 40 people died, and the\nUnited States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was\ncalled in to help combat the disease.\n\nThe virus, named after the Malaysian village where it was first\ndetected, jumped the species barrier from fruit bats to pigs and then\nto humans in October 1998. It is believed to be caught through direct\ncontact with pigs. In 1999, 256 people in Malaysia fell ill with the\ndisease, and 4 in 10 patients died. More than a million pigs were\nslaughtered to help curb its spread.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nipah virus is a member of the family _Paramyxoviridae_. Its name\noriginated from Sungai Nipah, a village in the Malaysian Peninsula\nwhere pig farmers became ill with encephalitis. Nipah virus was first\nreported in pigs and thence humans in Malaysia in 1998. The disease\nin pigs was relatively mild. Human cases of Nipah virus infection,\napparently unassociated with infection in livestock, have been\nreported in Bangladesh since 2001. Species of fruit bats (genus\n_Pteropus_) have been identified as natural hosts of Nipah virus.\nAnthropogenic changes (habitat loss, hunting) that have impacted the\npopulation dynamics of _Pteropus_ species across much of their range\nare hypothesised to have facilitated emergence.\n\nNipah virus has been transmitted to humans, cats, and dogs through\nclose contact with infected pigs. However, person-to-person\ntransmission can occur. An encephalitis outbreak was investigated in\nFaridpur District, Bangladesh, in April-May 2004. 36 cases of Nipah\nvirus illness were identified; 75 percent of case-patients died.\nMultiple peaks of illness occurred, and 33 case-patients had close\ncontact with another Nipah virus patient. RT-PCR (reverse\ntranscriptase polymerase chain reaction) testing of environmental\nsamples confirmed Nipah virus contamination of hospital surfaces.\nThis investigation provided evidence for person-to-person\ntransmission of Nipah virus [see: Gurley ES, Montgomery JM, Hossain\nMJ, Bell M, Azad AK, Islam MR, et al: Person-to-person transmission\nof Nipah virus in a Bangladeshi community.

Researchers from the Dhaka-based Institute of\nEpidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) suspected Nipah\nvirus because last year's outbreak was caused by contact with fruit\nbats, which carry the virus and can transmit it to people. The team\nthinks the juice was made from fruit contaminated by fruit bat\ndroppings, or from fruit the bats had half-eaten.\nThe researchers sent samples of patients' blood to the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, United States, which\nconfirmed Nipah virus infection in one of them. Bangladesh does not\nhave adequate research facilities for diagnosing the virus or working\non ways of controlling it. One constraint is that there are no\nlaboratories in which the virus can be studied safely, without a risk\nof it escaping and infecting more people.\nThe IEDCR, however, is trying to find out how the outbreak began.\nAlthough the researchers suspect fruit bats are the main carriers of\nNipah virus, they are also collecting samples of blood, tissue and\ndroppings from other species including cats, dogs, poultry, cattle\nand rodents to see whether the virus has other hosts. By sampling\nfruit trees, they hope to determine whether the virus can be\ntransmitted through contact with fruit touched by the bats. Mahmudur\nRahman, lead researcher and director of the IEDCR, told SciDev.Net\nthat climate might also play a role in patterns of outbreaks, as each\nof the previous outbreaks also occurred in winter.\nStrong evidence of human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus was\nfound for the 1st time during 2004's outbreak, according to research\npublished in the Health and Science Bulletin of the Dhaka-based\nCentre for Health and Population Research. Because of this threat,\nthe Directorate of Health Services has advised healthcare officials\nto wear masks and gloves when treating patients suspected of having\nNipah, and the public has been warned to avoid close contact with\ninfected people.\nSymptoms of Nipah virus infection are similar to those of influenza,\nsuch as fever and muscle pain. In some cases, inflammation of the\nbrain occurs, leading to disorientation or coma. Around half of the\nsymptomatic cases are fatal. Rahman thinks there could be a\nconnection between a recent increase in Bangladesh of cases of\nencephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and Nipah or a Nipah-like\nvirus. 'We need extensive research on encephalitis,' he says.\nThere is no cure for Nipah, but a vaccine is in development.\nAccording to Bangladesh's Directorate of Health Services, Nipah virus\nhas infected a total of 211 people and killed 59 of them since 2001,\nwhen the virus was 1st detected in the Bangladesh.

WHO\nreports that in February 2004, an outbreak of Nipah virus spread across 6\ndistricts of Bangladesh and claimed 17 human lives of 23 cases -- a\nmortality rate of 74 percent. A 2nd outbreak in the Faridpur district\nkilled 18 of a total 30 cases -- a 60 percent mortality rate -- as of 19\nApr 2004.\nNipah virus, inducing influenza-like symptoms often leading to encephalitis\nand coma, came into view when it jumped from infected pigs in Malaysia to\nhumans, killing both. The virus was named after the Malaysian village where\nit was first discovered. Of 265 confirmed cases in Malaysia and Singapore,\n105 died. And even among the survivors, the virus has taken a horrendous\ntoll: many of the survivors were left with some degree of brain damage. To\ncontain the spread of the disease the Malaysian authorities killed over a\nmillion pigs. Currently it is believed that fruit bats (also known as\n'flying foxes') serve as the virus reservoir, based on the finding of\nnatural Nipah viral antibody in healthy fruit bats. Virus has been isolated\nfrom the urine of fruit bats. Normally, flying foxes live deep in the\njungle, feeding off succulent fruit like jambu air [also known as Jambu\nmawar, water apple, or rose apple, a small red succulent fruit with pink or\nwhite flesh] and mango. Local hunters shoot and eat them. In Cambodia, they\nare prized as aphrodisiacs, and the bats are used as good luck talismans in\nFilipino wedding ceremonies.\nSo, how did the pig acquire the virus? Researchers have tried to link the\nemergence of Nipah virus to El Nino. During 1997-1998, El Nino brought\ndrought and dry weather to the Indonesian peninsula, which led to massive\nforest fires and the haze that shrouded the region for months.\nConsequently, haze blocked sunlight, reducing the ability of trees to\nflower and bear fruit. This forced fruit bats to travel great distances in\nsearch of sustenance. They settled in places outside their usual habitat\nsuch as the fringes of forests, close to pig farms. They may have passed\nthe virus on to pigs via their urine, as well as their saliva in the\nhalf-eaten fruit that fell to the ground and was then eaten by the\nvoracious pigs. The presence of Nipah virus antibodies indicate that bats\nwere infected with the virus, as were pigs, cats, and dogs. In the\nMalaysian outbreak, pigs were the apparent source of infection for most\nhuman cases: 93 percent of the confirmed cases had occupational exposure to\npigs. In contrast, pigs farming is uncommon in the outbreak areas in\nBangladesh. That implies that other intermediary sources other than pigs\nwere the source of infection.\nIn the recent Bangladesh outbreak, fruit bats are also the suspected\nreservoir for Nipah virus. A significant number of victims in Bangladesh\nwere under age 19. It has been hypothesized that young boys may have\ncollected and eaten fruits harvested from trees [in the early morning] and\ncould have contracted infection by eating the same fruits that fruit bats\nfed on during the night. in addition many of the cases in Bangladesh have\noccurred within households -- with victims having had no direct contact\nwith animals or bats. This implicates that human-to-human transmission\nmight be possible, which is a matter of great concern. However,\nhuman-to-human transmission of Nipah virus had not been reported in the\nMalasyian outbreak.\n[Byline: Mohammad Sarowar Hossain]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[While this article provides a useful summary of the 2004 outbreak of Nipah\nvirus infection in Bangladesh, it may be premature to conclude that\nperson-to-person transmission occurred -- in this outbreak in the absence\nof reliable information concerning both the reservoir host and the actual\nroute of transmission.

The outbreak, which occurred in the Faridpur District of Bangladesh,\nwas responsible for 34 cases, including 26 deaths. No new cases have been\nreported since mid-April 2004. The Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) confirmed Nipah virus infection in 16 of the cases. Health\nauthorities in Bangladesh, the International Center for Diarrheal Disease\nResearch in Bangladesh, CDC, and other international partners worked\ntogether to assess and control this outbreak. Outbreaks of Nipah virus\nencephalitis have previously occurred in Bangladesh in May\n2001, January/February 2003, and January/February 2004.\nNipah virus, which was discovered in 1999, is a zoonotic virus (infectious\ndisease that can be transmitted from certain animals to humans). Fruit bats\nof the genus _Pteropus_ are thought to be the reservoir for this virus. The\ninitial outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore affected humans and commercial\nswine herds, although other species, including cats, dogs, and horses, were\nalso infected. The virus mainly caused respiratory illness among the pigs\nand an encephalitis syndrome among humans. Nipah virus infection can cause\nfever, muscle pains (myalgia), drowsiness, and encephalitis characterized\nby serious central nervous system illness, coma, seizures, and inability to\nmaintain breathing.\nAs a general precaution, CDC advises travelers to avoid contact with wild\nor domestic animals in the region. As with other infectious illnesses, one\nof the most important and appropriate preventive practices is careful\nand frequent hand washing, which helps remove potentially infectious\nmaterials from the skin and prevents disease transmission.

Last year [2003] the spread\nof the disease seemed to have stopped.\nA study conducted by local and foreign virologists recently revealed\nthat the outbreak of the virus has been limited to southwestern\ndistricts of Bangladesh in the past 3 years, with a mortality rate of\n50 to 100 percent in different areas. The virus was traced to fruit\nbats. Some experts are of the opinion that the virus-prone belt\nstretches along the course of the Padma [river] up to south-west India,\ncausing death to an unaccounted number of people every year. There is\nno laboratory in Bangladesh that can detect the virus.\nExtensive research has found that pregnant bats harbored the virus\nand possibly transmitted it to humans. The experts did not rule out\nhuman to human transmission of the disease. In the latest spell this\nyear [2004], 4 members of a mendicant family at Faridpur died, after\nthe mendicant himself became infected and died. A rickshaw-puller,\nwho carried a patient to the hospital, also became infected and died.\nThis gives credence to the view that the virus is passed on from\nhumans to humans.\nThe bats become pregnant from November to April, and most of the Nipah-like\ninfection cases were reported during that period. The study found that,\nusually, a group of people were infected at a time, and that the victims\nwere related. Dr. AKM Shahidul Islam, an Associate Professor of Microbiology\nat the Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital, who was part of the team\nthat conducted the survey, said date and palm juices, contaminated by urine\nor droppings of Nipah-infected bats, could transmit Nipah virus to humans.\nHe said: 'The jujube drops from a tree after it had been partly eaten up by\nbats at night. While eating a jujube, the bats secrete saliva on it. When\nthe children collect the fruit, and eat it without washing, the virus of\nbat's saliva is transmitted to them.' He pointed out that most of the people\nwho died of this virus infection were not more than 15 years old. He advised\npeople not to eat fruit bitten or half-eaten by bats, or drink the raw\njuices of palm and date in a Nipah-prevalent area. About 17 percent of the\nbats were found to be carrying antibodies against Nipah virus in their blood\nand, surprisingly, all were pregnant. Tests on other domestic and wild\nanimals proved negative.\nDr. Shahid said, 'The latest finding is the presence of [Nipah] virus\ngenetic material in the beds of 2 patients in Faridpur General\nHospital. It means that the virus is capable of spilling out of the\npatient's body, but it is questionable whether it is infectious or\nnot. Only laboratory culture of the sample could prove whether these\nare full [infectious] virus or only [non-infectious material], but\nthe IEDCR has no facility to ascertain that,' he added. Dr. Shahid\nsaid: 'Several guidelines were formulated to control the outbreak of\nthe disease, including guidelines for doctors regarding diagnosis and\ntreatment, for nurses and other health-care professionals about the\ncare of patients as well as personal protective measures, and for the\npublic and relatives of the patients about what to do in case of\ninfection.'\nLast season [northern winter 2004], the disease was 1st reported in\nGoalundo, in Rajbari district, as an 'unknown'' ailment between 12 and 18\nJan 2004. Then, it was reported in Faridpur, Manikganj, Tangail, and\nJoypurhat. The disease begins with fever, followed by unconsciousness within\none to 2 days of feverish illness. According to an ICDDR [International\nCentre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research]study, 2 previous Nipah outbreaks\nwere recorded before the last outbreak. The 1st recorded outbreak occurred\nbetween 25 Apr and 26 May 2001, causing 9 deaths in Meherpur district.\nBetween 11 and 28 Jan 2003, another outbreak killed 8 out of 17 affected\npersons in Naogaon. After the epidemic in January 2004, foreign experts from\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA, the World\nHealth Organization headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, Health Canada, and\nthe University of Malaya came to the country to investigate the outbreak.\n[Byline: Nurul Islam Hasib]\n--\nPablo Nart\n<pablo11@hotpop.com>", "summary": "Dr. Shahid\nsaid: 'Several guidelines were formulated to control the outbreak of\nthe disease, including guidelines for doctors regarding diagnosis and\ntreatment, for nurses and other health-care professionals about the\ncare of patients as well as personal protective measures, and for the\npublic and relatives of the patients about what to do in case of\ninfection.'

Between 17 and 21 Jan 2004, 6\nadditional children (aged between 2 and 15 years) and a 28-year-old woman\n(mother of the youngest child) also died with the same symptoms. All\npatients came from the neighboring Kazipara and Juran Molla Para villages\nand lived in 2 groups of houses located within 1 km of each other. On 21\nJan 2004, Goalanda health authorities triggered the alert and sent a report\nto the central level. On 22 Jan 2004, a joint investigation mission with\nthe Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of the\nMinistry of Health, the Centre for Health and Population Research (ICDDRB),\nand the WHO country office was dispatched to Goalanda to verify the rumors\nand to collect samples for laboratory diagnosis.\nBetween 22 and 27 Jan 2004, the investigation team was able to confirm the\noutbreak and to provide a 1st description of the epidemic. Blood samples\nobtained from several patients were sent to the Special Pathogen Branch\n(SPB) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta,\nUSA. On 4 Feb 2004, SPB-CDC detected IgM antibodies against Nipah virus in\nthe serum of 5 patients. The laboratory investigations included ELISA tests\nfor IgG and IgM antibodies, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction\nto detect the viral genome, and viral isolation. CDC was able to culture\nthe virus from 2 of the patients. Viral RNA was amplified to show that a\nNipah virus -- with about a 95 percent homology with that isolated during\nthe Malaysian outbreak in 1999 -- was the cause of the outbreak.\nSurveillance\n------------\nIn light of the findings of previous epidemic investigations and of the\nclinical presentation of the first 8 confirmed Bangladeshi cases, 3\ncategories were employed for case definition: (1) suspect, (2) probable,\nand (3) laboratory-confirmed. In addition, when samples were collected from\nprobable and suspect cases, they were reclassified as 'non-cases' if they\nwere negative for Nipah virus IgM antibodies. Routine epidemiological\nsurveillance was reinforced by an active suspect-encephalitis\ncase-notification system -- implemented in Faridpur, Manikgonj, and Rajbari\ndistricts -- surrounding the outbreak epicenter. Surveillance was also\nreinforced by IEDCR across the entire territory.\nEpidemiology\n------------\nDescriptive epidemiology was undertaken based on the case definition. A\ncase of Nipah virus infection was any probable or laboratory-confirmed\ncase. As at 23 Feb 2004, 23 Nipah cases -- including 11\nlaboratory-confirmed cases -- had been identified in 6 districts (Faridpur,\nGolpagonj, Manikgonj, Joypurat, Naogaon, Rajbari). 17 of the 23 cases died\n(case-fatality rate of 74 percent). In all the affected districts, cases\nwere clustered geographically and in time. The 1st identified case\ndeveloped the 1st symptoms of the disease on 11 Jan 2004. Most of the\ndetected cases occurred between 12 and 25 Jan 2004 (for 20 out of 23 cases)\nsuggesting a common source of contamination. [Figure 1 (not shown here)\nillustrates the weekly distribution of cases (survivors and deaths) of\nNipah virus infection in 6 districts of Bangladesh as of 23 Feb 2004. -\nMod.CP.]\nThe main focus, with 12 Nipah cases, was identified in Goalanda, Rajbari\ndistrict, where an in-depth investigation was undertaken. Of the 12 cases,\n9 were male (75 percent) and aged under 19 years. The investigation failed\nto establish any link between these cases and sick pigs -- or other types\nof sick mammals -- as was observed during the Malaysian Nipah outbreak.\nConversely, it was noted in Goalanda that young boys collected and ate\nfruits in the trees before dawn. This observation gave rise to the\nhypothesis that contamination could have occurred while eating the same\nfruits that fruit bats (_Pteropodidae_) fed on during the night.\nSeveral epidemiological studies were conducted by the investigation team in\nGoalanda. These included a case-control study to identify risk factors for\ninfection, a seroprevalence study to assess the spread of the infection\n(antibody detection) in the general population, and a follow-up of\nconvalescent cases to assess antibody kinetics and duration of viral\nshedding. Fieldwork has been completed, and data analysis has begun.\nClinical description\n---------------------\nMost of the identified cases were transferred to the Dhaka Medical College\nHospital and the Dhaka Shishu Hospital where definitive case management was\norganized. Among 11 patients with laboratory-confirmed Nipah virus\ninfection, the most commonly reported signs and symptoms included fever\n(11/11), headache (4/11), vomiting (5/11), dizziness (5/11), altered\nconsciousness or total or partial loss of consciousness (11/11), coma\n(9/11), focal neurological signs (3/11), disorientation/hallucination\n(4/11), seizure (8/11), respiratory distress (6/11) and cough/cold (3/11).\nEcological studies\n------------------\nEcological studies were conducted to establish the source of human\ninfection and identify the natural reservoir of Nipah virus in Bangladesh.\nThe team focused its work in the Goalanda area and sampled domestic,\nperidomestic and wild animals living in or around the affected villages. It\nprioritized taxa associated with previous Nipah virus outbreaks in Malaysia\n(i.e. Megachiropteran bats and pigs). Laboratory investigations are\ncurrently under way at SPB-CDC, although preliminary results confirm that\nseveral _Pteropus_ flying foxes have evidence of Nipah virus infection.\nSocial mobilization and health education\n------------------\nThe Ministry of Health and the WHO team relayed all relevant information to\nthe press on a regular basis thereby keeping the public regularly informed\nabout the evolution of the situation and of investigations. Given the\nresults of the epidemiological investigation, it was proposed that several\nhealth education messages be prepared to improve hygiene while eating\nfruits (washing, peeling, cooking fruits before eating them, and\nhand-washing at home) in order to break the primary infection and\ntransmission of the disease. The support of medical anthropologists and\nexperts in social mobilization will be needed to prepare these messages.\nCluster of Nipah Cases in Faridpur District, Mar - Apr 2004\n-----------------\nOn 19 Apr 2004, the Bangladesh Ministry of Health reported one cluster of\n30 Nipah cases, including 18 deaths from 13 Mar to 14 Apr in Faridpur\ndistrict. Laboratory testing, performed by CDC, confirmed Nipah virus\ninfection in 16 of the cases.\nThe outbreak was investigated by a team comprising experts from the IEDCR,\nICDDRB and the WHO country office. All cases lived in Guha Laksmipur\nvillage or were in contact with a spiritual leader living in this village\nwho was himself a case. Direct contact with ill patients is suspected to\nhave played a role in the transmission of the disease and the spread of\nthis outbreak.\nThe team organized infection-control and safe clinical-management workshops\nfor local medical staff in different health care settings of the Faridpur\ndistrict. Investigations are continuing.\nConclusion\n----------\nAfter Meherpur (2001) and Naogaon (2003), Bangladesh faces again an\nepidemic of Nipah. As in 2001 and 2003, few cases were identified, but this\ntime suspect cases are more widely spread throughout the country. Until\nstudies have been completed, and control and prevention measures discussed,\nthe investigation team has proposed the following short-term recommendations:\n1. Creation of a task force for Nipah outbreaks using a multidisciplinary\napproach.\n2. Creation of special funds for outbreak response and to support families\nand hospitals.\n3. Institution of urgent measures to prevent nosocomial infection in all\nhospitals of the country (patient isolation, injection safety, safe waste\ndisposal, etc.).\n4. Preparation of prevention messages recommending hand-washing after\ntaking care of sick relatives and washing fruit, and peeling or cooking it,\nbefore eating.\nRecommendations also included medium-term activities such as strengthening\noutbreak detection and investigation capacity, strengthening basic\nlaboratory support, transferring Nipah laboratory diagnosis capacity to\nBangladesh, and conducting further studies on the ecology of _Pteropodidae_\nin Bangladesh.\nAn international workshop focusing on case-management, and a scientific\nmeeting on Nipah virus and Hendra virus, are planned to be held in Dhaka in\n2004 in collaboration with experts from Australia, Malaysia, Thailand and\nUnited States.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "Given the\nresults of the epidemiological investigation, it was proposed that several\nhealth education messages be prepared to improve hygiene while eating\nfruits (washing, peeling, cooking fruits before eating them, and\nhand-washing at home) in order to break the primary infection and\ntransmission of the disease.

Both outbreaks occurred over brief periods and had high\ncase-fatality ratios. In contrast to previous experience with Hendra\nand Nipah viruses in which no human-to-human transmission had\noccurred in Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore, epidemiologic\ncharacteristics of the outbreak in Bangladesh suggested the\npossibility of person-to-person transmission. Exposure to animals may\nhave contributed to disease transmission to humans during the\noutbreaks, but nevertheless, the ultimate source of the virus is its\nzoonotic reservoir.\nEpidemiological Investigation\n-----------------------------\nBetween 26 Apr and 26 May 2001, 9 deaths occurred among people with\nfebrile illnesses and neurologic symptoms in Chandpur village of\nMeherpur district, 17 km from the border with India; 7 deaths\noccurred among people within the same family who lived within the\nsame home or whose homes were adjacent to each other. The mean age\nwas 40 years (range 32-60 years); 6 were males. During the same time\ninterval, 18 other residents of the village were reported to have a\nsimilar illness and survived. An investigation led by the Director\nGeneral of Health Services (DGHS) in May 2001 was followed by a 2nd\ninvestigation from 26 May to 1 Jun 2001 by a team that included staff\nfrom DGHS, the World Health Organization (WHO), and ICDDR,B. Results\nof antibody testing by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) done at the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States\nsuggested that at least 2 people in the Chandpur outbreak were\ninfected with Nipah/Hendra-like viruses.\nBetween 11 and 28 Jan 2003, another outbreak of severe illness\nincluding features of encephalitis was reported affecting at least 17\nresidents (range 4 to 42 years) of Chalksita and Biljoania villages\n(located 45 km northeast of Rajshahi) in Naogaon district; 8 people\ndied. In February 2003, an investigative team from ICDDR,B and\nCDC-Atlanta visited Chandpur to learn more about the scope and risk\nfactors for the 1st outbreak. Upon concluding studies in Chandpur,\nthe team visited Naogaon District with the objective of defining the\netiology and scope of the 2nd outbreak. The team collected specimens\nof blood from 119 residents of Chandpur and 89 residents of Chalksita\nand Biljoania villages who reportedly had been ill and recovered and\nthose who were contacts (family members, close acquaintances, and\nneighbours of cases) of residents who had died, during either of the\noutbreaks. Sera were not available from any of the patients who died\nduring the outbreaks. 4 people from Chandpur had evidence of\nantibodies (by ELISA) to Nipah antigen; all 4 had been ill during the\noutbreak period and were relatives of patients who died. Similarly,\nin Chalksita and Biljoania, 4 residents were found to have antibodies\nreactive with Nipah virus antigen; all 4 had been ill and had contact\nwith patients who died. No health care workers were identified with\nillness during the outbreak periods.\nA case of Nipah/Hendra-like virus infection was defined as a resident\nof one of the villages where the outbreaks occurred who died during\nthe outbreak periods or who had measurable antibodies to Nipah virus\nantigen. A total of 13 cases (including 9 deaths) were identified\nfrom the 1st outbreak and 12 cases (including 8 deaths) were\nidentified from the 2nd outbreak.\nFever, headache, and altered consciousness were the most common\nsymptoms. Cases in the Naogaon outbreak were more likely than\nnon-cases to have had contact with a herd of pigs that had passed\nthrough the villages. In the Meherpur outbreak, cases were more\nlikely than non-cases to report contact with a cow during the 2 weeks\nbefore illness. Close contact with ill people in the Meherpur\noutbreak, including contact with patient secretions, was reported\nmuch more commonly in cases than in non-cases. Sera were collected\nfrom a variety of animals with the goal of identifying the source of\nthe virus for these outbreaks. Antibodies reactive with Nipah virus\nantigens were found in 2 of 44 _Pteropus giganteus_ bats tested,\nwhile none were found in the remaining animals tested, including 2\nother species of bats, pigs, rodents, shrews, pigeons, and dogs in\nareas near case-households.\n(Reported by: Division of Viral and Rickettsial Disease, National\nCenter for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, USA; Health Systems and Infectious Diseases Division and\nClinical Sciences Division, ICDDR,B.)\nComment and Conclusions\n------------------------\nFindings of this report suggest that Nipah/Hendra-like viruses were\nthe etiological agents of both outbreaks. Because diagnoses were\ndependent on serologic tests in both outbreaks, the precise\netiological agent is not known and may be due to a pathogen that\ncross-reacts with Nipah virus antigens in antibody assays. Hendra and\nNipah virus-associated illness was first recognized during outbreaks\nin Australia in 1994 and an epidemic in Malaysia and Singapore in\n1998-1999. A total of 105 of 276 patients with laboratory-confirmed\nNipah virus in Malaysia and Singapore died with viral encephalitis.\nClose contact with sick pigs was highly associated with human\nillness, but a few patients had no direct contact with pigs. No\nperson-to-person transmission was shown. The reservoir for Hendra and\nNipah viruses are bats of the genus _Pteropus_. In Australia, horses\nhave been the domestic link to human infections, while in Malaysia\nand Singapore, pigs were clearly the linking animal host. Antibodies\nto Nipah viruses were identified in other animals (dogs, cats, and\nhorses), but transmission from these animals to humans was not\ndocumented. Subsequent studies in Cambodia have also shown that\nevidence of infection (antibodies) with Nipah/Hendra-like viruses can\nbe found in apparently healthy bats. No cases of human illness due to\nNipah viruses were identified following the mass culling of >1\nmillion pigs in Malaysia.\nIn contrast to the Australia and the Malaysia/Singapore outbreaks, no\nclear source of transmission was identified for either of the\noutbreaks in Bangladesh summarized within this report. Because of the\nclustering of cases among family members and neighbours, the\nsecondary peaks of cases following a period of no illnesses, and an\nepidemiologic suggestion of increased risk for illness among people\nwho had exposure to secretions of other sick patients,\nperson-to-person transmission cannot be ruled out. However, absence\nof illness among health care workers creates some uncertainty about\nthis possibility. Increased risk of illness following exposure to\npigs in one outbreak and a sick cow in the other raise the potential\nof animal-to-human transmission, but this possibility cannot be\nvalidated with the limited data available.\nSystematic surveillance for encephalitis is not routinely done in\nBangladesh. It is possible that other outbreaks and sporadic cases of\nNipah/Hendra-like virus encephalitis have occurred or will occur.\nMore information will be needed to define the magnitude of the\nproblem and to identify strategies to prevent illness and deaths.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The above paper describes the outcome of investigation of 2 previous\noutbreaks of Nipah/Hendra-like virus-associated encephalitis in\nWestern Bangladesh.

Antibodies reactive with Nipah virus\nantigens were found in 2 of 44 _Pteropus giganteus_ bats tested,\nwhile none were found in the remaining animals tested, including 2\nother species of bats, pigs, rodents, shrews, pigeons, and dogs in\nareas near case-households.\n The team collected specimens\nof blood from 119 residents of Chandpur and 89 residents of Chalksita\nand Biljoania villages who reportedly had been ill and recovered and\nthose who were contacts (family members, close acquaintances, and\nneighbours of cases) of residents who had died, during either of the\noutbreaks. A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Between 11 and 28 Jan 2003, another outbreak of severe illness\nincluding features of encephalitis was reported affecting at least 17\nresidents (range 4 to 42 years) of Chalksita and Biljoania villages\n(located 45 km northeast of Rajshahi) in Naogaon district; 8 people\ndied. In contrast to previous experience with Hendra\nand Nipah viruses in which no human-to-human transmission had\noccurred in Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore, epidemiologic\ncharacteristics of the outbreak in Bangladesh suggested the\npossibility of person-to-person transmission. Between 26 Apr and 26 May 2001, 9 deaths occurred among people with\nfebrile illnesses and neurologic symptoms in Chandpur village of\nMeherpur district, 17 km from the border with India; 7 deaths\noccurred among people within the same family who lived within the\nsame home or whose homes were adjacent to each other. (Reported by: Division of Viral and Rickettsial Disease, National\nCenter for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, USA; Health Systems and Infectious Diseases Division and\nClinical Sciences Division, ICDDR,B.)\n A case of Nipah/Hendra-like virus infection was defined as a resident\nof one of the villages where the outbreaks occurred who died during\nthe outbreak periods or who had measurable antibodies to Nipah virus\nantigen. A total of 13 cases (including 9 deaths) were identified\nfrom the 1st outbreak and 12 cases (including 8 deaths) were\nidentified from the 2nd outbreak.\n Increased risk of illness following exposure to\npigs in one outbreak and a sick cow in the other raise the potential\nof animal-to-human transmission, but this possibility cannot be\nvalidated with the limited data available. \n2 outbreaks of encephalitis, both caused by Nipah/Hendra-like\nviruses, occurred in separate areas in western Bangladesh in 2001 and\n2003. Similarly,\nin Chalksita and Biljoania, 4 residents were found to have antibodies\nreactive with Nipah virus antigen; all 4 had been ill and had contact\nwith patients who died. Exposure to animals may\nhave contributed to disease transmission to humans during the\noutbreaks, but nevertheless, the ultimate source of the virus is its\nzoonotic reservoir. It is likely that the virus associated with the\noutbreaks of encephalitis in Western Bangladesh is a novel member of\nthe genus _Henipavirus_, in view of its distinctive epidemiological\ncharacteristics. Hendra and\nNipah virus-associated illness was first recognized during outbreaks\nin Australia in 1994 and an epidemic in Malaysia and Singapore in\n1998-1999. Antibodies\nto Nipah viruses were identified in other animals (dogs, cats, and\nhorses), but transmission from these animals to humans was not\ndocumented. Because diagnoses were\ndependent on serologic tests in both outbreaks, the precise\netiological agent is not known and may be due to a pathogen that\ncross-reacts with Nipah virus antigens in antibody assays. Close contact with ill people in the Meherpur\noutbreak, including contact with patient secretions, was reported\nmuch more commonly in cases than in non-cases. In the Meherpur outbreak, cases were more\nlikely than non-cases to report contact with a cow during the 2 weeks\nbefore illness. Cases in the Naogaon outbreak were more likely than\nnon-cases to have had contact with a herd of pigs that had passed\nthrough the villages.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "nipah virus"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2003-02-25 00:00:00", "2001-06-01 00:00:00", "2001-05-26 00:00:00", "2001-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-05-26 00:00:00", "2001-05-25 00:00:00", "1994-03-25 00:00:00", "2003-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Bangladesh", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Atlanta", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Singapore", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chalksita", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Meherpur", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Biljoania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chandpur", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cambodia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Naogaon", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chandpur village", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2198218", "headline": "PRO/AH> Nipah virus -

The fatality once again highlighted the plight of\nthe pig farmers and their families. For about 200 people who had tested\npositive for the Nipah virus, news of the death was a bad omen. There is\nmuch confusion surrounding this disclosure, and the 200 are still unclear\nabout the implications of testing positive.\n'We are not sure whether we are carriers of the actual virus or simply its\nantibodies,' said Lay Yong Tee, Chairperson of the Negeri Sembilan Nipah\nVirus Committee (NSNVC). A medical lecturer from a university told\nmalaysiakini that 'there is no evidence yet to conclude or seclude\n[exclude] whether they are carriers, but a positive reaction to the Nipah\nvirus does not mean they are sick, it simply means that they have been\ninfected.'\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n{'Testing positive' undoubtedly indicates having antibody. This is good,\nnot bad. Whether people can have antibody and be persistently infected is\nanother, unlikely, story. What is significant about this news story is that\nthe recent human infection indicates persistence of the virus in Malaysia,\npossibly in persistently infected animals, such as pigs. I wonder whether\npig retroviruses could bring about an acquired immunodeficiency state, such\nthat pigs could be persistently infected with\nNipah and other viruses. In any case, the virus has not been eradicated\nfrom Malaysia and red flags should be going up all over the place. - Mod.

Nor. Any hog farm found with just one infected pig [defined as\nhaving antibody, as far as we can tell - Mod.CC] must destroy its entire\nstock, he was reported as having said. Whereas Nipah virus first was\nobserved to have killed pigs and humans in Negri Sembilan state in western\nMalaysia where 84 people died, the virus has since swept into the states of\nPerak, Johor, Kelantan, Malacca and Selangor.\nHealth officials initially believed the disease was Japanese encephalitis,\n[the etiologic agent of] which is transmitted from pigs to humans by\n_Culex_ mosquitoes. Later, scientists identified a new virus, named Nipah\nafter the Malaysian village where it claimed its first victim.\nThe eight-month outbreak has ruined the pig-farming industry in many parts\nof Malaysia. Pig farmers in the worst-hit area, 60 miles southeast of the\ncapital of Kuala Lumpur, abandoned their homes in March.\nA farm in Sungai Buloh, Selangor, has been listed as 'high risk' after one\nof its workers was admitted to hospital on May 14 and fell into a coma,\nSelangor executive councillor Datuk Abdul Fatah Iskandar said yesterday.\nFatah said the Sungai Buloh farm had 2,600 pigs and 'some of its pigs are\nalso coughing, a symptom of Nipah infection.'\nHealth director-general Tan Sri Dr Abu Bakar Suleiman said the ministry\nexpected some farms outside the outbreak areas to be tested positive\nbecause 'of the way pigs were moved all over the place. 'I am more\nconcerned about farmers and workers taking precautions to protect\nthemselves from being infected by the pigs,' Dr Abu Bakar said in an\ninterview.\n[Bernama reported that] the government is no longer allowing military\npersonnel to be involved in pig culling operations and following the\ndecision, the operation to put down the animals in five pig farms in Alor\nGajah [in Malaka] today had been shelved. State Secretary Datuk Wira Abdul\nAziz Omar said confirmation of the government decision had been conveyed\nearly this morning. 'Thus the operation scheduled to commence at about 8 am\ntoday had to be shelved as there are no shooters,' he said. Pig culling\noperations planned for Perak and Johor were also facing the same problem\nfollowing the decision prohibiting members of the armed forces to be\ninvolved, he said.\nThe operation in Alor Gajah was said to be deemed urgent as the state\ngovernment feared the possibility of an increase in the number of pigs that\nhad to be destroyed as the results of the tests on blood samples taken from\npigs in 93 other farms throughout the state had yet to be received.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[The reports painted a rather grim picture of the present status of the\nNipah virus encephalitis outbreak in peninsular Malaysia.

History of human cases\nThe outbreak of Nipah disease in Malaysia, which has caused human\nfatalities, has been attributed to a viral infection in pigs. The outbreak\nin 1998/99 has been investigated and traced back to earlier incidences\nwhich were provisionally diagnosed as Japanese encephalitis (JE).\nIn 1997, the illness was reported in a number of pig-farm workers, one of\nwhom died. Most of them received treatment at private hospitals.\nIn 1998, more cases of viral encephalitis were reported and two more\nvillages were affected. A special Task Force comprising officers from the\nmedical and veterinary departments was formed. By the end of 1998, ten\nworkers from Tambun, Ulu Piah and Ampang had died from the disease after\nbeing in a coma for periods ranging from four days to a few weeks. Among\nthe viral encephalitis cases, only about 15% were confirmed as JE, leaving\nthe remaining 85% undetermined.\nBy mid-December 1998, the disease had spread to Sikamat, about 60 km south\nof Kuala Lumpur, through movement of infected pigs. Seven of the 20 workers\ndeveloped the disease and five died in January 1999.\nBy March 1999 the disease had spread to the major pig producing area of\nBukit Pelandok in the State of Negeri Sembilan.\n\nThe Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Malaya, successfully\nisolated an unknown virus. The virus was sent to the Arbovirus Research\nCenter, Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Fort Collins, Colorado, United\nStates of America. There, the Malaysian and United States scientists worked\ntogether to study the characteristics of the virus. On 18 March 1999, the\nCDC announced that the isolate was of a genus closely related to the Hendra\nvirus, a paramyxovirus first isolated in Brisbane, Australia, in 1994. On\n10 April 1999, the isolate was officially called the Nipah virus, named\nafter the village Sungai Nipah in Negeri Sembilan, where the worker from\nwhom the virus was isolated had died.\nThe disease spread to more farms and, from 1 March to 10 May 1999, a total\nof 224 suspected cases of viral encephalitis occurred in Negeri Sembilan\nwith 80 fatalities.\nOut of a total of 258 persons suspected of being infected with the Nipah\nvirus, 100 have died.\nAs a measure to control the spread of the new virus, farmers and their\nfamilies have been instructed to leave their villages and settle\ntemporarily in schools and community halls outside the affected district.\nAssistance has been sought from experts in the CDC and Australia to help\nwith the diagnosis and control of Nipah disease.\n2. Clinical picture in humans\n- Mild to severe clinical signs.\n- Fever and headaches of varying severity.\n- A few patients present drowsiness and disorientation, later falling into\na coma and requiring artificial respiration.\n- A majority of the patients in a coma subsequently die\n- The full course of the disease is still unknown.\n- The incubation period is postulated to be from one to three weeks.\nSome patients have shown serological reactivity without clinical signs.\n3. Disease in pigs\n- Generally, mortality is low but morbidity is high.\n- Spread of the disease between and within pig farms has not been established.\n3.1 Clinical signs\na) Weaners and porkers\n- Mild to severe coughing, with varying reports of mortality and morbidity.\nb) Sows and boars\n- Disease more pronounced, including moderate to severe respiratory\ndisorder characterised by dyspnoea, convulsions and death.\n- In boars, disease may be acute, death occurring within several hours.\nThick mucopurulent discharge and pneumonia in less severe forms.\nc) Piglets, gilts and sows\n- Convulsions and other neurological signs.\n3.2 Necropsy\n- Varying degrees of consolidation of the lungs, primarily the\ndiaphragmatic lobes (prominently thickened interlobular septa).\n- Cut surface showed exudate of varying consistency in the bronchi.\n- Kidneys showed congestion both on the surface and in the cortex.\n\n- Brain appeared normal except in a case with petechial haemorrhage.\n- Other visceral organs appeared normal.\n4. Disease in other animals\nSerologically positive dogs, cats, horses and goats were found in the\ninfected areas.\nDogs: lesions observed at necropsy of dogs presenting clinical signs were\nsimilar to those of affected pigs. Kidneys showed severe haemorrhage and\ncongestion. Exudates were present in the trachea and bronchi.\n5. Mode of transmission\nTransmission studies in animals are being carried out at the Australian\nAnimal Health Laboratory (AAHL), CSIRO (1), Australia.\n5.1 Oral inoculation\n- Incubation period for clinical signs was 14 to 16 days.\n- Clinical signs and gross pathology were mild.\n- Virus isolation work is in progress.\n5.2 Parenteral inoculation\n- Two inoculated pigs developed a more severe disease, one showing a\ncentral nervous system syndrome and the other a respiratory tract syndrome.\nSigns developed within 7 to 10 days of challenge.\n5.3 In-contact pigs\n- Infection occurred quickly, possibly at first contact. Neutralising\nantibodies were detected at day 14.\n- Virus multiplication in the tonsils and respiratory epithelium, together\nwith contaminated cellular debris in the lumen of air passages in the lung,\nsuggests that the virus may at least be transmitted by pharyngeal and\nbronchial secretions.\nOther results are pending.\n6. Diagnosis\n6.1 Virus isolation\nTissue samples of lung, liver, kidney, spleen, heart and brain were\ncollected from necropsied animals for virological examination. Samples were\nsent to the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.\nMolecular studies done on the virus isolate showed a 21% difference in the\nnucleotide sequence and an 11% difference in the amino acid sequence\ncompared to the Hendra virus.\n6.2 Serological tests\nTwo laboratories, namely the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI), Ipoh, and\nthe Task Force Laboratory at the Department of Medical Microbiology,\nUniversity of Malaya, were selected to carry out serological tests on the\nveterinary and human sera respectively. Samples were tested using the IgG\nand IgM capture ELISA at the above laboratories and virus neutralisation\ntests at AAHL, Geelong (Australia).\n\n7. Results of serological surveillance in animals during the outbreak period\n7.1 Pigs\nIn a previously infected farm, more than 95% of sows had Nipah virus\nantibodies. More than 90% of the piglets had antibodies assumed to be\nmaternal antibodies. Antibody prevalence across all ages is currently being\nstudied in an infected farm.\n7.2 Horses\nAt a farm in an infected area, 2 of the 47 polo horses were found to have\nNipah virus antibodies and were euthanised. All racehorses in the country\nhave tested negative.\n7.3 Dogs\nMore than 50% of dogs captured in one of the infected areas were positive\nto Nipah virus by IgG capture ELISA using Hendra antigen.\nAntibodies in dogs in other infected areas are also being studied.\n7.4 Cats\nOut of 23 cats tested in the affected area, one was seropositive.\n7.5 Bats\nOut of 99 flying foxes tested, 15 were found to be positive to the virus\nneutralisation test for the Nipah virus.\n7.6 Rodents\nTo date, serum samples from rats trapped in infected areas have all been\nnegative. Further tests are in progress.\n7.7 Other animals\nSera have also been collected from cattle, goats, sheep, squirrels, wild\nboar, wild birds, poultry and ostriches for later testing.\n8. Control and eradication programme\n8.1 Control Programme for Nipah Disease Phase I\nWith the discovery of the aetiology of the disease, a programme was\ndeveloped for immediate eradication of the disease by mass culling of pigs.\n>From 28 February to 26 April 1999, a total of 901,918 pigs were culled in\nfour infected areas (one in the State of Perak, one in Selangor and two in\nNegeri Sembilan).\n8.2 Control Programme for Nipah Disease Phase II\nA surveillance programme was developed to detect previously infected farms\nby testing for the presence of pigs with antibodies to the Nipah virus.\nAll farms outside the previously designated high risk areas will be\nscreened by taking a statistically valid random sample of sows for\ndetection of Nipah virus antibodies. Farms with two consecutive negative\ntests performed within an interval of three weeks will be accorded\n'provisionally free' status. However, farms found to be positive during the\nfirst or second tests will be depopulated.\nTo date, 235 farms have been tested, of which 9 were found to be positive.\nA total of 23,736 animals and 11,458 pigs in 4 of the positive farms have\nbeen culled. In this programme a total of 824 farms with a 1.6 million SPP\n(standing pig population) will be tested.\n9. Actions for the future\nInvestigations will continue in order to ascertain the natural hosts of the\nNipah virus and the modes of transmission to domestic animals and humans.\nThe outbreak has given the Government of Malaysia an opportunity to review\nthe status of the pig industry and the direction for revival of the industry.\n(1) CSIRO: Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[This is the first comprehensive report we have seen and may be the first\ncomprehensive report.

Nor. Any hog farm found with just one infected pig [defined as\nhaving antibody, as far as we can tell - Mod.CC] must destroy its entire\nstock, he was reported as having said. Whereas Nipah virus first was\nobserved to have killed pigs and humans in Negri Sembilan state in western\nMalaysia where 84 people died, the virus has since swept into the states of\nPerak, Johor, Kelantan, Malacca and Selangor.\nHealth officials initially believed the disease was Japanese encephalitis,\n[the etiologic agent of] which is transmitted from pigs to humans by\n_Culex_ mosquitoes. Later, scientists identified a new virus, named Nipah\nafter the Malaysian village where it claimed its first victim.\nThe eight-month outbreak has ruined the pig-farming industry in many parts\nof Malaysia. Pig farmers in the worst-hit area, 60 miles southeast of the\ncapital of Kuala Lumpur, abandoned their homes in March.\nA farm in Sungai Buloh, Selangor, has been listed as 'high risk' after one\nof its workers was admitted to hospital on May 14 and fell into a coma,\nSelangor executive councillor Datuk Abdul Fatah Iskandar said yesterday.\nFatah said the Sungai Buloh farm had 2,600 pigs and 'some of its pigs are\nalso coughing, a symptom of Nipah infection.'\nHealth director-general Tan Sri Dr Abu Bakar Suleiman said the ministry\nexpected some farms outside the outbreak areas to be tested positive\nbecause 'of the way pigs were moved all over the place. 'I am more\nconcerned about farmers and workers taking precautions to protect\nthemselves from being infected by the pigs,' Dr Abu Bakar said in an\ninterview.\n[Bernama reported that] the government is no longer allowing military\npersonnel to be involved in pig culling operations and following the\ndecision, the operation to put down the animals in five pig farms in Alor\nGajah [in Malaka] today had been shelved. State Secretary Datuk Wira Abdul\nAziz Omar said confirmation of the government decision had been conveyed\nearly this morning. 'Thus the operation scheduled to commence at about 8 am\ntoday had to be shelved as there are no shooters,' he said. Pig culling\noperations planned for Perak and Johor were also facing the same problem\nfollowing the decision prohibiting members of the armed forces to be\ninvolved, he said.\nThe operation in Alor Gajah was said to be deemed urgent as the state\ngovernment feared the possibility of an increase in the number of pigs that\nhad to be destroyed as the results of the tests on blood samples taken from\npigs in 93 other farms throughout the state had yet to be received.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[The reports painted a rather grim picture of the present status of the\nNipah virus encephalitis outbreak in peninsular Malaysia. There should be\nno doubt that Nipah virus has already spread countrywide, at least among\npigs. At least one new yet-to-be-confirmed human case (patient is now in a\ncoma) has been reported.

'The other\n81 farms in Johor are located in remote areas, at least 15\nkilometres from any residential area.So there is no reason\nto panic,' he stressed.  A 0.5km radius of the farm has been\nsealed off and the police will deploy a 24-hour road-block near\nthe farm...\nOn blood samples taken from the farmer and seven workers\nfrom the pig farm in Seelong, Dr Chua said the WHO collaborating\ncentre for air-borne [sic -- should read 'arthropod-borne,' meaning\ncarried by mosquitoes, ticks, etc.] viruses in Universiti Malaya had\nconfirmed them negative for the Nipah virus. Dr Chua added that a\nnearby vegetable farm had also been asked to cease operations\nimmediately.\nHealth Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said today only 31\nsuspected JE cases were currently being treated in various\nhospitals in the country...\n'A total of 258 people who were suspected VE cases were\nadmitted at the height of the outbreak in March of which 100\ndied while another 127 had been discharged,' he said...\nHe also reminded residents in VE affected areas in Lukut not\nto return to their houses for the moment until the Cabinet Task\nForce has made a decision on the matter...\nMeanwhile, the JE Humanitarian Fund today received RM30,000 ...\nfor relief work for 204 families affected by the viral encephalitis\noutbreak in Bukit Pelandok.\n>>>>>>>>>>\n>From the very outset of this Nipah virus epidemic -- whenever\nthat was -- we have been bombarded with misinformation and\nmisstatements.  I have not seen or heard of a shred of evidence\nthat there has been a single confirmed case of Japanese\nencephalitis [in peninsular Malaysia] since very early 1999,\neither in humans or in pigs. \nIf such data are available, we would welcome them and would\npost them immediately on ProMED-mail.\nThe basic problem remains definitions for 'a case' and 'an\ninfection with'. Antibody to a virus in a serum sample from an\nill person or pig (or horse or anything else) is confirmatory of\nnothing.  Yet the Malaysian authorities are reported to have\npublicly pronounced this many cases of JE virus and that many\ncases of Nipah virus.  A confirmed 'positive', in terms of a human\nor a pig, depends upon either virus isolation or a change in\nantibody titers between paired acute- and convalescent-phase\nserum samples. \nNo doubt finding IgM antibody in a single serum sample from a\nsick human (or pig) provides excellent presumptive data, but it\ndoes not provide confirmatory evidence of recent infection.\nWe have heard nothing regarding persistence of Nipah virus in\npigs.  If there is evidence that persistent infections occur, we\nwould like to know that -- as would everyone else.  If there is no\nevidence for such a persistent state, then why are pigs that are\n'positive' (assuming this means they have been shown to have\nantibody in a single serum sample) being killed?  Seems to me\nthese immune animals would be the ones to retain.\nUntil we begin to receive real data, rather than statements from\ngovernment spokespeople, ProMED-mail will not post repetitive\nand unhelpful reports, but will continue to post messages regarding\nareas newly discovered to have infected animals, and other\nimportant data. \nNo further mention of Japanese encephalitis will be made here\nunless some confirmatory evidence is presented that JE virus is\nstill circulating or has infected even one human or one pig since,\nsay, January 1999.\nTerms such as 'VE', meaning 'virus encephalitis', are\nobfuscating with regard to whether a human or a pig has\nJapanese encephalitis or Nipah virus.\nThe Malaysian government task force responsible for\ninvestigations of the epizoodemic of Nipah disease is still\ncalled the 'State Japanese encephalitis/Nipah Task Force',\nwhich suggests that JE is not only a current problem but\nTHE principal curent problem. It could as well be called\nthe State Ebola/Yellow Fever/Nipah Task Force and be just\nas accurate. Indeed, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia)\nBerhad, Sat 24 Apr 1999) quoted Health Minister Chua as\nhaving said that there were more than 13 000 malaria cases\nlast year but no yellow fever cases. He could have added no\nsmallpox either.\nPersonally, I suspect that the actual situation with regard to\nthe causes of this epizoodemic, the political reasons and\nrepercussions deriving therefrom, and the overall logistics\nhave not begun to be mentioned.  I have received, addressed\nto me personally, many messages from people in Malaysia\nwho have told me of scientific personnel in Malaysia being\nthreatened with firing, transfers, and funding reductions if they\ncontinue to speak out in conflict with official statements, and of\nother even more heinous accusations. \nThe free exchange of information can never cause the\nexpansion of an epidemic, and statements that the public\nshould not panic cannot begin to assuage public feelings\nthat the entire story is not being told.\n--\nCharles H.
