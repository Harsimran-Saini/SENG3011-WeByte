Even though mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease, 41 of the individuals infected in the reported incident had been fully vaccinated according to the current guidelines. What started as a mild illness in a caretaker of children in Nebraska grew into an epidemic involving communities in six different states. This raises concerns about waning immunity from childhood mumps immunization.\n\nMumps is a highly contagious disease of children and young adults. It is caused by a paramyxovirus of which there is only a single serotype. Humans are the only known host, and infections are spread by direct contact or through droplets from the upper respiratory tract.\n\nThe infection may remain asymptomatic for an incubation period that ranges from 12-25 days. When symptoms are apparent, mumps can present with initial flulike symptoms, such as fever, congestion and aches, followed by a characteristic painful swelling of the jaw. The index case of the outbreak developed left ear and jaw tenderness the day after attending the wedding. Her jaw swelling was noted 11 days after her initial exposure to the virus.\n\nIn most cases, the disease resolves spontaneously within 2 weeks of onset. However, complications such as deafness, infertility or encephalitis may result. Thankfully, the disease can be largely prevented by vaccination.\n\nThe history of mumps dates to the 5th century BC, when Hippocrates described the condition as a bilateral or unilateral swelling near the ears, and noted that some patients had bilateral or unilateral pain and swelling of the testicles. Isolation and culture of the virus did not occur until 1945, however, and a vaccination against it was first licensed in 1967.\n\nWithout routine immunization, the incidence of mumps would be projected to be 100-1000 cases per million, with an epidemic occurring every 4-5 years. Universal vaccination has been a crucial factor in the global decline in the incidence of mumps. Finland was the 1st country to declare itself mumps-free, in 2000, after a national 2-dose vaccination program for children, resulting in high vaccination coverage. In Korea, the mumps vaccine was included in a national immunization program in 1985, and booster doses began in 1997.\n\nSadly, according to the World Health Organization, the mumps vaccine had been introduced nationwide in only 122 countries by the end of 2018. As of June 2020, Japan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and most countries in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa did not have the mumps vaccine included in their national immunization programs.\n\nIn the United States, the CDC recommendation for childhood immunization against mumps is a 2-dose series. The 1st shot is given at 12-15 months of age; the 2nd at 4-6 years. A catch-up vaccination may be done for unimmunized children and adolescents, with 2 doses given at least 4 weeks apart. This is especially recommended for at-risk groups such as post-high school students, health care personnel and international travelers. The mumps vaccine is given along with vaccines against measles and rubella, a combination known as MMR. It confers a 78 percent risk reduction following one dose rising to 88 percent after receiving 2 doses.\n\n[Byline: Ekemini Hogan, Akpabio Akpabio, Utibe Effiong]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[[The finding that the contacts were fully vaccinated is concerning.

Mumps immunity after childhood vaccination can wane by early adulthood (6). It is likely that waning of vaccine-induced immunity contributed to this outbreak, because approximately 2/3 of patients had received 2 or more doses of MMR vaccine, and the median patient age was 35 years. Specific viral factors (such as mutations increasing pathogenicity and shedding) were not a likely contributor because mumps genotype G is commonly implicated in both sporadic cases and outbreaks in the United States (7). However, mumps is most infectious just before and during onset of parotitis (3), and the timing of the event likely contributed to transmission among exposed attendees because the index patient developed parotitis the day after the wedding. The wedding served as a setting conducive to droplet transmission, facilitated by close social contact.\n\nIsolation of ill persons and a communitywide MMR vaccination campaign helped end the outbreak. As of 1 Dec 2019, no additional cases had been identified in community A, nor had any additional cases been identified in any other state as linked to this outbreak. A decline in case count before the campaign was observed, which complicated assessment of the campaign's relative contribution in controlling the outbreak. Collaborative efforts, including early and regular communication between local, state, and national public health authorities, local health care providers, and community officials proved crucial for efficient resource mobilization, strengthened preparedness, and resulted in effective disease containment.\n\nThe full report and references are available at the URL above.\n\nAlso see,\nRasheed MAU, Hickman CJ, McGrew M, et al.

Of more than 12 600 student medical records on file, 196 [students] have submitted waivers, the school told the Charleston City Paper in September [2019].\n\n'We will get through this together. In the meantime, every member of our campus community can and should take steps to safeguard themselves and others against mumps,' read the 14 Nov [2019] update from College of Charleston president Andrew T. Hsu. Previous dispatches were signed by campus emergency officials.\n\n'We are always evaluating the effectiveness of our various communications and making adjustments as needed,' says Ron Menchaca, the college's director of communications. 'With this latest update, which included an announcement of a targeted vaccine clinic, the college opted to issue the message directly from the president to differentiate it from previous updates from our emergency management team.'\n\nThe other new approach, the 'targeted vaccine clinic,' is specifically geared toward fraternities and sororities but is open to anyone on campus; [it is] scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday [19-20 Nov 2019] this week from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the Stern Student Center ballroom.\n\n'The targeted vaccine clinic for students involved in fraternity and sorority activities is being held in response to a recommendation from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control [SCDHEC] and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention due to known risk factors inherent in this population (living/socializing in close quarters, potential sharing of items that could transfer saliva, etc.),' says Menchaca.\n\nA representative from SCDHEC says that the targeted clinic isn't necessarily for those who have not received the vaccine, but rather for those in at-risk communities to receive a 2nd or 3rd dose in order to maximize their protections against illness.\n\nAlong with the climbing number of confirmed mumps cases and the clinic announcement, the school has also started new PSA [public service announcement]-style posts around campus and on social media.\n\n'Don't let mumps ruin your fun. Get vaccinated!' says one of the posts in large block letters above a list of 5 tips for avoiding the contagious disease. Those steps include self-isolating if you feel sick, practicing good hygiene, monitoring your own health, remaining vigilant to those around you, and, topping the list, getting vaccinated.\n\nThose on campus can seek treatment with Student Health Services, located behind the Robert Scott Smalls building near Calhoun Street or at <studenthealth.cofc.edu>.\n\nIn any case, many students will likely leave campus over the Thanksgiving holiday, 27-30 Nov [2019].

Mumps is most recognisable by the painful swellings in the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive 'hamster face' appearance. Other symptoms of mumps include headaches, joint pain, and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands.\nWhile mumps is not usually serious, the condition has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis.\n\nA diagnosis can generally be made after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth, and checking the person's temperature to see if it's higher than normal. Mumps is spread through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.\n\nA person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards. During this time, it's important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated.\n\nSpread of infection can be prevented by\n- regularly washing your hands with soap;\n- using and disposing of tissues when you sneeze; and\n- avoiding school or work for at least 5 days after your symptoms 1st develop.\n\nThe combined MMR vaccine for mumps, measles, and rubella offers protection against mumps infection.

However, protection only comes if about 88% of people have been vaccinated, according to viral vaccines expert Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham. If a majority of people are vaccinated, those susceptible to the infection would benefit from 'herd immunity,' Prof Ball said.\n\nMumps is a contagious viral infection which causes swelling of the parotid glands. General symptoms can include headache, joint pain, feeling sick, tiredness, loss of appetite and a high temperature. It is spread in the same way as colds and flu, through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.\n\nMumps can lead to viral meningitis if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain, although this is rare.\n\nOther complications include swelling of the testicles or ovaries, which may affect a person's fertility.\n\nA person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See the following study on waning mumps immunity over years:\n\n'Lewnard JA and Grad YH.

Following decades of declining mumps incidence amid widespread vaccination, the United States and other developed countries have experienced a resurgence in mumps cases over the last decade. Outbreaks affecting vaccinated individuals and communities with high vaccine coverage have prompted concerns about the effectiveness of the live attenuated vaccine currently in use. It is unclear if immune protection wanes, or if the vaccine protects inadequately against currently circulating mumps virus lineages. Synthesizing data from 6 studies of mumps vaccine effectiveness, we estimated that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps wanes on average 27 (95% confidence interval: 16 to 51) years post-vaccination. After accounting for this waning, we found no evidence that the emergence of heterologous virus genotypes contributed to changes in vaccine effectiveness over time. A mathematical model of mumps transmission confirmed the central role of waning immunity to the vaccine in the re-emergence of mumps cases. Outbreaks from 2006 to the present among young adults, and outbreaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s among adolescents, aligned with peaks in mumps susceptibility of these age groups predicted to be due to loss of vaccine-derived protection. In contrast, evolution of mumps virus strains escaping immune pressure would be expected to cause a higher proportion of cases among children, not adolescents and young adults as observed. Routine use of a 3rd vaccine dose at age 18 years, or booster dosing throughout adulthood, may be a strategy to prevent mumps re-emergence and should be assessed in clinical trials.' - Mod.LK\n\nHealthMap/ProMED maps available at:\nNebraska, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/229\nNew Mexico, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/233\nUnited Kingdom: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40]", "summary": "If people start experiencing mumps-like symptoms, they should contact their doctor.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See the following study on waning mumps immunity over years:\n\n'Lewnard JA and Grad YH.

'We should be vaccinating all at-risk people as early as possible, particularly if we are about to confine them in a closed space with a bunch of other unvaccinated people in the setting of an outbreak.'\n\nThis mumps virus information was gathered through the Freedom of Information Act and confirmed mumps cases in at least 16 different detention facilities in Texas.\n\nPreviously, on 14 Jun 2019, federal authorities confirmed about 4276 individuals were in medical quarantine in 39 immigrant detention centers related to large numbers of mumps and chicken pox cases.\n\nSome of these mumps cases may have originated from countries such as Honduras, which announced significant mumps outbreaks during 2018.\n\n'From an operational perspective, the impact is significant in the short and long term and will result in an increase in cohort detainees' length of stay in detention, an inability to effect removal of eligible detainees, and postponing scheduled consular interviews,' said Nathalie Asher, executive associate director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO).\n\n'Preventing the spread of communicable diseases while in ICE custody is something we have demonstrated success doing,' Asher previously said.\n\nRoutine vaccination of US-bound refugees before travel to the United States is not legally required. However, routine vaccinations are strongly recommended and offered overseas to protect the health, prevent travel delays due to disease outbreaks, and, for children, allow more rapid integration into schools after arrival in the United States.\n\nThe CDC vaccination schedule is modified periodically (May 2019) based on changing Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations, logistics, or availability.\n\nUnfortunately, these are not the only mumps cases being reported in Texas during 2019.\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) confirmed as of [Thu 1 Jul 2019] that there have been 385 total mumps cases during 2019.\n\nDue to a high vaccination rate in Texas, the number of mumps cases has been traditionally low, says DSHS. In 2017, only 470 cases of mumps were reported in Texas.\n\nAs an example of Texas being a proactive vaccination state, DSHS launched Operation Lone Star for its 21st year in July 2019.\n\nIn 2018, DSHS and partners delivered approximately 43 000 health services and vaccinations to 9346 people in southern Texas during this event.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is a recurring mumps risk related to vaccine effectiveness 'waning.' According to a Harvard study in 2018, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps persists, on average, for just 27 years after the last-administered vaccine dose.\n\nIn response to this information, the CDC released new guidance suggesting when a 3rd dose of mumps vaccine is appropriate to administer.\n\nNationwide, from January [2019] to 19 Jul 2019, there have been 45 states and the District of Columbia reporting mumps infections in 1799 people, which is actually good news compared to previous years.\n\nFrom January 2016 to June 2017, health departments reported 9200 mumps cases, including outbreaks at schools, universities, athletics teams and facilities, church groups, workplaces, and large events.\n\nThe mumps virus is easily spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs, sneezes, or talks.\n\nCDC officials say that 'it's never too late to be immunized.' In the USA, there are 2 approved mumps vaccines, MMR-II and ProQuad.\n\n[Byline: Don Ward Hackett]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Outbreaks of mumps in immigrant-holding facilities is not new information. The ProMED-mail post of 6 Jun 2019 reported nearly 300 confirmed cases of mumps in ICE facilities and other immigration detention centers across the country, with the most cases concentrated in Texas, Mississippi, Arizona, and Georgia. Mumps virus transmission continues in Texas and likely in other states as individuals are held in close confinement under conditions that facilitate transmission of the virus. Dr. Jody Rich's advice to vaccinate all at-risk people as early as possible, particularly if we are about to confine them in a closed space with a bunch of other unvaccinated people in the setting of an outbreak, is prudent and good preventive medicine practice.\n\nIn the previous Mumps update (Mumps update: (09): USA (FL) quarantine; archive no. 20190609.6508541), Mod.UBA commented, 'Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus, a member of the Rubulavirus family. The average incubation period for mumps is 16-18 days, with a range of 12-25 days. The mumps virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract and is transmitted person-to-person through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets of a person infected with mumps.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6834a4\nhttps://tinyurl.com/yxbkpr2g\n------------------------------------\nOn 12 Oct 2018, 5 confirmed cases of mumps among migrants who had been transferred between 2 detention facilities were reported by the facilities to the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS). By 11 Dec 2018, 8 Texas detention facilities and 6 facilities in 5 other states had reported 67 mumps cases to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Health Service Corps (IHSC) or local health departments.\n\nOn 12 Dec 2018, TDSHS contacted CDC to discuss mumps control in detention facilities and facilitate communication with IHSC. During 4-17 Jan 2019, 6 more state health departments reported new cases in detention facilities, which prompted CDC and IHSC to launch a coordinated national outbreak response.\n\nDuring 1 Sep 2018-22 Aug 2019, a total of 898 confirmed and probable mumps cases (1) in adult migrants detained in 57 facilities (18% of 315 U.S. facilities that house ICE detainees*) were reported in 19 states (Figure); an additional 33 cases occurred among staff members. Private companies operated 34 facilities; 19 were county jails that house detained migrants, and 4 were ICE-operated. 44 percent (394) of cases were reported from facilities that house ICE detainees in Texas.\n\nMedian patient age was 25 years (range = 17-67); 846 (94%) were male. Based on detainee custody status during their incubation period (12-25 days before symptom onset), most (758, 84%) patients were exposed while in custody of ICE or another U.S. agency; 43 (5%) were exposed before apprehension; and the custody status at the time of exposure of 97 (11%) was unknown. Among those with data on complications, 79 (15%) of 527 male patients reported orchitis, and at least 13 patients were hospitalized. More than half (576, 64%) of cases were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing or viral culture testing at CDC, state public health laboratories, Association of Public Health Laboratories-CDC Vaccine Preventable Disease Reference Centers, or commercial laboratories. Sequencing of isolates from 70 patients identified genotype G, the most common mumps genotype detected in the United States since 2006 (2). IHSC provided over 25 000 doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in response to mumps in 56 facilities.\n\nSince 2015, approximately 150 mumps outbreaks and 16 000 cases have been reported in the United States, typically in close-contact settings such as universities, schools, and athletic events. This is the 1st report of mumps outbreaks in detention facilities.\n\nMMR vaccination efforts differ among detention facilities; facilities should follow local or state health department recommendations for preventing and responding to mumps (3) and should report cases and follow disease control guidance from their health department. Detainees and staff members at increased risk for mumps should be offered MMR vaccine per existing recommendations for vaccination during outbreaks (4,5). MMR vaccine has not been shown to be effective at preventing disease in persons already infected with mumps; facilities should be aware that cases might occur among detainees exposed before vaccination.\n\nHealth departments, CDC, IHSC, and facility health administration can work together to develop appropriate control measures based on local epidemiology and the specific needs of each facility. Identifying and vaccinating close contacts of exposed or symptomatic persons with mumps in detention centers is challenging. IHSC can look up transfer history and facilitate vaccine procurement for detainees in ICE custody upon request from facility health services administrators. CDC is coordinating communication among state and local health departments, IHSC, and other federal partners to mobilize appropriate resources and is providing technical support for implementing appropriate disease control and prevention measures. Effective public health interventions require understanding of facility and custody operations, which often involve frequent transfers of detainees (between facilities and states) and multiple entities with authority for operations and detainee custody.\n\nAs of 22 Aug 2019, mumps outbreaks are ongoing in 15 facilities in 7 states, and new introductions into detention facilities through detainees who are transferred or exposed before being taken into custody continue to occur.\n\n[See URL for references.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n\n[Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus, family Rubulavirus. It spreads through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by\n- coughing, sneezing, or talking\n- sharing items that may have saliva on them, such as water bottles or cups\n- participating in close-contact activities with others, such as playing sports, dancing, or kissing\n- touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others\n\nAn infected person can likely spread mumps from a few days before their salivary glands begin to swell to up to 5 days after the swelling begins. A person with mumps should limit their contact with others during this time.\n\nBefore the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, and many more unreported cases occurred. The disease caused complications, such as permanent deafness in children, and, occasionally, encephalitis, which could rarely result in death. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. From year to year, the number of mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. However, outbreaks still occur, even among highly vaccinated populations.\n\nOrchitis occurs in approximately 20-30% of unvaccinated and 6-7% of vaccinated post-pubertal male mumps patients [In this report, 15% of the cases were noted to have this complication]. In 60% to 83% of males with mumps orchitis, only one testis is affected. Mumps orchitis has not been linked to infertility but may result in testicular atrophy and hypo-fertility (excerpted from https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/hcp.html).\n\nDetention facilities such as those on the US-Mexico border provide the perfect environment for mumps and other highly infectious diseases such as influenza and TB to spread among detainees. It is not clear what is being done to protect the health of at-risk detainees.

In England there has been a significant rise in the number of cases of mumps [in the past year].\n\nThe latest data from Public Health England (PHE) show that there were 5042 lab-confirmed cases of mumps in England in 2019 compared with 1066 cases in 2018. This is the highest number of cases since 2009.\n\nThe steep rise in cases in 2019 has been largely driven by outbreaks in universities and colleges. Many of the cases in 2019 were young adults born in the late 1990s and early 2000s who missed out on the MMR vaccine when they were children.\n\nIn Cheshire East, our uptake was less than 80% for the 2nd dose in the early 2000s, more than 15% below the figure required for group immunity. These cohorts are now old enough to attend college and university and are likely to continue fuelling outbreaks into 2020.\n\nMumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus. Mumps can be caught through direct contact with saliva or droplets from the saliva of an infected person.\n\n[MMR vaccine] uptake has improved locally in recent years with most practices achieving between 90% and 95% for the 1st dose; however, in some towns there are still more than 10% of children who have not had both doses of MMR before they start school.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nUnited Kingdom: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40]\n\n******\nResearch\n---\n[3] Tracking mumps\nDate: Tue 11 Feb 2020\nSource: PLOS Biology [edited]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000611\n\n\nRef: Wohl S, Metsky HC, Schaffner SF, et al: Combining genomics and epidemiology to track mumps virus transmission in the United States.

We paired epidemiological data from public health investigations with analysis of mumps virus whole genome sequences from 201 infected individuals, focusing on Massachusetts university communities. Our analysis suggests continuous, undetected circulation of mumps locally and nationally, including multiple independent introductions into Massachusetts and into individual communities. Despite the presence of these multiple mumps virus lineages, the genomic data show that one lineage has dominated in the USA since at least 2006. Widespread transmission was surprising given high vaccination rates, but we found no genetic evidence that variants arising during this outbreak contributed to vaccine escape. Viral genomic data allowed us to reconstruct mumps transmission links not evident from epidemiological data or standard single-gene surveillance efforts and also revealed connections between apparently unrelated mumps outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[Recommended reading.

It is spread by coughing, sneezing, or close contact with an infected person. Mumps causes a fever, headache, earache, and inflammation of the salivary glands which results in swelling and tenderness at the angle of the jaw. Anyone who thinks that they have mumps should contact their provider before going for care so proper precautions can be taken to prevent exposure to others.\n\nSevere complications are rare but can include meningitis, decreased fertility, permanent hearing loss, and, in extreme cases, fetal loss during 1st trimester of pregnancy. There is no treatment for mumps.

University officials say the vast majority of students involved had been immunized previously with the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella.\n\nSo why are so many still appearing on campus with the mumps' signature swollen cheeks?\n\nJames Garrow, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health says, for mumps, the vaccine's power can wane over time. 'The MMR vaccine is excellent against measles and rubella. Against mumps it provides good immunity, but not excellent,' he says. 'By the time (students) get to college, their immunity is lowered.'\n\nOn Wednesday [27 Mar 2019], Temple set up a free clinic to provide students with booster shots. Mark Denys, the director of Student and Employee Health Services at Temple, says many of the 2206 people vaccinated had already received the required 2 rounds of the vaccine, but 'wanted to make sure they were covered.'\n\nHealth official are hopeful the booster, which will be offered again on Friday [29 Mar 2019], will help curtail the spread of the virus. But it could take a while.\n\n[Byline: Rebecca Ellis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which is highly effective. This protects against 3 diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella. The CDC recommends that children get 2 doses of MMR vaccine: the 1st dose at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years of age. However, mumps outbreaks can occur, particularly in settings where people have close prolonged contact, such as universities and close-knit communities.\n\nDuring these outbreaks, people who previously had 1 or 2 doses of MMR vaccine can get mumps as well. Experts aren't sure why vaccinated people still get mumps; it could be that their immune system didn't respond as well as it should have to the vaccine. Or their immune system's ability to fight the infection decreased over time. Disease symptoms are milder and complications are less frequent in vaccinated people. Also, high vaccination coverage helps to limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks.

However, mumps outbreaks can occur, particularly in settings where people have close prolonged contact, such as universities and close-knit communities.

When the discovery was made at the campus, students were sent home with a letter detailing how the district was handling the sanitation of the school, and phone calls were made that same evening.\n\nIn the letter, information on how the virus is spread, symptoms of the mumps and vaccination details were all highlighted. It also encouraged families to keep sick children out of school.\n\nAccording to Hidalgo County Health and Human Services Director Eduardo Olivarez, keeping the public informed in this way is one of the ways to keep the virus contained.\n\n'Of all the cases [in the county], over half of them are between 20 and 30 years old, which is odd,' Olivarez said. 'We're talking with the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and the Department of State Health Services, and we can't figure it out. It's not a new strain or a wild strain; it's genotype G, for general mumps. Across the country, it's all the same age group, so we don't think it was a bad lot of vaccines because it's so spread out.'\n\nAs of Monday [20 May 2019] morning, 46 confirmed cases of the mumps have been diagnosed in Hidalgo County since the end of March/beginning of April 2019.\n\n'Confirmation is done by a combination of laboratory testing and physical symptoms identified by a physician,' Olivarez said. 'We have reported cases in pretty much every major community in Hidalgo County, so this is no longer in just a concentrated area.'\n\nThere are cases in Mission, McAllen, Pharr, Weslaco, San Juan and Edinburg.\n\n'The good thing is of those 46 cases, probably less than 8 as of printing may still be contagious, but all the other cases are no longer contagious,' Olivarez said. 'But they're isolated; they are staying home from work or school.'\n\nOlivarez said that currently, there are 10 pending cases that the county is still waiting to hear results from. He brought up the R0 (pronounced 'R naught') measurement, which is the number of people one sick person will infect.\n\nThe R0 for mumps states that for every person who contracts the virus, 10 more will be infected. The value for hepatitis C and Ebola is 2, for HIV and SARS, 4, and measles is 18.\n\n'I'm expecting a 3rd wave, which is probably going to be right about now,' Olivarez said. 'Towards the end of this month [May 2019], I'm expecting more cases to come up just because of exposure. I'm expecting another one at the end of June 2019.'\n\nOlivarez said the high vaccination rate in the county has prevented the virus from spreading faster and kept it more contained. 46 cases out of over an estimated one million people is less than .01 percent.\n\n'We have an average vaccination rate [ages 6 to 19 in Hidalgo County] of 85 to 90 percent vaccinated,' Olivarez said. 'That's a high number, and it's been like that for several years.'\n\nThe department also stressed that the current spread of the virus has not come from any immigration issues in Hidalgo County. They have been in weekly contact with Customs and Border Patrol, who have seen one outbreak in a Cameron County detention facility but none in Hidalgo.\n\n'I average 2-3 mumps cases every year, usually found in children,' Olivarez said. 'This is the 1st time we have had a public outbreak in many years, probably over 15, 20 years.'\n\nThe mumps outbreak will be considered finished after the county goes 42 days without a case.\n\n[Byline: Jamie Trevino]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The report notes that over half of the cases are between 20 and 30 years old.

Sci Transl Med. 2018 Mar 21; 10(433): eaao5945. doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.aao5945.\n\nAbstract.\n'Following decades of declining mumps incidence amid widespread vaccination, the United States and other developed countries have experienced a resurgence in mumps cases over the last decade. Outbreaks affecting vaccinated individuals and communities with high vaccine coverage have prompted concerns about the effectiveness of the live attenuated vaccine currently in use. It is unclear if immune protection wanes, or if the vaccine protects inadequately against currently circulating mumps virus lineages. Synthesizing data from 6 studies of mumps vaccine effectiveness, we estimated that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps wanes on average 27 (95% confidence interval: 16 to 51) years post-vaccination. After accounting for this waning, we found no evidence that the emergence of heterologous virus genotypes contributed to changes in vaccine effectiveness over time. A mathematical model of mumps transmission confirmed the central role of waning immunity to the vaccine in the re-emergence of mumps cases. Outbreaks from 2006 to the present among young adults, and outbreaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s among adolescents, aligned with peaks in mumps susceptibility of these age groups predicted to be due to loss of vaccine-derived protection. In contrast, evolution of mumps virus strains escaping immune pressure would be expected to cause a higher proportion of cases among children, not adolescents and young adults as observed. Routine use of a 3rd vaccine dose at age 18 years, or booster dosing throughout adulthood, may be a strategy to prevent mumps re-emergence and should be assessed in clinical trials.' - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] Malaysia (Terengganu)\nDate: Tue 14 May 2019\nSource: Rojak Daily [abridged, edited]\nhttp://www.rojakdaily.com/news/article/6813/mumps-cases-on-the-rise-in-terengganu-182-recorded-in-just-one-week\n\n\nThe spread of mumps in Terengganu has recorded an alarming increase to 182 cases as of Sun [12 May 2019], compared to only 114 cases earlier this month [May 2019], Astro Awani reported.\n\nTerengganu health director Dr Mohd Jusoh told the news portal that the increase of 68 cases within a span of 2 weeks involved a full boarding school in Kuala Terengganu.

As of [18 Mar 2019], there have been 54 cases of mumps at Temple -- 12 confirmed and 42 probable --, according to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.\n\nAlthough mumps cases were rare in the years following the introduction of the Mumps, Measles and Rubella (MMR) vaccine in 1971, a resurgence of outbreaks has occurred in recent years among vaccinated individuals. Many of those 54 people at Temple had the MMR vaccine. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), experts do not know exactly why vaccinated individuals still contract mumps. They suspect it could have to do with the number of doses and the immune system not responding properly to the vaccine.\n\nDana Perella, program manager for the Acute Communicable Disease Program at the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, said even though someone may have the MMR vaccine, cases can still occur years after vaccination, and the disease appears frequently on college campuses. 'Mumps outbreaks can still occur, and in recent years, have been reported in settings like universities, where individuals have close, prolonged contact,' Perella said.\n\nAlthough contracting mumps is possible even with vaccination, symptoms are not as severe or life-threatening if vaccinated. Those symptoms include fever, painful, swollen salivary glands and pain while chewing or swallowing. There is currently no treatment for mumps, but the immune systems of vaccinated individuals can fight off the virus in several days.\n\nNene Okunna, Ph.D., assistant professor of interdisciplinary health services and public health specialist, said the outbreak is a public health issue resulting from people not vaccinating their children out of fear that vaccinations cause autism -- a connection that has been repeatedly disproved. 'The problem is if people don't get vaccinated, then these diseases are spread across campus,' Okunna said. 'This is a problem particularly on university campuses because we have a lot of people on one campus. That's why it's so concerning what we are seeing at Temple.'\n\nSt. Joe's requires all incoming freshman and transfer students to have 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, as well as 2 varicella, 4 polio and 4 tetanus/diphtheria/ pertussis with a booster within the past 10 years, according to Eileen Bevilacqua, director of the Student Health Center.\n\nThis is not the case at all universities. Some schools recommend rather than require vaccinations. Until the mumps outbreak, this was the case at Temple. 'Temple did not have requirements for vaccine records other than meningitis, which is a federal law if a student lives in campus housing,' Bevilacqua said. 'On their website, they state they will now require proof of MMR, varicella and tetanus/ diphtheria/ pertussis of all incoming students.'\n\nEven though all St. Joe's students are required to have the MMR vaccine, Bevilacqua and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health still advise students to take precautionary measures, such as washing their hands, not sharing utensils and staying away from infected individuals for 5 days. 'The SHC [Student Health Center] constantly discusses with students infection control measures such as washing your hands, coughing and sneezing into your sleeve and frequently wiping down surfaces that are touched regularly with a disinfectant wipe,' Bevilacqua said.\n\n[Byline: Alysa Bainbridge]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Ship outbreak\nDate: Tue 19 Mar 2019\nSource: CNN [edited]\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/19/politics/new-virus-case-us-warship/index.html\n\n\nA new case of a viral infection aboard a US navy warship was reported [Tue 19 Mar 2019], which means the USS Fort McHenry will continued to be quarantined at sea in the Middle East, according to the US Navy 5th Fleet.\n\nThe new case means 26 sailors and Marines have fallen ill on board since December [2018]. The Navy said it is awaiting findings from a medical team before deciding when the ship can be deemed safe to pull into a port.\n\nLast week CNN reported that the Fort McHenry had essentially been quarantined at sea for over 2 months and has been unable to make a port call due the outbreak of the mumps-like virus. The 26 sailors and Marines aboard the amphibious warship have been diagnosed with parotitis, which causes symptoms similar to mumps, according to US military officials.\n\nUntil CNN asked about the incident, the US military had not disclosed it. 'None of the cases are life-threatening and all have either already made or are expected to make a full recovery,' the 5th Fleet said in a statement provided to CNN last week.\n\nAll 703 military personnel aboard the ship have received measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster vaccinations, according to the US Navy's 5th Fleet headquartered in Bahrain.\n\nThe ship is currently operating in the Persian Gulf region and military medical officials are assessing when it may be deemed medically safe to make a port call.\n\nA US military official told CNN that when there are major disease outbreaks, a decision may be taken to halt port visits until 30 days after the last reported illness due to varying incubation periods. But the Fort McHenry did make a port call in early January in Romania when it was in the Black Sea before traveling back through the Mediterranean and into the Middle East.\n\nAfter they became ill, the patients were quarantined and treated in the ship's medical facility. Living and work spaces were disinfected. None of the personnel had to be medivac'd off the ship and all are expected to make a full recovery. The ship, which carries Marines to perform amphibious warfare duties, did have some of its scheduled training modified to deal with the outbreak's impact.\n\n[Byline: Barbara Starr]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] History of mumps and other vaccines\nDate: Wed 20 Mar 2019\nSource: STAT News [edited]\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2019/03/20/mumps-greg-cant-play-photo/?utm_source=STAT+Newsletters&utm_campaign=6e09894eb8-Daily_Recap&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-6e09894eb8-149684921\n\n\nIt was 1957 and Greg Cox, 7 years old, was at home in Altamont, Ill., a compress wrapped from chin to hairline.

The outbreak response is detailed in the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [see reference below].\n\n'Response to this mumps outbreak in a Colorado Marshallese community was facilitated by building relationships with church leaders, leading to early active surveillance, public education, and mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccination clinics,' the authors write in the report. 'These interventions might have contributed to the rapid interruption of transmission and limited spread of mumps to other local communities.'\n\nThe cases were first identified as being linked to the church on 19 Jan 2017, when patient interviews indicated that all of the ill individuals had attended events at the church. Local health departments worked in collaboration to launch an outbreak investigation immediately.\n\nHealth officials met with leaders of the church to implement active surveillance measures upon learning that facial swelling -- a symptom linked to mumps -- was circulating though members of the church community. The church leaders provided health officials with addresses and phone numbers of church members to inquire about vaccination history, occurrence and timing of symptoms, travel history, household visitors, and church attendance.\n\nIn total, church leaders provided a list of 21 members to officials, and a total of 17 members -- representing 15 households -- were responsive. The total number of individuals living in the 15 households was 117.\n\nHealth officials conducted interviews with the head of household and received information about 76 individuals. Among the 76, 22 individuals reported attending at least one other event at an additional Marshallese church. Additionally, 3 households reported visitors from Arkansas where a concurrent outbreak was occurring in the Marshallese population, including one visitor who reported a swollen jaw at the time of visit.\n\nIn total, there were 47 outbreak cases -- 17 confirmed and 30 probable -- across 2 counties in the Denver Metropolitan area. A probable outbreak case was defined as the occurrence of mumps-compatible symptoms on or after 1 Nov 2016, and an epidemiologic link to the Marshallese community. A confirmed case was defined as identification by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or culture in an individual with a probable case.\n\nAmong ill individuals, 24 were male (51%), the median age was 20 years, and onset of illness ranged from 1 Nov 2016, to 28 Mar 2017. 46 cases (98%) occurred in Marshallese persons.\n\nReported symptoms included parotitis in 47% of individuals, bilateral swelling (22%), jaw pain (74%), malaise (62%), fever (57%), and submandibular swelling (47%).\n\nThe authors indicate a challenge was faced in determining MMR vaccination status in the patients. None of the confirmed case patients were able to provide personal vaccination records and 34 of 47 patients did not have doses recorded in the Colorado Immunization Information System.\n\nAs part of the outbreak response, health officials met with community leaders who disseminated information about mumps to prevent further transmission. As a result, vaccination clinics were held during the 5 weeks following outbreak identification with the goal of vaccinating all eligible individuals in the area. In total, 164 MMR doses were administered to 126 church attendees.\n\nThe outbreak was declared over on 17 May 2017, following 50 days or 2 incubation periods after the last reported case. No serious complications or deaths associated with the outbreak were reported.\n\nThe authors listed 3 distinct limitations of the findings. First, vaccination status was determined by information recorded in the Colorado Immunization registry, which likely did not consist of all of the affected individuals' vaccination records due to the highly mobile population in this area.\n\nLanguage and cultural barriers may have led to the collection of incorrect information despite the use of interpreters and translated documents. Also, there was uncertainty regarding living arrangements which made the identification of household members a challenge and may have resulted in incorrect estimations of household size.\n\nOverall, the ability to stop the spread of the outbreak by working with community leaders emphasizes the importance of using community partnerships in outbreak situations.\n\n[Byline: Michaela Fleming]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Reference\n---------\nMarx GE, Burakoff A, Barnes M, et al.

Congressman Jason Crow wants to hear from the Department of Homeland Security about the situation with mumps, reported chicken pox and facility expansion at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.\n\nICE responded to the mumps case with this statement, 'With the recent influx of migrants coming from the southern border, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has confirmed 1 new case of parotitis, mumps, at our Denver Contract Detention Facility. Medical personnel are credited with reducing the further infection of detainees by their quick reaction to quarantine everyone who may have been inadvertently exposed to stop the spread of the disease. Each detainee receives a medical examination upon arrival at the facility to check for potential signs of illness, however ICE has no way of knowing what viruses a person may have been exposed to prior to entering the facility. Mumps is highly contagious, easily contracted by nearby people and difficult to detect until symptoms appear. ICE and the medical professionals employed by GEO took the necessary steps to quickly isolate the exposed detainees, provide proper medical care and prevent further spread of the disease. Preventative steps included education, early recognition, and following the guidelines established by the CDC and Immigration Health Services Corps (IHSC). We strive to ensure people in our care are treated with compassion and we work to get them back to health as quickly as possible while mitigating the spread of this and all diseases.'\n\nA private contractor runs the facility on Oakland Street. Crow, a Democrat representing Aurora and Adams County, contends the facility has been remodeled to increase the number of detainees by several hundred.\n\nIn particular, Crow is concerned about reports of chicken pox outbreaks. 'There are workers, people and family members who are coming and going from this facility into our community- every day and if there are continued outbreaks we are very concerned about that from a public health and safety perspective,' said Crow during a visit to the facility on [Wed 20 Feb 2019].\n\nRA's brother is one of those being detained in the suddenly expanding facility.

Last year [2018], the uptake of childhood vaccinations dropped slightly in Donegal, and this resulted in an outbreak of measles in January this year [2019].'\n\nThe HSE says 'There is also an ongoing mumps outbreak across Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. The HSE has been notified of 116 cases so far.\n\n'As soon as vaccination rates fall, diseases like measles and mumps return. Fortunately, the majority of people in Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim are protecting their children with vaccination. The most recent figures for 2018 show that 90% of children in Donegal received the MMR and 93% of children in Sligo and Leitrim received it.\n\n'However, over 95% of children need to be vaccinated with the MMR in order to prevent the spread of measles in our community. This is the goal for 2019, as it is really important for 'herd immunity'. In this way, we can protect newborns and vulnerable children, including those with cancer or immune problems who can't get vaccinated, from coming in contact with measles and other diseases like meningitis.'\n\nThis year [2019] European Immunisation Week runs 24-30 Apr. The goal is to raise awareness of the benefits of vaccination and to celebrate the vaccine heroes who contribute to protecting lives through vaccination. Vaccine heroes include health workers who administer vaccines, parents who choose vaccination for their children, and everyone who promotes vaccination.\n\n'Every parent wants to protect their child and do what's right for them. Sometimes it can be difficult to know what to do, now that there is so much false and misleading information on the internet and social media when it comes to vaccination,' says Dr. Laura Heavey, Specialist Registrar in Public Health Medicine in HSE North West, 'I would really encourage parents to look for information in the right places. Two good sources of reliable, evidence-based information are <www.immunisation.ie> and the Vaccine Knowledge Project at http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/. Essentially all of the vaccines on the infant, child and adolescent schedule in Ireland are backed up with years of data on their safety.'\n\nAnother goal for the HSE in 2019 is to continue to increase the uptake of the HPV vaccine in teenagers. In 2018, 70% of teenage girls in Ireland got the vaccine. In Scotland, where HPV vaccination started over 10 years ago and 90% of teenage girls get the HPV vaccine, researchers have found that the vaccine has nearly wiped out cases of cervical pre-cancer in young women. We want to see as many Irish teenagers as possible getting vaccinated in 2019, so that we can see those same results here. This year [2019], the vaccine will also be offered to teenage boys. If all our young people receive the vaccine, cervical cancer could be eliminated in Ireland in the future.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Ireland: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39]\n\n******\n[2] Indiana\nDate: Wed 17 Apr 2019\nSource: US News and World Report [edited]\nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/indiana/articles/2019-04-17/indiana-u-mumps-outbreak-reaches-16-cases-9-linked-to-frat\n\n\nIndiana University officials say the number of students diagnosed with mumps has more than doubled since last week to 16.

IU spokesman Chuck Carney says there have been 17 confirmed mumps cases on campus since 12 Feb 2019, of which 9 have been linked to a single fraternity house.\n\nWhile the school is not identifying the students or the fraternity, CNN reported that those affected by the outbreak were either members of the fraternity or had visited the house.\n\nCarney went on to say that every student enrolled at IU is required to have 2 doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine -- the amount recommended by the CDC -- with an exemption available for religious reasons.\n\nOn 4 Apr 2019, the Monroe County Health Department held a free MMR vaccination clinic at the fraternity house, which allowed members to get a 3rd shot 'which provides about a month of boosted immunity.' Of the 149 members of the fraternity, 58% got a vaccine.\n\nThe school is also taking steps to promote healthy practices in general. 'We're making the campus aware and advising students to say home if they feel sick and otherwise practice good hygiene habits -- wash their hands with soap and water, don't drink or eat after someone, cover a sneeze with a tissue, for example,' Carney said. 'We want all of our 41 000-plus students to remain healthy, so they should go to the IU Health Center on the IU Bloomington campus and get checked out if they feel unwell or see their own doctor.'\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, mumps is 'a viral infection that primarily affects saliva-producing (salivary) glands that are located near your ears.' Signs and symptoms of the virus typically develop between 2 to 3 weeks after exposure.\n\nIn addition to painful gland swelling, mumps can also cause fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and loss of appetite. However, in rare cases, the contagious disease has been known to cause brain and spinal cord damage as well as death, according to the CDC. The virus is transmitted through saliva or mucus, and can be spread by sharing cups and utensils, or participating in close-contact activities, like sports or kissing, the CDC says.\n\nBoth mumps and measles can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, but measles cases are on the rise worldwide. The World Health Organization said in a report released on Monday [15 Apr 2019] that based on preliminary data, measles cases are up by 300% worldwide in the first 3 months of 2019, compared with the same period last year [2018], adding that the new data 'indicate a clear trend' of rising rates of infection.\n\nEarlier this year [2019], the organization named 'vaccine hesitancy' -- the 'reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability' -- as one of the biggest threats to global health in 2019. Thanks to the measles vaccine, 2 to 3 million deaths are prevented each year, WHO said, but that number could be much higher. 'A further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved,' the group said.\n\nCases of the measles in the USA are now at a 5-year high. As of 11 Apr, there have been a reported 555 measles cases in 2019, according to the CDC, the most since 2014.\n\nThe CDC says that there are currently outbreaks of the measles in several parts of the USA, including the Pacific Northwest, Michigan and New York City. They believe the outbreaks are due to people traveling to other countries with significant outbreaks, including Israel, the Philippines and Ukraine, and then coming back to the USA and infecting people in areas with low vaccination rates.\n\nAlthough the measles was considered eradicated in the USA as of 2000 thanks to the vaccine, some people are choosing to not vaccinate, partially due to the spread of misinformation about the vaccine, which has led parents to opt out of giving children the life-saving protections.\n\n[Byline: Maria Pasquini]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[3] Penn State University outbreak\nDate: Wed 17 Apr 2019\nSource: WJAC-TV [edited]\nhttps://wjactv.com/news/local/penn-state-announces-mumps-outbreak-during-spring-2019-warns-community\n\n\nAnother case of the mumps has been confirmed at Penn State. This comes just a week after the university announced the 1st cases, during the spring semester. The university says this latest case is now the 3rd confirmed case of the mumps at the University Park campus, and the state's Department of Health considers this a mumps outbreak.\n\n'We're encouraging people that may have children or may not be immune to mumps to really be careful if they're coming to campus,' infectious disease manager and campus health liaison Shelley Haffner said. Haffner is giving a warning to those who might visit the University Park campus as it faces another mumps outbreak.\n\nHealth officials say mumps is a highly contagious disease that can be passed through saliva. Penn State also dealt with mumps outbreaks in spring 2017 and spring 2018.\n\nThe first 2 cases were confirmed last week. That led the university to put out a warning for folks before Blue-White Weekend activities begin, bringing big crowds. The university says it has 3 more suspected cases. 'We want to stress the importance of understanding possible is: They could end up being something other than mumps,' Haffner said.\n\nIn order to protect students, the university says one student has left campus and the others have been isolated until further notice.\n\nIf any students have come in contact with those infected, the university advises them to get a 3rd dose of the measles, mumps and rubella -- MMR -- vaccine. Students are required to be vaccinated. Those who don't have proof of the MMR vaccine may be excluded from campus. 'That means they cannot come to classes on campus, or live on campus,' Haffner said.\n\nHealth center officials say they're working closely with the Department of Health to monitor the situation. 'As I said, we only have 3 confirmed cases at this point so we're just going to have to wait and see if more cases develop,' Haffner said.\n\nUniversity officials say there is a concern when it comes to big crowds.

At least 2 Sanpete County residents have contracted mumps, the Central Utah Public Health Department announced in a press release Monday [15 Apr 2019]. The health department stated it was investigating 'other probable cases with close contact to the identified cases.'\n\nUnvaccinated individuals will be allowed to return to school 26 days from the onset of the last identified case, the department stated. Currently, that date would be 5 May 2019. Those individuals will have to provide documentation of their receipt of the MMR vaccine before they can return. No further information about the mumps-infected individuals would be released, the health department stated.\n\nMumps is contagious and caused by a virus, the department stated. Signs and symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, and swelling of the salivary glands, causing a tender and swollen jaw. Complications of mumps can include swelling of the brain, meningitis, and deafness.\n\nThe department provided some guidelines to reduce the risk of getting mumps, including:\n- Stay current on recommended vaccines; the MMR vaccine is the best way to reduce the likeliness of getting mumps. Know the vaccination status of yourself and any family members. A person is considered susceptible unless they have received 2 doses of the mumps vaccine or were born prior to 1957.\n- Contact your healthcare provider if you see signs of mumps in yourself or a family member. Do not go directly to a clinic or hospital without calling before. This will help to ensure that others are not exposed.\n\n[Byline: Alyssa Roberts]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Utah, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/246]\n\n[Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus.

From 1-31 Jan 2019, mumps infections have been reported in 58 people from 18 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThis new data is good news when compared with 2018 when the CDC confirmed 2251 mumps cases. But, this CDC data may not include mumps cases reported by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency during 2019. So far, ICE facilities in Colorado and Texas have reported mumps cases.\n\nThe leading states reporting mumps cases during 2019 include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Arkansas: The Department of Health said cases of the mumps have been confirmed on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A total of 3 cases have been confirmed and there is another suspected case of the mumps at the university over the last few weeks.\n\n- Georgia: Nancy Nydam, Director of Communications for The Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote, 'An outbreak of mumps has been reported at the facility and the investigation is ongoing.'\n\n- Illinois: 8 cases were reported in 2 locations; 6 at Crystal Lake church and 2 at the McHenry County Correctional Facility. Health officials are working to determine if the 2 locations are related.\n\n- Indiana: 2 confirmed cases of the mumps have been found at Indiana University in Bloomington, health officials said.\n\n- Montana: 3 cases of mumps are confirmed in children attending Bozeman public schools, and health officials are investigating other possible cases.\n\n- North Dakota: The North Dakota Department of Health has confirmed 5 cases of mumps statewide, 3 of them in Stark County and 2 in Williams County.\n\n- Pennsylvania: Officials at a Delaware County elementary school are warning parents after a student was diagnosed with mumps. Officials at Garrett-Ford Elementary in Drexel Hill sent an email to parents regarding the health concern.\n\n- Utah: Southern Utah health officials say they have a reported case of mumps that popped up at an elementary school in St. George earlier this month [February 2019]. However, they believe because of the long delay before symptoms show, there could be more cases.\n\n- Wisconsin: A Marquette University student has contracted mumps. In an email to students, the school said the infected student lives in one of the residence halls.\n\nInternationally, Ireland has reported a mumps outbreak during 2019. According to reporting by the Irish Times, there have been 278 mumps cases in the 1st 6 weeks of 2019, compared with 43 for the same time in 2018, according to the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. A total of 9 outbreaks were reported in school, university, community, and private home settings, with the majority of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults.\n\nA major factor contributing to mumps outbreaks is being in a crowded environment or living in a dormitory with a person who is infectious with mumps, says the CDC.\n\nOne mumps outbreak in Ireland forced the cancellation of a schools rugby match in south Dublin, while Trinity College, DCU, and schools in Co Louth have also been affected. During 2018, various colleges have reported mumps cases, such as Cincinnati, Emory, Harvard, James Madison University, Michigan, Northern Colorado, Northeastern University, Oklahoma University, Penn State, TCU, Texas State and Western Illinois University.\n\nAccording to the previous study, another potential cause of these mumps outbreaks is 'waning-immunization'. A previous study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps persists on average about 27 years, after the last administered dose.\n\nIn response to the expanding number of mumps outbreaks, the CDC released guidance in October 2017, regarding when the 3rd dose of mumps vaccine is appropriate. This new CDC guidance did not recommend a 3rd MMR dose outside of a 'confirmed mumps outbreak'.\n\nAnother reason for mumps outbreaks could be under-vaccinations by international travelers.\n\nThe mumps component of the MMR vaccine has reported being 88% effective when a person gets 2 vaccine doses.\n\n[Byline: Don Ward Hackett]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania: Temple University on alert after students test positive for mumps\nDate: Fri 1 Mar 2019\nSource: 6abc [abridged, edited]\nhttps://6abc.com/health/temple-on-alert-after-students-test-positive-for-mumps/5162886/\n\n\nStudents, faculty and staff at Temple University have been notified about cases of mumps on campus.

An outbreak has now sickened 100 times that. The mumps outbreak in Hawaii has hit the 1000 case mark, according to the state Health Department.\n\nTypically, the state sees less than 10 cases a year. In 2017, Hawaii saw more than 760.\n\nThe majority of cases were reported on Oahu, with 810 confirmed cases. Hawaii Island saw 134 cases, Kauai saw 49, and Maui has 7 confirmed cases.\n\nThis has been the largest outbreak of the disease in the islands in decades. An Oahu charter school even had to start winter break early to prevent the disease from spreading. There also have been 31 reports of complications since the outbreak, including hearing loss. 'For now, it's still trickling along,' said Dr. Sarah Park, Department of Health.\n\nPark said we're nowhere near ending the outbreak, although it seems the outbreak may at least be slowing down a bit. The outbreak started in March 2017, after the Health Department reported 9 people had the viral infection. The infection is spread through saliva. Park said sharing food, drinks, or other activities that could transmit saliva should be avoided.\n\nThe disease is not considered life-threatening, but there can be complications. Symptoms can include fever, headaches, swollen glands under the ear or jaw, and muscle aches.\n\nThe state Department of Health said the best way to prevent mumps is to get vaccinated.\n\nFor more information on mumps, visit the state Health Department's website.\n\n[Byline: Samie Gebers]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There, unfortunately, have been 31 cases of mumps in Hawaii with complications, including loss of hearing.

Our (health) institution has taken care of in its different units 54 persons diagnosed with mumps. Five cases of this condition were seen last week, according to a report issued by the General Direction of Epidemiology from the Federal Health Secretary.\n\nThe data published in the Health Secretary website indicate that these 54 cases of this vaccine-preventable disease outnumber the 32 cases found during the same time period in 2017, emphasizing that the condition is equally affecting men and women.\n\nIn this sense, Mr. Fernando Izquierdo-Aquino, Public Health Sub-Secretary, pointed out that the National Epidemiological Surveillance Council sent a communication to all its facilities, declaring an alert state because of this mumps outbreak occurring since last April [2018], emphasizing that medical units should take special care with these cases.\n\n'We are alert in order to avoid blockade and take care of affected persons who may present with the symptoms; for this reason, the most important aspect is to immediately go to health-care facilities should any upper respiratory symptom occur,' he declared. Mr Izquierdo-Aquino also mentioned that the duration of this outbreak is unknown. The occurrence is located in the northern Mexican states, but the other state authorities are in an alert state.\n\n'Mumps is an acute self-limiting condition, as is the case for conjunctivitis, but it is a preventable condition, and our strength lies in our vaccination schedule, in which the triple viral vaccine (MMR: measles, mumps, and rubella) is administered to children less than 5 years of age,' he pointed out.\n\nThe Mexican National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE, according to its Spanish initials) has identified cases and outbreaks in the country since the last weeks of 2017. The increase in the number of mumps cases is affecting many areas of the country, especially Tamaulipas State in Ciudad Madero and Tampico municipalities; Quintana Roo State, Solidaridad municipality; and Nuevo Leon State, Monterrey municipality.\n\nUp to the 15th epidemiological week for 2018, 2619 mumps cases have been identified in Mexico; the most affected states are as follows: Tamaulipas, 561 cases (21 percent); Nuevo Leon, 302 (12 percent); Quintana Roo, 203 (8 percent); Jalisco, 189 (7 percent), and Chihuahua, 167 (6 percent).\n\nThe most affected age groups all over the country are 25-44-year-old adults, with 805 cases (31 percent); followed by the 20-24-year-old group, with 531 cases (20 percent), and 5-9-year-old children, with 388 cases (15 percent).\n\nGender distribution shows a mild male predominance, with 1450 affected males (55 percent) and 1169 female cases (45 percent).\n\nIn this year so far, mumps outbreaks have been identified in Mexico City, Sonora, and Chihuahua.

Inflammation results in swelling of the tissues that surround the salivary glands, redness, and soreness.

Inflammation of the salivary glands reduces their ability to function properly and may lead to infections within the mouth.\n\nParotitis may result from many causes, including infection, drugs, radiation, and various diseases. Mumps was once the most common viral cause of parotitis, but vaccination has made mumps a rare disease today. Parotitis caused by bacterial infection is somewhat common in the United States (excerpted from https://www.healthgrades.com/conditions/parotitis).\n\nIt is not surprising that the outbreaks in Mexico have occurred in colleges affecting young people, as colleges have close living accommodations where infectious diseases easily spread.

The states with the highest number of cases are: Tamaulipas-561 (21 percent), Nuevo Le\u00f3n with 302 (12 percent), Quintana Roo with 203 (8 percent), Jalisco with 189 (7 percent) and Chihuahua with 167 (6 percent).\n\nThe most affected age groups nationwide are adults from 25 to 44 years old, with 805 (31 percent), followed by the group of 20 to 24 years old with 531 (20 percent) and children from 5 to 9 years old, with 388 (15 percent).\n\nLast year, Mexico reported a total of 4653 cases of mumps.\n\nMumps: Why it's seen a resurgence\n---------------------------------\nMumps is an acute infectious disease caused by the mumps virus. It is spread via coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing glasses or utensils, and touching a surface that has the virus on it. Mumps is suspected when there is swelling of one or more of the saliva glands. The swelling may just be on one side, but is more commonly on both. Sometimes the glands under the tongue or jaw are affected also. Other possible symptoms of mumps include: fever, headache, earache, tiredness, sore muscles, dry mouth, poor appetite, and trouble talking, chewing, or swallowing.\n\nBefore the swelling occurs, flu-like symptoms appear in about half of those who get the virus. In children under 5, mumps can show up as a lung infection. Fever usually lasts 1 to 6 days but enlargement of the glands may go on for 10 days or longer. A few people may have little or no symptoms but can still spread the virus. When a person is exposed to mumps, it usually takes from 16 to 18 days for them to get sick, but it can range from 12 to 25 days. The virus is most contagious from 2 days before the swelling starts until 5 days after it goes away.\n\nWaning vaccine-derived immunity linked to mumps re-emergence: Study\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nGlobally, the World Health Organization has reported 585 315 cases of mumps in the present year through [13 Feb 2018], distributed as follows: Pacific West 57 percent (335 304), Africa 17 percent (100 576), East Mediterranean 13 percent (75 680), Southeast Asia 5 percent (31 739), Europe 4 percent (20 874) and the Americas 3 percent (21 142).

Chan School of Public Health shows the increase in mumps in college age students is likely because protection can decline years after receiving the vaccine. While it is expected that 50 percent of people will retain protection for 19 years after receiving a mumps-containing vaccine, many people will maintain protection far longer, so the population average is about 27 years,' according to J Lewnard, Research Associate, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Officials said winter break at the public charter school in Waianae would begin [Tue 19 Dec 2017] and continue through [16 Jan 2018]. The school said starting the winter break 2 days early and extending it by a week 'will allow us to get past the 25-day incubation period' for mumps.\n\nSo far in 2017, there have been 705 confirmed cases of mumps statewide, and 19 people have suffered from complications, the state Health Department reports. The large majority of those who have fallen ill have been on Oahu. 2017's outbreak is by far the largest number of cases Hawaii has seen in decades. In all of 2016, Hawaii saw just 10 total cases of mumps.\n\nTo tackle the growing outbreak of mumps, the state is recommending more people get vaccinated, even if they've already been vaccinated before. While mumps spreads easily, it's mostly preventable with a 2-dose vaccine. However, officials say mumps cases this year have been seen in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Hawaii has seen an influx of mumps cases since March 2017, when the Health Department was made aware of 9 people with the viral infection. Some people with mumps have very mild or no symptoms. The disease is not considered life-threatening, but there are some prominent manifestations, especially the swelling of one or both salivary glands.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Wai\u02bbanae is a census-designated place (CDP) in Honolulu County in the USA state of Hawaii.\n\nMy colleague Mod.LK has pointed out the lack of severe symptoms vaccinated individuals experience following infection with mumps in comments in the past that 'even though mumps cases occur even in fully vaccinated children and adults, the occurrence of the more severe complications is relatively rare now, evidence of some protection afforded by the vaccine.' Nonetheless, this is an important point to make frequently as it further supports the MMR vaccine's effectiveness even when full protection does not occur.\n\nOne paper among others that discusses the problem of genetic variation in the SH gene of mumps virus is Echevarr\u00eda JE, Castellanos A, Sanz JC, et al. Mumps Virus Genotyping: Basis and Known Circulating Genotypes. The Open Vaccine Journal, 2010, 3, 37-41 (available at: https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOVACJ/TOVACJ-3-37.pdf. Although the 12 genotypes of mumps virus currently recognized by the WHO are considered to be the same serotype, lack of full cross-protection between different genotypes has been reported and has been suggested as a cause of vaccine failure. However, other reports did not find this lack of cross reaction among different genotypes.\n\nJeryl-Lynn and Rubini vaccine strains belong to genotype A which is genetically distant from the other genotypes. Wild strains belonging to the A genotype used to be dominant before vaccination, but nowadays most MV wild strains belong to other genotypes. The genetic distance between genotype A vaccine strains and non-A wild strains has been proposed to be a determinant factor in vaccine failure. On the other hand, non-A vaccines have been more frequently associated with post vaccination meningitis and are considered less safe. Additional studies are needed to obtain a better balance between efficiency and safety in order to establish the best future strategy for achieving optimal vaccine efficacy. Data from neutralization experiments are still unclear. Another similar paper is Gouma S, Ten Hulscher HI, Schurink-van 't Klooster TM, et al. 2016. Mumps-specific cross-neutralization by MMR vaccine-induced antibodies predicts protection against mumps virus infection.

LK has pointed out the lack of severe symptoms vaccinated individuals experience following infection with mumps in comments in the past that 'even though mumps cases occur even in fully vaccinated children and adults, the occurrence of the more severe complications is relatively rare now, evidence of some protection afforded by the vaccine.' Mumps-specific cross-neutralization by MMR vaccine-induced antibodies predicts protection against mumps virus infection. Although the 12 genotypes of mumps virus currently recognized by the WHO are considered to be the same serotype, lack of full cross-protection between different genotypes has been reported and has been suggested as a cause of vaccine failure.

Lab results are currently pending for 3 additional students. The health department also is investigating several additional cases in the region that are apparently unrelated to JMU.\n\nMumps is an acute viral disease that is transmitted from person to person through direct contact with respiratory droplets spread by coughing and sneezing, or through contact with saliva from an ill person. Persons with mumps may have body aches, fever and swollen glands in the jaw. Most people recover from the illness in a week, but serious complications are possible.\n\nTo protect yourself from diseases like mumps that are spread through droplet contact, wash your hands frequently, cover your nose or mouth when you cough or sneeze and avoid droplet contact with people who are ill. Don't share cups or utensils and avoid close contact with people who are ill.\n\nThe health department is advising students and community members to review their immunization status and contact their health care provider to receive vaccine as needed. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) is usually given when a child is 1 year old and again between the ages of 4 and 6 years. The mumps vaccine is 88 per cent effective in people who receive 2 doses, but some fully immunized individuals may still develop mumps. A 3rd dose of MMR vaccine may be recommended for individuals at high risk for infection due to close contact with someone who has mumps.\n\nPeople exposed to mumps may not show symptoms for 12-25 days, but infected individuals are able to transmit the infection to others up to 2 days before symptoms appear. If you have mumps-like symptoms or questions about your mumps immunizations, contact your health care provider. The health department and JMU will provide additional updates as new information becomes available or recommendations arise.\n\nFor more information about mumps, see http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/epidemiology-fact-sheets/mumps.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nHarrisonburg, Rockingham county, Virginia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/9191\nVirginia county map: http://geology.com/county-map/virginia-county-map.gif]\n\n******\n[2] Delaware (Wilmington)\nDate: Wed 21 Mar 2018\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/delaware-mumps-outbreak-associated-wilmington-dance-97963/\n\n\nThe Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) reports as of [Tue 21 Mar] there are 3 known cases of mumps (1 confirmed and 2 probable cases) with a 4th case being investigated.

Researchers found vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps lasts about 27 years after the last dose. The findings suggest that, in addition to the currently recommended 2 doses of mumps vaccine in childhood, a 3rd dose at age 18 may help sustain protection among adults. The study [was] published 21 Mar 2018, in Science Translational Medicine [reference and press release cited below].\n\n'This analysis helps address a persistent question surrounding the recent mumps outbreaks, pointing to the key role played by waning vaccine induced immunity, and helps frame the research and policy questions on how best to control mumps,' said Yonatan Grad, assistant professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard Chan School, who co-authored the study with Joseph Lewnard, postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Chan School's Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics.\n\nAfter the mumps vaccine was introduced in the mid-1960s, mumps incidence in the US and other developed countries declined for decades. After recommendations for children to receive a second vaccine dose were issued in 1989, sustained reductions in mumps incidence led to optimism that vaccination could eliminate the disease from the US in the long term.\n\nBut recent mumps outbreaks, including on college campuses, began occurring among vaccinated young adults around 2006 and have continued to the present. The resurgence is troubling, the authors wrote, because mumps infections may cause complications such as testicular inflammation (which may result in infertility), meningitis, and deafness. Since cases have predominantly occurred in vaccinated populations, the mumps resurgence has prompted questions about what's to blame -- either waning immune protection from the mumps vaccine or new strains of the mumps that evade vaccine-driven protection.\n\nIn the new study, Harvard Chan School researchers pooled and analyzed data from six epidemiological studies of mumps vaccine effectiveness conducted over past decades in the US and Europe. The researchers estimated that 25 per cent of people in the US vaccinated against mumps may lose protection within 7.9 years, 50 per cent within 19 years, and 75 per cent within 38 years. Linking data from these studies to a mathematical model of mumps transmission, the researchers determined that waning immunity has played a central role not only in the recent re-emergence of mumps cases among young adults, but also in outbreaks that occurred in the late 1980s among adolescents who had received only one dose under earlier recommendations.\n\nIn contrast, the researchers found no evidence that new strains of mumps virus are contributing to changes in vaccine effectiveness. Moreover, their model suggested that new strains would not be expected to cause cases in age groups affected by recent outbreaks.\n\n'Vaccination is the centerpiece of current public health strategy against mumps,' said Lewnard. 'Knowing that protection wanes in the long term can help inform how we deploy vaccines to prevent or contain future outbreaks.'\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Lewnard JA, Grad YH.

Two of the remaining 4 individuals live with someone who attended one of the dances, and the source of the mumps virus exposure for the remaining 4 individuals is still under investigation.\n\nMumps is an acute viral infection spread through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, talking, sharing items such as cups or eating utensils with others, and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others.\n\nSymptoms typically start with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swollen salivary glands, which results in puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but can range from 12-25 days after infection. Some people with mumps may not have any symptoms. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks. However, mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults.\n\nPeople known or suspected to have mumps should stay away from school or work until 5 days after the onset of swollen salivary glands as there is no specific treatment for mumps.\n\nThe CDC recommends children get 2 doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years of age. Teens and adults who did not get the recommended MMR vaccines per the above schedule should be vaccinated so they are up to date.

'We are definitely concerned.' Dr Amanda Tiffany said [Wed 14 Feb 2018]. 'In the 5 years prior to 2017 when our outbreak began, Alaska saw 3 mumps cases, so the fact that we are now reporting 248 cases is concerning.'\n\nMost of those cases during those years were travel-related but now, according to Dr Tiffany, the virus is successfully spreading because people have either developed a waning immunity to vaccinations or aren't vaccinated.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the mumps component of the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine is about 88 percent effective. This means out of 100 people who are vaccinated, 12 people are still going to get mumps, and while mumps outbreaks aren't new in Alaska, Dr Tiffany believes people are vulnerable. 'Historically, when you have really high vaccination coverage, it's not such an issue to have a waning immunity and low vaccine effectiveness.' The epidemiologist added, 'but we do have people who are not being vaccinated, we are having many outbreaks, and people are being infected.'\n\nIt's important to note that the CDC says that Mumps outbreaks still happen even in highly vaccinated communities, however, 'high vaccination coverage helps to limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks.'\n\nFor now, Dr Amanda Tiffany is helping spread the word to combat a disease that can be avoided. 'There are people when I speak with them and tell them about the mumps outbreak, they just look at me with a blank face.' Dr Tiffany said. 'Oh really mumps, that's a thing?'\n\nThe state now recommends a 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine for Anchorage residents who want additional protection against mumps if it has been 5 years since the 2nd dose or if the resident believes they are vulnerable.\n\n[Byline: Juan Montes]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This nearly doubles the number of cases reported in ProMED Mumps update (37): USA, New Zealand 20171230.5528344 on 29 Dec 2017, that is, 119 cases of the disease, with another 19 classified as 'probable'. - Mod.LK\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nAlaska: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206]\n\n******\n[2] Alaska (Juneau)\nDate: Sun 18 Feb 2018\nSource: Juneau Empire [edited]\nhttp://juneauempire.com/local/news/2018-02-16/mumps-confirmed-juneau-first-time-20-years\n\n\nAs of Thu [15 Feb 2018], there has been one confirmed case of the disease in Juneau and 3 possible cases, said Alison Gaines, the nurse manager at the Juneau Public Health Center. The 1st case was diagnosed in January [2018], with the most recent suspected one springing up this past week, she said.\n\nAmanda Tiffany, an epidemiologist at the Alaska Division of Public Health, said this is the 1st confirmed case of mumps in Juneau since 1997.\n\nMumps is a contagious disease that causes swelling in a person's salivary glands. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. The disease is almost never fatal and long-term effects are relatively rare. Mumps can cause some hearing loss, Tiffany said, as well as inflammation of the brain, brain membrane, testicles, or ovaries.\n\nThe main problem for people who have mumps, Tiffany said, is the pain that comes with the salivary gland swelling.\n\n'I think the perception is that mumps is not such a big deal, like, 'Well, you have it and then it goes away,' but if you speak with anyone who had it, they were miserable,' Tiffany said.\n\nStarting in the summer of 2017, though, an outbreak began in Anchorage. There have been 247 [now 248 -- see [1] above] cases statewide (now 215 confirmed and 33 probable) since May of 2017, Tiffany said, with 96 percent of them being in Anchorage. The most recent large outbreak was in 1995, when there were 10 confirmed cases in Kodiak, Tiffany said.\n\nThe sole confirmed case in Juneau, Gaines said, was in a person who had recently traveled to Anchorage.\n\n'There's no way to know 100 percent,' Gaines said of whether the patient contracted mumps in Anchorage, 'but there is a link there.'\n\nThe common MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination prevents mumps, and Tiffany said more than 91 percent of Alaskans aged 13-17 are up to date on their MMR vaccination. Tiffany said if people don't know whether they're vaccinated, they should call their health care provider.\n\nThis past [Mon 12 Feb 2018], the Department of Public Health sent a notice to the Juneau School District and to licensed daycares in town alerting them to the recent outbreak. Early symptoms are similar to that of a regular cold, but those who believe they have mumps should call their doctor and set up an appointment, Tiffany said. Physicians will likely advise people to isolate themselves for the 5 days after facial swelling starts.\n\n'We're trying hard to track cases and stop the spread,' Gaines said, 'and the easiest way to do that is to know the cases we have in town.'\n\n[Byline: Alex McCarthy]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Vermont (Burlington)\nDate: Fri 16 Feb 2018 5:08 PM EST\nSource: NBC 5, WPTZ/WNNE US [edited]\nhttp://www.mynbc5.com/article/mumps-outbreak-reported-at-st-michaels-college-uvm/18212508\n\n\nThe Vermont Heath Department has announced an outbreak of mumps at 2 Burlington colleges.\n\nOfficials said several students at The University of Vermont [UVM] and St Michael's College have been diagnosed with mumps.\n\nThe number of cases remains small.\n\nThe Health Department said it conducted 2 vaccination clinics this week [week of 12 Feb 2018] for students. About 450 doses of the MMR vaccine were administered. Vaccination clinics are planned for next week for students who live in 3 UVM dorms.\n\nParents of children who attend daycare centers on the UVM campus have been notified about the outbreak.\n\nSo far, no cases of mumps have been identified there.\n\n'Mumps may be spread through close contact, but some people who get it have very mild or no symptoms. Often, they may not know they have the disease,' deputy state epidemiologist Laura Ann Nicolai said. 'In a college setting, with shared space of dorms and classrooms, it's possible to be exposed to the virus through encounters with people who don't realize they're infected.'\n\nMumps is a contagious illness caused by a virus that can be spread through close person-to-person contact, such as coughing, sneezing, or sharing drinking glasses. The virus causes fever, swelling of the parotid glands, and can affect other parts of the body. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but can occur up to 25 days later. They include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of appetite, and tenderness under the ears on one or both sides. There is no cure for mumps. Treatment involves bed rest, staying hydrated, and fever reduction.\n\nMost people who are ill with the virus recover completely in a few weeks.\n\n[Byline: Brad Evans]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[UVM requires proof of MMR vaccination, a 2-dose vaccine most commonly received before the age of 6, for enrolling undergraduate students, according to the UVM Center for Health and Wellbeing. - Mod.LK\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nBurlington, Vermont, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2472]\n\n******\n[4] Texas: prison outbreaks\nDate: Sun 18 Feb 2018 11:45\nSource: LMT online [edited]\nhttps://www.lmtonline.com/news/local/article/Possible-mumps-outbreak-shuts-part-of-two-Texas-12623799.php?utm_campaign=hptexas\n\n\nAnother possible mumps outbreak shut down visitation over the weekend [17-18 Feb 2018] for some parts of 2 Texas prisons.\n\nA stomach bug affected visiting at 3 other facilities, though Texas Department of Criminal Justice [TDCJ] spokesman Jason Clark said a 'relatively small number' of prisoners are affected.\n\nThe Beto Unit in Tennessee Colony [Anderson county] and the Segovia Unit in Edinburg [Hidalgo county] are both dealing with the possibility of mumps, while the McConnell [Bee county], Ellis [Walker county], and Terrell [Brazoria county] units are all grappling with gastrointestinal illnesses, Clark said.\n\nA number of mumps cases surfaced in early 2017 in Texas, and the disease made its way into the prison system around April, hitting Willacy County State Jail north of Brownsville and the nearby Lopez State Jail in Edinburg, according to TDCJ.\n\nAt one point last year [2017], roughly 10 inmates had confirmed cases, Clark said. But then the illness receded only to re-emerge in November at Willacy. Dozens of inmates went on medical lockdown there and also at Stringfellow Unit in Brazoria county after one symptomatic prisoner was transferred between the 2 units.\n\n'Mumps has been pretty prevalent down in South Texas,' Clark said at the time. 'And what you see in the community often makes its way into the prison system.'\n\nInmates with confirmed cases are put in isolation cells, while any inmates who may have been exposed are put on medical restriction.\n\nTDCJ offers vaccines for incoming inmates born after 1957, but the recent outbreaks come amid a nationwide uptick.\n\n'This is a vaccine-preventable disease,' said Dr Robert Atmar, professor and interim chief of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine, 'and the thought is ... that immunity is waning and a lot of the people who've been affected in these outbreaks have been persons who have had a number of years since they've had a mumps vaccine.'\n\n[Byline: Keri Blakinger]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nTexas: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245\nTexas county map: http://geology.com/county-map/texas-county-map.gif\n\n[From 1-27 Jan 2018, 25 states in the US reported mumps infections in 130 people to CDC. The case numbers have increased since 27 Jan 2018, as 248 cases have been reported in Alaska -- see [1] above.\n\nMumps outbreaks can occur any time of year. A major factor contributing to outbreaks is being in a crowded environment, such as attending the same class, playing on the same sports team, or living in a dormitory with a person who has mumps [such as in colleges, prisons]. Also, certain behaviors that result in exchanging saliva, such as kissing or sharing utensils, cups, lip balm, or cigarettes, might increase spread of the virus. In some years, there are more cases of mumps than usual because of outbreaks.\n\nMumps outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated US communities, particularly in close-contact settings. However, high vaccination coverage helps limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks. MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective at protecting against mumps; 1 dose is 78 percent (range: 49-92 percent) effective. Studies have shown that the MMR vaccine protects against currently circulating mumps strains.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, outbreaks ranged in size from a few to several hundred cases, have mostly affected young adults, and are likely due to a combination of factors. These factors include the known effectiveness of the vaccine, waning immunity following vaccination, and the intensity of exposure to the virus in close-contact settings (such as a college campus) coupled with behaviors that increase the risk of transmission.\n\n(Excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html See URL for a map showing distribution of mumps cases in the US and a figure with cases by year.) - Mod.LK]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nTexas: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245\nTexas county map: http://geology.com/county-map/texas-county-map.gif\n\n[From 1-27 Jan 2018, 25 states in the US reported mumps infections in 130 people to CDC.

Health officials estimate that there are about 5000 cases of reported mumps across the US this year.\n\nThe majority of those outbreaks are in Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Washington, and Texas.\n\nIn Florida, most infections were reported in Broward, Collier, Duval, Hillsborough, and Palm Beach counties, according to a Florida Department of Health.\n\nThe 2017 count includes confirmed and probable cases, according to Brad Dalton, a health department spokesman, the Miami Herald reports.\n\nThis is the largest mumps outbreak in Florida in the past decade, though infection rates have been steadily increasing the past couple of years.\n\nIn 2016 there were 16 cases and 2015 there were 10 reported cases, meaning 2017 showed a significant increase.\n\nHealth officials suspect that there are more cases that have gone unreported due to patients experiencing minor to no symptoms. Symptoms typically include swollen glands, puffy cheeks, headaches, fever, chills and fatigue and usually appear about two weeks after being infected.\n\nMumps spreads through contact with infected saliva or mucus, commonly from sharing drinks or eating from the same cutlery.\n\nOutbreaks in Florida have been reported among those in close settings such as roommates or sports teammates.\n\nTreatment for mumps focuses on relieving symptoms until the body's immune system fights off the infection.\n\nThere are currently no medications to treat the mumps virus and it typically takes two weeks to fully recover.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the best way to prevent contracting the infection is to receive the MMR vaccination which is effective 88 percent of the time.\n\n\n[Byline: Kayla Brantley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[From 1 Jan-2 Dec 2017, 48 states and the District of Columbia in the US reported mumps infections in 4980 people to CDC. Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to under-reporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 5833 cases in 2016. The recent increase has been mainly due to multiple mumps outbreaks reported across the country in settings where people often have close contact with one another, like college campuses (from https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html, includes a map showing case numbers by state and figure showing cases over time, from 2000-2017, as of 2 Dec 2017).\n\nAlso see ProMED-mail Mumps update (36): USA (HI) school 20171221.5518587 for discussion by Mod.LL on the problem of diminished cross-protection by the vaccine where there is genetic variation in the infecting virus, or infection with a viral genotype that differs from that of the vaccine; recent outbreaks have been caused by genotype G while the MMR vaccine is against virus strains of genotype A.\n- Mod.LK\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nFlorida, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24558\nFlorida county map: http://geology.com/county-map/florida-county-map.gif]\n\n******\n[2] Alaska (Anchorage)\nDate: Thu 28 Dec 2017 4:31 PM AKST\nSource: KTUU [edited]\nhttp://www.ktuu.com/content/news/Anchorage-mumps-outbreak-reaches-100-state-updates-vaccine-guidelines-467052963.html\n\n\nThe [Alaska] state health department says a mumps outbreak in Anchorage has surpassed 100 confirmed cases, and the department is updating its vaccination recommendations.\n\nThe state has confirmed 119 cases of the disease, with another 19 classified as 'probable.'

'For September, it looked like we had 62 cases in the north, which was down from 97 in August [2017],' said Dr Michael Isaac, chief medical officer for the Northern Health Region (NHR).\n\nIn June, 98 cases of mumps were reported in the region, with another 94 reported in July [2017]. Typically, between 0 and 5 cases are reported to NHR in a year....\n\nThe mumps virus has had a resurgence throughout Manitoba in the past year, with more than 1000 cases being reported in the province since January [2017]. Isaac said the outbreak began in Winnipeg last spring, gradually spreading to other communities from there. Cases have been found among all age groups. The illness is highly contagious and can be spread for as long as 3 weeks during the period of infection.\n\nSymptoms of the disease include headaches, muscle aches, fever and swollen glands around the neck, jaw and chin. Isaac also said the rate of complications arising from mumps cases has decreased during the outbreak, adding that few cases of severe side effects have been reported.\n\nDespite the high number of cases, the NHR reports that northern Manitoba has a higher than average rate of people vaccinated for mumps. Cases of mumps have been reported in people who have previously been vaccinated for the illness.\n\nIsaac said the mumps vaccine, like other immunizations, becomes less effective over time. 'There's no doubt that the length of time after you've had your vaccine can play a part in your immunity. It looks like, for example, people who were vaccinated 25, 30 years ago are likely less [immune] than people who were vaccinated last year,' he said.\n\nSmaller, tight-knit communities are more susceptible to highly contagious illnesses like mumps. 'Once you get a case or 2 in the community, because of that, the spread of the virus is greater,' said Isaac. 'I think the other thing that we have to take into account is, depending on the community, some communities have very high rates of overcrowding in housing stock. Where there's overcrowding - and it's not only mumps, it can be other things like tuberculosis and bacterial infections - there tends to be easier transmission in those environments. I think those 2 things, from a northern perspective, might explain some of the higher numbers we've been seeing.'\n\n[byline: Eric Westhaver]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A Healthmap/ProMED of Canada can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Alaska, Anchorage)\nDate: Tue 21 Nov 2017\nSource: Daily News-Miner [edited]\nhttp://bit.ly/2hSL46p\n\n\nCases of the mumps are on the rise in Anchorage, according to a health bulletin put out by the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. The state has identified 62 cases of confirmed, probable and suspected mumps, according to the bulletin. Most live in Anchorage or spent time there. It's the 1st outbreak in 5 years, according to the state health and social services website.\n\nMumps is a viral illness that typically starts with several days of fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of appetite and swollen salivary glands, the bulletin said. The best way to prevent mumps infection is through vaccination with a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, commonly known as the MMR. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is encouraging people in high-risk groups to get at least 3 doses of the MMR vaccine.\n\nGroups at the most risk for contracting mumps include people who participate in a group setting, such as a daycare, work or church, where mumps is circulating, or Anchorage residents who are Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n['As of [Wed 15 Nov 2017], 44 confirmed, 12 probable, and 6 suspect cases [updated numbers above] were identified (see figure at URL below). All 56 confirmed and probable cases were residents of or spent extensive time in Anchorage. Among the 44 confirmed patients, the median age was 24 years (range: 10-68), and 13 (29 per cent) were aged 18 years or over; 36 (82 per cent) self-identified as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (NH/PI), 3 (7 per cent) as white, one (2 per cent) as black, and 4 (9 per cent) were of unknown race; and 20 (45 per cent) were female. Two patients have been hospitalized; none have died. Of the 22 (50 per cent) confirmed patients whose vaccination status was known one had 4 doses of MMR, one had 3 doses, 17 had 2 doses, and 3 had one dose. Among patients with 2 or more doses of MMR, the median time from the most recent dose to illness onset was 12 years (range: 4-20 years).\n\n'Discussion\nTo date, this mumps outbreak has disproportionately impacted NH/PI people, who comprise 82 per cent of confirmed cases. For most patients, their infection was epidemiologically linked to a household or a congregate setting (such as work or church) where a case of mumps had been previously identified. While the original source of the outbreak is uncertain, several of the initial patients reported recent travel to or close contact with a person who had recently traveled to a Pacific island where mumps is circulating. Controlling a mumps outbreak requires high levels of herd immunity by vaccination. Because the vaccine is not 100 percent effective, however, many cases occur in fully-vaccinated patients during mumps outbreaks. In the current outbreak, 43 percent of patients had at least 2 doses of MMR. Moreover, waning immunity to the mumps component of the MMR vaccine contributes to mumps transmission. In this outbreak, a median of 12 years passed since receiving a 2nd dose among patients who had received 2 doses of MMR.\n\n'On [Wed 25 Oct 2017], ACIP recommended that persons previously vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR who are identified by public health as being at high-risk for mumps during an outbreak should receive a 3rd dose of MMR. Based on this ACIP recommendation and the pattern of disease in the Anchorage outbreak, a 3rd dose of MMR is advisable for certain people . These recommendations may be updated as the outbreak evolves.'\n\nSee http://www.epi.alaska.gov/bulletins/docs/b2017_28.pdf, State of Alaska Epidemiology Bulletin [excerpted and edited]. for figure, references and full report. - Mod.LK]\n\nA Healthmap/ProMED of the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106 and\nAlaska, United States at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206]\n\n******\n[3] USA (Texas, Willacy County)\nDate: Fri 17 Nov 2017 6:11 PM EST\nSource: KRGV [edited]\nhttp://www.krgv.com/story/36874240/mumps-outbreak-at-willacy-co-jail\n\n\nThere is another mumps outbreak at a Rio Grande Valley jail [in the southernmost tip of South Texas].

These symptoms lead many to believe that they have a 'common cold' until days later, their cheeks are puffy and salivary glands are swollen, indicating that they have mumps.\n\nMumps can be easily spread, especially at college institutions such as Syracuse University.\n\n'Any institution is susceptible of viruses even if students are vaccinated,' said Julie Murawski, director of the UC [Utica College] Student Health Center. 'Mumps are spread through close contact, such as coughing, sneezing, talking, kissing, and sharing items from others.'\n\nTo become immune to the mumps virus, the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination is offered and is mandatory for children to receive 2 doses prior to attending kindergarten. A 3rd dosage is not required, but is strongly considered during an outbreak. Syracuse University gave close contacts of those affected a 3rd dose to help them fight off the virus.\n\nWith the mumps outbreak happening an hour away from Utica, the UC community was concerned of something similar happening on its campus. Murawski, who has worked at UC since 1999, says there have been no cases of mumps, but UC has had bad cases of chickenpox and the flu in recent years.\n\n'It's very fortunate that there haven't been any mumps cases at UC, but we have had contagious diseases on campus,' Murawski said. 'We've dealt with international students with chicken pox before and every year we have a couple of students with the flu.'\n\nThe UC Student Health Center is currently advertising that students stop in to get their flu shot on the daysheet and with flyers on campus, which Murawski says helps motivate students to get vaccinated.\n\n'Flyers, email, and clinics have all helped raise awareness for making sure students get vaccinated,' Murawski said. 'We also have a receptionist at the front desk that asks students if they would like to receive a flu shot even if they are there for another visit. So far, we have vaccinated over 360 students and if we ever run out of vaccinations, we always order more.'\n\nBut even if students are vaccinated, they are not completely immune to the virus.\n\n'All vaccinations aren't 100 percent effective,' Murawski said. 'But, if a student gets sick after getting vaccinated, they experience less severe symptoms. We currently have 2 students with flu-like symptoms: 1 student was vaccinated and is experiencing minor symptoms while the other student wasn't vaccinated and is experiencing milder symptoms and is much sicker than the vaccinated student.'\n\nIn recent years, there has also been controversy on whether people should be vaccinated or not. UC nursing students shared their thoughts regarding how important it is to be vaccinated.\n\n'I believe all individuals should get vaccinated,' senior Michael Wells said. 'I do understand that individuals think that vaccines have a direct correlation to developmental disorders such as autism, however there has been extensive research into the connection between vaccinations and autism, none of which have provided substantial evidence backing that claim. Research has concluded that vaccines are safe to be administered to children.'\n\nBut, Wells also says that there's nothing that administrators and staff can do to make sure everyone gets vaccinated as it's the individual's choice.\n\n'Individuals are given a right to determine if they want to get vaccinated or not,' Wells said. 'Institutions like UC, however, can give the appropriate education on vaccinations in hopes to avoid an epidemic like the one that is occurring at SU. There is also a debate on whether or not parents should have the right to refuse vaccinations on their children, but that is a completely different debate.'\n\nUC currently has a student health portal where students can upload and share their immunization records with UC Admissions prior to coming to college, which the UC Student Health Center can access as well.\n\nSenior Emra Klempic said the UC health portal is very important and helps students in making sure they are up to date on their vaccinations.\n\n'Vaccinations are very safe and effective at preventing illnesses, such as the mumps and the flu, so everyone should get vaccinated and stay up to date,' Klempic said. 'If a student is missing a vaccination, they will notice that on the UC health portal and it's important that they receive the necessary vaccination as soon as possible, so that it doesn't end up becoming a public issue.'\n\n[Byline: Morgan Golliver]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of New York State can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1926. - Mod.LK\n\n******\n[2] District of Columbia (American University), New York (Syracuse University)\nDate: Sun 12 Nov 2017\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/american-university-reports-additional-mumps-cases-syracuse-outbreak-update-66567/\n\n\nAmerican University [Washington DC] officials say they have been notified of an additional case of mumps by the DC Health Department (DC DOH), bringing the total to 7.\n\nThe new suspected case is a student who resides in Leonard Hall and has been isolated.\n\nOf the 7 mumps cases reported, 2 cases now have laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis (5 are classified as probable diagnoses).

We recommend that people take precautions and avoid kissing, sharing drinks or eating utensils. As with many infectious illnesses, frequent hand washing is also an important way to protect yourself because the virus may also be spread indirectly when a person touches items or surfaces without washing their hands and then someone else touches the same surface and rubs their mouth or nose.

But, as the number of mumps infections spike nationwide, SU is one of the latest in a growing number of universities forced to handle the highly contagious disease on campus.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4980 people contracted the mumps nationwide between [Sun 1 Jan and Sat 4 Nov 2017]. In 2016, more than 6000 cases of the disease were reported, up from about 1500 cases in 2015. There were less than 500 cases of mumps nationwide in 2012.\n\nMumps cases reported to the CDC in 2016 and 2017 have primarily been 'associated with college settings,' according to the agency.\n\nBrittany Kmush, an assistant professor in the David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics who studies infectious diseases, said mumps can spread quickly on a college campus because students are interacting in close quarters, such as living together in dorms and coming in contact with each other in classrooms.\n\nBut scientists are not sure why the disease has been contracted in such high numbers in recent years.\n\n'Our evidence is limited to fully explain what has happened in the last couple of years,' said Kelly Moore, director of the Tennessee Immunization Program at the Tennessee Department of Health. 'If the answer were easy, we would have it by now.'\n\nMoore said researchers believe the mumps vaccine's effectiveness may wane as people get older. That may be one of the reasons why the disease has made a comeback in recent years, she added.\n\nTo attend college in New York state, students are required to receive 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Most are vaccinated when they are children.\n\nSince the end of October [2017], SU has hosted 7 clinics so students could receive a 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine. Every SU student who has contracted the mumps has been properly vaccinated, though, according to the health services website.\n\nAlthough a CDC advisory board in October [2017] unanimously recommended that people exposed to a mumps outbreak should receive a 3rd vaccine, federal officials also said there was limited scientific evidence showing whether the 3rd dose protected individuals against mumps-related complications, The Washington Post reported.\n\nBut is a 3rd vaccine effective? 'The simple answer is yes,' said Patricia Quinlisk, medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health. But, she added, 'It's obviously more complex than that.' Quinlisk said the effectiveness of the 3rd MMR vaccine depends on the timing of mumps cases, who the cases are occurring in and whether cases are linked. A 3rd vaccine is effective, Quinlisk said, if there are multiple mumps cases in a single dorm during a short period of time. If there are isolated cases over a longer period of time, a 3rd vaccine isn't necessary, she added.\n\nThe Onondaga County Health Department only recommended a 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine after it was determined that:\n\nThere was high vaccination coverage at SU. Exposure settings, such as schools, colleges and dorms, were likely to cause easy transmission of the disease. There was a high attack rate and transmission of the mumps for at least 2 weeks.\n\nBrad Hutton, deputy commissioner of public health at the New York State Department of Health, said at a press conference in October [2017] that the 3rd vaccine will not stop the mumps from infecting those who have already been exposed to the disease.\n\nStill, roughly 30 percent of SU students received a 3rd MMR vaccine through the university's clinics, said Karen Nardella, medical director of Health Services.\n\nSU's response to the mumps outbreak\nBen Domingo, director of SU Health Services, said the university has handled the mumps before. 'We actually had a few close calls,' Domingo said. 'Last fall we had a case, and then we had a few cases in January [2017].'\n\nNone of the previous cases were considered an outbreak, he said. But, he added, those cases helped the university plan how it would confront a larger mumps outbreak.\n\nNardella said SU officials also looked at how the State University of New York New Paltz and University of Missouri handled mumps outbreaks.\n\nSU's response to the outbreak has included isolating students with confirmed or probable mumps cases from the rest of the campus community for up to 5 days.\n\n'The minute we were getting cases we were already familiar with the fact that, this fall, isolation was necessary,' Domingo said.\n\nStudents have been housed in South Campus apartments and the Sheraton Syracuse University Hotel and Conference Center.

She says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports over 4900 cases of mumps this year. Up to 47 states and the District of Colombia have all reported cases of mumps, according to Dr. Tiffany.\n\nTo put the outbreak in perspective, the DHSS says it saw less than 5 confirmed cases of mumps between 2012 and 2017. And all of those were travel related, meaning the infection was contracted outside Alaska and then brought into the state.\n\nThe DHSS can't be sure where this latest mumps outbreak started but nearby states have also reported significant mumps cases this year [2017]. Hawaii has reported more than 500 cases and Washington State has reported over 300 cases.\n\nThe current recommendation from the Department of Health and Social Services is to stay up-to-date with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination (MMR). 'For Anchorage residents who self-identify as native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, we recommend a 2nd dose of MMR,' Dr. Tiffany said. She says a 3rd dose is recommended for people who have had a 2nd dose within the past 5 years.\nDr. Tiffany explains the vast majority of reported cases have been seen in the Pacific Islander and native Hawaiian communities because the infection is spread through close contact.\n\nThe DHHS has some recommendations if a person suspects they may be infected with mumps:\n\n- Go to a healthcare provider. Dr. Tiffany says due to the similarity of its symptoms, mumps can often appear as other illnesses .\n\n- The MMR vaccine should be covered by health insurance or Medicaid.\n\n- If you experience facial swelling or a cough, tell family and friends because mumps has a long incubation period.\n\n- It's especially hard during the holidays but the state says it's essential to self-isolate for 5 days after symptoms start.\n\n[Byline: Sean Maguire]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See Mumps update (34): Canada, USA (AK,TX) 20171125.5464364 for discussion of why Pacific Islander and native Hawaiian communities are at greater risk.\n\nChildren should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine: 1st dose: 12-15 months of age; 2nd dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 28 days after the 1st dose)\n\nSome infants younger than 12 months should get a dose of MMR if they are traveling out of the country.

It is caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_. Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe. After cough fits, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breaths, which result in a 'whooping' sound. Pertussis can affect people of all ages, but can be very serious, even deadly, for babies less than a year old.\n\nThe best way to prevent pertussis (whooping cough) is to get the vaccine.

Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus spread through saliva and mucus.\n\nIndependent of this outbreak, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices -- a panel of medical and public health experts who meet 3 times a year to offer vaccination guidance for the United States -- will vote [Wed 25 Oct 2017; see report below] on whether to recommend the use of a 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine during outbreaks. Committee recommendations are reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOther outbreaks in recent years, most notably one involving NHL [National Hockey League] players in 2014, have prompted the CDC to debate whether a 3rd dose of the vaccine should be recommended in such situations. A 3rd dose may prevent additional cases by further protecting those exposed to the virus.\n\nAbsent this official CDC recommendation, a 3rd dose is given during outbreaks on a case-by-case basis, such as the current one at Syracuse.\n\nThe health department of Onondaga county, where Syracuse University is located, reported 6 additional probable cases among non-campus members as of [Tue 24 Oct 2017].\n\nConfirmed cases have been verified by laboratory testing, while probable cases only include likely though unconfirmed symptoms.\n\nMumps typically begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite lasting a few days. Most people will then see salivary glands swell, causing puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw.\n\n3rd dose recommendation\n-----------------------\nThe MMR vaccine is 88 percent effective when 2 doses have been given. In people who receive just one shot, the vaccine is less effective.\n\nMost recent outbreaks have occurred among vaccinated people, according to Dr Manisha Patel, a medical officer at the CDC.\n\nIn weighing a possible recommendation on [Wed 25 Oct 2017], the CDC advisory committee will review data from recent outbreaks, including the number of vaccinated people who became infected. In its deliberations, the panel will assess the impact of a 3rd dose in decreasing the size and duration of outbreaks.\n\nThe CDC currently recommends that children get their 1st dose when they are 12-15 months old and a 2nd dose at 4-6 years.\n\nOutbreaks of mumps tend to occur in areas where there is crowding and close contact, according to Patel. Campuses are a typical site for outbreaks because of the sharing of saliva: by coughing, sneezing, kissing, and sharing utensils, lipstick, or cigarettes.\n\nPossible complications\n----------------------\nThe incubation period for mumps ranges from 12-25 days; symptoms last at least 2 and usually more than 10 days. Mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults. These include deafness and inflammation of the brain, ovaries, breast tissue, or testicles.\n\nSince it is caused by a virus, mumps will not respond to antibiotics. Doctors generally recommend bed rest and over-the-counter pain relievers. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks, according to the CDC.\n\nBefore the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, the CDC received reports of 186 000 cases each year. The actual number of cases was probably much higher but not always reported since most doctors considered the mumps a typical childhood disease. Since the development of the vaccine, cases have decreased by more than 99 percent in the United States.\n\nEach year, the number of mumps cases fluctuates within a range of a couple hundred to a couple thousand, according to Patel.\n\nIn 2016, the United States experienced the highest number of mumps cases in a decade: more than 6000, according to CDC preliminary reports.\n\nThe number of cases is high this year, too. As of 7 Oct 2017, the CDC has received reports of 4667 total mumps infections in 47 states and the District of Columbia for the year.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See ProMED-mail Mumps update (30): USA, New Zealand 20171022.5396070 for discussion of the impact of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine as presented in N Engl J Med 2017; 377: 947-956 by CV Cardemil et al (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1703309), as well as item [2] below.\n\nThe state of New York can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1060.

Experts hope the recommendation will help address a problem that has bedeviled public health authorities recently.\n\nAfter years of very low numbers of mumps cases -- fewer than 1000 cases nationally a year -- the disease has made a resurgence of sorts in the past decade or so. There were nearly 7000 cases nationally in 2006 and more than 6000 last year [2016]. As of early October [2017], there have been 4667 cases in 47 states and the District of Columbia so far in 2017. It's long been known that the mumps vaccine is less effective than those that protect against measles and rubella. Still, 2 doses of mumps vaccine -- the 1st given at between 12 and 15 months of age and the 2nd sometime between the ages of 4 and 6 years of age -- is thought to protect about 88 percent of people vaccinated.\n\nHowever, as mumps outbreaks have increased, public health officials have noticed that children and young adults -- especially the latter -- who received both recommended doses of vaccine were among those contracting the disease. In some cases, including in a large outbreak of mumps in northern Arkansas [USA] earlier this year [2017], authorities have resorted to giving additional doses of the vaccine. But the evidence proving additional doses overcomes the problem of waning protection has been lacking.\n\nLast month [September 2107] the New England Journal of Medicine published a study [see reference in item [1] above] that delved into the issue. It was based on data from a 2015-2016 mumps outbreak at the University of Iowa.\n\nThe researchers found that the longer it had been since a person received a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine, the more likely it was that he or she would contract the mumps. Students who had received their 2nd shot 13 years or more before the outbreak were 9 times more likely than more recently vaccinated students to be infected.\n\nGiven the recommended timing of MMR vaccination, teenagers and people in their early 20s could be vulnerable to contract mumps at a time when their lifestyles put them at higher risk, if they come in contact with the virus.\n\nOn [Wed 25 Oct 2016], a veteran vaccine expert -- Dr Stanley Plotkin, who is not a member of ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] -- suggested the committee should recommend a 3rd dose of mumps vaccine for all students entering university. But the idea was dismissed.\n\n'We did discuss this question. But ... we did not feel that we had any evidence to support a decision about a routine [3rd] dose outside of an actual exposure situation where there was an immediate need for that vaccine,' said Dr Kelly Moore, an ACIP member who chairs a work group that advises the panel on mumps vaccine. Moore is director of Tennessee's immunization program.\n\nThe mumps virus spreads in saliva; so activities like kissing, sharing drinks, and sharing cigarettes fuel its spread. Mumps outbreaks have been common on university campuses, but they have also occurred among athletes who play team sports. Several National Hockey League teams, for instance, have seen mumps spread along their benches.\n\nThe mumps virus causes symptoms that are common to lots of illnesses -- fever, headache, muscle aches. But the virus also infects salivary glands, leading to pronounced swelling on one or both sides of the face. It can also cause a painful condition known as orchitis -- swelling of the testicles -- in males who contract the virus after puberty.\n\nMost cases are mild, but there are serious complications in rare cases, including encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), deafness, and infertility. Severe cases are less common among people who have been vaccinated but still contract mumps.\n\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps elimination in the United States has never been documented. The Healthy People 2020 mumps goal is to reduce the number of US-acquired cases, rather than elimination The 3rd dose may help attain this new goal.\n\nAlso see, 'Third MMR dose shows promise in curbing mumps outbreaks' http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/09/third-mmr-dose-shows-promise-curbing-mumps-outbreaks for a report on the impact of the 3rd dose of MMR on University of Iowa students during a mumps outbreak. 'The attack rate was lower in students who received 3 doses than in their peers who had gotten only 2-6.7 versus 14.5 cases per 1000 population. The researchers calculated that the vaccine was associated with a 60 percent to 78 percent reduction in mumps risk. ...\n\nThe improvement noted in vaccine effectiveness between the 2- and 3-dose groups at 7 days after vaccination suggests that the benefit occurs shortly after vaccination, which is likely due to a booster response. ... They said other factors, such as a coordinated public health response, implementation of a standard case definition, rapid testing, isolation, and enhanced awareness, also probably played a role in the decline of the outbreak, which occurred rapidly. ...\n\nThe authors concluded that longer-term benefits of routine 3-dose MMR administration requires further study, but for now, a 3rd-dose may be useful for outbreak control. And the drop-off seen in immunity may be useful in helping health officials decide if a 3rd dose would be helpful in stemming outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations.' - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] Hawaii\nDate: Wed 25 Oct 2017\nSource: Pharmacist [edited]\nhttp://www.pharmacist.com/article/500-sickened-hawaii-mumps-outbreak\n\n\nHealth officials in Hawaii have reported a significant increase in mumps cases in the state's ongoing mumps outbreak.

It is important for people to know, even though they may not be hearing as much about it, that it is still ongoing,' Dr Elise Weiss, acting chief provincial public health officer, said [Tue 24 Oct 2017].\n\n(With schools back in session and students in close quarters, 'the goal of sending this letter out (is) there are measures people can take to help protect themselves.'\n\nAs of last [Thu 19 Oct 2017], there had been 1150 confirmed cases of the contagious viral infection since the beginning of the outbreak [1 Sep 2016], Manitoba Health says. The province normally experiences fewer than 10 cases a year.\n\nThe mumps occur mostly in children, commonly involving fever, headache, swollen salivary glands and cheeks, and difficulty chewing, swallowing, or talking. Symptoms appear 12-25 days after exposure to the virus through direct contact with the saliva of an infected person, and usually last for a week or more.\n\nThere is no treatment; prevention (especially via immunization) is the most important form of protection and management, Manitoba Health says in its bulletin, which is to be distributed to all school divisions, post-secondary institutions, and registered daycares.\n\nWinnipeg School Division [WSD] senior information officer Radean Carter said Tue afternoon [24 Oct 2017] she had yet to see the Manitoba Health reminder, but once it is logged, it will be passed on to all principals and vice-principals 'and they will share the information with parents.'\n\nEach WSD school will disseminate the information as it best sees fit, she said, with most making contact with parents and guardians via email lists, while some will also print the document to be sent home with students.\n\nWSD is the largest in the city with more than 33 000 students attending 78 facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, a year into the outbreak, the number of cases continues its slow climb, rising from 853 confirmed in the province as of [31 Aug 2017].\n\n'In many outbreaks, you will have your general, bell-shaped curve: you'll start slow, peak and then wane out.

When goes above that average, we start looking at it in terms of: is it meeting other criteria for an outbreak?' she said.\n\n'It would be the same thing for calling an end.

The same criteria would be used to say it's over: it goes back down to baseline levels.'\n\nWhile the information contained in the mumps bulletin is important, Weiss said -- stressing the need for good hand hygiene and to stay home when sick -- it is not uncommon for Manitoba Health to issue such public reminders, pointing out the department's annual flu season push and a notice for a German measles outbreak in the 1990s.\n\n[Byline: Scott Emmerson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Canada can be seen at http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/Canada_Provinces_and_territories_map.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/261. - Mod.LK]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See ProMED-mail Mumps update (30): USA, New Zealand 20171022.5396070 for discussion of the impact of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine as presented in N Engl J Med 2017; 377: 947-956 by CV Cardemil et al (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1703309), as well as item [2] below.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices unanimously voted to approve a 3rd dose of mumps-containing vaccine as a tool for outbreak control, despite acknowledging evidence to support the practice is limited. In this update:\nUSA\n---\n \n\nThe CDC currently recommends that children get their 1st dose when they are 12-15 months old and a 2nd dose at 4-6 years. \n\nConfirmed cases have been verified by laboratory testing, while probable cases only include likely though unconfirmed symptoms. \n\nOutbreaks of mumps tend to occur in areas where there is crowding and close contact, according to Patel. \n\nAbsent this official CDC recommendation, a 3rd dose is given during outbreaks on a case-by-case basis, such as the current one at Syracuse. \n\nWinnipeg School Division [WSD] senior information officer Radean Carter said Tue afternoon [24 Oct 2017] she had yet to see the Manitoba Health reminder, but once it is logged, it will be passed on to all principals and vice-principals 'and they will share the information with parents.' In documents dated [19 Oct 2017], and making their way to the public this week, Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living asks parents and guardians of young children and post-secondary students and faculty to be aware of the symptoms of mumps, what to do if they suspect an infection and how to help prevent one. \n\n--\n [Byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\n \n\n--\n \n\nMumps typically begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite lasting a few days. \n\n'We see (mumps) in certain numbers every year in Manitoba and across Canada, so we have an average. According to the Hawaii Department of Health, 500 cases of mumps have now been recorded, a 216-case increase since [24 Aug 2017]. [2] MMR vaccine: 3rd dose\n [2] MMR vaccine: 3rd dose\n As of [Mon 23 Oct 2017], there have been 27 confirmed and 48 probable cases of mumps on campus, according to Syracuse University Health Services. \n\nSince it is caused by a virus, mumps will not respond to antibiotics. The researchers found that the longer it had been since a person received a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine, the more likely it was that he or she would contract the mumps. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps elimination in the United States has never been documented.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "measles", "mumps", "rubella"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2107-09-25 00:00:00", "1150-03-25 00:00:00", "2016-09-01 00:00:00", "2014-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2021-03-31 00:00:00", "2017-03-25 00:00:00", "2006-03-25 00:00:00", "2016-03-25 00:00:00", "2020-03-25 00:00:00", "1967-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "the District of Columbia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Manitoba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Honolulu", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "CANADA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Onondaga County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Arkansas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hawaii", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tennessee", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Onondaga county", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5340444", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps update (27): Pacific (New Zealand), USA (HI, AK)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5340444", "date": "2017-09-25 23:20:01", "main_text": "MUMPS UPDATE (27): PACIFIC (NEW ZEALAND), USA (HAWAI'I, ALASKA)\n***************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\nPacific\n------\n[1] New Zealand (North Island, Tauranga)\n[2] New Zealand (Auckland)\nUSA\n---\n[3] Hawai'i\n[4] Alaska (Anchorage)\n\n******\n[1] New Zealand (North Island, Tauranga)\nDate: Tue 19 Sep 2017\nSource: Bay Of Plenty Times [edited]\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503343&objectid=11923656\n\n\nHealth authorities say 3 people have been diagnosed with mumps in Tauranga this month [September 2017]. However, there were concerns more people might unwittingly be carrying and passing on the virus.\n\nToi Te Ora Public Health Organisation chief medical officer Neil de Wet said mumps could have serious health complications including swelling of the brain, loss of hearing, and potential infertility in young men, but these were rare.\n\nDr de Wet said there had been an increase in mumps cases in New Zealand in the past year, but most of these were in Auckland [see next post]. Up until last week, there had been 3 confirmed cases in the Bay of Plenty District Health Board area.\n\n'In the past, our immunisation rates have been very low, so people who are now in those 2 age groups -- 10-19 and 20-29 -- historically had low immunisation rates. It's not surprising that we are seeing most cases in these age groups.'\n\nThe Auckland Regional Public Health Service had been notified of 300 cases of mumps from 1 Jan-4 Sep this year [2017].\n\nDr de Wet said because of the high mumps numbers nationally, it was hard to establish Auckland links to the local cases.\n\n'We do have mumps in our community, and people can be asymptomatic, especially younger children. They might not be symptomatic, so not every case will be diagnosed,' Dr de Wet.\n\nMumps symptoms include headaches, a general feeling of unwellness and swelling of the jaw area.\n\n'For most people, this is an unpleasant illness that will get better on its own after about a week.'\n\nMumps can be spread from person to person throughout the air by coughing and sneezing. The MMR vaccine, which is part of routine childhood vaccines, prevents mumps as well as measles and rubella.\n\nAnyone who feels they might be sick or at risk is encouraged to phone their family doctor to arrange an appointment at a time unlikely to infect anyone else, Dr de Wet said.\n\nThe last mumps epidemic in New Zealand was in 1994, with 188 hospitalisations. 20-30 cases of mumps were still notified each year; about half are in children under 10 years of age.\n\nAuckland medical officer of health Dr Josephine Herman said mumps was now at large in the local community, 'and the only way we can stop this spreading further is to achieve high levels of MMR vaccination in the population.'\n\n[Byline: Kiri Gillespie]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail of New Zealand can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164.]\n\n******\n[2] New Zealand (Auckland)\nDate: Mon 25 Sep 2017\nSource: Stuff [edited]\nhttps://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/97197173/the-mumps-outbreak-continues-to-spread-at-a-rapid-rate-through-the-auckland-region\n\n\nThe mumps outbreak continues to spread at a rapid rate through the Auckland region, a sign of low vaccination rates, as the city deals with the most serious outbreak in more than 20 years.\n\nMore than 440 cases have been reported in the region so far this year [2017], with about 5 per cent of those cases needing hospitalisation.\n\nHealth authorities say the outbreak began in West Auckland and has now spread to south Auckland and across the region.\n\nThe last similar outbreak of mumps was in 1994 when there were between 200-300 cases reported. Since then, only handfuls of cases were reported each year, many from overseas.\n\nAuckland Regional Public Health Service [ARPHS] medical officer of health Josephine Herman said she had seen mumps-related meningitis and testes inflammation.\n\nThe most common complication of the current outbreak had been orchitis, which is inflammation of the testicles.\n\nThe disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries, and permanent deafness. It can also lead to infertility.\n\nThe primary sign of mumps is swollen salivary glands that cause the cheeks to puff out; the term 'mumps' is an old expression for lumps or bumps within the cheeks.\n\nOther symptoms include headache, muscle aches and pain while chewing or swallowing.\n\nARPHS is warning that a large number of 10-29 year olds are not only at risk of mumps but also of measles and rubella due to some parents rejecting the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine.\n\nThe service said the 'lost generation' of unprotected young people was partly due to the MMR controversy in the late 1990s, something which has been thoroughly discredited.\n\nEveryone needed to urgently check that they had had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine and to get immunised if they needed to, Herman said.\n\n[Byline: Shabnam Dastgheib]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Hawai'i\nDate: Fri 22 Sep 2017\nSource: The Garden Island [edited]\nhttp://thegardenisland.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/largest-outbreak-in-years/article_35c8ed0e-4b4a-54be-8c8f-fb0a77855a12.html\n\n\nIt's been 40 years since the number of mumps cases has reached current levels in Hawaii, according to the state epidemiologist, Sarah Park.\n\nThe Department of Health reported on Thu [21 Sep 2017] 384 confirmed cases of mumps for 2017, with 32 confirmed cases on Kauai, 334 on Oahu, 17 on Hawaii Island and one on Maui.\n\nThe disease has been confirmed in adults and children, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, according to DOH.\n\nPark said she hasn't seen those kinds of numbers since the 1970s. It's not specifically associated with schools, and it's throughout the islands.\n\n'This is a community and statewide outbreak,' said DOH spokeswoman Janice Okubo. 'Any cases in schools are only an indication of disease activity associated with that particular community.'\n\nIn the past 9 years, Wilcox Medical Center has seen only 4 mumps cases, according to Faith Campbell, marketing manager for Wilcox Health. That's compared to the 30 confirmed on the island in just 2017.\n\n'We have definitely seen an increase this year [2017] in patients with mumps-related symptoms,' she said.\n\nThe most common symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, loss of appetite, tiredness, and swollen glands in front of the ears or jaw on one or both sides. Mumps is best known for the puffy checks and swollen jaw that it causes, which is the result of these swollen glands, according to Wilcox Health.\n\nSome people who get mumps can have very mild or no symptoms, while others may feel sick but will not have swollen glands.\n\n'That is why it is important to consult your health care provider if you are experiencing any of these symptoms and stay at home to avoid spreading the disease to others,' Campbell said.\n\nMumps prevention comes in the form of a vaccine given in 2 doses. The 1st is generally administered at 12-15 months, and the 2nd is administered at 4-6 years old. DOH urges those who have had only one dose of the MMR vaccine to make an appointment to get the booster.\n\n[Byline: Jessica Else]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the US state of Hawai'i can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/214.]\n\n******\n[4] Alaska (Anchorage)\nDate: Sat 23 Sep 2017\nSource: Alaska Dispatch News [edited]\nhttps://www.adn.com/alaska-news/health/2017/09/22/13-confirmed-mumps-cases-in-anchorage-outbreak/\n\n\n'We're currently experiencing a mumps outbreak in Anchorage, and right now, we have 13 confirmed cases,' said Joe McLaughlin, state epidemiologist and chief of the section of epidemiology with the Department of Health and Social Services.\n\nIt's the 1st outbreak in Alaska in decades.

About 60 percent have been among Anchorage's Pacific Islander population. And roughly half of the cases were in people who had received mumps vaccinations.\n\n'It's really important to note that if people were not vaccinated, our case counts would be much, much higher than they are,' McLaughlin said.\n\nMumps vaccinations, which come in 2 doses, are 88 percent effective in preventing the illness.\n\n[Byline: Laurel Andrews]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Because of the notable increase in mumps outbreaks globally, the panel of experts on vaccinations, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, has set up a working group to investigate the use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine in response to outbreaks and will recommend to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changes to mumps vaccination policy if the decision is made that this is scientifically justified.\n\nSuggested reading.

The effect of a 3rd dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in stemming a mumps outbreak is unknown. During an outbreak among vaccinated students at the University of Iowa, health officials implemented a widespread MMR vaccine campaign. We evaluated the effectiveness of a 3rd dose for outbreak control and assessed for waning immunity.\n\nConclusions. Students who had received a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine had a lower risk of mumps than did those who had received 2 doses, after adjustment for the number of years since the 2nd dose. Students who had received a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine 13 years or more before the outbreak had an increased risk of mumps. These findings suggest that the campaign to administer a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine improved mumps outbreak control and that waning immunity probably contributed to propagation of the outbreak. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the US state of Alaska can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206.]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Because of the notable increase in mumps outbreaks globally, the panel of experts on vaccinations, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, has set up a working group to investigate the use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine in response to outbreaks and will recommend to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changes to mumps vaccination policy if the decision is made that this is scientifically justified.

But most of the campus community didn't know about the potential health scare until 21 Sep [2017], when SU confirmed a 2nd mumps case and sent out a campus-wide email.\n\nIn a contained environment like SU, members of the campus community deserve to know when their health is at risk. Clear and timely information is SU's only chance at shutting down rumors about outbreaks before they start.\n\nOnly those who may have been exposed to the 1st mumps case received a warning email on 5 Sep [2017]. There was a 2-week gap between the 1st and 2nd emails -- plenty of time for mumps rumors to grow without official word from the administration.\n\nEven since SU sent out its 21 Sep [2017] email, rumors of class cancellations and student quarantine locations have circulated campus. An official email right away could have addressed potential rumors regarding the outbreak to avoid confusion and misinformation.\n\nIt's natural for a campus-wide email about a contagious disease to wreak some havoc on the community. But despite there being 13 confirmed mumps cases at SU, students don't seem too worried.\n\nThat's not to say SU students shouldn't take the threat of this disease seriously.

A total of 98 cases of the highly contagious viral disease were reported across the Northern Health Region (NHR) in June 2017, with another 94 in July 2017.\n\n'In a typical year, we'd see 0, maybe 3, 4, 5 cases. This is extremely high for us in the North,' said NHR medical health officer Dr. Michael Isaac.\n\nWhile numbers have yet to be finalized for August 2017, more than 60 cases had already been reported as of mid last week.\n\nAdditional cases were possible given the lag time between exposure to mumps and the presence of symptoms.\n\nIsaac confirmed cases of mumps have been reported in Flin Flon in the past 3 months, but the number is lower than in other northern locations.\n\n'In general, the number of cases that we've had in Flin Flon has been relatively lower than we've seen in some other parts in the region,' he said. 'That's not to say that the virus might not work its way into the community, given a bit more time.\n\n'We've seen it in small communities, in First Nations communities, and in some of our larger communities as well. I would say for the most part, there hasn't been a community where we haven't seen at least a case or 2.'\n\nMumps has been reported in all age groups.\n\nThe disease is characterized by fever, headaches, muscle pains and glandular swelling in the neck, chin and jaw. In serious cases, mumps can cause brain infections, meningitis, genital inflammation and swelling, and deafness.\n\nIsaac confirmed none of the cases reported in the NHR have involved the more severe symptoms. 'We're not seeing some of the significant and real consequences of the mumps,' he said. 'We just haven't seen much of that in Manitoba.'\n\nMumps can lay dormant in a person for up to 3 weeks before symptoms present themselves. Most people receive a vaccination against the disease as children.\n\nIsaac said a higher-than-average number of people in northern Manitoba are vaccinated, which reduces both the number of potential infections and the severity of symptoms.\n\n'Our vaccination rates are actually a little bit higher than the rest of the province, which is contributing to the less severe cases we're seeing,' he said.\n\nIsaac said it's very difficult to say what is behind the northern outbreak. One possible reason is that mumps can spread more easily when people live in overcrowded housing and in smaller, tight-knit communities.\n\n'It's just a lot easier for the virus to spread in those places,' Isaac said. 'People are out and about in the community, and your chances of being exposed to the virus on any given day may be higher than if you were living in Winnipeg.'\n\nAvoiding the mumps is as simple as receiving a vaccination. Isaac advises people to check their vaccination status and receive boosters if needed.\n\n'If you haven't had a mumps vaccine in the past, we're encouraging people to go ahead and do that,' he said. 'That will offer some protection for sure.'\n\nPeople who suspect they have the mumps are advised to call ahead to a clinic or ER and book an appointment in advance.\n\n'That helps from spreading the disease around unnecessarily when going through care,' Isaac said.\n\nFor people who strongly suspect they have the mumps, Isaac says the best course of action is to self-isolate for 5 days.\n\n'Once the 5 days is up, their chance of spreading the virus to anyone else is extremely low,' he said.\n\n[Byline: Eric Westhaver]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail of Canada can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12 and Manitoba Province, Canada, at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/261.]\n\n******\n[2] Ontario\nDate: Wed 27 Sep 2017\nSource: Global News [edited]\nhttps://globalnews.ca/news/3772710/peterborough-public-health-urges-vaccination-as-mumps-outbreak-continues/\n\n\nPeterborough Public Health wants residents to check their vaccination records after 3 people were diagnosed with the mumps virus.\n\nMedical Officer of Health, Dr. Rosana Salvaterra, said she wouldn't be surprised if more cases surfaced in the Peterborough area over the next few days.\n\n'There have been more than 100 cases in Ontario alone, so it's definitely not surprising that we're seeing an outbreak here,' she said.\n\nMumps causes fever, headaches and swollen salivary glands.

According to data from the Ministry of Health, the number of reported cases until now is 3 times higher compared to figures recorded 5 years ago.\n\n'We've had an important outbreak of mumps this year [2017],' pointed out Adolfo Zarate, Head of the Epidemiology area of the Ministry of Health, who also mentioned that during this year 2044 cases of mumps have been reported. This is 3 times the figure for 2013, when a similar outbreak took place, but only 776 cases were reported. Mr Zarate explained that this explosive condition is because of the change of season, and also because non-immunized people may gather, so this may generate the high number of cases.\n\nYesterday [31 Oct 2017], La Paz Health Service (SEDES, according to its Spanish initials) reported that the mumps vaccine, which is included within the MRM package (measles, rubella, and mumps) only confers 80 percent protection. The vaccine is administered to children between 12 and 24 months of age, and a booster dose is given when they are 4 years old.\n\nThe most affected departments are La Paz, 1698 cases; Santa Cruz, 221 cases, and Cochabamba. For this reason, Mr Zarate urged the (symptomatic) population to go to health centers in order to have timely therapy.\n\nIn La Paz city, SEDES reported last week that this is an alarming situation, since 'there is an explosive and persistent outbreak'.\n\nMumps is a viral disease that is transmitted from person to person through saliva (droplets). Affected persons most commonly present with the following symptoms: fever, sore throat, parotid gland enlargement (inflammation), and loss of appetite.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that all affected persons must get rest if they develop symptoms, since male subjects may develop orchitis (testis inflammation) or ovaritis (ovarian inflammation), which may lead -- in a small percentage of cases -- to infertility.\n\nHe also advised that affected persons must use masks; they must also avoid sharing cutlery and dishes, and thoroughly wash their hands. It is also important to disinfect the household using detergents, in order to prevent transmission of the disease to other members of the family.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that sanitary triage must be established in educational facilities, so that if parents, teachers, or school authorities find a symptomatic student, he/she must be immediately sent home and be isolated for at least 10 days.\n\nThe disease may occur at any age in a non-immunized person, but most commonly affected individuals are those less than 20 years of age.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Bolivia can be seen at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/bolivia_admin_2006.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Washington)\nDate: Thu 2 Nov 2017\nSource: iFIBER One News [edited]\nhttp://www.ifiberone.com/columbia_basin/mumps-and-whooping-cough-a-problem-in/youtube_71b3dcd4-c002-11e7-9a61-ff27becf4d65.html\n\n\nGrant County [Washington] saw an extraordinary amount of mumps cases this year [2017] with 45.

Dr Herman, said this was the worst outbreak since 1994. 'This is quite a large outbreak, and something we're very concerned about, and trying our best to implement public health measures to try to contain,' Herman said.\n\nShe said Auckland was essentially free of the viral disease even late last year [2016], but the outbreak began after being picked up overseas. Herman said it particularly came from the Pacific Islands -- mostly Fiji, and later Tonga -- where the mumps vaccine was not available.\n\nShe said there have also been 'massive' outbreaks in the US and the UK, which has spread easily through universities, she said.\n\n'In terms of where the mumps infection is occurring, it's actually all throughout the world. New Zealand has been immune to it until late last year [2016] and early this year. Because we've had a vulnerable population here who have not been fully immunised with the MMR vaccine, it's allowed community spread to be well established.\n\n'We are importing mumps, as well as probably exporting it as well.'\n\nHerman said it was not possible to know if the rates of the disease have peaked.\n\nBut she said if people have not received the MMR vaccine, to do so immediately. Other ways to combat the spread include washing hands, covering coughs and cleaning commonly used items.\n\nHerman says for most adults, it's a mild illness. However, a small proportion can develop complications including meningitis or encephalitis. Young children are more at risk of developing harmful outcomes.\n\n[Byline: Jordan Bond]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This outbreak is a consequence of introduction of mumps into a community with low vaccination coverage.

He declined to say where the new cases occurred.\n\nEarlier this month [September 2017], Naalehu Elementary School notified parents that mumps had been confirmed in a student. The student was asked to stay home for 2 weeks, the Ka'u-Keaau-Pahoa Complex Area superintendent said last week [week of Sun 27 Aug 2017].\n\nMumps is a highly transmissible virus that vaccination had controlled until outbreaks began worsening in 2006. It's problematic because a person is contagious for 2 days before facial swelling starts and for 9 days afterward.\n\nMumps has become a nationwide problem, with only 3 states reporting no cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: West Virginia, South Dakota and Wyoming. In Hawaii, 312 confirmed cases of mumps have been reported this year [2017].\n\nBalajadia's plea is that people diagnosed with mumps -- which has flu-like symptoms -- stay home from work or school while their condition is transmissible.\n\nHe said vaccination against mumps is 88 percent effective, meaning 12 percent of vaccinated people are at risk for development of mumps despite the MMR (measles mumps rubella) vaccination. Cases that develop among vaccinated individuals, though, tend to be less severe than without vaccination.\n\nBalajadia encourages people to talk with a physician about vaccination.\n\nPeople risk getting exposed, according to the CDC, by standing near someone who coughs or sneezes, sipping from the same glass of water, living in close quarters with a large group of friends or family, or eating from a shared plate of food.\n\nWhy are mumps a problem now? Balajadia said it's been many years since a major mumps outbreak. Hawaii's vaccination rate for schoolchildren is greater than 90 percent, Balajadia said. That means 10 percent of children in school are susceptible because they're not vaccinated for religious or health reasons, and 22 percent of vaccinated people overall also are susceptible to mumps.\n\n'It's a large pool of susceptibles,' Balajadia said. 'If people were not vaccinated to that degree, we would be seeing way more cases.'\n\nThe Department of Health's website urges anyone born after 1957 to get an MMR vaccination if the person has had no vaccination, or only one dose.\n\nPeople born before 1957 are presumed to already have been infected with mumps and built immunity.\n\nAll children are supposed to get 2 doses of MMR, one at age 12--15 months and a 2nd at age 4--6, the CDC recommends.\n\nHowever, the state DOH website recommends that 'due to the continued circulation of mumps in Hawaii, children between 1--4 years of age should receive their 2nd dose now.'\n\nThe 2nd dose should be given at least 4 weeks after the 1st.\n\nThe rise in Big Island cases, Balajadia said, should trigger people to be especially cautious about protecting themselves from exposure and about protecting others.\n\nWash hands repeatedly, he urged. Avoid sharing cups, spoons and forks with others. If someone is coughing or sneezing, turn away.\n\n[Byline: Jeff Hansel]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) continues to investigate an increasing number of cases of mumps infections statewide.\nThe disease has been confirmed in children and adults, both vaccinated and unvaccinated.

What started out as one confirmed case in early April 2017 has since spread to 10 students, all of which are either on the baseball team or in close contact with the team, vice president Dr Adam Breerwood said.\n\nAfter the 1st confirmed case, Breerwood said the school immediately contacted the Mississippi State Department of Health [MSDH] and initiated an emergency protocol, notifying faculty and students of the risk. All suspected areas of contagion were disinfected, specifically the workout and training areas and hand sanitizing containers often used by the baseball team, he said. As soon as students started to show symptoms, they were sent home to prevent further spread of the disease, Breerwood said. Some of the students have since returned to classes after being cleared by their doctors and the MSDH, he said.\n\nWith most of the cases under control, Breerwood said he hopes the issue will be resolved shortly; however, the virus can stay in the body for up to 25 days. 'It's a unique situation,' Breerwood said. 'We haven't heard of anybody getting the mumps in a number of years.'\n\nAt the recommendation of MSDH, the college provided vaccinations for the students to prevent their risk of infection, Breerwood said. As of Thu [27 Apr 2017] morning, he awaited word on whether the agency would recommend another round of vaccines. Students are scheduled to move out of the dorms on 5 May 2017, giving college staff time to decontaminate any possible areas before summer classes begin, Breerwood said.\n\nThe college currently doesn't require students to receive the mumps vaccine prior to enrollment, Breerwood said, but the administration is considering it now. 'This is what's somewhat ironic: LSU [Louisiana State University] had the same issue, and Loyola in New Orleans had it,' Breerwood said.

The infection used to be common nationwide, and decreased greatly after people started getting vaccinated. Still, state epidemiologist Dr Sarah Park says outbreaks still occur. 'When we talk and look at other states in the nation, they're seeing similarly. It's concerning. For whatever reason, there's a lot of mumps nationwide,' Park said.\n\nLocally, Park is puzzled by the outbreak. Park says these cases are unusual, because cases are typically isolated. But investigators have been able to link 3 different clusters of mumps so far this year [2017]. 'It's the end of April [2017]. We're only 4 months into 2017, and we've already gone above what we normally see,' she said. Park says the health department can't figure out what caused the mumps outbreak. 'Either they were in the same group, or some similar setting they were in. It's not necessarily relatives. With all respiratory disease, the closer we are together, the more likely we spread infection,' Park said. 'We can connect this person to this person, and that person to that person, kind of like connect the dots. It's kind of frustrating. It's not been one unifying thing.' Park says the clusters of cases show how easily the infection spreads, and adds that the respiratory infection is more contagious than the flu. It is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n\nIn children, mumps is usually a mild disease. However, mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults. Complications include:\n- meningitis (infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord);\n- deafness (temporary or permanent);\n- encephalitis (swelling of the brain);\n- orchitis (swelling of the testicles) in males who have reached puberty;\n- oophoritis (swelling of the ovaries) and/or mastitis (swelling of the breasts) in females who have reached puberty.\n\nOfficials also say that while cases have been reported in vaccinated individuals, the best protection against the disease is vaccination. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. The DoH says that all children should receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. The 1st dose is given at age 12-15 months and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years of age. All adults born in or after 1957 should also have documentation of vaccination, unless they have had a blood test showing they are immune to mumps. Certain adults at higher risk of exposure to mumps may need a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are 88 per cent effective at protecting against mumps, and one dose is 78 per cent effective.\n\nMumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus [family Paramyxovirus; genus _Rubulavirus_]. The classic symptom of mumps is called parotitis, which is a swelling of the salivary glands under the ears, resulting in a tender, swollen jaw. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Persons should seek medical attention immediately if they develop symptoms.\n\nPeople with mumps are most infectious in the several days before and after the onset of parotitis. The disease is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission can also occur when sharing items, such as cups or eating utensils, or by touching contaminated objects or surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth. Persons with mumps should stay home from school or work for 9 days after the onset of parotitis to keep from spreading the disease to others.\n\nAdditional information about mumps can be found on the DoH website at http://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/mumps/.\n\n[byline: Brigette Namata]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap showing Hawaii can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/227.]\n\n******\n[4] New York (State University of New York at Albany)\nDate: Sat 29 Apr 2017\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/mumps-eight-cases-reported-ualbany-students-19080/\n\n\nThe State University of New York, University at Albany (UAlbany) is currently dealing with 8 confirmed cases of mumps in the student body.

Cherwell has learned that major outbreaks have occurred at Exeter, Corpus Christi and St Anne's colleges, with as many as several dozen students falling ill across the entire university.\n\nIt is possible that the infection, an airbourne virus transmitted through coughing or sneezing, was spread at recent college balls. In serious cases, it can cause deafness and meningitis. Four Anne's students have reportedly been confined to their rooms, while 2 have been sent home to recover in quarantine. At Corpus, at least 3 students are affected, all of whom have either been asked to remain in their rooms or go to home for a brief period.\n\nJC is a 2nd year mathematician at Corpus who has contracted mumps and is sitting exams this term. Speaking to Cherwell, he said: 'How I got mumps is a mystery, as the incubation time is between 2--3 weeks.' Although the 'the college has been supportive and useful' by rearranging tutorials and relaxing deadlines, he said, he is concerned about upcoming examinations. He added that he 'can't really work, and as it's a viral infection, you can only treat the symptoms.'\n\nA post on the Corpus Christi College Cricket Club Facebook page announced that the St Anne's side had had to concede this week's scheduled match '[D]ue to an outbreak of mumps and food poisoning.'\n\nAccording to JB, a 2nd year at Corpus, feeling in college was relatively jovial. He told Cherwell: 'Oddly enough people really don't seem to be that worried about it at all. It's more of a cause for humour than a genuine cause for concern.'\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cherwell, St Anne's JCR [junior common room] president Pranay Shah said: ''The mumps outbreak around a few Oxford colleges is a pretty terrible coincidence with finals, prelims and other exams for the majority of students, but the response from staff has been very helpful. As well as warning people of the [infection] methods and symptoms, advice from the NHS [National Health Service] and college nurse has been provided too.'\n\nOne student who has contracted mumps told Cherwell: 'The 1st I heard about it, someone I knew caught it and had been shipped home. 'Then one evening I got sharp pains in the corner of my jaw which were pretty uncomfortable but I didn't think much of it. Overnight, I was pretty feverish. I woke up the next day with my face all swollen up on the right hand side. I went to the doctor who confirmed it was mumps, so College told me to stay in my room in quarantine or go home. 'College have been pretty good about it -- they moved me to a room with en-suite so I could be a bit more comfortable, and the nurse has been around to check on me, but I'm not allowed to use kitchens or communal bathrooms. The first couple of days of infection were pretty grim, I was really weak, walking to Jericho meant I had to sleep for almost the rest of the day, and everything ached. I had dizziness, headaches and a high temperature, and a large swelling around the back of my jawbone.'\n\nBoth the Oxford University health guidelines and NHS website recommend that people entering higher education for the 1st time have the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. In 2010, a similar outbreak saw 41 students contract mumps.

More recently, a local Pennsylvania news outlet, Lancaster Online, reported that, as of 15 May [2017], the case count had reached 86.\n\nAlthough a majority of those who were infected during the ongoing outbreak have recovered, new cases are continuously popping up around campus. In addition, the University Health Services (UHS) urges all those who present with mumps-like signs and symptoms not attend large social functions, so as to control the spread of the outbreak. The UHS also recommends all who have come in close contact with infected individuals 'avoid large social activities, especially where food or drinks are shared or where the virus can be passed through saliva exposure, even if they are not showing symptoms,' since symptoms usually arise around 16 days after exposure.\n\nInfected individuals usually present with 'puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw,' due to swelling of the salivary glands. Other symptoms include fever, muscle ache, headache, and loss of appetite.\n\nAccording to the Penn State's immunization recommendations, most students, including those living on and off campus, whether they are new, returning, or transfer students, are expected to receive 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, or submit results from a blood test proving immunity, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nStudents exempt from this requirement include exchange students, non-degree-seeking students, World Campus students, and those CDC recommends not to receive the vaccine, including pregnant women, anyone with previous allergies to the vaccine, and anyone with life-threatening allergy against neomycin. In addition, the CDC recommends individuals with certain chronic diseases inform their physician of their conditions prior to receiving vaccination.\n\nA Penn State press release reports that 'most of the confirmed mumps cases are in students who received the CDC-recommended 2 doses of MMR vaccine;' however, UHS still recommends those who have not received the vaccine or who are not immune to mumps - through previous infection - schedule an appointment with UHS or their primary care physician to be vaccinated 'immediately.'\n\nCommenting on the ongoing outbreak at Penn State, Shelley Haffner, infectious disease manager at UHS, said, 'While many students who contracted mumps earlier this semester are no longer infectious, we are still continuing to see several new cases each week on campus... It is important that everyone take steps not only to protect themselves from possible exposure, but also to prevent exposing others should they develop symptoms.'\n\nIn light of this ongoing outbreak, Penn State will 'exclude' anyone who does not provide proof of immunity from campus for the duration of 26 days if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Individuals who have presented with mumps-like symptoms have been placed in isolation based on protocols and recommendations from the CDC and the Pennsylvania Department of Health. In addition, several students have left campus 'during the infectious phase of the illness.' UHS has reached out to individuals who may have contracted infection and have already taken necessary steps to exclude those who have been identified as contacts of confirmed cases from the university campus.\n\n[byline: Sarah Anwar]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\n\n******\n[4] California, Los Angeles County\nDate: Thu 1 June 2017 4:57 PM PDT\nSource: Los Angeles Daily News [edited]\nhttp://www.dailynews.com/health/20170601/mumps-outbreak-declared-in-la-county-after-more-than-40-diagnoses\n\n\nMore than 40 people in Los Angeles County and surrounding regions have been diagnosed with mumps, prompting public health officials [Thu 1 Jun 2017] to declare an outbreak and issue an alert to physicians and providers to be aware of it.\n\nIn the alert, public health officials said many of the cases were initially misdiagnosed and there was a reliance of using false negative results. It's unclear when this occurred. Health officials also did not release the conditions of those who were diagnosed. A response from Los Angeles County public health officials was not immediately forthcoming [Thu 1 Jun 2017].\n\nBut health officials said most of the patients are men who have sex with men, and the majority of the cases were linked to patients being at large venues such as gyms, bars, theaters and nightclubs. Some of the patients are women and heterosexual men who have social connections to men who have sex with men, health officials noted. 'The majority of cases have had no documentation of complete vaccination; however, some cases were fully vaccinated,' according to the alert.\n\nMumps is highly infectious and spreads among those living in close quarters or at social settings. In March [2017], 7 men in LA County were diagnosed with mumps as part of 2 different clusters and occurred in men who have sex with men. It was unclear if those cases were related to the recent outbreak. 'A major factor contributing to outbreaks of mumps is being in a crowded environment,' according to the alert. 'Also, certain behaviors that result in exchanging saliva, such as kissing or sharing utensils, cups, lipstick or cigarettes, may increase the spread of the virus.'\n\nSymptoms include fatigue, body aches, headache, loss of appetite, a low-grade fever and swelling of the salivary glands, according to health experts. In adult men, mumps can sometimes lead to sterility.\n\nNationwide, 2570 people have been diagnosed with mumps from January to April of this year [2017], according to the federal CDC. The agency reports that mumps is no longer common in the United States, but some outbreaks have been reported. Last year [2016], there were 5833 cases. 'Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting,' according to CDC. 'Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been more than 99 per cent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.'\n\nMumps patients are contagious from 2 days before through 5 days after onset, according to CDC. Public health officials said routine vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the disease. California requires that all children entering kindergarten receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. As of 1 July 2016, only children with medical proof can be exempt.\n\n[byline: Susan Abram]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/214.]", "summary": "\n\n[byline: Felix Pope]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of the United Kingdom can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40]\n\n******\n \n\n[byline: Sarah Anwar]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\n\n******\n \n\n[byline: Susan Abram]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/214.] A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< \n\nCommenting on the ongoing outbreak at Penn State, Shelley Haffner, infectious disease manager at UHS, said, 'While many students who contracted mumps earlier this semester are no longer infectious, we are still continuing to see several new cases each week on campus...

At the same time, the Department of State Health Services confirms numbers in Central Texas are rising too -- 5 in Travis County in March and April [2017], and 2 cases in Hays County. Public health experts say the MMR vaccine is the key to stopping the outbreak from reaching the Austin area, but even if you got the shots, you may not be immune to the mumps.\n\nThat's because the MMR vaccine is 88 percent effective, meaning about 1 in 10 people won't develop the antibodies to fight off the diseases and won't know it.\n\nAt Austin Public Health's Far South Clinic, the health care workers are in the business of stopping preventable diseases. That includes mumps. 'We have seen a large outbreak in the Dallas area, in Cedar Hill,' said public health educator Colleen Christian. 'Here in Travis County, we haven't seen anything like that. We do have a few cases of mumps reported.' Christian believes there were no cases reported in Travis County last year [2016].\n\nChristian says many adults may not be immune to mumps. 'For it to be as effective as possible we recommend people get 2 doses of the vaccine,' she said. But 2 doses weren't recommended until the late 1980s. ...\n\nAdults born before 1957 likely have immunity from being exposed to the mumps virus before the vaccine was made available to the public. But if you were born between the late 1950s and late 1980s, doctors can test to see if you have immunity to the mumps. 'To find out if you are immune to the illnesses that the vaccines protect against, you could have a titer run which is where they draw your blood and look at the amount of antibodies that are available,' Christian said.\n\nSymptoms of mumps include fever, headache, throat pain and swelling of the salivary glands between the ear and jaw. If you have those symptoms, or you've been in contact with someone connected to the outbreak in North Texas, call your doctor.\n\n[Byline: Adela Uchida]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A ProMED/Healthmap of Texas, United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245]\n\n******\n[2] California (Orange County)\nDate: Fri 19 May 2017 9:31 am\nSource: Orange County Register [edited]\nhttp://www.ocregister.com/2017/05/18/two-new-mumps-cases-in-orange-county-are-unrelated-to-chapman-outbreak/\n\n\nA total of 2 new mumps cases have been diagnosed that are unrelated to the Chapman University outbreak, the Orange County Health Care Agency said [Thu 18 May 2017].\n\nThe 2 patients, both in their 20s, did not have contact with the 13 Chapman students who fell ill between January and 18 April 2017, but had close contact with each other.

'We're asking all residents to get a mumps vaccine unless they have already received 2 doses of the vaccine,' Connie Carter, public health communicable disease nurse at CHD, said.\n\nMost individuals who contract mumps will have a mild illness that lasts a week or so, but some people may have more serious outcomes. 'Those outcomes include testicular swelling, hearing loss, swelling around the brain and spinal cord or brain damage,' Carter said.\n\nThough officials are urging county residents to get vaccinated against the virus, the vaccine might not work as well for some people, so having as many qualified individuals who are healthy enough to receive the vaccination is important.\n\n'Having high vaccine rates in the community also protects those who can't be vaccinated because they are too young or have a health condition that prevents it,' Carter said.\n\nMeanwhile, officials are working on pinpointing where the disease in Union County originated, but according to Carrie Brogoitti, public health administrator with CHD, the extensive investigation will take time.\n\nWhile it may never be known how mumps came to the county, public health workers want residents to know what the symptoms are and how the disease is contracted so they can protect themselves and their families.\n\nSymptoms of mumps include puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. Other indicators of the virus include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, according to the news release. The 1st symptoms typically appear 16 to 18 days after infection and up to 25 days after initial contact.\n\n'Some people may not have signs of illness. If you think that you have the mumps, stay away from others,' Carter said. 'Do not show up at the emergency room or your health care provider's office. Instead, call your provider and ask what you should do next.'\n\nThe communicable disease is spread easily through fluids from the mouth, nose, or throat. It can spread two days before signs of the illness appear, and up to 5 days after the swelling begins.\n\nAn infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, talking, or sharing items such as cups or eating utensils with others and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others, according to the release.\n\nHealth officials are warning that if someone thinks they might have contracted the mumps, then they should stay away from others.\n\nHealth officials are also encouraging anyone who thinks they might be infected to not show up at an emergency room or a health care provider's office. Health officials are urging anyone who believes they may have mumps to call their primary provider and ask for instructions, according to the release.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Oregon (Jackson County)\nDate: Fri 16 Jun 2017\nSource: KTVL [edited]\nhttp://ktvl.com/news/local/public-health-officials-seeing-mumps-outbreak-across-oregon\n\n\nJackson County [Oregon] Public Health officials say they're noticing a spike of mumps cases across the state.\n\nLocally, Jackson County has only had 1 confirmed case this year [2017].\n\nMumps is a vaccine-preventable disease, usually given to children at a year and then between the ages of 4 and 6 years old.

There were 5833 cases nationwide last year [2016], and that number seems to be rising this year. As of May [2017], there have been 3176 nationwide cases this year, on pace to exceed last year's comfortably.\n\nSome vaccinated individuals have been affected, with the majority of cases being found in places where people are kept in closed quarters, such as college campuses. The MMR vaccine, designed to protect against mumps among other diseases, does not seem to be covering it.\n\nThe vaccine's effectiveness is not really in question, but there are thoughts of adding additional doses. Now, doses are given when children are about 1 year of age and then again before school age. The vaccine may wane before adulthood is reached. Some, like military members, are given additional doses of the vaccine in basic training, but the general population does not receive a booster.\n\nResearch has shone that it may be just a blip though. Most of those infected intermingle. Most of the cases have been seen on campuses, in bars, nightclubs, or other similar places. People infected tend to have the same social networks.\n\nIt is recommended that you limit contact with affected individuals. Do not share drinks. Avoid shaking hands. Make sure to wash your hands often. If you are infected, you should limit your contact with other people until you're better and should see a doctor immediately to start your treatment. Please be courteous to others and try not to spread the virus around.\n\nRegardless of this blip, the national incidence of mumps is down more than 99 percent since before the introduction of the MMR vaccine, so these numbers are nothing too much to worry about. It's just important that everyone take the proper precautions to avoid getting infected, especially if you live in an outbreak area.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4259.

Public Health England (PHE), alongside the NHS, are investigating after nearly 450 cases were reported between [1 Jan-30 May 2017]. This is an increase of 150 cases compared to the same 5-month period in 2016. The City of Westminster had the lowest infection rate with only 8 cases, with 15 reported in Kensington and Chelsea.\n\nThis news comes in tandem with data that show that cases of measles have also sky-rocketed in London and the South East last year [2017], reaching the highest number since the last outbreak in 2012 (which saw 3873 cases across England and Wales). There were a total of 60 cases recorded in 2016 (there were 382 in 2012), compared to just 4 in 2015. London and the South West were the only 2 regions to record more cases of the viral infection last year [2016].\n\nThe upturn in both mumps and measles can be traced to the falling numbers of children undergoing the MMR vaccine. The World Health Organisation has set a target of 95 percent, but vaccination rates have fallen to 91.9 percent. This recent fall has followed years of broadly rising coverage since the MMR controversy, when the vaccine was linked to autism in a now-discredited paper in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of the United Kingdom can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/283\n\nThe mumps virus is an RNA virus belonging to the genus _Rubulavirus_ in the family Paramyxovirus.

However, this past year has seen a upswing in the number of mumps cases.\n\nMMR (Measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66 to 95 percent) effective at protecting against mumps; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49 percent to 92 percent) effective. It is important that children get vaccinated since the disease can be more severe in adults. While some people who get mumps have very mild or no symptoms, and often they do not know they have the disease, and most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks, symptoms can be serious. Complications may include infections of the coverings of the brain (15 percent), pancreatitis (4 percent), permanent deafness, and painful testicular swelling which uncommonly results in infertility. Women may develop ovarian swelling but this does not increase the risk of infertility. - Mod.LK]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of the United Kingdom can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/283\n\nThe mumps virus is an RNA virus belonging to the genus _Rubulavirus_ in the family Paramyxovirus.

Swollen jaw or not, it could be mumps.\n\nThe Capital Region [New York] is experiencing its 1st outbreak of mumps in years, with 45 cases in the 4-county region so far in 2017. For some parts of the area, these are the 1st cases of mumps in several years. And in Rensselaer County this year's 2 reported cases are the 1st seen there in 20 years, said Public Health Director Mary Fran Wachunas.\n\nAlbany County has seen the lion's share of mumps this year [2017], with 29 cases.\nMost of them are traceable to 2 locations where the virus that causes the disease has spread. One is the University at Albany, where 22 patients had an association. The other is a local sports team, which had 6 cases.\n\nMumps cases by county, 2017\n\nAlbany : 29\nSaratoga: 13\nRensselaer: 2\nSchenectady: 1\n\nIn Saratoga County, where there have been 13 diagnosed cases of mumps, however, the patients are not connected by community, facility or demographic. That caused county officials to advise residents with suspected mumps symptoms to see a doctor immediately.\n\nThe most well-known symptom of mumps are swollen glands under the ears or jaw. But some patients who have the illness do not have that telltale sign, said Dr Rebecca Kobos, medical director for student health at UAlbany. Headache, muscle aches, loss of appetite and fever may be enough to indicate mumps, Kobos said, especially if a patient has been exposed to someone with the virus.\n\nHer advice: See a doctor and take it seriously. Rest and stay away from work or school, so you don't expose other people to the illness. Rare but serious complications of mumps include swelling of the reproductive organs or the brain, as well as deafness.\nCommon sense is also handy.\n\n'Precautions as simple as regular handwashing and covering one's mouth when coughing can go a long way to halt the spread of the virus,' said Catherine Duncan, director of public health in Saratoga County.\n\n[Byline: Claire Hughes]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of New York, United States, can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234]\n\n******\n[4] Massachusetts, Boston\nDate: Fri 9 Jun 2017\nSource: Eastie Times [edited]\nhttp://www.eastietimes.com/2017/06/09/eastie-part-of-recent-mumps-outbreak/\n\n\nThe state's Department of Public Health's (DPH) spokeswoman Ann Scales confirmed that some of 12 new cases of mumps that are part of an ongoing outbreak in the area originated in East Boston.\n\nSince the end of March [2017], 12 cases have been reported in Eastie, Boston, Chelsea and Revere among the neighborhood's Latino population.\n\nScales said the DPH will be reaching out to the Latino communities here and in the other communities affected by the outbreak in order to increase awareness about mumps and to encourage vaccination.\n\nThe DPH usually sees mumps outbreaks among college-age individuals attending local colleges and universities. However, what makes this outbreak unique is it is among adults ranging in age from 20 to 41 with no known connection to higher education. All of the residents hit by the outbreak are Latino and include members of the Colombian, Dominican, Guatemalan, and Salvadoran communities. None of those affected is known to have traveled internationally prior to becoming ill. For the majority of the residents, vaccination histories are unknown but most are believed to be unvaccinated against mumps. Unvaccinated individuals are most susceptible to mumps infection.\n\nHealth officials reported that this outbreak 'may represent a change in the epidemiology of mumps in Massachusetts'.\n\n'MMR vaccination is highly protective against mumps and is recommended for children and adults,' said Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel, MD, MPH, referring to the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. 'In addition, those who have mumps should stay isolated at home for 5 days after their onset of swelling. Mumps is usually a mild disease but can cause serious illness. If you think you have mumps, stay home and call your healthcare provider.''\n\nAccording to the DPH mumps virus is spread through infected respiratory tract secretions. It can be spread within 3 -- 6 feet when an infected person coughs or sneezes or with direct contact with infected secretions like sharing water bottles. The incubation period can range from 12 -- 25 days. Parotitis, or swelling of the salivary glands, is the most common symptom but non-specific symptoms such as myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-grade fever may precede the parotitis by several days. In the pre-vaccine era, 15--30 percent of infections were asymptomatic.\n\nPeople are considered infectious from 2 days before symptoms begin until 5 days after the onset of parotid swelling. Therefore, those suspected of mumps should be isolated and should refrain from public activities for 5 days after the onset of swelling.\n\nDPH and local health departments are investigating these cases and instituting isolation and quarantine measures to control the spread of mumps.\n\nEast Boston Neighborhood Health Center could not confirm if any of the confirmed cases were treated at the clinic.\n\n[Byline: John Lynds]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of Massachusetts, United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/224]\n\n[According to the CDC [edited], from 1 Jan -- 20 May 2017, 42 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. reported mumps infections in 3176 people to CDC.\n\nMumps is no longer very common in the United States. From year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2016, there were approximately 5833 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting.

That is more than 3 times the number of cases reported in the state all of last year [2016]. Every other year in the previous decade saw only single-digit case numbers.\n\nThe biggest reason for the dramatic spike this year [2017] has been an outbreak of 46 linked cases in Denver and Arapahoe County. But Miller said no new linked cases have been identified since the end of February [2017], and health officials are hopeful that vaccination clinics helped stem the outbreak.\n\n'But we are continuing to get sporadic cases of mumps that don't turn out to be related to the outbreak,' Miller said.\n\nThose isolated cases, Miller said, are the result of a nationwide mumps boom that mirrors Colorado's own increase. This year [2017], 37 states have reported more than 1000 mumps cases, combined, and Miller said outbreaks elsewhere will likely continue to keep Colorado case numbers ticking upward.\n\nThe mumps, which causes telltale painful swelling in the glands of the cheek and jaw, is often thought of as an old-time virus. Most people born before 1957 have probably been exposed to mumps in their lifetimes. But vaccination made mumps cases much more rare.\n\nMiller said the outbreak this year [2017] mostly occurred in unvaccinated people. Those who have been vaccinated can still catch mumps if exposed, but it is much less likely and the symptoms would be less severe.\n\nMiller said it is possible that mumps outbreaks are cyclical and that this year's will soon be relegated to history. But she also encouraged more people to get vaccinated in order to break the cycle.\n\n'The intervention is really very clear,' she said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[A map of the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\n\n******\n[3] USA (Texas, Dallas County)\nDate: Wed 5 Apr 2017 9:45 PM\nSource: CBS Local [edited]\nhttp://dfw.cbslocal.com/2017/04/05/cedar-hill-at-center-of-mumps-outbreak/\n\n\nDallas County Health and Human Services report 76 mumps cases in the county, 56 of them coming from students and teachers in Cedar Hill ISD.\n\nA letter went out to Cedar Valley College students and staff alerting them about a high school student from Cedar Hill Collegiate Academy taking classes there might have exposed others.\n\nDallas County reported its 1st mumps case on 19 Jan [2016].

A person with mumps can spread the disease from 2 days before to 5 days after gland swelling begins, so people with mumps should stay at home until at least 5 days after the swelling starts.

We're quite used to having this cyclical activity with mumps.'\n\nThere's been increased mumps activity across Ontario, as well as Canada and the United States. 'It is circulating. There is sporadic activity,' Wright said.\n\nIn Guelph, there are 3 confirmed cases among university aged people linked to a keg party held in mid-January [2017]. 2 more suspected cases are being followed.\n\nToronto Public Health is investigating a mumps outbreak in the city. There were 43 confirmed cases by [15 Mar 2017].\n\nWright said people should check their immunization records to ensure they've received 2 mumps vaccines, which is needed for optimal protection. The 1st dose is given around the 1st birthday, and the 2nd between 4 and 6. Some people only received 1 dose as a child. They can get a 2nd dose now.\n\nThose most affected by the recent spike in mumps activity are people 17-35 years old. It's thought the longer the time from the 2nd dose, the more susceptible a person may be.\n\n'We do see some waning effect, especially as you get older,' Wright said.\n\nThe virus is spread through droplets and requires close contact. That can include sharing drinks, kissing, and coughing or sneezing within one metre.\n\n'It tends to be a very social age group,' Wright said. 'That might contribute to spread among that age group.'\n\nSymptoms include fever, headache, and swelling in the salivary glands, Wright said. 'There are a lot of people who just have respiratory symptoms.'\n\nComplications such as meningitis are possible but rare, and most people are better in about a week.\n\nMumps activity goes in cycles and, fortunately, large outbreaks are rare because of high immunization rates, Wright said. Last year [2016], there was one case in the region. 'And in other years we have none at all,' she said.\n\nThe virus has a long incubation period, upwards of 25 days before symptoms appear. 'You can be contagious but not show any symptoms,' said Chuck Ferguson, spokesperson for the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.\n\nHe said the department is watching to see if anyone in contact with the current cases develops mumps to know if it's spreading in the community and who is at risk.\n\n[Byline: Johanna Weidner]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Canada can be accessed at http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/Canada_Provinces_and_territories_map.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Illinois)\nDate: Wed 22 Mar 2017 5:15 AM CDT\nSource: Daily Herald [edited]\nhttp://www.dailyherald.com/article/20170322/news/170329654/\n\n\nStation Middle School [Barrington, Cook and Lake counties, Illinois] now has 3 confirmed cases of the mumps, making it the 2nd Barrington Area Unit School District 220 school to have an outbreak of the disease, district officials said [Tue 21 Mar 2017].

Since then, there have been nearly 3000 cases of the disease across 33 counties in the state.\n\nAs a public health practitioner, I wondered: Why did this outbreak take off?\n\nMy team at HealthMap, a computational epidemiology lab based out of Boston Children's Hospital, began by rounding up as much data as we could.\n\nWe quickly discovered that the Arkansas Department of Health was releasing semi-regular PDF reports on the outbreak. The reports broke down cases by county, age, and school district (many of the people who have contracted mumps in the Arkansas outbreak are children). But there were no historical archives that could give us a sense of how the outbreak had grown over time.\n\nSo we turned to a tool called the HealthMap Digital Surveillance System, which collects social media reports and news about public health issues around the world and turns them into usable epidemiological data. (For example, this blog previously reported on how we used our surveillance system to collect Google search and participatory public health data to track and predict flu outbreaks.)\n\nFrom the HealthMap data about the mumps outbreak, we were able to estimate the total number of cases that had occurred since August 2016.\n\nAt that point, we had all the information we needed to tackle a more difficult question: What could the data tell us about vaccination in communities affected by the outbreak?\n\nBefore we get to our answer to that question, let's talk about mumps.\n\nMumps, like measles and rubella, is extremely contagious. Because of this, the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine is given in 2 doses. Even with both doses, the vaccine is imperfect. One out of every 10 individuals who receives it remains susceptible to the mumps virus. In the event of a mumps outbreak, some people who get sick will be people who were vaccinated; how many depends on what percentage of the people in the affected community are vaccinated.\n\nFor a disease as contagious as mumps, a 2-dose community-level vaccination rate as high as 96 percent may be necessary to prevent active transmission of the virus, maintaining so-called herd immunity. When the vaccination rate drops, herd immunity breaks down and outbreaks can take off.\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Health doesn't generally report high-resolution vaccination statistics to the public. But it has been collecting self-reported data on vaccination from individuals who were diagnosed with mumps during this particular outbreak. In the department's latest report, an average of about 70 percent of people who got mumps said they had received both doses of the mumps vaccine.\n\nHowever, studies have shown that self-reported vaccination rates are typically 1.5 to 2 times greater than actual vaccination rates. This means that the true 2-dose vaccination rate among mumps cases in Arkansas was probably closer to 35-46 percent.\n\nBut what about vaccination rates in the larger communities that these cases came from?\n\nAfter pairing our surveillance data with mathematical modeling methods, we estimated that the average 2-dose vaccination rate in communities affected by the outbreak was likely no higher than 89 percent and may have been as low as 70 percent, well below that ideal rate of 96 percent.\n\nOur complete methodology can be found in a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases [see citation below].\n\nAs vaccine hesitancy gains ground in the United States, we place ourselves at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella. While these childhood illnesses aren't fatal to most people, those who are most susceptible to serious adverse effects, such as children under the age of 1 and cancer patients, are often those who can't be vaccinated.\n\nAnd this is why herd immunity is so important. When we vaccinate, we protect not only ourselves but the most vulnerable members of our communities, too.\n\n[Byline: Maimuna Majumder]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Reference\n--------\nMajumder MS, Nguyen CM, Cohn EL et al: Vaccine compliance and the 2016 Arkansas mumps outbreak.

'People who are in close contact with the patients of the outbreak should get a 3rd dose,' he said.\n\nPrior to this year [2017], just one case of mumps had been recorded by the North West Hospital and Health Service since 2012.\n\nMumps usually causes swelling of parotid salivary glands under the angle of the jaw. Other symptoms include fever, headache and tiredness.\n\nIn severe cases, the disease can affect the testicles in males or the lining of the brain (meningitis).\n\nIt spreads easily through sneezing and coughing.\n\nDr Donohue said immunisation was the most effective counter-measure. 'Mumps is a virus so antibiotics do not work,' he said. 'If given before exposure, vaccination will prevent the disease in the majority of people.'\n\nMMR vaccine is routinely given at 12 and 18 months, but catch-up boosters can be given anytime.\n\nHowever the live, weakened vaccine cannot be given to pregnant women, young babies, or people with immune problems.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Australia can be seen at http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24533. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Texas, Dallas County)\nDate: Sat 25 Mar 2017\nSource: Focus Daily News (FDN) [edited]\nhttp://www.focusdailynews.com/2017/03/25/cedar-hill-isd-continues-mumps-outbreak-dallas-county/\n\n\nThis week Dallas County health officials announced another increase in the number of mumps cases at Cedar Hill High School. According to DCHHS [Dallas County Health & Human Services], since the initial outbreak on [9 Feb 2017], there have been 49 cases reported between students and teachers.\n\nThat is a drastic increase since the last reported update of 28 cases, as students prepared for the Spring Break holiday [13-17 Mar 2017].\n\nCedar Hill Independent School District [CHISD] borders Ellis County as well, County Spokesperson Renae Crutchfield, did note not all cases are Dallas County residents.\n\nTo date, there have been 63 mumps cases in Dallas County. DCHHS has also identified 14 unrelated mumps cases in Mesquite, Dallas, and neighboring DeSoto [Dallas County].\n\nCedar Hill ISD Director of Communication Jamie Brown urges calm. He says that the statement from the county health department could easily confuse Cedar Hill residents.\n\n'The number Dallas County is reporting represents the total number of cases since [9 Feb 2017]. As of yesterday [24 Mar 2017], all of the teachers and students who were confirmed by the county have returned to class,' explains Brown. 'We do have some who are absent and are still waiting confirmation from the County.'\n\nAlthough the statistics are finally leaning in a positive direction for CHISD, Brown assures parents that the district has not relented in its efforts to combat the illness.\n\n'We are continuing to be vigilant with cleaning and communicating to students about the importance of hand-washing and proper hygiene,' said Brown. Strict cleaning efforts have been in place since [9 Feb 2017], when the district was first informed of the outbreak from DCHHS. 'We had our cleaning staff do an extensive cleaning of the campus that night,' said Brown. Furthermore, additional janitorial staff members came in over the weekend to deep clean in an effort to stop the spread of the disease.\n\nSince the mumps onslaught the district and DCHHS have partnered to host a number of clinics on the high school campus.\n\n'Actually we are playing host and Dallas County is providing the vaccines.'\n\nThe Centers For Disease Control recommends a 3rd dose, only when an individual has exposure to an ongoing outbreak.\n\n'Since February [2017], we have hosted 3 booster shot clinics at the high school. 2 additional for students who come from the Ninth Grade Center to attend classes or activities,' said Brown.\n\nDCHHS Health officials are urging immunization to protect against and prevent the spread of mumps. People with 2 rounds of mumps vaccinations (such as 2 MMR vaccines) are usually immune from mumps.\n\n'At 2 doses, the MMR vaccine has 88 percent effectiveness,' said Dr Christopher Perkins, Dallas County medical director. 'Getting vaccinated is the best option for protection in addition to washing hands frequently and cleaning/disinfecting objects or surfaces that may be contaminated with germs.'\n\nCurrently Cedar Hill officials are awaiting confirmation from DCHHS on a 3rd round of vaccinations at the Ninth Grade Center.\n\nMumps is a highly contagious viral disease that spreads by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Items used by a person suffering from the mumps, such as cups or soft drink cans, could carry the virus, which may spread to others.\n\nMumps patients often show symptoms of fever, headache, and swelling of the salivary glands, fatigue, muscle aches, and loss of appetite. Symptoms usually appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection.\n\n[Byline: Joshua C.

Only 2 of those individuals have tested positive, said Kerry McCue, Ellis County health services administrator.\n\nBoth of those individuals are 'well past' the contagious period, he said.\n\nWhen a positive mumps case is identified, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment requires a 5-day quarantine.\n\nResidents are encouraged to make sure they are vaccinated and might have the option of a 'booster shot' as a precaution. There is not yet a recommended time when someone should get a booster, but that could change if the outbreak continues, McCue said.\n\n'I would assume that with the number of cases that have spread out across the nation, I imagine we'll all be recommended from the CDC to eventually get our 3rd one,' he said. 'There is not a specific time frame.'\n\nThere have been at least 79 confirmed mumps cases statewide, according to the most recent data available from KDHE [Kansas Department of Health and Environment].\n\nThe vaccine is not 100-percent effective, but those who get it are considered 9 times less likely to acquire the virus, he said. 'And if they do get it, it won't be as severe,' McCue said.\n\nThere are some exceptions: People who were born before 1957 are considered immune, as they likely already had the virus.\n\n2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine typically are recommended for children, 1 dose at between 12 and 15 months, and another between 4 and 6 years of age. Young children are not considered fully vaccinated until they receive the 2nd dose, but they do have some protection, said Kimberly Koerner, infection prevention officer at Hays Medical Center.\n\n'That's why we encourage anybody who can be vaccinated to be vaccinated, because they do help increase the coverage for everybody else in the community,' Koerner said. 'If we have a community that does practice preventative care by getting a vaccine, that helps cover those that aren't fully vaccinated or can't be fully vaccinated.'\n\nVaccines are available at the Ellis County Health Department or through primary care physician clinics.\n\nThough the exact source of the outbreak isn't yet clear, KDHE has linked possible exposure to wrestling and basketball events, Kansas State University and the University of Kansas, and travel to other states, according to the agency's website.\n\nThe most telling symptom is often pain and swelling in the glands below the jaw line. Other -- and often earlier -- symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, and fatigue, Koerner said. The virus has a lengthy incubation period, with symptoms typically showing 12-25 days after exposure.\n\nIf anyone suspects they might have the virus, they are encouraged to seek prompt medical attention. Patients, however, should call ahead to notify the medical clinic of their condition so steps can be taken to avoid exposing others, Koerner said.\n\nIn otherwise healthy patients, the illness doesn't usually lead to severe complications, she said.\n\n'It actually used to be very common,' she said. 'It's become highly uncommon since more people are being vaccinated.'\n\nOther preventive measures include practicing good personal hygiene and frequent handwashing. The airborne virus is carried through coughing, sneezing, talking or sharing eating utensils with others.\n\n'The number one way to stop the spread of germs is covering your cough and washing your hands,' Koerner said. 'We always ask people to do that, all the time. And avoid close contact with people when they're sick.'\n\n[Byline: Kaley Conner]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Kansas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8703.

At the heart of that outbreak is the campus of LSU [Louisiana State University]. The 1st cases were reported by the Louisiana Department of Health around [16 Mar 2017], following a major outbreak in Arkansas.\n\nThe challenge, per assistant state health officer, Dr Parham Jaberi, is that someone infected with the mumps virus may not show symptoms for up to 3 weeks. 'It becomes a challenge because once we identify the problem through public health, we're playing catch up,' said Dr Jaberi.\n\nSymptoms of the mumps include fever, aches, fatigue, loss of appetite, and swollen salivary glands. The virus itself is not usually a serious illness and most people recover on their own. However, it is extremely contagious, leaving crowded areas like a college campus at high risk for infection.\n\n'Often times, it's spread through kissing, sharing of utensils, personal items, and in concentrated areas where people live close together,' said Jaberi.\n\nThe university has reported about 20 cases of mumps so far. Jaberi said there's been a handful of cases in other areas of the state as well. Doctors say a vaccine is the best way to prevent the mumps, but for the vaccine to be most effective, 2 doses are needed. Even then, it's not a guarantee. The Louisiana Department of Health says most of the current cases involve patients who were vaccinated.\n\nLSU requires immunizations for new students and recently offered booster shots in coordination with the health department and the CDC.

'There's no need to panic. We're quite used to having this cyclical activity with mumps.' There's been increased mumps activity across Ontario, as well as Canada and the United States.\n'It is circulating. There is sporadic activity,' Wright said.\n\nIn Guelph, there are 3 confirmed cases among university aged people linked to a keg party held in mid-January [2017]. Two more suspected cases are being followed.\n\nToronto Public Health is investigating a mumps outbreak in the city. There were 43 confirmed cases by [Wed 15 Mar2017].\n\nWright said people should check their immunization records to ensure they've received 2 mumps vaccines, which is needed for optimal protection. The 1st dose is given around the 1st birthday, and the 2nd between 4 and 6. Some people only received 1 dose as a child. They can get a 2nd dose now.\n\nThose most affected by the recent spike in mumps activity are people 17 -- 35 years old. It's thought the longer the time from the 2nd dose, the more susceptible a person may be.\n\n'We do see some waning effect, especially as you get older,' Wright said.\n\nThe virus is spread through droplets and requires close contact. That can include sharing drinks, kissing, and coughing or sneezing within 1 meter.\n\n'It tends to be a very social age group,' Wright said. 'That might contribute to spread among that age group.'\n\nSymptoms include fever, headache, and swelling in the salivary glands, Wright said. 'There are a lot of people who just have respiratory symptoms.'\n\nComplications such as meningitis are possible but rare, and most people are better in about a week.\n\nMumps activity goes in cycles and, fortunately, large outbreaks are rare because of high immunization rates, Wright said. Last year [2016], there was one case in the region. 'And in other years we have none at all,' she said.\n\nThe virus has a long incubation period, upwards of 25 days before symptoms appear.\n\n'You can be contagious but not show any symptoms,' said Chuck Ferguson, spokesperson for the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.

As well, 5 of these cases have been linked to elementary and high schools in Toronto, either among staff or students.\n\n'All of the cases related to Toronto school settings acquired the mumps from close contact with a known individual who already had the mumps and not from the school setting,' Toronto Public Health said in the news release.\n\nRyerson University confirmed 2 cases of the mumps on campus earlier this week [week of 19 March 2017]. The other schools affected include King Edward Public School, Hodgson Senior Public School and Forest Hill Collegiate.\n\nToronto Public Health said the initial outbreak began in February [2017] when the number of cases hovered around 14, but that number has grown ever since. Originally, the outbreak was linked to bars and restaurants in the city's west-end, particularly between Queen Street and King Street from Spadina Avenue to Dufferin Street.\n\nIn Thursday's news release, Toronto Public Health said that broader community spread of the mumps is now occurring in Toronto.\n\nThe mumps is a viral infection which is typically found in saliva and respiratory droplets. It is spread through coughing, sneezing and coming into contact with a person's saliva by sharing drinks or utensils, food or water bottles, or by kissing.\n\nFurthermore, a major factor contributing to outbreaks of this infection is being in a crowded environment or being in close quarters consistently with a person who has the mumps.\n\nSymptoms for the virus include fever, swelling of one or more salivary glands, loss of appetite, tiredness, and headache.\n\nIn more severe cases, mumps can produce an infection in the brain, painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, pancreatitis or hearing loss.\n\nToronto Public Health is urging residents of the city to call their doctor to ensure they are properly immunized.

At Barrington High, the number of confirmed mumps cases increased to 6, and Superintendent Brian Harris said it could eventually go to as high as 10.\n\n'I wouldn't be surprised,' said Harris at the board of education meeting at Barrington High [Tue 21 Mar 2017] night. 'Ten reported cases out of approximately 3500 people who are in and out of this building every day is still well below the public health information that talks about the effectiveness of vaccines.'\n\nAccording to the CDC (Centers for disease Control and Prevention), the mumps component of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is about 88 percent effective when a person gets 2 doses.\n\nThe district has been getting updates on the slow spread of the disease via daily 3 p.m. conference calls with the Lake County Health Department.\n\n'I do believe our school community has responded appropriately and diligently in all regards,' Harris said. 'I do believe that is part of the reason why we've seen so many reporting, I think parents and students are following up as we asked.'\n\nThe Lake County Health Department updates their website daily with the latest number of confirmed, probable and suspected mumps cases.\n\nOn [Mon 13 Mar 2017], the health department held a vaccination clinic for Barrington High School staff and students who were not up to date with their MMR vaccinations. Harris said 85 staff members took advantage of the opportunity. He said students likely didn't take advantage because more than 99 percent of them have received 2 MMR vaccines already. Adults born after 1957 and before 1989 were only required to get one MMR vaccine, so Harris said the staff members used the clinic to get a 2nd dose.\n\nHarris said there will be a similar clinic offered to staff and students and Station Middle School in the coming weeks.\n\nWhen new confirmed cases trickle in, it means the districts small number of students who are unvaccinated for religious or medical reasons have to spend more and more time away from the student population. The district has been helping those students continue their education from home in a variety of ways, including having access to coursework through their school-issued laptops. Harris said they are also inviting the students to come in and receive one-on-one instruction after school for things like tests and time learning in the lab. The schools are thoroughly cleaned each night to health department specifications.\n\nMumps is a serious contagious disease.

Some surrounding states have also had a number of cases, according to KDHE.\n\nMumps is caused by a virus and spreads through close contact with an infected person. Mumps can occasionally cause complications, including inflammation of the testicles or ovaries, meningitis, encephalitis and deafness. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks.\n\nIn addition to staying isolated when a person has mumps, the spread of virus can be prevented by:\n- Washing hands often with soap and water.\n- Covering mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and putting used tissue in the trash can. If no tissue is available, a person can cough or sneeze into the upper sleeve or elbow, not the hands.\n- Avoiding sharing drinks or eating utensils.\n- Disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, such as toys, doorknobs, tables, counters.\n\nAfter the introduction of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, mumps became less common in the United States, KDHE reports. MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease.\n\nSome people who receive 2 doses of MMR can still get mumps, especially when they have prolonged, close contact with someone who has the disease. If a vaccinated person does get mumps, he or she will likely have less severe illness than an unvaccinated person. Therefore the best way to reduce the chance of getting the disease is by being vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Kessinger]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A Healthmap of Kansas, United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/219]\n\n******\n[6] USA (Washington, Seattle)\nDate: Thu 23 Mar 2017 7:18 pm\nSource: Seattle Times [edited]\nhttp://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/mumps-outbreak-spreads-to-uw-greek-system/\n\n\nWashington's mumps outbreak, the worst this decade, has spread to the fraternities and sororities at the University of Washington.\n\nThose cases were concentrated in the Greek system, according to an email from the UW Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases, and 'we anticipate the number of cases among UW students will increase more broadly as the outbreak continues in King County and across Washington state.'\n\nThe UW advised those infected, or with symptoms, to stay home.\n\nStatewide, 664 cases of mumps have been reported since October [2016], according to the state Department of Health (DOH).

Since then, there have been nearly 3000 cases of the disease across 33 counties in the state.\n\nAs a public health practitioner, I wondered: Why did this outbreak take off?\n\nMy team at HealthMap, a computational epidemiology lab based out of Boston Children's Hospital, began by rounding up as much data as we could.\n\nWe quickly discovered that the Arkansas Department of Health was releasing semi-regular PDF reports on the outbreak. The reports broke down cases by county, age and school district (many of the people who have contracted mumps in the Arkansas outbreak are children). But there were no historical archives that could give us a sense of how the outbreak had grown over time.\n\nSo we turned to a tool called the HealthMap Digital Surveillance System, which collects social media reports and news about public health issues around the world and turns them into usable epidemiological data. (For example, this blog previously reported on how we used our surveillance system to collect Google search and participatory public health data to track and predict flu outbreaks.)\n\nFrom the HealthMap data about the mumps outbreak, we were able to estimate the total number of cases that had occurred since August 2016.\n\nAt that point, we had all the information we needed to tackle a more difficult question: What could the data tell us about vaccination in communities affected by the outbreak?\n\nBefore we get to our answer to that question, let's talk about mumps.\n\nMumps, like measles and rubella, is extremely contagious. Because of this, the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine is given in 2 doses. Even with both doses, the vaccine is imperfect. One out of every 10 individuals who receives it remains susceptible to the mumps virus. In the event of a mumps outbreak, some people who get sick will be people who were vaccinated; how many depends on what percentage of the people in the affected community are vaccinated.\n\nFor a disease as contagious as mumps, a two-dose community-level vaccination rate as high as 96 percent may be necessary to prevent active transmission of the virus, maintaining so-called herd immunity. When the vaccination rate drops, herd immunity breaks down and outbreaks can take off.\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Health doesn't generally report high-resolution vaccination statistics to the public. But it has been collecting self-reported data on vaccination from individuals who were diagnosed with mumps during this particular outbreak. In the department's latest report, an average of about 70 percent of people who got mumps said they had received both doses of the mumps vaccine.\n\nHowever, studies have shown that self-reported vaccination rates are typically 1.5 to 2 times greater than actual vaccination rates. This means that the true two-dose vaccination rate among mumps cases in Arkansas was probably closer to 35 percent to 46 percent.\n\nBut what about vaccination rates in the larger communities that these cases came from?\n\nAfter pairing our surveillance data with mathematical modeling methods, we estimated that the average two-dose vaccination rate in communities affected by the outbreak was likely no higher than 89 percent and may have been as low as 70 percent, well below that ideal rate of 96 percent.\n\nOur complete methodology can be found in a study published [Thu 23 Mar 2017] in The Lancet Infectious Diseases (see reference below).\n\nAs vaccine hesitancy gains ground in the United States, we place ourselves at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, mumps and rubella. While these childhood illnesses aren't fatal to most people, those who are most susceptible to serious adverse effects, such as children under the age of 1 and cancer patients, are often those who can't be vaccinated.\n\nAnd this is why herd immunity is so important. When we vaccinate, we protect not only ourselves but the most vulnerable members of our communities, too.\n\n[Byline: Maimuna Majumder]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See Majumder MS, Nguyen CM, Cohn EL et al.

In addition to staying isolated when a person has mumps, the spread of virus can be prevented by:\n- Washing hands often with soap and water. A total of 3 confirmed cases of the mumps have been reported in Waterloo Region (Ontario province) so far this year [2017], mirroring a widespread bump in the virus's activity. At Barrington High, the number of confirmed mumps cases increased to 6, and Superintendent Brian Harris said it could eventually go to as high as 10. The reports broke down cases by county, age and school district (many of the people who have contracted mumps in the Arkansas outbreak are children). \n\nMumps outbreaks have been documented in several Kansas counties this winter. http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/mumps-outbreak-in-toronto-grows-to-62-cases-1.3338044\n\n\nAn outbreak of the mumps is continuing to spread in the city of Toronto as the number of confirmed cases has grown to 62. \n\nKDHE 'has not identified all of the sources of these mumps infections,' the letter says.

This means that the true two-dose vaccination rate among mumps cases in Arkansas was probably closer to 35 percent to 46 percent. \n\n'You can be contagious but not show any symptoms,' said Chuck Ferguson, spokesperson for the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health. For a disease as contagious as mumps, a two-dose community-level vaccination rate as high as 96 percent may be necessary to prevent active transmission of the virus, maintaining so-called herd immunity. He said the department is watching to see if anyone in contact with the current cases develops mumps to know if it's spreading in the community and who is at risk. In a news release issued [Thu 23 Mar 2017], Toronto Public Health said that most of the cases are among people between the ages of 18 and 35 years old. \n\nSymptoms for the virus include fever, swelling of one or more salivary glands, loss of appetite, tiredness, and headache. \n\n'I do believe our school community has responded appropriately and diligently in all regards,' Harris said.

In 2016, more than 5000 people across the country reported mumps, she said. From 1 Jan through 25 Feb 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an additional 1077 cases.\n\nIn Kansas, there have been 56 cases reported in 12 counties, Delfs said.\n\nMumps has been most common on college campuses, where the disease is easily spread through coughing, sneezing and talking, said Gianfranco Pezzino, the county's health officer. Lawrence has reported 14 cases, according to statistics shared during the Thu 16 Mar 2017 meeting. Pittsburg reported 8 cases, while Manhattan had 3.\n\nWith few exceptions, including those for religious beliefs, most children are required to have at least 2 doses of the mumps vaccine before kindergarten. A 2-dose regiment is successful at preventing the disease about 88 percent of the time, but Pezzino said it is likely the vaccine begins to wear off by young adulthood.\n\nBefore the mumps vaccination program began in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher because of underreporting, according to the CDC.

As of Wed [15 Mar 2017], there have been 12 cases of mumps reported by the LDH Office of Public Health.\n\n'There has been a large outbreak of mumps cases in Arkansas, and we're starting to see cases in Louisiana now,' said Dr. Frank Welch, medical director of the state Immunization Program, Louisiana Department of Health.\n\nThe 1st cluster of cases has been identified at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. The university is taking extra precautions to prevent the spread among students and faculty. The Louisiana Department of Health has shared health alerts and education to remind health care providers, schools and universities about the signs and symptoms of mumps.\n\n'Our Louisiana culture is rich with festivals and celebrations including many scheduled for St. Patrick's Day this weekend. Large gatherings create an environment where germs and contagious illnesses spread easily,' said Dr. Jimmy Guidry, State Health Officer, LDH. 'This is a great time to remind everyone to take proper precautions to avoid getting sick.'\n\nThe Louisiana Department of Health offers these reminders to avoid the spread of infection:\n- Do not share drinks, utensils, or food.\n- Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.\n- Clean surfaces that are frequently touched (such as toys, doorknobs, tables, counters, etc.) with soap and water or with cleaning wipes regularly.\n- Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand cleaner.\n- If you have symptoms, stay at home for 5 days after symptoms begin; avoid school, work or large group settings.\n\nSymptoms of mumps include:\n- Fever\n- Headache\n- Muscle aches\n- Tiredness\n- Loss of appetite\n- Swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides\n\nDr. Welch added that a person who has the mumps virus may not know they are ill because it can take several weeks after the infection until the symptoms occur.\n\n'The infectious period is the time during which an infected person can spread the disease to others. People are most infectious from 1-2 days before onset of symptoms until 5 days after they notice inflammation of their salivary glands,' Welch added. 'It is for this reason that we advise these safe sharing precautions, especially at a time when people gather in large groups.'\n\nVisit http://www.ldh.la.gov/mumps for more information about mumps for more information.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Pennsylvania\nDate: Thu 16 Mar 2017\nSource: The Inquirer Daily News [edited]\nhttp://www.philly.com/philly/health/Do-Penn-State-mumps-cases-mean-college-students-need-more-shots-cdc-acip.html\n\n\nAs Pennsylvania State University copes with an ongoing outbreak of mumps, infectious-disease experts are investigating why vaccinated young people are getting sick and whether a booster shot would help.\n\n'We didn't see outbreaks like this 10 years ago,' said Kelly L. Moore, director of the Tennessee Immunization Project and chair of the mumps work group for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Its vaccination recommendations become official policy for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when approved by the CDC director.\n\nThe government already recommends 2 shots, given at 12 to 15 months and just before entering school. The 2nd shot was added in 1989.\n\nIn recent outbreaks, public health authorities have suggested a 3rd dose for people in affected communities. Penn State recently began suggesting shots for several hundred students it deemed at high risk for mumps exposure.\n\nPenn State had its 1st case on 29 Jan 2017 and had 36 probable or confirmed cases on 3 Mar 2017, just before students headed out for spring break.\n\nThe total is now 45, said Shelley Haffner, infectious-disease manager at Penn State's student health center. She said the school would have a vaccination clinic on Thu [16 Mar 2017]. Students will be expected to submit the cost of the vaccine, which the school is still working out, to their insurance companies. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine usually costs about USD 150, she said.\n\nAll but one of the students with mumps symptoms has had at least one dose of the vaccine, Haffner said. The 1st student to become ill was fully vaccinated. Students are supposed to have 2 doses before entering the university, but some may not have had them at the correct age, she said.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Health said Wed [15 Mar 2017] that it was not aware of mumps cases at any other Pennsylvania colleges.\n\nExperts in 2012 decided that the evidence for a 3rd shot was 'inconclusive,' Moore said. Now, because of multiple outbreaks of mumps over the last 2 years, the CDC and ACIP are studying the issue again. A recommendation is expected next year [2018], she said.\n\nHer group had its 1st meeting last month [February 2017], so it doesn't have answers yet, but it will investigate a lot of questions. Those include whether and how much the vaccine's effectiveness wanes over time and whether a 3rd dose could help prevent or shorten outbreaks. Another question is whether the vaccine's formula, which has been based on the same strain of virus since it was introduced in 1967, needs tweaking. Most of the current cases involve a different strain of mumps.\n\nOutbreaks since 2006 have occurred in well-vaccinated groups, including college and high school students.\n\nBefore the mumps vaccine was developed, there were about 186 000 cases a year in the United States. Not all were reported then, so the CDC said the actual numbers were likely much higher. Since then, there have been many years when only a couple of hundred cases were reported.\n\nBut there was a spike in cases in 2006, mainly among college students in the Midwest. That year, 6500 people got sick.\n\nThere was another spike last year [2016], with more than 5000 cases reported. As of the end of February 2017, 1077 cases had been reported this year [2017].\n\nTrish Perl, an infectious-disease doctor at the University of Texas who is on the board of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said there was some evidence that the vaccine becomes less effective over time.\n\n'That is probably contributing to the outbreaks we've been seeing,' said Kristen Feemster, director of research for the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nGiving 3rd doses during outbreaks is becoming more common, but it's not clear how effective that is. 'Mumps is really a pretty infectious disease,' and it takes 2 weeks after a shot for increased immunity to kick in, Perl said.\n\nEffectiveness of the vaccine is estimated at 77 percent after one dose and 88 percent after 2.\n\nPeople infected with the virus can spread it for 2-3 days before they have symptoms and 5 days after. The incubation period is long -- 16 to 18 days -- and some infected patients never have symptoms.\n\nOutbreaks in the last decade have mainly been among vaccinated people who belong to groups with frequent, close contact. 'The other thing that plays a role,' Moore said, 'is how intense and prolonged is your exposure to the virus.' College students, who live and go to class in groups and may exchange saliva through kissing and sharing of drinks, are prime candidates for exposure. The disease largely has not spread to wider communities.\n\nIn most people, mumps causes relatively mild symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and lack of appetite. The classic symptom is swelling and tenderness of the glands just below or in front of the ear or jaw.\n\nMumps can occasionally cause more severe complications, including inflammation of the testicles, brain, tissues covering the brain and ovaries as well as deafness.\n\nPerl and Moore both pointed out that vaccinated mumps victims have far fewer complications than those who have not gotten the shots. Haffner said that only one Penn State student has had a mumps complication and that did not require hospitalization.\n\nBefore vaccination, 12 percent to 50 percent of male mumps victims got testicular inflammation, Perl said. Three percent to 10 percent of boys and men who have been vaccinated get it. The percentage who suffered hearing loss has fallen from 4 percent to one percent or less, according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a CDC publication. The percentage needing hospitalization fell from 5.5 percent to 1-2 percent.\n\n'The cases that we're seeing now have far lower complication rates,' Moore said.

Moore, director of the Tennessee Immunization Project and chair of the mumps work group for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). \n\nBefore the mumps vaccine was developed, there were about 186 000 cases a year in the United States. \n\nTrish Perl, an infectious-disease doctor at the University of Texas who is on the board of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said there was some evidence that the vaccine becomes less effective over time. \n\nThe Louisiana Department of Health offers these reminders to avoid the spread of infection:\n- Do not share drinks, utensils, or food. \n\nPeople infected with the virus can spread it for 2-3 days before they have symptoms and 5 days after. It is for this reason that we advise these safe sharing precautions, especially at a time when people gather in large groups.'\n\nVisit http://www.ldh.la.gov/mumps for more information about mumps for more information. \n\n'The cases that we're seeing now have far lower complication rates,' Moore said.

Public health deputy director Harriette Carr said there had been 39 'confirmed and probable cases'' of mumps reported in New Zealand, between 1 Sep 2016 and 1 Mar 2017. The number was up to 3 times higher than for the corresponding periods in the previous 3 years.\n\nMost of the cases were reported from the Auckland region (26 cases). Other affected district health board areas are Northland (3 cases), Lakes (3), Capital and Coast, Canterbury (2 each), Taranaki, Hutt Valley and West Coast (1 each). '16 of the cases were likely to have been acquired overseas,'' Dr Carr said.\n\nThe age range of affected persons is 2 to 34 years, with about half the cases occurring in school-aged children and half in young adults. 'Though spread has been limited at this stage, there is an increased risk of further outbreaks, particularly given the start of the year for schools and universities,' said Dr Carr.\n\nOtago Primary Principals' Association chairwoman and Musselburgh School principal Debbie Smith said schools were being cautious in light of the threat. 'I would make sure there's something in school newsletters so people can be aware of it. Principals should follow the Ministry of Health's lead, and I suggest that parents keep an eye out.' The Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education advised that the best prevention against the disease was immunisation with 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR), which is free.\n\nTaking action before a mumps outbreak could minimise the effect or spread of the illness, Dr Carr said. 'School and university staff, educators, students and parents can help prevent mumps spreading in the community by making sure that their immunisations and their children's immunisations are up to date. If they are unsure, encourage them to check with their family doctor. Anybody not fully vaccinated with MMR for their age must get vaccinated, that is, all school-age and older students must have had 2 doses of MMR,' she said.\n\n- Mumps is a disease notifiable to the local medical health officer.\n\n- Symptoms include sore and swollen areas under the jaw/around the face, usually accompanied or preceded by fever, muscle soreness, poor appetite, fatigue and headache.\n\n- If a person develops symptoms of mumps, isolate them from others.\n\n- Susceptible people include those born after 1981 who have not had a mumps infection or have not been fully vaccinated.\n\n- People with mumps, and those who have been exposed to mumps, should not attend education or workplaces or mix with other susceptible people while they are infectious.\n\n- A person can be infectious for 7 days before the swelling of the salivary gland(s), and for 5 days after the swelling has gone down.\n\n- Complications include orchitis (inflammation of the testicles) in adult males; oophoritis (inflammation of the ovaries and/or breast tissue [mastitis]) in adult females; inflammation of the brain (encephalitis); inflammation of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis); and deafness.\n\n- Following a case of mumps, the local medical officer of health will make the decision on the exclusion from educational facilities of susceptible children or adults exposed to the case.\n\n[byline: John Lewis]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap of New Zealand can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] USA [Oklahoma (Tulsa)]\nDate: 8 Mar 2017\nSource: Fox 23 News [edited]\nhttp://www.fox23.com/news/tulsa-health-department-investigates-local-outbreak-of-mumps/500878702\n\n\nThe Tulsa Health Department (THD) is currently investigating an outbreak of mumps in Tulsa County.

It is a vaccine-preventable disease that without vaccination is a very contagious disease that is most serious for babies. People with whooping cough usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others. Parents, older siblings, or other caregivers can give whooping cough to babies without even knowing they have the disease.\n\nYoung babies can get pneumonia (lung infection), and many have trouble breathing. About half of babies younger than one year old who get whooping cough end up in the hospital, and a few even die from the disease.\n\nBabies need protection because they can catch whooping cough from anyone around them, and it can make them very sick.

The mumps component of the MMR vaccine is about 88 percent effective when a person gets 2 doses. More than 5000 cases of mumps were reported last year, 2016, in the United States, of which 19 outbreaks occurred on college campuses. This is the most in a decade. But importantly, even with infection with the mumps virus, those who have been vaccinated have fewer severe complications. A 3rd vaccine dose is being considered as a preventative measure. There is some evidence that this additional dose may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[5] Comment in response to RFI in ProMED-mail posts Mumps update (05) & (06)\nDate: Sun 5 Mar 2017\nFrom: Kamran Kadkhoda <kamrankadkhoda@gmail.com> [edited]\n\n\n[Dr. Kadkhoda is responding to the RFI concerning the high incidence of mumps in previously vaccinated individuals, particularly young adults.

It'll be intriguing to see whether sub-neutralizing anti-mumps antibody levels help a new infection establish itself through antibody-dependent enhancement. It is also known that some HLA haplotypes play a role even in primary vaccine failure.

'I just hope it doesn't reach us. I feel for the guys that have it. Just want to make sure that it gets as contained as we can this time.'\n\nThe latest outbreak began in Vancouver, where the Canucks announced last weekend [25-26 Feb 2017] defenceman Troy Stecher had been diagnosed while 6 other players and a trainer were showing symptoms. On [Mon 27 Feb 2017], the Minnesota Wild announced forwards Zach Parise and Jason Pominville and assistant coach Scott Stevens were diagnosed with the highly contagious disease and must miss at least 3 games.\n\nThe developments raised concern after what occurred during the 1st half of the 2014-15 season: 24 players, including Pittsburgh star Sidney Crosby, representing 5 teams and 2 on-ice officials either showed symptoms or were diagnosed with the mumps.\n\nThe Wild were also affected in 2014, when 5 defensemen contracted the virus.\n'I don't know what to say to that. It's a lot for one team in a few years,' said Wild forward Mikael Granlund, whose brother, Markus Granlund, was among the Vancouver players showing symptoms.\n\nThere was enough worry in Minnesota that center Eric Staal wondered of the potential danger of players rubbing gloves against teammates' faces during the celebration following a 5-4 overtime win against Los Angeles on [Mon 27 Feb 2017] night. 'If someone had it in that pile, then we all got it,' Staal said. 'So we'll see what happens.'\n\nWild doctors recently provided players and staff with measles-mumps-rubella vaccination, as they did in 2014. The Wild equipment staff also uses a chemical spray on locker room cubicles each time players come off the ice. And Minnesota is one of 27 NHL teams using a Sani Sport machine to disinfect players' equipment.\n\nIn Vancouver, public health officials have yet to determine where or how Canucks players contracted mumps, Vancouver Coastal Health spokesman Gavin Wilson said. Wilson added the Vancouver region is not showing any signs of a spike in the mumps virus, unlike neighboring Washington State, which had a reported 503 cases already in 2017, as opposed to just 48 last year [2016].\n\nThere have been other pockets of outbreaks across the continent this year [2017], including the University of Missouri, which reported more than 320 confirmed and probably cases earlier this month [February 2017].\n\nFrom [1-28 Jan 2017], the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said there have been 485 mumps infections reported in the United States, which already surpasses the 229 cases reported in 2012. Since 2000, there have been only 2 years -- 2006 and 2016 -- in which the number of mumps cases have topped 3000.\n\nMumps can be spread by saliva or mucus. The virus has a 12 - to 30 - day incubation period. Its typical symptoms are fever, headache, muscle aches and loss of appetite, followed by swollen salivary glands.\n\nThe CDC notes that while mumps are 'no longer very common' in the U.S., outbreaks do occur particularly in places where people have had prolonged close contact with a person with the virus, such as school, dorms or sports teams.\n\nIn an e-mail to The Associated Press, NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly wrote it's unclear what prompted the recurrence. As for how the league is attempting to contain the latest outbreak, Daly wrote: 'Education, reinforcement of precautions and booster shots, where necessary.'\n\nThough booster shots work, they are only considered effective 88 percent of the time.\n\nIn Buffalo [NY], Sabres equipment manager Dave Williams said a protocol is put into place the moment a player shows any sign of sickness, even when involving what appears to be the common cold. The protocols include having players drink from their own water bottles, using hospital-strength disinfectant laundry detergent to wash the player's uniform separately.\n\nThe 1st professional hockey-related case of mumps this year [2017] occurred last month [January 2017], when 3 members of the New Jersey Devils' AHL affiliate in Albany, New York, contracted the virus.\n\nNashville Predators defenseman P.K. Subban said there's very little players can do to avoid getting mumps other than taking precautions. 'Professional sports is where all teams intertwine. We all touch every rink,' said Subban, noting the Predators played both the Wild and Canucks over the past 3 weeks. 'We've just been told to make sure our shots are up to date and wash our hands. That's it.

ADPH is investigating these notifiable disease cases and working closely with UA to contact potentially exposed people.\n\nWhile UA has a highly vaccinated population of students, mumps can still occur in vaccinated communities, particularly in close-contact settings such as schools, colleges and camps. However, high vaccination coverage helps to limit the size, duration and spread of mumps.\n\nDuring this investigation, ADPH recommends that UA students, faculty and staff not vaccinated with two doses of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR), immediately receive a second MMR at Student Health Center, their doctor, or health department. ADPH strongly recommends students who do not have any record of MMR and decline to be vaccinated should not attend class for 25 days after exposure to mumps.\n\nIn 2016, Alabama reported only one case of mumps.\n\nOut of an abundance of caution, ADPH and UA have begun notifying the campus community about mumps, prevention tips, and vaccinations.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\npromed@promedmail.org\n\n[This is not a publicly available report at this time.\n\nA map of the United States showing the location of Arkansas, California, and Pennsylvania is available at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] California (Orange County)\nDate: Sat 25 Feb 2017\nSource: Orange County Register [edited]\nhttp://www.ocregister.com/articles/mumps-744955-students-symptoms.html\n\n\nFour Chapman law students sickened in mumps outbreak\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nFour students who attended Chapman Law School's back-to-school event in late January [2017] have been diagnosed with mumps, and more could have been exposed to the virus, county health officials said Fri [24 Feb 2017].\n\nOne case has been confirmed through testing and there are 3 probable cases, said Dr. Matthew Zahn, medical director of epidemiology and assessment at the Orange County Health Care Agency.\n\nThe 3 students were exposed as part of the same social group and are experiencing mumps symptoms, Zahn said.\n\nThe health agency has supplied vaccines to Chapman University. He said they will be administered through the campus clinic to students who were exposed.\n\nStudents were exposed to the virus 27 Jan at Rudy's Pub & Grill in Newport Beach, according to a Chapman University health alert issued Friday. University officials are encouraging students who attended the event and who may have been exposed to remain vigilant and get medical care if they experience symptoms.\n\nThe incubation period for the mumps virus is usually 12 to 25 days, which means it could take weeks for symptoms to develop, Zahn said. Mumps usually starts out with flu-like symptoms such as fever and muscle aches.\n\n'After a couple of days, you start to feel the classic symptoms of pain and swelling along the jaw line,' he said.\n\nThere is no treatment for mumps other than pain medication as it resolves on its own. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mumps spreads through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose or throat.\n\nAn infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing or talking; by sharing items such as cups or beverages; through intimate contact; or by touching surfaces with unwashed hands.\n\nOrange County sees about 10 cases of mumps annually, Zahn said.

One anonymous submitter stated that several cases have been noted in Kansas since Thanksgiving [November] 2016. Over Thanksgiving vacation, there was a party at The University of Kansas, Lawrence, with some University of Missouri students who came down with mumps while there. In addition, cases have been reported in high school wrestlers across Kansas, and in a Mother in Johnson County, KS infected by her child who attended school at the University of Missouri.\n\n[ProMED thanks the submitter for this information.]\n\nB. Dr. Dirk Haselow [Arkansas Department fo Health] submitted a response to the RFI:\nI noticed a quote from an interview that I gave some time ago included in the thread. An important omission is as follows. While we have seen a higher than expected rate of parotitis in persons who have had 2 doses of MMR vaccine, we have seen exceptionally low rates of severe manifestations among our 2820 cases. (0 meningitis, 0 encephalitis, 1 pancreatitis, 5 hospitalizations, and 17 orchitis) Lumped together, these severe manifestations have occurred at roughly 100 fold lower rates than expected if our population was unvaccinated. The vaccine, while not perfect, clearly is working well to prevent severe disease.\n\nWe are in the process of conducting a study with CDC to estimate effectiveness of a 2nd dose and (in some cases a 3rd dose booster) in our outbreak.\n\n--\nDirk Haselow, MD, PhD\nState Epidemiologist and Outbreak Response Medical Director\nArkansas Department of Health\n4815 W. Markham St., Slot 48\nLittle Rock, AR 72205\n(o) 501-537-8969\n(f) 501-661-2300\n\n[ProMED thanks Dr. Haselow for his important note. We have pointed out the lack of severe symptoms vaccinated individuals experience following infection with mumps in comments in the past, most recently in Mumps update (01): USA (WA,TX) Archive Number: 20170110.4753366 - 'Even though mumps cases occur even in fully vaccinated children and adults, the occurrence of the more severe complications is relatively rare now, evidence of some protection afforded by the vaccine.' Nonetheless, this is an important point to make frequently as it further supports the MMR vaccine's effectiveness even when full protection does not occur.\n\nOne paper among others that discusses the problem of genetic variation in the SH gene of mumps virus is Echevarr\u00eda JE et al. Mumps Virus Genotyping: Basis and Known Circulating Genotypes. The Open Vaccine Journal, 2010, 3, 37-41. Although the 12 genotypes of mumps virus currently recognized by the WHO are considered to be the same serotype, lack of full cross-protection between different genotypes has been reported and has been suggested as a cause of vaccine failure. However, other reports did not find this lack of cross reaction among different genotypes.\n\nJerryl-Lynn and Rubini vaccine strains belong to genotype A which is genetically distant from the other genotypes. Wild strains belonging to the A genotype used to be dominant before vaccination, but nowadays most MV wild strains belong to other genotypes. The genetic distance between genotype A vaccine strains and non-A wild strains has been proposed to be a determinant factor in vaccine failure. On the other hand, non-A vaccines have been more frequently associated with post vaccination meningitis and are considered less safe. Additional studies are needed to obtain a better balance between efficiency and safety in order to establish the best future strategy for achieving optimal vaccine efficacy. Data from neutralization experiments are still unclear.\n\nAlso, from Gouma S et al. 2016. Mumps-specific cross-neutralization by MMR vaccine-induced antibodies predicts protection against mumps virus infection.

The distribution of cases is shown in a map [in the URL above].\n\nKansas\n------\nMumps cases have been reported in multiple counties in Kansas. The Kansas Department of Health Environment (KDHE) and affected local health departments are working closely together to identify cases and implement appropriate isolation and exclusion policies to prevent further spread of mumps. Many cases have reported attendance to wrestling tournaments in Kansas, have associations to the University of Kansas or Kansas State University, or reported travel to other states that are also currently experiencing large mumps outbreaks.\n\nAs of 4 Mar 2017, there have been 56 cases reported. Crawford and Douglas Counties have recorded the most mumps with 13 and 11 cases, respectively. The map below by KDHE indicates counties with mumps cases.\n\nCases range from age 14 to 57 years with a median age of 20 years. Three patients reportedly had complications to mumps and one person required hospitalization for their illness. Of these reported cases, 44 (82%) were vaccinated, 6 (11%) were not vaccinated, 4 (7%) with unknown vaccination history and 2 cases with vaccination history not yet assessed.\n\nCalifornia\n---------\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) is investigating 2 clusters of mumps cases occurring in adult men in Los Angeles County. As of 9 Mar 2017, there have been 5 confirmed and 2 likely cases of mumps reported in adult men; the majority have been in HIV uninfected men who have sex with men. Contact investigations are ongoing.\n\nThe health department advises health care providers to consider the diagnosis of mumps among patients presenting with parotitis, other salivary gland swelling, and/or orchitis, even if patients have been vaccinated.\n\nMissouri\n-------\nThe Southeast Missouri State University continues to receive reports of students presenting to their health care provider or the Campus Health Clinic with symptoms of mumps. As of 9 Mar 2017, the University has received 36 confirmed reports of Southeast students infected with mumps (up from 15 cases reported a week ago).\n\nA majority of the confirmed cases are generally among students who are members of the university's Greek student community, specifically the fraternity community. Additionally, the campus has suspected cases of mumps from students who are symptomatic, and these students are currently self-quarantined while their test results are evaluated by the State of Missouri. All confirmed cases are shared with the Cape Girardeau County Public Health Center, and the campus has been working with both local and State of Missouri public health agencies in response to the confirmed and suspected cases.\n\nOklahoma\n---------\nThe Tulsa Health Department (THD) is currently investigating an outbreak of mumps in Tulsa County. There have been 8 cases identified, 5 of which have been laboratory confirmed. One of the confirmed cases is a student at the 7th Grade Center at Owasso Public Schools.\n\nTHD health officials are following standard disease investigation and response protocols which include working with individuals who have potentially been exposed through close contact with the confirmed and probable cases. THD is working closely with the Owasso Public Schools administration to ensure that students, parents and teachers who may have been exposed are notified and receive guidance on what precautions they may need to take.\n\nPersons who may have been exposed should have their immunization status evaluated, watch for signs and symptoms, and seek medical attention as soon as symptoms suggestive of mumps begin. Additionally, THD officials are notifying area clinics and hospitals to provide clinical guidance to health care providers.\n\nTexas\n-----\nDallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) is reporting 39 mumps cases in Dallas County for 2017. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends reporting all probable and confirmed cases of mumps when an outbreak occurs.\n\nDCHHS has identified 30 associated mumps cases between students and teachers in Cedar Hill High School. Not all cases are Dallas County residents. DCHHS has a separate total of 9 additional unrelated mumps cases in the city of Mesquite and Dallas.\n\nFor medical confidentiality and personal privacy reasons, DCHHS does not provide additional identifying information. DCHHS health officials are urging immunization to protect against and prevent the spread of mumps. People who have had 2 mumps vaccinations (such as 2 MMR vaccines) are usually considered immune from mumps. A 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine is only recommended by the CDC when an individual is associated with an ongoing outbreak.\n\nLouisiana\n--------\nThe Louisiana State University Student Health Center, working with the Louisiana Department of Health, has confirmed several student cases of the mumps.\n\nStudents with swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears or jaw on one or both sides of the face are advised to seek care at the Student Health Center or with their primary care provider as soon as possible.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap of the US may be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Louisiana, Louisiana State University)\nDate: Fri 10 Mar 2017\nSource: WAFB [edited]\nhttp://www.wafb.com/story/34727336/several-cases-of-mumps-confirmed-at-lsu\n\n\nThe LSU Student Health Center, along with the Louisiana Department of Health, have confirmed several cases of the mumps among the students.\n\nSince mumps is a contagious disease, the university is providing information to protect its students, faculty, and staff.\n\nThe school says students with swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears or jaw on one or both sides of the face should seek medical care at the Student Health Center or with their primary care physician as soon as possible.\n\nStudents exhibiting symptoms of mumps should be isolated for at least 5 days from the onset of salivary gland swelling. There is no specific treatment for mumps, however most people who contract the illness fully recover. Mumps can occasionally cause complications, some of them serious. Infected persons are typically contagious from 3 days before until up to 9 days after the onset of symptoms.\n\nMumps is spread by contact with infectious respiratory tract secretions and saliva. To help prevent transmission of the illness, people [who are infected] should follow these tips:\n- Practice good hand washing.\n- Do not eat or drink around others.\n- Cover nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.\n\nReceiving 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to prevent mumps. Proof of immunity to mumps or proof of 2 doses of the vaccine is required for all LSU students. However, the vaccine is not 100 percent effective, and the infection can occur even in vaccinated students [But serious complications rarely occur in vaccinated individuals. - Mod.LK].\n\n[Byline: Rachael Thomas]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] USA (Pennsylvania; Penn State University)\nDate: Mon 13 Mar 2017\nSource: Centre Daily [edited]\nhttp://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/penn-state/article138349188.html\n\n\nOn Mon [13 Mar 2017], Penn State University released new numbers putting what was just 2 cases [of mumps], 1st reported as of 29 Jan 2017, at 38 probable patients.

So far, 49 different schools in 17 school districts, 3 colleges or vocational schools and 3 private schools have been affected by the mumps.\n\nArkansas currently leads the nation with more than 2000 mumps cases. The majority of these cases are among schoolchildren, the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) says.\n\nThe ADH is also looking into 2 unconfirmed cases of the mumps involving students at Arkansas Tech in Russellville.\n\nMumps is spread from an infected person through coughing, sneezing, or contact with saliva. Mumps is a viral infection that causes one or more salivary glands (located in the cheeks, below and in front of the ears) to become inflamed, swollen, and tender. Other symptoms include fever, fatigue, headaches, swelling or tenderness in the neck/jaw area, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, rash, and flu-like symptoms.\n\nThe best way to prevent mumps is through vaccination. The mumps vaccination is given in combination as MMR or MMRV with measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. Most students have received 1-2 MMR vaccinations. If you haven't received a vaccination for mumps, the MMR is available in the Health and Wellness Center. Keeping hands clean, coughing or sneezing into a tissue or your elbow, and refraining from sharing drinking or eating utensils are also important steps in preventing the spread of the illness.\n\n[Byline: Ellen Lampe]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the past several years, increasing numbers of college students and others have started getting mumps in spite of an effective vaccine, and 2016 marks the biggest spike in a decade. Seven states (Arkansas, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Oklahoma) have each reported more than 100 cases this year [2017]. [As of 31 Dec 2016, 46 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. reported mumps infections in 5311 people to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Eight states have reported more than 100 cases this year [2017]: AR, IA, IN, IL, MA, NY, OK, and TX (data from CDC), with about half occurring in Arkansas in a variety of schools, workplaces and colleges. By comparison, in 2010, there were 2612 cases reported to the U.S. CDC, and in 2012, there were 229.\n\nMost mumps patients said they had received their 2 recommended doses of the combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to the CDC. In Arkansas, the state with the largest outbreak, around 70 percent of the mumps patients self-reported that they were fully vaccinated against mumps, according to the CDC.\n\nSo what's behind the comeback? One factor may be that the vaccine's effectiveness appears to wane over 10 or 15 years, says William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Exactly why this year [2017] has been such a large problem, however, climbing to more than 4000 cases, remains a mystery. 'That has all of us puzzled,' Schaffner says. Vaccination coverage rates in the worst-affected states of Arkansas, Illinois and Iowa are generally high. All have 2-dose coverage rates of around 90 percent or better, according to the CDC.\n\nJanell Routh, a medical officer in the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases, says this year's [2017] sudden increase may simply be cyclical. 'We know generally that mumps cases wax and wane over the years. This year, in particular, we know the spike was driven by 3 large outbreaks,' she says.\n\nScientists agree that mumps outbreaks often occur in crowded environments where people may come into contact with one another's saliva or mucus via things like sharing food or drinks, or kissing. 'The virus is always out there,' says Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. 'The most likely reason for these outbreaks is that vaccine immunity is fading,' he says. Routh says the agency still does not have strong enough evidence to answer that type of question. 'We don't know the level of antibody required to stop a case of mumps in a person, so that question of knowing whether the vaccine works less well over time is something we're still working to investigate,' she says.\n\nOther theories to explain the spike do not check out either, according to the CDC. It does not appear that the virus has mutated in a way that would make vaccines less effective against it, Routh says, noting that the main genotype of the virus in the U.S. has remained the same over the past decade. There is also no evidence the virus is being imported by unwitting travelers or students, Routh adds. 'We know the mumps vaccine is only 88 percent effective after 2 doses, so that means a certain portion of vaccinated people are still vulnerable,' she says, which underscores the possibility the cases could be home-grown. Also, the fact that about 30 percent of mumps cases are asymptomatic makes it difficult to trace outbreaks to one particular person, she says.\n\nThis winter [2016-2017], the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will consider whether or not to recommend a 3rd dose of the vaccine, Routh says. Her agency's guidelines already include administering a 3rd dose of the vaccine during an outbreak. So far, the effectiveness of this has not been established, but the CDC says it is working with college campuses that have had outbreaks in the past to assess the effectiveness of their emergency 3rd-dose campaigns. For now, Schaffner says, parents should check with their pediatricians to make sure their children are up to date on immunizations, and, if they are unsure, they should get their child a 3rd MMR vaccination.\n\n(Excerpted and edited from DF Maron.

In Arkansas, the state with the largest outbreak, around 70 percent of the mumps patients self-reported that they were fully vaccinated against mumps, according to the CDC. Also, the fact that about 30 percent of mumps cases are asymptomatic makes it difficult to trace outbreaks to one particular person, she says.

The mumps vaccination is given in combination as MMR or MMRV with measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. The Arkansas mumps outbreak continues to spread as 2 more school districts have announced cases. So far, the effectiveness of this has not been established, but the CDC says it is working with college campuses that have had outbreaks in the past to assess the effectiveness of their emergency 3rd-dose campaigns. \n\nThe best way to prevent mumps is through vaccination.

It is usually rare in the United States because most people have received immunizations to protect them against mumps. People born before 1957 are probably immune to mumps because most people had the disease before the immunizations were routinely given starting in the early 1970s.\n\nMumps is spread by close face-to-face contact with a person who has the infection.\n\nMumps is best known for the puffy cheeks and swollen jaw that it causes. This is a result of swollen salivary glands.\nThe most common symptoms include:\n- Fever\n- Headache\n- Muscle Aches\n- Tiredness\n- Loss of Appetite\n- Swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one of both sides (parotitis).\n\nSymptoms usually appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection. Some people who get mumps have very mild or no symptoms, and often they do not know they have the disease.\n\nA person with mumps should avoid prolonged, close contact with other people until at least 5 days after the start of the swollen glands because the person is contagious during this time. People who have mumps should not go to work or school, and stay home while they are contagious (5 days after the onset of gland swelling).\n\nThe MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. People who have received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine are about 9 times less likely to get mumps than unvaccinated people who have the same exposure to mumps virus. However, some people who receive 2 doses of MMR can still get mumps, especially if they have prolonged, close contact with someone who has the disease, and it has been several years since they were vaccinated. If a vaccinated person does get mumps, they will likely have less severe illness than an unvaccinated person.\n\nBefore there was a vaccine, mumps was a common childhood disease in the United States. In some cases, the disease caused complications, such as permanent deafness in children and, occasionally, swelling of the brain (encephalitis), which in rare cases caused death. From year to year, the number of mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. In some years, there are more cases of mumps than usual because of outbreaks.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n2016-2017 Washington State Emerging Mumps Outbreak\n\n[According to preliminary data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of infectious mumps cases in the United States is at a 10-year high.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health is monitoring the situation.\n\nMumps is a highly infectious disease passed through saliva and respiratory secretions. Symptoms often include tender swollen glands below the ear or along the jawline on one or both sides of the face and neck, headache, fever and cold-like symptoms. People with mumps are considered infectious from 2 days before swelling begins through 5 days after the start of swelling. For most people, 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine provide adequate immunity to the infection.\n\nUniversity Health Services, a unit of Penn State Student Affairs, advises the following:\nAll students, faculty and staff should check with their health care providers to confirm receipt of 2 doses of the MMR vaccine after their 1st birthday. Anyone who does not have immunity to mumps either through receipt of the 2-dose MMR vaccine or a previous mumps infection, should schedule an appointment to receive the vaccine.\n\nAll students who have not already done so are advised to request a copy of their immunization information from their private healthcare provider to be faxed to University Health Services. During a mumps outbreak, anyone who does not have proof of vaccination may be excluded from campus until 25 days after the last possible date of infection.\n\nAvoid sharing food and drinks, engaging in drinking games, or other activities that may result in saliva exposure. In addition, frequent hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette are also helpful in preventing the spread of this and many other diseases.\n\nAlthough the 2-dose MMR series is highly effective for most people, it is important to remember that no vaccine is 100 percent effective for every person.

Mumps typically includes a fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite and swollen salivary glands.\n\nThe Springfield-Greene County Health Department has not yet declared a mumps 'outbreak' in the area, noting there is no evidence to suggest a 'person-to-person' spread locally.\n\nKendra Findley, administrator of community health and epidemiology, said all 5 of the cases have been linked to an outbreak in northwest Arkansas.\n\nA confirmed mumps case is fairly rare because most individuals have built up an immunity to the disease.\n\nThe vaccine has been around since the 1950s and includes 2 shots, the 1st when a child is a toddler and the 2nd toward the end of elementary school.\n\nThe first 3 Springfield students to test positive, the ones who belonged to the same family, had all taken the vaccine. It is not yet clear if the Carver or Westport students had taken the shots.\n\n'Most of the ones we've dealt with so far have been immunized,' Findley said.\n\nShe said the outbreak in northwest Arkansas involves a virus with a 'strain or genotype' that is a little different and has been contracted by individuals who have been vaccinated.\n\nThere is no known treatment for mumps but children typically recover fully in a few weeks. However, there can be serious consequences for adults who contract the disease. She said adults can develop swelling in the brain, ovaries or testicles. That can cause infertility and even death.\n\nIn the district's health alert, officials stated that if an outbreak is declared, students that have not yet been vaccinated for mumps may be 'excluded' or told to stay home for up to 26 days.\n\nThe district is required to track and report vaccine compliance. At this point, 98 percent of students have received the recommended vaccines based on their age. The other 2 percent have sought medical or religious exemptions.\n\nThe Springfield district, in collaboration with the Springfield-Greene County Health Department, urged families interested in obtaining the immunization to contact their health care provider.\n\n[Byline: Claudette Riley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The report states that all 5 cases have been linked to an outbreak in northwest Arkansas. The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) reported in November 2016 that in that outbreak, 90 to 95 percent of school-aged children and 30 to 40 percent of adults had been fully immunized.\n\nThis prompted health officials to look at the effectiveness of the mumps portion of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. According to state epidemiologist, Dirk Haselow, MD, PhD, the mumps strain seen in Arkansas is the most genetically distinct from the type used to make the vaccine. Haselow said the strain of the virus making the rounds may have evolved enough to surmount the vaccine, though he added that this hasn't yet been confirmed.

Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting.

Infants less than age 1 are less likely to be affected due to passive protection from maternal antibodies, if she [the mother] has adequate immunity,' Dr Holland said.\n\n'The mumps virus is highly contagious and transmitted via spread of respiratory droplets. Transmission is most common among those living or congregating in close quarters (that is, dormitories, grade schools, sports teammates). The average incubation period is between 16-18 days, but may range from 12-25 days.'\n\nTypical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and decreased appetite. These symptoms typically precede the classic symptom of swelling of the salivary glands by 3-5 days. Approximately 20 percent of people do not develop symptoms after infection, so awareness of possible exposure is very important.\n\n'It's important to practice good, frequent handwashing,' said Emily Carroll, director of the Navarro County Health Department. 'It's also important for people to check their immunization records. For more information, the Department of State Health Services website is http://www.dshs.texas.gov.\n\nDiagnostic testing is performed by obtaining a cheek swab for isolation of the virus (recommended) or viral antibody testing. Mumps may also be diagnosed by classic exam findings identified by your primary care provider. Treatment includes supportive care measures, including rest and OTC (over the counter) medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) for fevers and pain.\n\nAlthough most people who contract mumps make a full recovery, it is such a public health concern due to serious complications including meningitis, deafness, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and orchitis (inflammation of the testicles). Vaccination is highly recommended for prevention.\n\nSince the advent of the mumps vaccine, the number of mumps cases has decreased in the US by over 99 percent. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that children receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine between ages 12-15 months and 4-6 years. This vaccine also helps protect against measles and rubella, and 2 doses are 88 percent effective against the spread of the mumps virus. Even if your child has missed a dose, your primary care provider can administer the vaccine by 'catch-up' immunization schedules. Pregnant women should not receive the MMR vaccine. Adequate immunity against mumps is also important for those who travel internationally.\n\nIf you feel that you have these symptoms, contact your primary care provider prior to your appointment to ensure that proper control and safety measures are taken to prevent the spread of the disease to others.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.

Teams from 16 states participated in the event, and wrestlers from 4 states had direct contact with the case and will be notified separately. [A total of 600 individuals were potentially exposed].\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Health received notification from the Washington State Department of Health that a Washington resident who participated in The Clash tournament on 30-31 Dec 2016 was reported as a mumps case in their ongoing outbreak. Symptom onset was early January 2017, and the case was infectious during the wrestling tournament. Participants in the event included individuals from Washington, Minnesota, North Dakota, California, Georgia, Arizona, Illinois, Oregon, Florida, Missouri, Wisconsin, South Dakota, New England, Ohio, Alabama, and Utah. Four states, including Minnesota, Illinois, California, and Oregon had team members who were directly exposed to the case and will be notified individually.\n\nMumps can occur in persons with 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) with intense and repeated exposure. Precautions for mumps infection include making sure people are up to date with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, practicing good hand hygiene, and isolating symptomatic persons to avoid other exposures.\n\nWrestlers or other participants who develop parotitis or other mumps-compatible illness (e.g., orchitis, oophoritis) regardless of vaccine status, should follow-up with their health care provider, inform the provider that they may have been exposed to a mumps case, and take precautions against exposing others.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Washington\nDate: Wed 18 Jan 2017\nSource: Bonner County Daily Bee [edited]\nhttp://www.bonnercountydailybee.com/state_news/20170118/mumps_outbreak_threatens_area\n\n\nThere is a mumps outbreak in Spokane, and local health officials say it could be headed our way.\n\nSpokane had 56 cases of mumps as of Tue [17 Jan 2017] evening, and the number is expected to rise.\n\nMelanie Collett, spokeswoman for the Panhandle Health District, said there are no confirmed cases of mumps in North Idaho, but that will likely change, given the region's proximity to Spokane.\n\n'This is a very fluid situation, and we're working with local physicians to make sure any suspect cases are being reported and tested,' Collett said.\n\nMumps, a contagious disease caused by a virus, typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swollen salivary glands. Mumps is often transmitted by people who are in close contact with one another, such as those living in the same house or dorm. Mumps usually goes away on its own in about 10 days. But in some cases, it can cause complications that affect the brain, the testicles, the ovaries, or the pancreas.\n\nKootenai Health has been alerted the outbreak is nearby and has isolation policies that go into effect if an outbreak of a communicable disease does come into the region.\n\nKim Papich, public information officer for the Spokane Regional Health District, said there is some evidence the Spokane outbreak is linked to a mumps outbreak in Seattle which started in late November 2016 and is still continuing, with 130 cases plus more in 5 surrounding counties.\n\nOf the 56 cases in Spokane, 34 are people who previously received the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccination. Ten of the cases are people who were not vaccinated, and there are 12 cases in which the vaccination status is unknown.\n\n'This has quickly turned into a polarized discussion on vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, but we have so many cases that we're beyond that,' Papich said, noting that vaccinated individuals are 9 times less likely to get the mumps. 'We have about 400 000 vaccinated people in Spokane; only 27 of them are sick. If they weren't vaccinated, we'd have 400 000 people with the mumps.'\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2 doses of the vaccine are roughly 88 percent -- with a range of 66 to 95 percent -- effective at protecting against mumps. One dose is 49-92 percent effective.\n\nThe CDC also reports the last big outbreak of mumps in the U.S. was in 2006 when there were more than 6500 cases. Between 2011 and 2015, the national number of cases hovered between about 250 cases to 1500 cases. In 2016, however, the preliminary count was about 5500 cases, mostly concentrated in Iowa and Illinois at college campuses.\n\nThere are one or 2 cases of mumps in Idaho, but that's normal, and they're unlikely to be related to the Spokane outbreak, Papich said.\n\nCory Webster, infection prevention coordinator for Kootenai Health, said that other than vaccination, people can take steps to reduce the likelihood of getting any disease.\n\n'People can stay home from school or work if they're sick, wash hands, appropriately cover coughs, and avoid sharing drinks and eating utensils,' she said. 'Right now, we are educating our staff, patients and visitors.'\n\nWebster encouraged people who are ill to refrain from visiting loved ones at Kootenai Health, and to seek care for themselves.\n\nUltimately, vaccination is the best way to prevent mumps, according to both Panhandle and Spokane Regional health districts.\n\n[Byline: Bethany Blitz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Washington\nDate: Thu 26 Jan 2017\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/washington-mumps-outbreak-nears-300-cases-88245/\n\n\nThe mumps outbreak in Washington state is on the cusp of 300 confirmed and probable cases, as 291 have been reported in 5 counties through Wed [25 Jan 2017].\n\nThe breakdown stands at King County (163), Spokane County (90), Pierce County (34), Snohomish County (3) and Yakima County (1).\n\nIn King County, 63.2 percent of patients report being up to date on their measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Roughly the same percentage has been reported as fully vaccinated in Spokane County.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mumps is a viral illness that is transmitted by direct contact with respiratory droplets or saliva from an infected person. It is best known for painful, swollen salivary glands that show up as puffy cheeks and swollen jaw.\n\nBoys may also have painful, swollen testicles. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite.\n\nThere is no treatment, and symptoms usually resolve themselves within a few weeks. Mumps is usually a mild disease in children, but adults may have more serious disease with complications.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] Colorado\nDate: Fri 27 Jan 2017\nSource: The Denver Channel [edited]\nhttp://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/mumps-outbreak-investigated-as-14-diagnosed-in-colorado-11-in-denver-metro\n\n\nA large outbreak of the mumps across the nation could be rippling into Colorado, health officials warned Friday [27 Jan 2017], as 14 cases were diagnosed in January 2017 alone.\n\nColorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) officials launched a large investigation with the Tri-County Health Department and Denver Public Health after 11 patients in Denver and Aurora learned they were diagnosed with the viral infection. Three other patients were diagnosed but aren't believed to be part of the outbreak, which overall could be linked to other states, specifically Washington.\n\nA fact sheet has been disseminated to doctors and physicians in the area, urging them to consider patients who have salivary gland swelling for further testing.\n\nAs mumps cases often go undetected or untested, the outbreak in Colorado is 'likely' to grow, CDPHE officials said.\n\nEven those who are vaccinated are susceptible to mumps, as the vaccine is only roughly 88 percent effective, and effectiveness can wane after the vaccine has been administered.\n\nMumps is an infection spread by direct human-to-human contact through respiratory droplets or saliva. Average incubation periods range from 16 to 18 days on average but can be up to 12 to 25 days.\n\nSymptoms of the infection aren't limited to swelling of salivary and parotid glands across the cheek and jaw area; swelling can range from the frontal part of the ear and spread as fluid builds up. Other symptoms can at times include low-grade fevers, malaise, loss of appetite, headache and more, but not all who have mumps will exhibit symptoms.\n\nSevere complications from the infection are rare but can include sterility, spontaneous abortion, deafness, and more.\n\nThe risks associated with the infection have prompted health officials concerned about the thousands of current cases across the nation to ask parents to be on the lookout.\n\n'Because of the high numbers of mumps cases across the country, it is especially important to make sure your children are vaccinated,' Rachel Herlihy, director of the Disease Control and Environmental Epidemiology Division at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said.\n\n'Both adults and children should make sure they are up to date on their mumps vaccine.'\n\nIn Colorado, the CDPHE says that for children between 19 and 35 months old, 93.6 percent have one or more doses of the vaccine. For children between 13 and 17 years old, 92.3 percent have 2 or more doses of the vaccine.\n\n[Byline: Mark Belcher]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects the nationwide spike in mumps cases to continue into next month [February 2017].\n\nAccording to the CDC, mumps cases hit a 10-year high in late December 2016, with 5311 cases in the US.\n\nTwo of the largest outbreaks happened on university campuses in Iowa and Illinois; 220 cases were also reported at the University of Missouri by mid-December [2016].\n\nThe case count is lower than in 2006, when more than 6500 people were sickened.

The contagious infection has showed up in at least 7 Oklahoma counties. Even if you've had your MMR vaccine, that's Measles, Mumps, and Rubella --turns out you're not in the clear-- in fact you could be infected and not even know it. So far, 324 people have been diagnosed in Canadian, McClain, Osage, Tulsa, Woods, Kay, and Garfield counties. Nearly 300 of those cases have been reported in Garfield County alone, with the 1st one reported in July [2016].\n\nAnd the most unsettling part of the outbreak? Most of the patients had gotten the MMR vaccine, but its only 88 percent effective in preventing mumps.

'In the whole U.S. there's about 3600 and that's the highest numbers in a decade,' said Holderness.\n\nShe said if you're showing symptoms like fever, headache, body aches and muscle pains, and in some cases, extreme swelling of the jaw or throat, go to the doctor and then stay home. 'Stay out of the school settings and crowded environments 5 days after that swelling begins,' continued Holderness.\n\nHealth officials say it's important to diagnose people with mumps, that way they can go to those locations and find out where the outbreak started.

As students return home for winter break there is the potential that exposed students will develop mumps and present to local healthcare providers for evaluation.\n\nCurrently, the State Universities of New York (SUNY) at New Paltz and Geneseo are experiencing mumps outbreaks. Up to 61 individuals who have been diagnosed with mumps are epidemiologically linked to the SUNY New Paltz Campus outbreak and 16 cases of mumps have been diagnosed that are associated with SUNY Geneseo. Suspect cases are under investigation at both institutions. More cases are expected to occur.\n\nAll students at both SUNY New Paltz and SUNY Geneseo who have not received any mumps-containing vaccine are considered susceptible and have been excluded from campus at this time. Those students who have received only 1 dose of mumps-containing vaccine have been advised to receive a 2nd dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to complete the recommended 2-dose series.\n\nThe vast majority of cases have been immunized with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. The median age of case patients is 20 years. Symptoms include swelling of the salivary glands (parotid, sub-mandibular or sub-lingual), malaise, headache, myalgia, fever, anorexia and jaw pain. Patients have also reported sore throat, earache and upper respiratory symptoms prior to onset of parotitis.\n\nNYSDOH is requesting that all medical providers consider and test for mumps in patients with symptoms that are clinically consistent with mumps without an alternative diagnosis, regardless of a patient's vaccination status. Please refer to the NYSDOH Vaccine Preventable Disease Control Guidelines for more information at:\nhttp://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/immunization/providers/outbreak_control_guidelines.htm\n\nIn response to the outbreak of mumps at SUNY New Paltz, the NYSDOH, Ulster County Department of Health, and SUNY New Paltz have recommended that all SUNY New Paltz students receive a 3rd dose of MMR. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided guidance for use of a 3rd dose of MMR as a control measure to consider during mumps outbreaks in settings where people are in close contact with one another and when traditional control measures, including high 2-dose coverage have failed to slow the spread of disease. There is evidence suggesting that a 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine may boost immunity among students and help prevent further spread of mumps on campus. MMR vaccination clinics were held on campus 13 and 14 Dec [2016] for all students to provide a 3rd dose of vaccine, or 2nd dose for those who had not yet completed the recommended 2-dose series. Students from SUNY New Paltz who did not receive a 3rd dose of MMR during these vaccination clinics may choose to discuss the recommendation for a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine with their healthcare provider during winter break. A 3rd dose is not currently being recommended for students attending other colleges or universities in New York State, nor for the general public.

Mumps is contagious 3 days prior to and 4 days after the onset of symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of mumps usually appear after 14-18 days of infection. They usually include fever, headache, and swelling and tenderness of one or more of the salivary glands, usually the parotid gland (located just below the front of the ear at the angle of the jaw). In mild cases the swelling may only last for 3 days to 4 days, but it may go on even up to a week or more. Approximately one-third of infected people do not exhibit symptoms.

According to Tom Steele, breaking news producer at the Dallas News, the number of mumps cases in North Texas has surpassed 50 as an outbreak in Johnson County has grown and cases have been found in Dallas, Collin, Denton, and Tarrant counties.\n\nMost of the cases there are school-age children from Cleburne and Keene [in Johnson County]. Health officials have traced the virus to an outbreak in Arkansas, where several children from Keene had visited recently.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, mumps is no longer very common in the United States. From year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. In 2010, there were 2612 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229.\n\nBefore the United States mumps vaccination program began in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting.

A county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/texas-county-map.gif. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ\n\nMumps is caused by a virus from the genus _Rubulavirus_. As stated above, its symptoms include low-grade fever, respiratory problems, and most notably swelling of the parotid glands below the ear, known as parotitis. Although parotitis is the most easily recognized symptom of mumps, it occurs only in about 30-40 percent of cases. Other patients may have non-specific symptoms. Up to 20 percent of infected individuals may experience no symptoms at all. Symptoms typically occur 2-3 weeks after exposure to the virus.\n\nThe virus is spread by respiratory droplets. These can become airborne when an infected person coughs, sneezes, and talks. Additionally, a person can contract the virus by touching surfaces that are contaminated with infected droplets. Infected individuals are considered most contagious during a period starting several days before the appearance of parotitis (if it occurs), and running through the 5th day after it first appears. To keep a patient from spreading the virus to others, isolation is recommended for 5 days after parotitis begins.\n\nIn the United States, cases of mumps have dropped by 99 percent since the introduction of a vaccine in 1967, however, mumps has not yet been eliminated in the country. Recent large outbreaks have occurred among college students (2006, more than 6500 cases) and in a tradition-observant Jewish community, sparked by a boy who returned from a trip to the United Kingdom and began showing mumps symptoms while at a summer camp (2009-2010, more than 3400 cases).\n\nMumps cases typically peak in late winter or early spring.\n\nMumps can be a mild disease, but complications may occur. These include meningitis; testicular inflammation in males who have reached puberty, among whom about half experience some degree of testicular atrophy; inflammation of the ovaries or breasts in females who have reached puberty; and permanent deafness in one or both ears. Before the development of a mumps vaccine, the disease was one of the major causes of deafness in children.\n\nThe live, attenuated mumps vaccine used today in the United States was licensed in 1967. Even though mumps cases occur even in fully vaccinated children and adults, the occurrence of the more severe complications is relatively rare now, evidence of some protection afforded by the vaccine . The MMR vaccine was licensed in 1971. The rubella component of the vaccine was changed in 1979, but the mumps and measles components have remained the same since 1971.\n(Excerpted and edited from http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/mumps)\n\nIt may be informative to evaluate whether the current mumps vaccine strain is still fully effective against circulating mumps strains, although it is thought to be. As of 26 Nov 2016, there have been 3800 reports of mumps from 45 states and DC. 94 percent of the children and 45 percent of adults have been up to date on vaccination. Arkansas reported more than 1750 cases of mumps, compared with 7 cases in 2015 and 1 in 2014 (CDC). But large outbreaks have been observed previously as noted, in 2006 and 2009-10.\n\nAt times, a 3rd dose has been given during outbreaks.

It is best known for the puffy cheeks and swollen jaw that it causes because of inflammation of the salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides. Other common symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and loss of appetite. Some people who get mumps have very mild or no symptoms, and often they do not know they have the disease.\n\nMost people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks. However, mumps can occasionally cause severe complications, especially in adults. Treatment includes rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medicine to reduce fever and discomfort. Since mumps is caused by a virus, antibiotics are not used as a treatment.\n\nPeople with mumps can spread the infection for up to 2 days before, and 5 days after, symptoms develop, so those infected can spread the disease before they feel sick. Symptoms typically appear 16 to 18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12 to 25 days after infection.\n\nStudents who have mumps or mumps-like symptoms will be asked to go home if they live close enough to New Haven or if their parent or guardian is able to pick them up. Students who are not able to go home will be cared for at Yale Health until they are no longer contagious.

The majority of cases are Marshallese and are believed to have acquired the infection within local churches and school settings. MMR vaccination clinics are ongoing.\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) has been investigating an outbreak of mumps in north west Arkansas (NWA) since Mid-August. A CDC Epi-Aid team deployed to Little Rock and NWA to assist with the outbreak response from 8 Sept 2016 until 28 Sept 16. They returned again on 4 Nov 2016 to investigate vaccine effectiveness among the affected community. A Marshallese dignitary group traveled from the Republic of the Marshall Islands to NWA on 2 Nov 2016 to assist in community outreach and vaccination efforts.\n\nAs of Tue 8 Nov [2016], we are aware of 1140 cases (626 laboratory confirmed -- via PCR -- and 514 probable cases). At least 134 additional suspects have pending laboratory testing at the state public health laboratory. The majority of cases are in the Marshallese (65 per cent). Transmission has spread to 53 schools in 5 different school districts and 4 private schools, 41 businesses or work places and 54 churches. The majority of cases are 5-17 years old (67 per cent) with an age range of 4 months-82 years. Language barriers are a major issue in conducting investigations as most of the cases are Marshallese or Spanish speaking and interpreters are needed to conduct effective interviews.\n\nThankfully, most cases have had mild disease. A total of 3 cases were hospitalized, 4 had orchitis, 1 had deafness, and 958 cases had typical parotitis. No pancreatitis or encephalitis has been observed.\n\nVaccination clinics are ongoing. To date approximately 4514 doses of MMR have been given at 55 vaccination clinics. As of Tue 8 Nov [2016], about 93 per cent of cases in children are up-to-date on vaccine. In contrast, 42 per cent of adult cases are up-to-date. Several 3rd MMR dose clinics have been conducted and more are planned.\n\nThere are 626 confirmed cases, 514 probable. An estimated 9000 individuals have been exposed, but there have been no deaths.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The link to this report is not publicly available, but ProMED-mail considers it useful to disseminate and share the information.\n\nArkansas is not the only state in the United States reporting increased cases of mumps.

An average year in the US sees no more than several thousand cases of mumps.\n\nSwelling in the salivary glands is one of the key symptoms of mumps. Infected people also suffer fevers, aches, and muscle fatigue. The disease is highly contagious and can spread through respiratory droplets, caused by a cough or sneeze.\n\nMost people in the developed world receive the mumps vaccine as children, which has lead to the disease being nearly eradicated. However, according to the World Health Organization, the vaccine is only 85 percent effective.\n\nHarvard officials have asked students to make health and prevention a top priority. Last spring [2016], over a dozen Harvard students were quarantined to prevent the spread.\n\nHarvard is not the only school dealing with a mumps problem.

The university says it's working with health officials to control the outbreak.\n\nMumps is a viral infection that causes swelling in the salivary glands and cheeks. Anyone with symptoms is asked to stay at home.\n\nIt has been on the rise nationally this year.\n\nThe [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 2345 mumps cases had been reported as of last month [October 2016].\nThat's more than twice as many as in all of 2015.\n\nOther universities also have reported cases this year [2016], including Harvard. Last week it emerged more than a dozen students have contracted mumps at the State University of New York [SUNY; see item [1] above].\n\nThe outbreak [at University of Missouri], first reported last month [October 2016], started on the school's swim team. This week, 4 unrelated students were diagnosed with the debilitating infection.\n\nIt is the latest in a serious of outbreaks across the country in the last few months.\n\nDozens were diagnosed with mumps in New York City in August [2016], just weeks before more than 400 people were struck down with the virus across Arkansas.\n\nThe escalating outbreak at SUNY has sparked an urgent investigation to contain the spread, with swim team practice suspended until further notice.\n\nAny students yet to get the MMR (mumps, measles, rubella) vaccination have been ordered to stay at home for 26 days. But the school insists tours for prospective students will continue as normal.\n\nThe infection is incurable and can lead to devastating health concerns in adults. Sufferers have lost their hearing, become infertile, and had swollen brains. Some people do not experience any symptoms. Typically, symptoms include swollen glands, headaches, a fever, chills, fatigue, and a lack of appetite. Sufferers have described feeling pain in their stomach, neck, pelvis, and testicles.\n\nSince widespread implementation of the MMR jab, it is now barely reported. As the maps [included with this report at the source URL above] show, incidents of mumps are few and vaccinations rates are high.\n\nA mumps infection can also travel to and infect other parts of the body. When this occurs it often causes swelling and discomfort in the affected area. One of those developments is orchitis, [a swelling of one or both testicles], which affects around 25 percent of post-pubescent males. Roughly half the time it also causes the affected testicle to shrink in size. Mumps can also lead to viral meningitis, acute pancreatitis, and oophoritis (swelling of one or both ovaries). In very rare cases (around 0.1 per cent) mumps can cause encephalitis, a life-threatening inflammation of the brain. Symptoms of encephalitis include flu-like symptoms, headache, confusion, dizziness, change in personality, change in behavior, drowsiness, disorientation, seizures, and loss of consciousness.\n\nAnyone suffering these symptoms after contracting mumps should call 911 immediately.

It is not clear why this large increase in cases is occurring.\n\nMumps is no longer very common in the United States. From year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2010, there were 2612 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.\n\nMMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66 to 95 percent) effective at protecting against mumps; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49 to 92 percent) effective. The MMR vaccine protects against currently circulating mumps strains. Outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated US communities, particularly in close-contact settings. In recent years, outbreaks have occurred in schools, colleges, and camps.

The Arkansas Health Department counted 520 confirmed or strongly suspected cases of the virus in Springdale, Rogers and Bentonville as of late Thursday [13 Oct 2016]. Dr Dirk Haselow, an epidemiologist with the department, said on Wednesday [12 Oct 2016] that he expects the number to keep rising for some time.\n\n'Two weeks ago, I would have been much more confident that this outbreak was dampening,' he said. 'Right now it looks like it's taking another step up.' Haselow said the state before this outbreak typically saw 4 or so cases a year of the disease. Mumps often causes flu-like aches and fever along with swollen salivary glands around the face, but rarely leads to more serious ailments. There's no treatment specific to the virus, so people who catch it must wait it out.\n\nThe state's data doesn't go back more than about 20 years, making it difficult to know for sure when Arkansas last had so many mumps cases, Haselow said. The outbreak is an unusual spike in mumps cases for Arkansas since the vaccine was developed in the 1960s, which drove the nation's cases down from hundreds of thousands each year to a couple thousand or fewer in each of the past 5 years.\n\nTwo doses of the vaccine generally protect 88 per cent of the people who receive it from any symptoms, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People who fall into the 12 per cent often experience shorter and less severe symptoms even if they catch the virus, Haselow has said, but they can still spread it, as can people who aren't vaccinated.\n\nThose immunity gaps are enough for mumps to get a foothold, at least for a while. The federal disease centers tracked a 2014 outbreak in Ohio that affected more than 400 people, and another around 2010 in Guam affected about 500 people. Others have affected thousands of people. In 2006, an outbreak that spread over several Midwestern states and college campuses eventually reached more than 6000 people, according to CDC.\n\nArkansas' outbreak seems to have been sparked by another in Iowa in the past year or so. Health officials there counted almost 600 cases from January to August [2016], according to the Iowa Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology.\n\nLike an ember flying away from a fire, a traveler chaperoning several children from north west Arkansas as they flew back home in early August [2016] seems to have carried the virus to Springdale, Haselow said. It spread into a single family, then appears to have spread into their church before reaching several public schools. The 1st schools affected grouped around US 412 in eastern Springdale, according to the Health Department. The cluster of schools then spread through town westward to Tontitown. Rogers schools were affected next, mostly around US 71 Business. At least one probable case was found at Bentonville's Washington Junior High School last week.\n\nThe virus can survive only moments on a surface, but the districts have nonetheless been cleaning buses and school surfaces and keeping an eye out for symptoms since the outbreak's start. For the most part, there hasn't been virus transmission from one school student to another, Haselow said.\n\n'The fact that we have it here is somewhat random,' said Dr Gary Wheeler, chief medical officer for the Health Department, adding occasional outbreaks somewhere in the country are inevitable. Where Iowa's mumps came from is less clear, said Dr Patricia Quinlisk, Iowa's state epidemiologist. The state's outbreak centered on the University of Iowa, where students and other residents often travel to and from other states, athletic events and other colleges. The virus can be spread by coughing, sneezing and kissing and spreads more readily in places where people live close together, which can make campuses particularly vulnerable. Quinlisk said the primary outbreak seems to have wound down by early this year, partly thanks to 3rd doses of the vaccine for thousands of students. 'However, it did get seeded out to other parts of Iowa, so we continue to see small outbreaks around the state,' she added. 'We're still higher than we would be in a normal year.'\n\nArkansas has also started tackling the outbreak with 3rd vaccine doses in some cases. The Health Department offered targeted vaccine clinics at more than a dozen specific workplaces and schools where the virus has been particularly common and organized 2 free public vaccine clinics so far at the Jones Center in Springdale. More than 2500 vaccine doses have been given out as of this week as part of the outbreak response, according to the Health Department, including almost 500 at the 2nd Jones Center clinic Thursday [13 Oct 2016].\n\nThat doesn't count the thousands or tens of thousands of people who haven't had to deal with the disease thanks to the vaccine's protection, Wheeler said, praising Springdale Public Schools for a relatively high vaccination rate. The Health Department hasn't seen other complications such as encephalitis or hospitalizations at all. 'It's paying off,' Wheeler said of vaccinations, adding that despite the growing number of cases, 'it's relatively contained still.'\n\n[byline: Dan Holtmeyer]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[More than 30 schools in north west Arkansas have reported at least one student with the mumps virus.

The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency says the student may have exposed others on campus between 6-9 and 12-14 [Sep 2016].\n\nThe student lived off campus and was up-to-date with mumps vaccinations, but was diagnosed with the highly contagious viral disease by blood tests reported to the County this week. The student was not hospitalized and has recovered.\n\nIndividuals can become ill with mumps 12-25 days after exposure.\n\nThis case is not related to the possible mumps exposure at the Casbah music venue on 28 Aug [2016]. It is not known where the student was exposed to the viral illness.\n\n'Cal State San Marcos is working closely with the County to notify individuals who were directly exposed to the person with mumps,' said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. 'We are encouraging immunizations for students and staff who are not up-to-date.'\n\nMumps is a highly contagious viral disease. It is spread by coughing, sneezing or close contact with an infected person. Mumps causes a fever, headache, earache, and inflammation of the salivary glands which results in swelling and tenderness at the angle of the jaw. Anyone who thinks that they may have mumps should contact their provider before going for care so proper precautions can be taken to prevent exposure to others.\n\nSevere complications are rare, but can include meningitis, decreased fertility, permanent hearing loss, and, in extreme cases, fetal loss during 1st trimester of pregnancy. There is no treatment for mumps. Most people recover without problems.\n\nThe best way to prevent mumps is by getting the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended -- one at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years of age. A 3rd booster shot is recommended for those in close living conditions when there is an outbreak.\n\nMumps is becoming increasingly more common on college campuses in the United States. The disease has been reported on multiple college campuses in 2016 including the State University of New York at Buffalo, Indiana University, University of Kentucky, University of San Diego, University of Southern Maine, Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire and Harvard University [in Massachusetts], among others.\n\n2016 has seen the most mumps cases in the US since 2010.

There are at least 18 people in their 20s and 30s currently being treated for the highly infectious virus in Long Beach -- and medics believe there are as many as 25.\n\nSince widespread implementation of the MMR jab, it is now barely reported. The sudden outbreak has shocked the medical community, since 97 per cent of New Yorkers have received the mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\nIt sparks fears that there may be a new strain of the [virus].\n\nResidents on Long Island [New York] have been warned to wash all glasses, plates, and cutlery in a hot dishwasher to blitz the highly infectious virus, which is spread through saliva.\n\nAnd anyone who thinks they may have symptoms should self-quarantine for at least 5 days and seek medical help.\n\n'If you know you're sick please stay home and don't transmit this,' Nassau County Health Commissioner, Dr Lawrence Eisenstein, said. 'It is highly contagious, and even those who were vaccinated can get mumps.'\n\nHe said anyone who has only received one MMR jab should consider getting a top-up booster to protect against mumps.\n\nTypically, symptoms include puffy cheeks, swollen glands, headaches, a fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, and a lack of appetite. Sufferers have described feeling pain in their stomach, neck, pelvis, and testicles. Sufferers have lost their hearing, become infertile, and had swollen brains. Some people do not experience any symptoms.\n\nA mumps infection can also travel to and infect other parts of the body. When this occurs it often causes swelling and discomfort in the affected area.\n\nOne of those developments is orchitis, [an inflammation of one or both testicles, which affects around 25 per cent of post-pubescent males. Roughly half the time it also causes the affected testicle to shrink in size.\n\nMumps can also lead to viral meningitis, acute pancreatitis, and oophoritis (swelling of one or both ovaries). In very rare cases (around 0.1 per cent) mumps can cause encephalitis, a life-threatening inflammation of the brain. Symptoms of encephalitis include flu-like symptoms, headache, confusion, dizziness, change in personality, change in behavior, drowsiness, disorientation, seizures, and loss of consciousness.\n\nAnyone suffering these symptoms after contracting mumps should call 911 immediately. This condition requires emergency treatment in a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n[Byline: Mia De Graaf]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is a viral illness caused by a _Rubulavirus_, a member of the _paramyxovirus_ family.

Whitworth requires students meet all of Washington state's immunization requirements.\n\nClose contacts of these 3 cases are being followed up on to monitor for symptoms. Whitworth University officials sent notifications to all other students and families.\n\nNancy Hines, Whitworth communications director, said: 'We take the health of our student, faculty and staff population seriously and are taking every precaution to mitigate the spread of mumps on our campus. With these 3 cases, we have armed our campus community with the necessary information to avoid the mumps infection.'\n\n'Although we hope to contain this to just 3 cases, mumps is spread from person to person when in close contact with each other,' said Dr. Joel McCullough, SRHD interim health officer. 'We urge individuals to make sure that they and their loved ones are up to date on the MMR vaccine.'\n\nIn children, mumps is usually a mild disease. Adults may have more serious disease and more complications.\n\nMumps is spread through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by:\n- Coughing, sneezing, or talking.\n- Sharing items, such as cups or eating utensils, with others.\n- Touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others.\n\nThe infectious period of mumps is 3 days before to 5 days after the onset of salivary gland swelling. Other common symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite.\n\nOfficials from the health district and Whitworth University advise students, faculty, or staff who experience mumps symptoms to seek medical care, either through Whitworth Student Health & Counseling Center or other health care providers.\n\nIndividuals who are concerned about getting the mumps can reduce their risk of becoming ill by:\n- Getting vaccinated against the mumps.\n- People who have received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine are about 9 times less likely to get mumps than unvaccinated people who have the same exposure to mumps virus.\n- If a vaccinated person does get mumps, they will likely have less severe illness than an unvaccinated person.\n- Most children and young adults have received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. Two doses of MMR vaccine are more effective than one dose.\n- Always covering nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing.\n- Washing hands frequently.\n- Disposing of used tissues and other similar objects appropriately.\n- Avoiding sharing glasses, eating utensils, water bottles, cigarettes, and makeup.\n\nSpokane County's last confirmed mumps case was in 2009. Counting Spokane's cases, since 1 Jan 2016, state health officials confirmed 6 cases of mumps in Washington state: the 3 in Spokane County and 3 cases unrelated to Spokane's outside Spokane County. In 2015, Washington confirmed 7 cases of mumps statewide.\n\nNationally, the CDC has reported 1897 mumps cases from 44 states through 10 Sep 2016.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is interesting to note, as in a number of previous ProMED reports, that the students were fully vaccinated when they contracted mumps.

The majority of cases are Marshallese and are believed to have common exposures within a local church and in school settings. MMR vaccination clinics are ongoing.\n\nDescription:\nThe Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) has been investigating an outbreak of mumps in northwest Arkansas (NWA) since mid-August [2016]. A CDC Epi-Aid team was deployed to Little Rock and NWA to assist with the outbreak response from 8 Oct 2016 until 28 Oct 2016.\n\nThe index case appears to be an unvaccinated 27-year-old woman with no international travel but who was visited by an individual who traveled from an area in Iowa where mumps was spreading at that time. As of Fri 7 Oct 2016, we are aware of 427 cases (196 laboratory confirmed via PCR) and 231 Epi-linked cases or clinically diagnosed). At least 25 additional suspects have pending laboratory testing at the state public health laboratory. The majority of cases are in Marshallese (66%) and are believed to have common exposures within a local church. Transmission has spread from that site to 37 schools in 4 different school districts, 17 businesses or work places, and 30 churches. The majority of cases are 5-17 years old (66%) with an age range of 7 months-82 years. Language barriers are a major issue in conducting investigations, as the majority of cases are Marshallese or Spanish speaking, and interpreters are needed to conduct effective interviews.\n\nVaccination clinics are ongoing. To date, approximately 2030 doses of MMR have been given at 17 vaccination clinics, and more clinics are scheduled in the coming weeks. As of today [7 Oct 2016], about 90% of cases in children are up-to-date on vaccine. In contrast, 35 per cent of adult cases are up-to-date.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Starting in August 2016, many cases of mumps have been reported in the Springdale [Arkansas] area through school and community transmission. As of Fri [7 Oct 2016], 322 suspected or lab confirmed cases have been reported in northwest Arkansas, where a large population of Marsallese live.\n\nMarshallese have been migrating from their North Pacific archipelago to the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas since the 1980s to earn money, educate their children, and seek medical care. The 2nd-largest U.S. continental population of Marshallese is concentrated in Springdale (Washington and Benton Counties; the 2010 federal census counted 4324 islanders in Arkansas).\n\nA Compact of Free Association with the United States was signed in 1986 which allows islanders to freely travel to the United States as migrants on just a passport, without visas or foreign employment credentials. Islander children born in the United States are conveyed citizenship.\n\nThe unique migration arrangement led to a Marshallese diaspora in the late 1980s. Islanders have settled in Hawaii, California, and Washington, but the largest continental population is located in Springdale, Arkansas.\n\nMarshallese in Arkansas generally live in multi-family, multi-generational households. Despite the amenities the Springdale area offers to the Marshallese, only American-born Marshallese children have access to U.S. entitlements. Compact migrants cannot participate in the American political system or legally apply for Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, or ARKids First (S-Chip) supplements, even though taxes to support such entitlements are deducted from many U.S. migrants' paychecks. As a result, Arkansas communities are burdened with providing healthcare to islanders lacking resources. The population, which now consumes a western diet, is plagued by diabetes, heart disease, tuberculosis, and obesity. Hansen's disease is endemic. A remnant elder population suffers from effects of the Cold War-era nuclear bomb tests, and some experts believe that the entire population may be immunocompromised.\n\nWith federal start-up funding and support from the Arkansas Department of Health, a Marshallese clinic for working poor islanders opened in Springdale in 2011. Operating costs are shouldered by the state. An interdisciplinary and voluntary taskforce called 'Gaps in Services to Marshallese,' made up of both public and private social and healthcare experts guided by stakeholders, is dedicated to serving the pressing needs of islanders. Of some assistance is the federal Affordable Care Act of 2010, which will allow Marshallese to purchase health insurance through the national health insurance marketplace (coverage beginning in 2014). They will be eligible for tax-credit subsidies to aid in the purchase of the insurance.\nExcerpted from: http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5972.\n\nIt is very likely this population had not been vaccinated with MMR vaccine, leading to this outbreak after exposure to an infected individual. But the vaccination clinics described in the report above should go a long way towards stopping this current outbreak.

'However, CDC has provided guidelines for use of a 3rd dose as a control measure during mumps outbreaks in settings in which persons are in close contact with one another, where transmission is sustained despite high 2-dose MMR coverage, and when traditional control measures fail to slow transmission.'\n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) confirmed an outbreak of mumps at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (C-UPHD) on 1 May 2015. Between April 2015 and May 2016, researchers identified 317 cases on campus. The university, IDPH and the university's McKinley Health Center recommended a 3rd MMR vaccination due to the seasonal trends and characteristics of the population at risk.\n\nAbout 50 000 students and staff members were targeted for 3rd-dose vaccination on C-UPHD campus. A total of 8200 doses of MMR were administered at multiple vaccination sites at the university between 6 and 27 Aug 2015 to determine if a 3rd dose of MMR would prevent further exposure of mumps to healthy staff and students. In addition, the C-UPHD center administered 3300 doses in the fall and spring semesters.\n\nEpidemiological analysis showed that all 317 cases of mumps were associated with the university. Cases in students totaled 278 (88 per cent), 3 (1 per cent) occurred in staff members and 36 (11 per cent) in people not associated with the university but who had contact with students or the campus grounds. Among those who were diagnosed at the time of parotitis onset, 50 patients had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine, 232 patients had received 2 doses, 12 patients had received 1 dose, 7 patients were unvaccinated and 16 patients were unaware if they had been vaccinated. 90 per cent of patients with a 3rd dose received it during the outbreak, and 10 per cent had received it previously independent of this outbreak, according to the researchers.\n\n'In light of the recent increased incidence of mumps, CDC is gathering additional data to assess use of a 3rd dose of vaccine to inform decision-making during outbreak responses and potential changes in the recommendations,' they wrote.\n\nReference:\nAlbertson JP, et al. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm62529a2.\n\n[byline: Kate Sherrer]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[While a 3rd dose of the vaccine sounds like it might be helpful in boosting immunity, it must be given sufficiently prior to exposure for the immunity to be boosted to be protective. As noted above, 50 patients (out of 317) had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine. One must assume they were not vaccinated with the 3rd dose in time to protect them.\n\nA 3rd vaccination appears to have been very effective in the following study: Ogbuanu IU, et al. Pediatrics 2012; 130(6)(http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2012/10/30/peds.2012-0177.full.pdf). This study was conducted to assess the impact of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine during an outbreak in 2009-2010 among school students in 6th-12th grade. The decline in incidence shortly after the intervention suggests that a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. The results indicated that of 2265 eligible students, 2178 (96.2 per cent) provided documentation of having received 2 previous doses of MMR vaccine, and a high proportion (1755 or 80.6 per cent) chose to receive an additional vaccine dose. The overall attack rate for all 6th- to 12th-grade students declined from 4.93 per cent in the prevaccination period to 0.13 per cent after vaccination (P, .001). Villagewide, overall attack rate declined by 75.6 per cent after the intervention. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] USA (Oklahoma)\nDate: Thu 15 Sep 2016\nSource: Enid News & Eagle [edited]\nhttp://www.enidnews.com/news/local_news/update-some-in-suspected-mumps-outbreak-were-vaccinated/article_47c989a4-7b67-11e6-8e84-dffe3f42c206.html\n\n\nUpdate: Some in suspected mumps outbreak were vaccinated\n--------------------------------------------------------\nGarfield County Health Department has confirmed at least some of the individuals who have or are suspected of having mumps in Garfield County [Oklahoma] have been vaccinated against the disease.\n\n'I don't have numbers on this just yet -- but it does look as though some were fully vaccinated with MMR,' Carla Dionne, director of Garfield County Health Department, reported in an email to the Enid News & Eagle. She added that this particular vaccine -- measles, mumps and rubella -- 'is 88 per cent effective -- but not perfect. Individuals with 2 doses can still get mumps.'\n\nEnid Public Schools [EPS] sent out a text message Wednesday [14 Sep 2016] evening reporting that Garfield County Health Department has confirmed multiple cases of mumps in the community, including at Longfellow Middle School and Enid High School.\n\nOklahoma Health Department later reported there have been 4 confirmed cases in Garfield County and at least 34 suspected cases.\n\nEPS requires students to be in compliance with Oklahoma vaccination laws, EPS Communications Director Amber Graham Fitzgerald said. 'Prior to (Wednesday's) events, the EPS Health Services Department established (Thursday) as the deadline for compliance,' she said. 'Those not in compliance -- there are about 12 students who don't have the MMR vaccine -- will not be allowed to return to school until they are in compliance.' This does not include students who have a religious or physical exemption from vaccinations, she said.\n\nLaurence Burnsed, an epidemiologist with the Acute Disease Service for the Oklahoma State Department of Health, confirmed that some of those who are suspected of contracting the disease in Enid have been vaccinated and that others have not been or do not know if they have been vaccinated. 'That's what you might expect in an outbreak situation,' Burnsed said. 'If you have the recommended 2 doses of MMR, you're at an 88 per cent level of protection, so if 100 people were exposed, you would still have about 12 experiencing symptoms. The vaccine is not 100 per cent protective.' In the health department's collaboration with school officials, Burnsed said there seems to be a good level of vaccinations.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is available at Garfield County Health Department.\n\nMumps is a virus spread though coughing, sneezing and direct contact with saliva through eating or drinking after an infected person, according to Garfield County Health Department. Symptoms can last 7-10 days and usually appear 12-25 days after infection.\n\nMumps is characterized by puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw, due to swollen salivary glands. Other symptoms include body aches, tiredness and fever, and males may experience swollen, painful testicles, according to the department. In order to prevent spreading mumps, children who exhibit such symptoms should not attend school or day care through 5 days after the illness begins, according to the department.\n\nBurnsed encouraged those who have not been vaccinated or who are behind on their vaccination schedule to get the MMR vaccine to help protect against the illness. Burnsed also said the state department is not ruling out that Enid's suspected outbreak could be related to a similar outbreak in Arkansas. 'It's certainly possible, considering the proximity,' Burnsed said. 'But we are still gathering information.'\n\nOn Monday [12 Sep 2016], the Arkansas Department of Health reported almost 100 cases of mumps have been confirmed in the state, with most being in Springdale, but some reported in Rogers and potential cases in Fayetteville, Huntsville and West Fork, according to the Arkansas Democrat Gazette.\n\n[byline: Sally Asher]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The cases in Oklahoma had been fully vaccinated with 2 doses, but still came down with measles.

However, CDC has provided guidelines for use of a 3rd dose as a control measure during mumps outbreaks in settings in which persons are in close contact with one another, where transmission is sustained despite high 2-dose MMR coverage, and when traditional control measures fail to slow transmission.' \n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) confirmed an outbreak of mumps at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (C-UPHD) on 1 May 2015. Cases in students totaled 278 (88 per cent), 3 (1 per cent) occurred in staff members and 36 (11 per cent) in people not associated with the university but who had contact with students or the campus grounds.

It is spread through the air by droplets and contact with saliva or mucus from infected persons. Mumps can be transmitted through coughing and sneezing as well as sharing food or beverage items and utensils with infected individuals.\n\nSymptoms of mumps include fever, body aches, headaches, and swelling or pain of the salivary glands near the ears and jaw. Anyone who experiences these symptoms should contact his/her health care provider for diagnosis and testing.\n\nThe MHD recommends that persons experiencing symptoms consistent with mumps infection, especially swelling of one or both salivary glands, call your healthcare provider and stay home from work or school for a minimum of 5 days after the onset of swelling. Individuals are also advised to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing and wash hands frequently with soap and water.\n\nWhile most individuals recover fully, mumps infection can occasionally cause serious complications in adults that can include inflammation of the testicles in men or ovaries and breasts in women, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), and temporary or permanent deafness.\n\nVaccination with 2 doses of mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to prevent mumps infection.

Mumps clusters can happen even in highly vaccinated populations. Annually the number of reported mumps cases can range from a few hundred to a couple thousand in the United States.\n\n'Mumps is highly contagious so it's important to practice good hygiene habits as that will help reduce illnesses. If you know someone who has mumps or suspect someone may have the disease, contact your physician or your local public health department,' said Terra Uhing Executive Director, Three Rivers Public Health Department.\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs, sneezes or talks. Items used by an infected person, such as cups or soft drink cans, can also be contaminated with the virus, which may spread to others if those items are shared.\n\nSymptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection. It is usually a mild disease, but can occasionally cause serious complications.\n\nThe most common complication is inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) in males who have reached puberty; rarely does this lead to fertility problems.\n\nOther rare complications include inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (encephalitis/meningitis), inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis) and/or breasts (mastitis) in females who have reached puberty, and deafness. Anyone who is not immune from either previous mumps infection or from vaccination can get mumps.\n\nAs of 29 Apr 2016, the CDC reports 727 mumps cases nationally.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of Nebraska, USA can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53326. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] USA (MA) - Harvard University\nDate: Tue 17 May 2016\nSource: NBC News [edited]\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/harvard-mumps-outbreak-continues-commencement-will-go-n575526\n\n\nThe show will be going on at Harvard [Cambridge, Massachusetts]. The commencement, that is. An ongoing breakout of mumps won't impact the 26 May [2016] ceremony featuring director Steven Spielberg, even if the viral illness is making life miserable for nearly 5 dozen members of the Harvard community -- students, faculty and staff.\n\nAs of 12 May [2016], there were 59 confirmed cases of the illness, with 12 people in isolation, according to the most recent update by Cambridge health officials. That's up slightly from 41 cases in late April [2016].\n\nHarvard University Health Services (HUHS) has been keeping the community informed of best practices for preventing the spread of the illness, and is working with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Cambridge Public Health Department, explains HUHS director Dr. Paul J. Barreira in a statement to TODAY.\n\nThe outbreak began in March [2016], but an increase in the number of cases isn't that unusual. 'In a community with a large residential population, one would expect to see increasing cases of mumps,' he says. Although Harvard community members were indeed vaccinated, the so-called MMR (mumps, measles, and rubella) vaccine offers different levels of protection depending on the illness.\n\nThe measles portion of the vaccine, for example, is about 93 percent effective with one dose, while 2 doses give people 97 percent protection, according to the CDC.\n\nBut the mumps portion is less effective. Two doses of mumps vaccine are 88 percent effective at preventing the illness, while one dose is 78 percent effective. 'The measles vaccine is so good it spoils us,' says Dr. Paul Sax, clinical director of Infectious Disease at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nAlthough there are no plans to cancel graduation ceremonies, 'given the 2- to 3-week incubation period for the mumps virus, students who come down with the virus at this point may have to miss certain end-of-year activities if they are ill,' says Barreira.\n\nNow that's a buzzkill, too, especially for any mumps-ridden graduating senior.\n\nStudents leaving campus for summer break and out of close proximity of each other will be a big help in curtailing the illness, he says.\n\nProtecting yourself from mumps starts with vaccination, but there are also some common-sense things that people should be doing, he adds, citing hand washing, covering your mouth and nose when sneezing, and avoiding sharing cups and utensils.\n\n'(Mumps) outbreaks have happened before, and they will happen again,' says Sax, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. 'But the message is this one will end.'\n\nAlthough mumps outbreaks vary from year to year and the vaccine is 'not 100 percent effective,' says Dr. Paul Sax, clinical director of Infectious Disease at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston -- without it there would have potentially been many more cases among the Harvard community, which numbers about 40 000 students, faculty and staff.\n\n[Byline: Joan Raymond]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of Massachusetts may be accessed at http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/massachusetts_cities_and_towns.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8159. - Mod.LK]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nAlthough mumps outbreaks vary from year to year and the vaccine is 'not 100 percent effective,' says Dr. Paul Sax, clinical director of Infectious Disease at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston -- without it there would have potentially been many more cases among the Harvard community, which numbers about 40 000 students, faculty and staff. \n\nA health advisory was sent to health care providers in Nebraska asking them to be on the lookout for cases of mumps and to contact their local health department about suspected cases. \n\nThe City of Milwaukee Health Department (MHD) has received reports of 3 confirmed cases of mumps infection in city residents, including area college students and community members.

The age range of cases is 14 to 86 years. The NDDoH is urging North Dakotans to be sure they have received their MMR vaccine. Anyone with symptoms of mumps should be evaluated by a health care provider, and, if they have mumps, stay home for 5 days after symptoms started, and avoid contact with others.\n\nMumps is a viral illness best known for the puffy cheeks and swollen jaw that it causes as a result of swollen salivary glands. The most common symptoms include: fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides (parotitis).\n\nMumps is generally a mild illness, but can cause complications, such as deafness, and inflammation of the testicles, brain, and ovaries. Symptoms may appear from 12 to 25 days after infection. People with symptoms are recommended to see a health care provider for testing, because other illnesses, including influenza, can cause parotitis.\n\n'The best way to prevent mumps is to be vaccinated,' according to Molly Howell, Immunization Program Manager for the NDDoH. 'The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. All children are recommended to receive MMR vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age and again at 4 to 6 years of age. MMR vaccine is required to attend child care, school, and colleges in North Dakota. People born before 1957 are generally considered immune to mumps due to the high rate of infection at that time.'\n\nOnly 2 of the mumps cases had a history of 2 doses of MMR vaccine. 'It is not surprising to see mumps cases in vaccinated individuals,' said Howell. 'The mumps component of the MMR vaccine is about 88 percent effective, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. MMR vaccine is the only tool that we have available to prevent mumps; 88 percent is a lot better than not being vaccinated at all. People who have received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine are about 9 times less likely to get mumps than unvaccinated people who have the same exposure to mumps virus.'\n\nMumps spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. A good way to prevent transmission of mumps is to practice good hygiene habits; regularly wash hands with soap and water, sneeze and coughing into a tissue or your elbow, and avoid sharing drinks, food and utensils.\n\n[Byline: Molly Howell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail and HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This outbreak has affected a broad age group from 14-86 years. These individuals may not have been fully vaccinated with 2 doses, the individuals were among the 20 percent where the vaccine is ineffective, or vaccine effectiveness may be waning with age. The vaccine is 80 percent effective. Even when not fully protective, the vaccine may lower the number of people who get sick when exposed to the virus, and lowers risk of problems.\n\nMMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is recommended routinely for all children at age 12 through 15 months, with a 2nd dose at age 4 through 6 years. The 2nd dose of MMR can be given as early as 4 weeks (28 days) after the 1st dose and be counted as a valid dose if both doses were given after the child's 1st birthday. The 2nd dose is intended to produce immunity in the small number of people who fail to respond to the 1st dose.\n\nAdults with no evidence of immunity should get 1 dose of MMR unless the adult is in a high-risk group. High-risk people need 2 doses and include healthcare personnel, international travelers, students at post-high school educational institutions, people exposed to measles in an outbreak setting, and those previously vaccinated with killed measles vaccine or with an unknown type of measles vaccine during 1963 through 1967. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/236.]", "summary": "High-risk people need 2 doses and include healthcare personnel, international travelers, students at post-high school educational institutions, people exposed to measles in an outbreak setting, and those previously vaccinated with killed measles vaccine or with an unknown type of measles vaccine during 1963 through 1967. \n\nMMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is recommended routinely for all children at age 12 through 15 months, with a 2nd dose at age 4 through 6 years.

It is spread by coughing, sneezing and other contact with saliva or mucus from an infected person. An individual is most contagious 3 days before and 5 days after the onset of symptoms.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail and HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) report from April 2016 noted that mumps appears to be on the rise in 2016, including on campuses (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/04/early-reports-show-mumps-rise-2016-including-campuses):\n\n'Recent headlines about US college mumps outbreaks appear to herald the start to a busy year for the disease and underscore the ongoing challenges that campuses face.\n\n'While mumps hit a low point of 229 cases in 2011, in the past 2 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded more than 1000 cases annually. In updating its numbers yesterday [7 Apr 2016], the CDC said that, as of 1 Apr [2016], public health departments have reported 467 mumps cases already this year.\n\n'Although mumps cases have seen a sharp decline since the CDC began recommending a 2-dose vaccine prevention plan in 1988, outbreaks are still prevalent, particularly in high-contact social settings like college campuses. Mumps is transmittable through the air or by touching unwashed, contaminated surfaces, and the rising cases bring into question vaccination practices, waning immunity, and college healthcare.\n\n'Concerns unique to colleges\n----------------------------\n'Mumps outbreaks can be difficult to detect at 1st because doctors are not always thinking about the disease, said Susan Even, MD, executive director of the University of Missouri Student Health Center and chair of the American College Health Association (ACHA)'s Vaccine Preventable Disease Advisory Committee.\n\n'Although she thinks that colleges are becoming more vigilant about looking for mumps, the disease is contagious at least 5 days before symptoms appear, and not all students experience or report symptoms.\n\n'In 2006, the CDC listed 6854 mumps cases, with 84 per cent of the cases through October of that year occurring at Midwestern colleges. College-aged people had the highest infection rates, and the most cited reason is because of their close-proximity lifestyle. The ACHA, in a presentation about a 2006 University of Iowa (UI) outbreak, listed parties, sports, dormitories, and travel as risk factors.\n\n'Those aspects of college life do not seem to change much, which is perhaps why U.S. colleges have reported cases of mumps this year on Midwest colleges in places like Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Eastern schools like Harvard University (16 cases as of 22 Mar [2016]) have also had some outbreaks and the University of Texas-Austin reported a case at the end of January [2016].\n\n'While outbreaks may seem to center around college campuses, Cristina Cardemil, MD, MPH, a medical epidemiologist in the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases, points out that various populations, such as children, older adults, and other communities are being affected, too.\n\n'Looking at the bigger picture, she said, the number of mumps cases are not exceeding the vaccine success rate, nor is the slight upward trend in cases over the past few years indicative of a growing pattern.\n\n''Even in the best-case scenario where everyone is vaccinated,' Cardemil said, 'We're still going to see a number of mumps cases every year.' A 2014 study in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) noted that 91.9 per cent of the U.S. population had received at least 1 dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\n'One dose of the MMR vaccine affords 78 per cent protection, while 2 doses provide 88 per cent effectiveness, according to the CDC. The vaccine is the best prevention for mumps, and even encourages colleges to ask for proof that their students are immunized and not just assume they are.\n\n'The CDC recommends that children receive MMR vaccine at 12 through 15 months of age and again at 4 through 6 years of age.\n\n'Waning immunity is a difficult question to answer, as many different factors such as vaccination rates (including community pockets with lower-than-average vaccine uptake), dose number, and individual predisposition factor into it, Cardemil said. She added that some studies have supported the idea that mumps immunity dissipates as time goes by, but more studies need to be done for the results to become conclusive.\n\n'Adult booster dose?\n--------------------\n'UI is one of a handful of colleges that have used free 3rd doses of MMR as booster shots to prevent mumps spread. More than 5000 UI students took advantage of the free vaccine during the 2015-16 season, which so far has seen almost 300 mumps cases in Johnson County, most of which were at UI.\n\n'Although CDC researchers obtained data about the 3rd dose's effects, the school has not seen its conclusions, according to Jim Kellogg, the director of The University of Iowa Student Health & Wellness.\n\n'The 3rd MMR dose may or may not keep mumps from spreading -- the CDC neither recommends for or against it. Cardemil cautions that using that treatment for every outbreak is not practical because of the resources and finances it takes.\n\n'In addition to the vaccine booster, UI reached its students through multiple communication platforms to remind them to practice healthy habits and teach them about the symptoms of mumps. Lisa James, RN, MSN, the associate director of UI's clinical outreach, said that students were slow to 'take action' unless a personal acquaintance contracted the disease. For those who did become sick, supportive treatment, pain and fever medication, and an excused isolation period were arranged.\n\n'Compared with the 2006 UI outbreak, which involved at least 55 cases, Kellogg said that the campus is now more prepared and able to react quicker because its data tracking was able to show university officials the rising trends that started mid-summer and continued through winter break. James added that the university's response was bolstered by increased communication with local public health officials.\n\n'The CDC strongly encourages that health departments report outbreaks of the mumps, which it lists as a nationally notifiable disease. As both Cardemil and Kellogg state, the college outbreaks are not sequestered to just the campus; mumps patients from the outside infect the college community, and vice versa.'\n\nAlso see discussion of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine in previous posts.\n\nA map of Nebraska, USA can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/229. - Mod.LK]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail and HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) report from April 2016 noted that mumps appears to be on the rise in 2016, including on campuses (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/04/early-reports-show-mumps-rise-2016-including-campuses):\n\n'Recent headlines about US college mumps outbreaks appear to herald the start to a busy year for the disease and underscore the ongoing challenges that campuses face. \n\nThe department announced Tuesday [31 May 2016] that the number of mumps cases increased from 10 to 21, after new cases were reported last week [week ending 28 May 2016] in Cass, Douglas, Dodge, Hall, Madison and Platte counties. \n\n'Although mumps cases have seen a sharp decline since the CDC began recommending a 2-dose vaccine prevention plan in 1988, outbreaks are still prevalent, particularly in high-contact social settings like college campuses. \n\n'While mumps hit a low point of 229 cases in 2011, in the past 2 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded more than 1000 cases annually. \n\n'In 2006, the CDC listed 6854 mumps cases, with 84 per cent of the cases through October of that year occurring at Midwestern colleges. \n\n'Those aspects of college life do not seem to change much, which is perhaps why U.S. colleges have reported cases of mumps this year on Midwest colleges in places like Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin. ----------------------------\n'Mumps outbreaks can be difficult to detect at 1st because doctors are not always thinking about the disease, said Susan Even, MD, executive director of the University of Missouri Student Health Center and chair of the American College Health Association (ACHA)'s Vaccine Preventable Disease Advisory Committee.

In addition, the collaboration is working to identify and directly notify anyone who may have been in close contact with these cases, and advises faculty, staff, students and members of the community to educate themselves on the symptoms, transmission and prevention of mumps.\n\nIn addition to Purdue, state health officials have reported 45 mumps cases on 3 other campuses -- Indiana University in Bloomington (17), Butler University [in Indianapolis] (24) and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) with 4.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms for mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides. Mumps is spread from direct and indirect contact with an infected person's respiratory droplets, which can be transmitted by sneezing and coughing. People with mumps can spread their infections for up to 2 days before and 5 days after the onset of symptoms. Anyone with symptoms is highly encouraged to stay home and avoid others to prevent the further spread of illness and to seek care as soon as possible.\n\nMumps is caused by a virus, so antibiotics are not indicated. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection but can range from 12-25 days. Generally, mumps is a mild illness, and some people may not have any symptoms. While complications and more serious issues can result from a mumps infection, they are generally rare, with a 1 percent to 3 percent complication rate.\n\nAt this time, university members are encouraged to check their vaccination records with their primary-care provider and obtain copies if needed. Currently, the best way to prevent mumps is to be vaccinated with 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR. Individuals born after 1957 who have not had 2 doses of vaccine or are unable to find their records are encouraged to seek advice from a health care provider or contact the local health department on receiving an MMR vaccine. Persons born before 1957 are considered to be immune to mumps due to the high rate of infection prior to routine vaccination. Two doses of vaccine are only considered around 88 percent effective at preventing infection, so some people who have been fully vaccinated with 2 MMRs may still contract mumps.\n\nPracticing good hygiene habits -- such as regularly washing your hands with soap and water, sneezing and coughing into a tissue or your elbow, and avoiding the sharing of drinks, food and utensils -- is a good way to prevent illness and transmission. Additionally, if you believe you may have symptoms of mumps, isolating yourself from contact with others and seeking care as soon as possible could prevent additional spread of mumps.\n\nStudents or staff with symptoms -- even if they have received a MMR vaccine -- should stay home and call ahead before going to an urgent care or the Purdue Student Health Center. If students have concerns about possible symptoms, they should contact the Purdue Student Health Center or their primary-care provider. Treatment for mumps is geared toward alleviating symptoms. Bed rest, a soft diet and a pain reliever for aches are often recommended.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of Indiana may be accessed at http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/USA/Indiana_map.jpg. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/217.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail and HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Adults born in 1957 or later who have not been vaccinated or have not had mumps should get vaccinated.

The current total cases now stands at 11.\n\nHarvard University Health Services [HUHS] Director, Dr Paul J. Barreira, wrote in a message to the Harvard community earlier this week:\n\nWe all have a responsibility to help prevent the spread of the virus. With spring recess only a few days away, I know many of you will be leaving the Cambridge area, and I write to remind you that it is even more important to be vigilant in taking precautions to prevent the spread of mumps if you are planning to travel.\n\nIf you are experiencing facial swelling, jaw pain, ear ache, or testicular swelling, you should refrain from public activities, avoid travel and public transportation, and contact HUHS at 617-495-5711 to be evaluated, even if you have been vaccinated. Doing this is crucial to minimizing the exposure of others to the virus.\n\nMumps spreads through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, or talking; sharing items, such as cups or eating utensils, with others; and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others.\n\nPeople may be able to spread mumps from 2 days before symptom onset to 5 days after symptom onset.\n\nSymptoms (fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite and swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides) typically appear 14-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection. Very rarely, the virus can also cause swelling of the heart and joints, meningitis (swelling of the brain and spinal cord), and encephalitis (swelling of the brain itself).\n\nMumps can be prevented with MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine. Most children and young adults have received at least one dose of MMR vaccine. Two doses of MMR vaccine are more effective than one dose.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of 4 Mar 2016, 250 mumps cases were reported nationally.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail and HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See discussion of mumps in the United States in ProMED-mail post Mumps - USA (04): (MA, MT) student cases 20160311.4084267.\n\nA map showing Massachusetts can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8159. - Mod.LK]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail and HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See discussion of mumps in the United States in ProMED-mail post Mumps - USA (04): (MA, MT) student cases 20160311.4084267. \n\nSymptoms (fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite and swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides) typically appear 14-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection. \n\nIf you are experiencing facial swelling, jaw pain, ear ache, or testicular swelling, you should refrain from public activities, avoid travel and public transportation, and contact HUHS at 617-495-5711 to be evaluated, even if you have been vaccinated. \n\nPeople may be able to spread mumps from 2 days before symptom onset to 5 days after symptom onset. \n\nHarvard University Health Services [HUHS] Director, Dr Paul J.

Barreira said. 'It's happening with students who are well-immunized, so it's a breakthrough infection. So the task is to get the population to act in ways that minimizes the spread of the virus.'\n\nThe number of confirmed cases at the university has not increased since Barreira's email last Wed [2 Mar 2016], which stated that 6 students on campus had contracted the virus. Since that time, Barreira has circulated information about preventing the spread of the virus and encouraged students exhibiting symptoms of mumps to contact HUHS.\n\n'We have no way of knowing how it came on campus,' Barreira said. 'Public Health is responsible with interviewing everybody, and then they try to do a contact mapping to see if they can identify how it came to campus, but at this point, they're not optimistic they will find what's called the index case.'\n\nBarreira said preventive measures against mumps include practicing hygienic habits like hand washing and refraining from sharing eating utensils, seeing a doctor at the onset of mumps-like symptoms, and isolating suspected cases early.\n\n'We examine and identify clinically people who are at risk, do a buccal swab to check for virus, then we communicate to the college,' Barreira said. 'Then the college notifies the house and then identifies the room that they're going to move into.'\n\nThe Cambridge Public Health Department mandates that students infected with mumps be quarantined in a single room with an individual bathroom for 5 days. Since most dorm rooms share a bathroom, students are housed elsewhere on campus, according to Barreira.\n\nIn an emailed statement, college spokesperson Rachael Dane said the college is 'utilizing various locations on campus for students who need to self-isolate, including rooms in some of the houses and Harvard-owned properties. We are also taking special precautions with regards to cleaning these spaces, with Facilities Maintenance Operations custodians undergoing special training cleaning the rooms and disposing of waste,' Dane wrote.\n\n99 percent of undergraduates have been vaccinated against mumps, according to Barreira. Barreira added that although some other universities verify mumps immunizations through a questionnaire, Harvard requires documentation of the vaccine.\n\n'In this state, we require 2 shots, one month apart,' Barreira said. 'We often test to see if there's adequate antibodies too. In some states around the country, they only require one shot, which by [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] standards is considered under-immunization.'\n\nThough some Harvard affiliates have asked whether a 3rd booster shot for all students would help prevent the spread of the virus, Barreira said there is no evidence that a 3rd booster shot would provide more immunity.\n\n'The CDC is very clear in their recommendations that a 3rd shot doesn't provide more immunity,' Barreira said. 'So if you've been well vaccinated, there's no indication that a 3rd shot will give you any more protection.'\n\nAs undergraduates prepare for spring break, university administrators will send 'a message encouraging responsible behavior when traveling with respect to careful hygiene and not using public transportation if ill,' Barreira wrote in an email.\n\nIn the meantime, administrators are informing parents of students about the recent mumps outbreak.

All of the confirmed cases attend Belgrade High School or Belgrade Middle School.\n\nMumps is a viral disease characterized by swelling of the parotid or salivary glands along the face, neck, and jaw. The swelling can last from 2 to 10 days. The incubation period, (time from when you were infected to when you have symptoms) is 12-25 days. Other symptoms, in addition to the swelling around the neck and jaw, include fever, malaise (tiredness), muscle aches, and headache. Up to 25% of people with mumps may have few or no symptoms.\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person. Saliva can pass from one person to another when they share straws, spoons, forks, cups, cans, bottles, and even lip gloss. Mumps is also commonly spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and a non-infected person inhales respiratory droplets that contain the virus.\n\nIf you do have mumps, you should avoid prolonged, close contact with other people until at least 5 days after your salivary glands begin to swell because you are contagious during this time.\n\nParents of children who may be most susceptible to mumps will be notified by staff from Gallatin City-County Health Department who will provide information and health care guidance. In most cases, students who are most susceptible to mumps are those who have not been vaccinated against the disease.\n\nThe good news is that guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control has determined that unimmunized students can return to school immediately if they are vaccinated against mumps.\n\nStudents who have religious or medical exemptions for the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine may be excluded from school for 25 days or more, depending on the course of the outbreak. But again, if students are vaccinated with the MMR vaccine they can return to school immediately.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Montana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35926. Gallatin County, in southern Montana, can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/montana-county-map.gif.\n\nFrom 2000 through 2012, an average of 1135 mumps cases (range: 229 to 6584) were reported annually in the United States. Large outbreaks occurred in 2006 (6584 cases) and in 2009 and 2010 (approximately 3500 cases). Outbreaks occurred primarily among previously vaccinated persons in densely populated settings (colleges and religious communities). A provisional total of 438 mumps cases were reported in 2013.\n\nMMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children age 12 through 15 months, with a 2nd dose at age 4 through 6 years. The 2nd dose is not a booster, but rather is intended to produce immunity in the small number of people who fail to respond to the 1st dose. 2-5% of people do not develop measles immunity after the 1st dose of vaccine. This occurs for a variety of reasons.\n\nTo protect against mumps, adults with no evidence of immunity should get 1 dose of MMR unless the adult is in a high-risk group. High-risk people need 2 doses and include healthcare personnel, international travelers, and students at post-high school educational institutions, among others (excerpted/edited from http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_mmr.asp).\n\nMumps is no longer common in the United States, but periodic mumps outbreaks occur, particularly in winter and spring, and cases may still occur despite prior vaccination.

Symptoms include fever, muscle pain, headache, fatigue and, ultimately, the swelling. It's mostly viewed as a children's disease but can also infect adults, including some who were infected as children or had vaccinations that have worn off over time.\n\nDoctors in Trondheim alerted state officials at the Institute for Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet) late last week. By then, cases were spreading beyond Trondheim. All students suffering symptoms that can be confused with flu were urged to undergo testing.

Students are also being urged to keep their distance from each other.\n\n'Try to maintain a 6-foot distance from other individuals, which admittedly isn't possible in many classroom environments,' says a mass communication just sent to students and their families, advising them about protecting themselves and the rest of the community from the mumps outbreak that began in April 2015 and escalated over the summer.\n\nHealth officials have linked most cases of mumps, a highly contagious viral illness, to the UI campus. There were 101 confirmed cases as of Wednesday [16 Sep 2015?], according to Champaign-Urbana Public Health District Administrator, Julie Pryde. Most mumps cases have been mild, since they've involved people who have been vaccinated with the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine. But there remains a potential for a serious case among those who aren't able to safely receive the vaccine, Pryde said.\n\nThe health district and the UI McKinley Health Center have been steadily giving an extra, 3rd dose of the vaccine to students, faculty and staff since early August 2015 in hope of getting the outbreak under control before most students returned for the fall [2015] semester, and other students were asked to get an extra vaccine dose before they returned to campus. But officials have yet to see the outbreak tail off.\n\nWith the rest of the students back on campus now, she said, 'it has the potential to explode. That's what we're trying to avoid. All of a sudden, the kids are back.' Those who haven't had an extra MMR shot have 2 extra chances to get one at vaccination clinics being held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday [23-24 Sep 2015] at the Illinois Union.\n\nPryde said the public health district has also blanketed medical providers throughout Illinois with information about mumps and urged them to test anyone with mumps symptoms, since this isn't an illness often seen these days. One thing that has horrified her, she said, is that there have been adults walking around in this outbreak with clear cases of mumps that were misdiagnosed. 'We've talked about it incessantly,' she said.\n\nDr. Robert Palinkas, director of the UI McKinley Health Center, said all mumps outbreaks that have occurred at universities over the past decade have involved vaccinated students. That's because the blended MMR vaccine involves a strong component for measles, but the vaccine for mumps is only 89 percent effective.\n\nPalinkas told students and faculty at a Senate Executive Committee meeting on Monday [21 Sep 2015] that since there's no treatment for mumps, the only options are to provide booster shots, isolate those who get sick, and try to do something difficult to do on campus, inhibit social interaction.\n\n'I had to go to a kid's apartment today [22 Sep 2015] and drag him to McKinley under threat of whatever and make him call his mom to come get him, because he didn't want to leave town because it was the 1st week of school, and he had mumps,' he said. 'So it's a struggle.'\n\nHealth officials always notify roommates and housing units when a student gets mumps, but 'at this point, it's going to be a more careful and thoughtful process of excluding more and more people,' who may have been exposed, given that several thousand students might not be immune to the disease, he said. Students 'are not going to be happy with some of the sanctions,' he said. 'It will be a challenge.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is an acute viral disease that is spread from person to person by coughing or sneezing. Some people may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms, but they can still pass the virus on to others.\n\nThe symptoms of mumps include a low-grade fever and swelling or tenderness of one or more of the salivary glands in the cheeks and under the jaw. In males who have gone through puberty, up to 30 percent may experience testicular pain and swelling.\n\nSymptoms usually appear between 12 and 25 days after a person has been exposed to the mumps virus. As many as 30 to 40 percent of infected people will not have symptoms, and nearly 50 percent will have non-specific or mostly respiratory symptoms, with or without infection in the salivary glands.\n\nThere is a vaccine to protect against mumps. The vaccine is given as part of a combination vaccine called the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella.\n\nVaccination of adults: To prevent mumps. adults born in 1957 or later including non-pregnant women of childbearing age who do not have a medical contraindication should receive at least one dose of the MMR vaccine, unless they can document that they have received at least one dose of mumps-containing vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of immunity to the disease.\n\nCollege and university students, healthcare personnel, and international travelers are at increased risk for mumps and should receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of immunity to ensure adequate protection.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is very safe and highly effective with few side effects. Mild reactions such as fever, redness, or swelling at the injection site have been reported.

The vaccine is given as part of a combination vaccine called the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella.

Pryde said the public health district has also blanketed medical providers throughout Illinois with information about mumps and urged them to test anyone with mumps symptoms, since this isn't an illness often seen these days. \n\nDr. Robert Palinkas, director of the UI McKinley Health Center, said all mumps outbreaks that have occurred at universities over the past decade have involved vaccinated students.

The outbreak is among a group of residents and health care personnel.\n\nOfficials believe the source of the infection is thought to be a person who recently moved to Colorado from Iowa with additional infections resulting from exposures in a health care setting. Iowa has been experiencing an ongoing outbreak of mumps since July 2015.\n\nWhile infectious, the person socialized with a group of 3 friends who all subsequently developed unilateral parotid swelling and tenderness in late January [2016].

'Not having a high awareness that mumps in the community leads to other spread,' said Young.\n\nYoung said all 6 of the adult patients had been vaccinated against the disease. She said the mumps vaccine is about 88 percent effective and immunity can wane after about 15 to 20 years. 'Right now, we're not recommending another vaccine. But we'll wait for further guidance from the CDPHE (Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment),' said Young.\n\nMumps cases are usually mild, but some can have serious complications. 'Some of those are inflammation of the brain or encephalitis, inflammation of the testes which can lead to fertility problems in men or inflammation of the ovaries or breasts in women,' explained Young.\n\nDenver Health is contacting those who visited Denver Health Adult Urgent Care Clinic on 28, 30, 31 Jan, 2 Feb 2016.\n\nAdditional Information from the Colorado Department of Health and Environment\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMumps is a viral infection that can cause painful swelling of one or more of the salivary glands, typically the parotid glands. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, malaise, and headache, but approximately 1/3rd of infected persons do not have clinically apparent illness so cases often go undetected. Severe complications from mumps are rare, but can include inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord, inflammation of the ovaries and/or breast, sterility, orchitis, spontaneous abortion, or deafness. Despite high vaccination rates and an effective vaccine, cases are likely to occur among vaccinated individuals because the vaccine is not 100 percent effective (estimated effectiveness for 2 doses is 88 percent) and vaccine-induced immunity can wane.\n\nInfection control\n-----------------\nMumps is transmitted by direct contact with respiratory droplets or saliva from an infected person. Mumps may be spread by freshly contaminated fomites. The average incubation period is 16-18 days, with a range of 12-25 days. The period of maximum communicability is from 1-2 days before onset of salivary gland swelling to 5 days after onset of salivary gland swelling.\n\nFor disease investigation purposes, consider mumps cases infectious 2 days prior to salivary gland swelling through 6 days of swelling (5 days after swelling onset with the day of onset counted as day 0).\n\n[Byline: Kathy Walsh]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] USA (Kentucky): increase in activity mumps\nDate: Sun 21 Feb 2016\nSource: Beacon Transcript [edited]\nhttp://www.beacontranscript.com/the-mumps-is-spreading-like-wildfire-in-the-us/5343/\n\n\nThe University of Kentucky has recently reported that the health authorities identified 3 more cases of mumps among students. According to the CDC, the mumps is spreading like wildfire in the US, with 69 confirmed cases so far.\n\nMostly viewed as a childhood disease, mumps can have some nasty effects once you grow older. And even as a child, it can put your life at risk. The mumps, also called epidemic parotitis (the inflammation of the salivary glands), is mainly caused by the mumps virus.\n\nThe most common symptoms associated with this disease are fever, headache and muscle pain. However, some of the patients reported fatigue after contracting the mumps virus. These symptoms usually resurface within an interval of 16 to 18 days, although in some cases it may take longer (12 to 25 days).\n\nAccording to the medical literature, most of the symptoms associated with epidemic parotitis are mild, but, in some instances, the patients can suffer from complications. The CDC notes that the most common complication associated with the mumps are meningitis or inflammation of the brain. Approximately 15 percent of the patients diagnosed with the mumps can suffer from this complication.\n\nThe virus can also induce pancreatitis in approximately 4 percent of the patients. Perhaps the most severe complication that can occur is permanent deafness. Moreover, it is also a known fact that older patients treated for the mumps can become infertile.\n\nOther complications associated with this childhood disease are swelling of the testicles or of the ovaries and swelling of the breasts.\n\nHow is the disease transmitted? According to the CDC, everyone infected with the mumps virus is a carrier, regardless of how severe the case is. Usually, epidemic parotitis is transmitted by droplets of saliva or mucus from an infected person. Anyone who is infected can infect others in return through sneezes, coughs or talking. Sharing personal objects like toothbrushes, towel or cups can also help the virus to spread.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for the disease, only supportive care. In case someone comes down with mumps, doctors recommend lots of bed rest, fluids and if necessary, to apply either ice or heat to the neck or to the groin. If the pain becomes acute, the patient can take pain relief medicine like acetaminophen.\n\nMoreover, the doctors have noted that gargles with water and soft food may ease the symptoms. As precautionary methods, the physicians urge their patients not to take aspirin for mumps. In some children, taking aspirin has caused another disease called Reye's syndrome.\n\nThe mumps is spreading like wildfire in the US, and the CDC recommends that all who have been exposed should go to the nearest clinic in order to receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine.\n\n[Byline: Angelina Stapp]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is no longer very common in the United States. From year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example, 2010 was a peak year with 2612 cases, while in 2012, there were 229. In 2014 and 2015, there were 1223 and 1057 cases, respectively. Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 per cent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.\n\nIn some years, there are more cases of mumps than usual because of outbreaks. Mumps outbreaks can occur any time of year but often occur in winter and spring.\n\nMMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. Two doses of the vaccine are 88 per cent (range: 66-95 per cent) effective at protecting against mumps; one dose is 78 per cent (range: 49-92 per cent) effective.

State disease tracking information suggests most of those reports have come within the last couple of weeks. Typically there are zero to one cases of mumps reported a year in Johnson County, Beardsley said. 'It is unusual,' Beardsley said. 'It's an unnecessary illness.'\n\nMumps can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which is administered to most kids in the United States during the first few years of their lives. The MMR [mumps measpes and rubella] vaccination is a requirement for kids in Iowa's public education system, licensed child care centers and at public universities. Exemptions are granted for religious and health reasons.\n\nLast week the University of Iowa urged students to get up-to-date on their vaccinations before returning to campus after 6bb cases of the mumps were reported among UI students in the past few weeks.\n\nBeardsley said it's possible for the disease to spread even among people who have been vaccinated. 'Even if you have been vaccinated you should stay away from someone [infected with mumps],' said Beardsley.\n\nMumps is a viral disease that includes fever, muscle pain, headache, tired feeling and swelling of the throat. Symptoms are usually benign, but can last for a couple of weeks.\n\n[Byline: Mark Carlson, KCRG-TV9]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is a contagious infection caused by mumps virus, a member of the family _Paramyxoviridae_. Mumps is most common in children over the age of 2 who have not been vaccinated, and also causes disease in unvaccinated teenagers and young adults, although older people may contract the disease as well.\n\nOnce a person has become infected with mumps, it takes 2-3 weeks for the symptoms to appear. However, an infected person can spread the infection even when they do not have any symptoms -- the disease is contagious from 7 days before and up to 9 days after the onset of symptoms. It can be a potentially serious disease for children and young adults.\n\nThe virus causes salivary glands to become swollen and tender on 1 or both sides of the face, resulting in enlarged cheeks. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite, and can last up to 10 days.

It claimed many outbreaks were linked to schools, colleges and universities as well as among families.\n\nThe centre, which monitors all infectious disease in the Republic, also observed the vaccination status of patients was not routinely available or reported. Such data were not available in 41 percent of all cases.\n\nNevertheless, the centre said it appeared a large proportion of cases had received 1 to 3 doses of the MMR vaccine with a majority having had at least 1 vaccine. The vaccine, introduced in Ireland in 1988, protects against measles, mumps and rubella. It is usually given to children aged 12 months followed by a booster dose at 4 to 5 years.\n\nThe infection can be highly dangerous in older children and adults as it can lead to serious complications such as meningitis and encephalitis through secondary infection.\n\nAs there is no cure for mumps, treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms and preventing the further spread of infection.\n\nThe HPSC [Health Protection Surveillance Centre] said recent results were in line with other international outbreaks of mumps which had shown waning immunity to the mumps component of the MMR vaccine as a factor in a number of outbreaks of the disease.\n\nResearch has shown there were 1993 reported cases of mumps notified to the health authorities in the past 12-month period with outbreaks reported across most regions and all age groups.

Local media reports that a Champaign-Urbana Public Health District official said most of the patients had been vaccinated, so the illness hasn't been severe. However, health officials say the outbreak could grow.\n\nMumps is a contagious, vaccine-preventable, acute viral illness that is spread through droplets of saliva or through mucus of an infected person. According to the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), symptoms of mumps usually appear 14 days to 18 days after infection. They usually include fever, headache, tiredness, muscle aches, loss of appetite and swelling and tenderness of one or more of the salivary glands, usually the parotid gland (located just below the front of the ear at the angle of the jaw). In mild cases, the swelling may only last for 3-4 days but can last up to a week or more. Approximately 1/3rd of infected people do not exhibit symptoms.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for mumps, but there are treatments that can help relieve some symptoms. Persons with symptoms of mumps should contact their primary care physician. Persons that become very ill should seek medical attention. Mumps vaccine is the best way to prevent mumps. This vaccine is included in the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines.\n\nChildren should receive the 1st dose of mumps-containing vaccine at 12-15 months and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years. All adults born during or after 1957 should have documentation of one dose. Adults at higher risk, such as university students, health care personnel, international travelers and persons with potential mumps outbreak exposure should have documentation of 2 doses of mumps vaccine or other proof of immunity to mumps.\n\nSimple measures can be carried out to prevent the spread of mumps. Persons who are ill should remain home for 5 days after onset of salivary gland swelling to help contain the spread of the virus. In addition, make sure to wash your hands; don't share eating or drinking utensils; clean surfaces that are frequently touched and cover your cough or sneeze into a tissue or your sleeve -- do NOT cough or sneeze into your hand.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A comprehensive description of measles virus and measles disease can be accessed at the WHO Measles Factfile: Know the risks; check your status; protect yourself (http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/measles/en/). - Mod.CP]\n\n[The virus usually causes mild disease in children, but in adults can lead to complications, such as meningitis [inflammation of the membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain] and orchitis [inflammation of the testes, usually unilateral] which occurs in 20-30 percent of post-pubertal males and is a risk factor for testicular cancer, - Mod.JW\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/216.]", "summary": "Adults at higher risk, such as university students, health care personnel, international travelers and persons with potential mumps outbreak exposure should have documentation of 2 doses of mumps vaccine or other proof of immunity to mumps.

She said that mumps is not common in the highly vaccinated Kimberley population. 'We haven't had a case of mumps in the Kimberley since 2009, other than a few cases in the detention centres, so this is unusual.' The last outbreak started 8 years ago and infected 153 people. 'This was a prolonged mumps outbreak in a vaccinated Aboriginal population. So we're concerned that we may see something similar in 2015,' Ms Eastwood said.\n\nMumps is a virus spread via respiratory droplets and is regarded as highly infectious. 'The symptoms of mumps are fever, mild chest illness, headache, and the cardinal sign is swelling of the salivary glands, lumps behind and below the jaw, and pain near the ear when chewing.' While mumps typically resolves after 7-10 days, complications may include infections of the coverings of the brain, pancreatitis, permanent deafness, and painful testicular swelling.\n\nAlthough the Kimberley population is highly vaccinated, it is thought that immunity declines after 5 years, making infection possible. 'People who have been vaccinated who get mumps are not as unwell as people who haven't been vaccinated,' the public health nurse stated.\n\nRates of infection by mumps have decreased by 90 per cent since vaccination was [developed] in 1967. 'The rates before infection used to be 250 per 100 000 people. And that mainly occurred in children. And after the vaccination program, that's dropped to about 0.4 in a 100 000. But it just shows how infectious mumps is,' said the public health nurse. The vaccine is being used as a booster to try to prevent a wider outbreak in Kimberley. 'We're offering contacts of cases an additional vaccine [dose] to boost their immunity and try to control the spread of the disease.'\n\nHealth authorities are asking those infected to help stem the spread of the virus. 'If you have mumps, stay away from school, work and social gatherings. Tell people you've been in contact with [over] the week before that you have mumps, and tell them to go to the doctor if they get symptoms,' she said.\n\nThe public health nurse said that simple hygiene is the best way people can avoid infection from the mumps virus.

'We haven't determined a link between the cases, and there are 4 suspected cases in total that we're investigating,' Ferguson said on Thursday [28 May 2015].\n\nPeople can protect themselves from getting mumps by getting the free vaccination, part of the measles, mumps rubella (MMR) childhood vaccine. Two doses are required.\n\nStudents at both schools who choose not to be vaccinated will be kept home from school for a minimum of 16 days or until the outbreak is over, Ferguson said. If a student who is missing a 2nd dose of the vaccine agrees to get it, they can return to school.\n\nFerguson said that keeping kids at home is not a measure that's taken lightly by the health unit. 'We work with parents; we work with schools; we work with doctors to make sure kids are protected, but if there's an outbreak and they're not vaccinated, there's nothing we can do but remove them from school for their own protection,' he said.\n\nTamara Nugent, director of education for the Wellington Catholic District School Board, said the number of kids that will be affected is shifting. 'By the end of this week, I think we'll have a good sense of how many students there are,' she said. 'We know that it's very few. It's just a matter of records and making sure that the public health unit has those on file; that's often the case.'\n\nNugent said the board is working with the public health unit to take all of the 'preventative and precautionary measures' they can, such as encouraging kids to wash their hands and not share water bottles or musical instruments with mouthpieces.\n\nMumps is very contagious and can be spread by coughing, sneezing, kissing or using an object an infected person has recently used. Ferguson said it's unclear where the mumps outbreak started, but there are sporadic cases in Ontario, and the 1st case may have been brought into the area through travel.\n\nThe symptoms of mumps include fever, swollen glands, and headache. It's caused by a virus, and antibiotics cannot treat it, so doctors often let it run its course. Mumps used to be a rare disease but is now making somewhat of a comeback.\n\nWhile people born before 1970 are supposed to have natural immunity to the mumps, those born in the 1980s and 1990s may have missed getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine, which was introduced in 1996.\n\n[Byline: May Warren]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Public health Agency of Canada (2014) states that: Outbreaks of mumps continue to occur in Canada, and the proportion of cases aged 20 years and older has increased.

The illness is spread through person-to-person contact, notably coughing and sneezing that scatters infected droplets through the air. The vaccine's been available since the late 1960s. The College of Family Physicians of Ontario reported in a 2011 journal article by Dr. Scott Smith that mumps had over a decade reappeared in clusters in Canada, the U.S. and Britain.\n\n'Outbreaks in Canada have predominantly affected adolescents and young adults, in part because these individuals are too young to have acquired natural immunity from childhood exposure but too old to have received the benefit of the 2-dose MMR vaccine,' it stated.\n\nMumps made international headlines late in 2014 when 9 National Hockey League players became afflicted.\n\n[Byline: Vik Kisch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The city of Guelph is a community of over 120 000 people situated in the heart of southern Ontario, just 100 km west of Toronto.\n\nMumps symptoms typically appear 16 to 18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12 to 25 days after infection. Mumps is best known for the swelling of the cheeks and jaw that it causes, which is a result of parotitis (inflammation of the salivary glands). Mumps also causes fever and headache.

The short answer: Well, we almost did.\n\nOnce a common disease with painful and sometimes catastrophic results (sterility in men and miscarriages in pregnant women), mumps is a virus spread through saliva contact from person to person, from something as innocuous as touching the same counter surface as someone with the disease or as obvious as being near someone who sneezes.\n\nBut after the creation of the vaccine for mumps in 1967, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation in 1977 that it be a regular vaccine for toddlers, and the recommendation in 1990 that a 2nd dose of the vaccine be given to children about 4 years after the 1st, the number of cases dropped by about 98 percent.\n\nBut pockets of resistance to the eradication of the disease have persisted from several different quarters.\n\nThere are those who have resisted vaccinating their children, despite the proven success of the mumps vaccine, because of a variety of fears; there are about 10 percent of people who have been vaccinated whose bodies simply don't respond, so-called 'nonresponders' who are still susceptible; and there is some belief that the effectiveness of vaccination may wane over time, requiring that adults get an additional booster shot (the Allegheny County Health Department recommends all adults get a mumps booster).\n\nThere also appear to be people apparently along the lines of Penguins star Sidney Crosby who were vaccinated recently and appeared to respond well to the vaccination, but still contracted the disease.\n\n'As physicians, we were caught on our heels by this,' said Matt McCarthy, an infectious disease physician for Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City. 'Why is Sidney Crosby -- a young, healthy guy with a good response to the vaccine -- getting this disease? There's something that's not adding up.'\n\nPrior to becoming infected sometime in the past 3 weeks, presumably from an opponent on one of the other 4 teams with the infection, Mr. Crosby had a booster shot in February 2014 before he left for the Olympic Games in Russia.\n\nProbably as a result, his antibody count -- which would show whether his body could fight the disease off -- was high enough when the Penguins tested him and the rest of the team on 3 Dec 2014 that they didn't think he was even susceptible. Others on the team -- including Beau Bennett, who may also have the mumps -- and staff did have low antibody counts, though, and 19 of them were given booster shots of the vaccine on 6 Dec 2014.\n\nSo what is happening that is leading to this outbreak?\n\nResearch following a 2006 outbreak of mumps in the Midwest, primarily on college campuses, found that antibodies were higher in those with a more recent vaccine dose and that there were no set amounts of antibodies in people that appeared to be the safe level that definitively prevented the person from contracting the disease.\n\n'That's the problem,' said Jennifer Preiss, a family physician in Pittsburgh who works with Allegheny Health Network. 'No one knows at what level they're immune.'\n\nDr. Preiss said that in her 24 years of practice, she has had 3 patients with the disease, which is why it concerns her that young, healthy men are catching it now.\n\nSome researchers have questioned whether the 2006 outbreak, and others over the last 3 decades, could be the result of the United States' decision in 1992 to switch the vaccine of choice from one strain to another, in an effort to be more effective.\n\n'It's possible the switch in vaccines is part of these outbreaks,' Dr. McCarthy said. 'I had not considered it until today.'\n\nBut it is the small percentage of the population that is not immunizing their children that concerns Michael Green, who works with infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC.\n\nPrior to 1967, 'parents didn't have to look far to see someone suffering from these diseases we've largely eliminated with vaccines' like mumps and polio, he said. 'But now, you don't see a lot of people with mumps or polio, so people think, 'I don't have to vaccinate my child.' We need to push with parents that [think] vaccines are not [needed].'\n\nFortunately, Allegheny County children have high, 2-dose mumps vaccination rates, at 91 percent, largely because schools require it before admitting students, said Kristen Mertz, a medical epidemiologist at the Allegheny County Health Department.\n\nThere was only one confirmed mumps case in Allegheny County prior to the Penguins' cases, just 2 all of last year [2014], and none in 2010, 2011 or 2012, she said.\n\nDr. Green said Children's is monitoring the situation to see whether the staff has to isolate patients who met Mr. Bennett during a visit there Thursday [11 Dec 2014]. He visited with most of the rest of the team, though not Mr. Crosby, to deliver Christmas presents. The Penguins did not know then that Mr. Crosby had the disease or that Mr. Bennett might have it (test results are due back today [16 Dec 2014]).\n\n'Of course we're concerned' that any of the kids at Children's may have been infected, Penguins spokesman Tom McMillan said Monday [15 Dec 2014].

Research following a 2006 outbreak of mumps in the Midwest, primarily on college campuses, found that antibodies were higher in those with a more recent vaccine dose and that there were no set amounts of antibodies in people that appeared to be the safe level that definitively prevented the person from contracting the disease. \n\nDr. Preiss said that in her 24 years of practice, she has had 3 patients with the disease, which is why it concerns her that young, healthy men are catching it now. \n\nCenter Sidney Crosby, defenseman Olli Maatta, right winger Beau Bennett, winger Steve Downie and goalie Thomas Greiss were diagnosed with the disease late last year [2014] that also afflicted players on 4 other National Hockey League teams. Others on the team -- including Beau Bennett, who may also have the mumps -- and staff did have low antibody counts, though, and 19 of them were given booster shots of the vaccine on 6 Dec 2014. \n\nThe team canceled another event set for this Friday [19 Dec 2014] in which 17 needy families and kids were going to come to the rink to receive Christmas gifts and meet the team. \n\n'As physicians, we were caught on our heels by this,' said Matt McCarthy, an infectious disease physician for Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City. ' Once a common disease with painful and sometimes catastrophic results (sterility in men and miscarriages in pregnant women), mumps is a virus spread through saliva contact from person to person, from something as innocuous as touching the same counter surface as someone with the disease or as obvious as being near someone who sneezes. [It] doesn't make a whole lot of epidemiological sense to have such a confined outbreak in what is an adult population of a disease that is normally a childhood disease that is vaccine-preventable,' he said. \n\n'Of course we're concerned' that any of the kids at Children's may have been infected, Penguins spokesman Tom McMillan said Monday [15 Dec 2014]. ' \n\nThere also appear to be people apparently along the lines of Penguins star Sidney Crosby who were vaccinated recently and appeared to respond well to the vaccination, but still contracted the disease. Probably as a result, his antibody count -- which would show whether his body could fight the disease off -- was high enough when the Penguins tested him and the rest of the team on 3 Dec 2014 that they didn't think he was even susceptible. \n\nDr. Green said Children's is monitoring the situation to see whether the staff has to isolate patients who met Mr. Bennett during a visit there Thursday [Byline: Molly Born]\n\n--\n Mumps outbreaks even among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students where the intensity of exposure among students was presumed to have overcome the vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "mumps"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2014-12-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2015-01-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "1990-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00", "2006-03-25 00:00:00", "2014-12-06 00:00:00", "1992-03-25 00:00:00", "2012-03-25 00:00:00", "2015-01-07 00:00:00", "1967-03-25 00:00:00", "2014-02-25 00:00:00", "1977-03-25 00:00:00", "2014-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Pittsburgh", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Russia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Allegheny County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mercer County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States '", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2524005", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps - USA (06): (OH) update", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2524005", "date": "2014-06-06 15:33:43", "main_text": "MUMPS - USA (06): (OHIO) UPDATE\n*******************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 2 Jun 2014\nSource: The Global Dispatch [edited]\nhttp://www.theglobaldispatch.com/ohio-mumps-outbreak-tops-400-measles-outbreak-goes-over-200-200/\n\n\nThe number of mumps cases reported in Central Ohio has reached 404 cases as of today, according to a Columbus Public Health (CPH) press release Monday [2 Jun 2014]. 220 of the cases are linked to the Ohio State University outbreak that began in early March [2014].

As of Wednesday [19 Nov 2014], 10 laboratory-confirmed cases of mumps have been reported, with over 20 additional reports being investigated, including 2 in the Moscow community.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is the best way to prevent mumps. Students who have not previously had mumps or who have no record of any doses of MMR vaccine should receive 2 doses at least 28 days apart; students who received only 1 dose of MMR vaccine should receive a 2nd dose.

An infected person can spread the virus before being sick. The virus is also spread when someone with mumps touches items or surfaces without washing their hands, and then someone else touches the same item or surface and rubs their mouth or nose. Symptoms, which can appear up to 25 days after being exposed, may include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen or tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides of the head. The most common complication of mumps infection in adults is testicular inflammation. Rare complications include meningitis, encephalitis, inflammation of the ovaries, and deafness. Anyone experiencing symptoms compatible with mumps should contact their health care professional. Up to half of people with mumps have very mild or no symptoms and might not know they are infected.\n\nAnyone infected with the mumps virus should stay home for 5 days after symptoms begin, while minimizing close contact with other people. Infected people should avoid sharing drinks or eating utensils, cover all coughs and sneezes, wash their hands frequently with soap and water, and regularly clean frequently touched surfaces.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of mumps, see my comments in ProMED-mail post Mumps - USA: (OH) university students 20140308.2321285.\n\nNevertheless, mumps outbreaks even among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students where the intensity of exposure among students was presumed to have overcome the vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm).\n\nThe American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before enrollment (http://www.acha.org/topics/docs/CDC_ACHA_Mumps_Recommendations_Jul13.pdf).

Last night [20 May 2014] there were 18 confirmed cases reported over the last 5 days at the Radcliffe Square college [Brasenose College]. Health authorities are now working to contain the outbreak.\n\nThe college's bursar Philip Parker said: 'There have been 18 cases. All of those students have either gone home or we're segregating them from other students with a quarantine area. 'Of course we're concerned, but we've acted well and taken steps to contain it.' University spokesman Matt Pickles said: 'The college is working with the college nurse and doctors and taking advice from Health Protection Agency to ensure that the best advice and information is provided to students, including the signs and symptoms to look out for. The college is advising any students who suspect they might have mumps-like symptoms to stay in their room and phone the college nurse or GP for advice.'

It usually takes between 16 and 18 days for the symptoms to develop and people are infectious between 2 days before and 4 days after the start of symptoms. It spreads from person to person in the same way as a cold -- through coughs, sneezes, and saliva.\n\nIt is important to protect teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated against the infection, which can develop into meningitis or other serious complications.\n\nThere was a similar outbreak in March 2010, when 41 students from Oxford University and 4 from Oxford Brookes University contracted the virus.\n\nStudents are being urged to have a 2nd dose of the MMR vaccine to ensure they are protected.\n\n[byline: Alex Wynick]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before college enrolment (http://www.acha.org/topics/docs/CDC_ACHA_Mumps_Recommendations_Jul13.pdf).\n\nNevertheless, mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students, where the intensity of exposure among students presumably overcomes vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm).

If you experience mumps symptoms (fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and swelling of the cheek and jaw area) contact your private healthcare provider.\n\nIt's a campus expectation that anyone suspected of having mumps stays home from school, work, or similar activities for 5 days.

Columbus Public Health officials say the number of confirmed cases of mumps now totals 13. A total of 7 women and 6 men between the ages of 18 and 22 have tested positive for the highly contagious disease.\n\nCPH medical director Doctor Mysheika Williams Roberts said the majority of the students who have mumps report receiving their childhood vaccinations.\n\n'The mumps component of the MMR vaccine has traditionally been known to be 80-90 percent effective, so it's not unusual,' Roberts said, for some people to contract the disease. 'And when they've had other large outbreaks of this size or larger at college campuses, we have seen a considerable number of cases who were vaccinated.'

It can lead to infertility in men, and women can have ovarian swelling. The disease also can lead to viral meningitis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is a contagious infection that is caused by the mumps virus (family Paramyxoviridae). Mumps is spread in respiratory droplets, and the incubation period is 14-25 days (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/mumps.pdf). As many as 20 percent of mumps infections are asymptomatic. An additional 40 to 50 percent may have only nonspecific symptoms. The illness is characterized by low-grade fever, headache, and myalgias, followed by swelling and tenderness of salivary glands, usually the parotid gland. Complications include orchitis, oophoritis, meningitis, and pancreatitis. Mumps has also been associated with sudden onset of unilateral sensorineural deafness in children that may rarely be permanent and may be associated with vestibular symptoms (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3767776).\n\nThe mumps vaccine was licensed in 1967 and is usually administered as part of a combination vaccine that provides protection against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4708.pdf). Live mumps virus vaccines in the United States are derived from the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine strain. Post-licensure studies in the United States demonstrated that 1 dose of mumps vaccine was 78-91 percent effective in preventing clinical mumps with parotitis; a study from the United Kingdom indicated a vaccine effectiveness of 88 percent for 2 doses of MMR vaccine compared with 64 percent for a single dose (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5522a4.htm). The MMR vaccine in the United States is given in 2 doses: The 1st dose is given at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose before entering school, at 4-6 years of age (http://www.vaccines.gov/diseases/mumps/index.html).\n\nNevertheless, mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students where the intensity of exposure among students was presumed to have overcome the vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm).\n\nThe American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before enrollment (http://www.acha.org/publications/docs/acha_ripi_mar2011.pdf). Immune globulin is not effective postexposure prophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/mumps.pdf). In an outbreak setting, MMR vaccine might reduce transmission to susceptible persons not yet exposed to the mumps virus. The CDC has evaluated use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control during 2 previous mumps outbreaks in which transmission was sustained, despite high 2-dose coverage (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6148a2.htm). During both outbreaks, targeted vaccination was followed by a decrease in mumps incidence among the target group.\n\nThe Ohio State University (OSU) is a large public research university in Columbus, Ohio, with about 28 000 undergraduates and more than 35 on-campus residence halls, with additional separate housing for graduate and professional students, plus multiple extra-curricular organizations where social mixing can occur (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University).

Until the announcement Wednesday, individual health departments were tracking community cases if not related to the OSU outbreak. Amato said local health departments will still track and record the cases within their area, but ODH will track the outbreak as a whole and report compiled numbers to the media in the mornings.\n\nThe 1st cases of mumps, a viral illness spread from person to person by droplets from the nose and mouth, were seen at OSU in February [2014]. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), close quarters in university dorms makes spreading the virus easy. In March [2014], cases began appearing in other communities without ties to the university outbreak.\n\nDGHD director of personal health Joan Bowe said recommendations for Delaware [County] residents have not changed: get vaccinated. Children should be vaccinated with MMR [measles mumps rubella vaccine] on or after their 1st birthday, followed by a 2nd dose at 4 to 6 years of age. Adults may receive a booster, which is recommended for post-secondary students and health care workers, according to the CDC. Adults born before 1957 are considered to have natural immunity as most had the virus before the vaccine was introduced to the public.\n\nThe 10 cases in Delaware [County] have occurred in residents ranging in age from 11 to 47. Cases at OSU have occurred in men and women between the ages of 18 and 58, while the other cases have shown up in residents of Columbus and Franklin County between the ages of 2 and 55.\n\n'Mumps is a reportable disease, which means physicians are mandated to contact the health department to report a suspect case and to let us know if they are sending blood in for lab work,' said DGHD spokesperson Traci Whittaker. 'We work with our local healthcare providers throughout the investigation, including receiving updated lab results as they become available.'\n\nThe [OHD] defines a mumps outbreak as 3 or more probable or confirmed cases clustered in a time and place, and the cases are likely related. Prior to lab confirmation, mumps reports are considered suspect -- unless an outbreak has been declared. In the event of an outbreak, all cases without confirmation are considered probable.\n\nSymptoms include fever, body aches, fatigue, swelling of salivary glands, or pain with chewing or swallowing. Up to 15 percent of people with mumps may also experience stiff neck and headache. Men may also experience orchitis, a testicular inflammation that causes pain, swelling, nausea, vomiting and fever. Some women may experience symptoms of inflammation of the ovaries and breasts. Symptoms usually begin 14 to 18 days after catching the virus, but the virus can be spread to others before symptoms even occur, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Transmission is likely before the salivary glands begin to swell and within 5 days after the swelling starts.\n\nAbout 1/3rd of patients will show mild symptoms or no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, residents are encouraged to contact their primary care provider. Residents can contact their primary care provider or the [DGHD] for vaccine availability at 740-368-1700.\n\nDGHD also recommends prevention through frequent hand washing, covering mouth and nose during a cough or sneeze, and not sharing cups or utensils. CPH recommends staying home and away from others for 5 days after symptoms begin.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2013, Delaware [County] had 5 cases of mumps reported -- the most recent of which was in 2009 -- and all were classified as suspect. No confirmed or probable cases of mumps were reported between 2004 and 2013 in Delaware County, and no mumps outbreaks were recorded in Delaware County during that time.\n\nMore information about mumps is available from the CDC at http://www.cdc.gov/mumps.\n\n[Byline: Stacy Kess]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail recently posted a report of the mumps outbreak on the OSU campus in the city of Columbus, Ohio, at which time there was a total of 13 confirmed cases of mumps -- 7 women and 6 men between 18 and 22 years of age (ProMED-mail post Mumps - USA: (OH) university students 20140308.2321285).

Live mumps virus vaccines in the US are derived from the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine strain. Post-licensure studies in the United States demonstrated that 1 dose of mumps vaccine was 78-91 percent effective in preventing clinical mumps with parotitis; a study from the United Kingdom indicated a vaccine effectiveness of 88 percent for 2 doses of MMR vaccine compared with 64 percent for a single dose (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5522a4.htm).

Immune globulin is not effective postexposure prophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/mumps.pdf). In an outbreak setting, MMR vaccine might reduce transmission to susceptible persons not yet exposed to the mumps virus. The CDC has evaluated use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control during 2 previous mumps outbreaks in which transmission was sustained, despite high 2-dose coverage (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6148a2.htm).

Dr Vicky Sheppeard, the director of communicable diseases for NSW Health, said there have been 15 reported cases of the disease in May [2013], clustered in several areas. It's highly likely more cases have not been reported. She said that the disease can be very serious for affected adults. 'Complications can include swelling of the testicles in males, and rarely inflammation of the brain, the lining of the brain and spinal cord, pancreatitis and hearing loss,' she said. A mumps infection during pregnancy can result in miscarriage, and the ovaries and testicles can also be affected.\n\nWhile most children are vaccinated against the disease, Dr Sheppeard said that many adults would not have any resistance to it, as the required 2 doses weren't routinely offered until the 1990s. 'Many people in their 20s, 30s, and early 40s will not be immune, so it is particularly important they check their status with their doctor and get vaccinated if they are not sure,' she said.\n\n'To prevent the spread of mumps, children and adults should have 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.' Symptoms of the disease include fever, loss of appetite, and tiredness and headaches, followed by swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands, especially near the jaw. Up to one-third of sufferers, however, have no symptoms. Mumps can be caught by breathing in the virus after a sufferer coughs or sneezes, or by direct saliva contact. It can then take 2 to 3 weeks to develop, and affected people are infectious a week before and up to 9 days after the glands have swollen. There is no specific treatment for mumps.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The consequences of mumps infection in adults include pain and swelling of the testicles (orchitis), which affects one in 5 of all males who get mumps after puberty. The swelling of their testicles normally begins 4 to 8 days after the swelling of the parotid gland. Occasionally, swelling can occur up to 6 weeks after the swelling of the glands. The swelling is usually very sudden and affects only one testicle. Just under half of all males who get mumps-related orchitis will notice some shrinkage of their testicles and an estimated 1 in 10 men will experience a drop in their sperm count.\n\nViral meningitis can occur if the mumps virus spreads into the outer protective layer of the brain which is known as the meninges. It occurs in one in 7 cases of mumps. Unlike bacterial meningitis, which is regarded as a potentially life-threatening medical emergency, viral meningitis causes much milder, flu-like symptoms, and the risk of serious complications are low. Sensitivity to light and vomiting are common symptom of viral meningitis. The symptoms of viral meningitis usually pass within 14 days.\n\nOne in 20 females who gets mumps after puberty will experience swelling of your ovaries (oophoritis), which can cause symptoms of lower abdominal pain, high temperature, and sickness. The symptoms of oophoritis are usually short-lived. One in 20 cases of mumps leads to pancreatitis. The most common symptom is the sudden pain in the centre of the upper abdomen. Other symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include sickness, diarrhoea, fever, and less frequently jaundice.\n\nRare but potentially serious complications of mumps include encephalitis (1 in 1000 cases) or permanent hearing loss (1 in 20 000 cases).\n\nAbstracted from NHS Choices http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Mumps/Pages/Complications.aspx. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/4966.]", "summary": "\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The consequences of mumps infection in adults include pain and swelling of the testicles (orchitis), which affects one in 5 of all males who get mumps after puberty.

Interim university president Joseph A Alutto appointed a mumps advisory executive team last week to review university policies, OSU spokeswoman Liz Cook said. The group will 'take a very careful and closer look at the outbreak and really try to determine next steps to really protect the university campus and the greater community,' she said.\n\nCook said she did not know whether the team was to specifically consider requiring students to be vaccinated before attending Ohio State. Some other schools mandate vaccination against mumps, but Ohio State does not. The advisory team has yet to meet, and Cook said she did not know when members would conclude their discussions or issue a report or recommendations.\n\nOutbreak cases have now been found in the following counties: Franklin (135), Delaware (12), Athens (1), Belmont (1), Fairfield (1), Hamilton (1), Licking (1), and Pickaway (1).\n\nOne of 2 people who became temporarily deaf as a result of the mumps has recovered, said Columbus Public Health spokesman Jose Rodriguez. There are now 6 cases of orchitis (swollen testicles) associated with the outbreak, he said. The condition can lead to sterility, though that is rare.\n\nRodriguez said news that a baby was sickened was particularly troubling. Babies under a year old are too young to have received a vaccine and are especially vulnerable, as are older children and adults who have not had both rounds of the vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella.\n\n[byline: Misti Crane]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail recently posted reports of the mumps outbreak that started on the Ohio State University (OSU) campus in the city of Columbus, Ohio and then spread into the surrounding counties (Delaware, Franklin, Fairfield, Licking, and Union) in central Ohio, but also involved Hamilton County in the south western portion of the state, in which the city of Cincinnati is located. As of the last previous post (4 Apr 2014) the total number of cases was 129. Now there are 153 cases, with 3 additional counties involved (Athens in south eastern, Belmont in eastern, and Pickaway in central Ohio), although most cases continue to be in Franklin County in which the city of Columbus and OSU are located.\n\nThe mumps vaccine is administered as part of a combination vaccine that provides protection against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4708.pdf). The MMR vaccine in the United States is given in 2 doses: the 1st dose is given at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose before entering school, at 4-6 years of age (http://www.vaccines.gov/diseases/mumps/index.html).

However, the news report above says that OSU does not mandate immunization against mumps before matriculation. Nevertheless, mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students where the intensity of exposure among students was presumed to have overcome the vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm). Perhaps waning post-vaccination immunity and antigenic differences between outbreak strains and the vaccine viruses are additional explanations for mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/11/1458.full).\n\nCDC has evaluated use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control during 2 previous mumps outbreaks in which transmission was sustained, despite high 2-dose coverage (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6148a2.htm).

Nevertheless, mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students where the intensity of exposure among students was presumed to have overcome the vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm). The American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before college enrolment (http://www.acha.org/topics/docs/CDC_ACHA_Mumps_Recommendations_Jul13.pdf). Perhaps waning post-vaccination immunity and antigenic differences between outbreak strains and the vaccine viruses are additional explanations for mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/11/1458.full). The mumps vaccine is administered as part of a combination vaccine that provides protection against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4708.pdf).

The majority of cases is in fully immunized young adults and may have spread to household and other close contacts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all children and adults of vaccination age have 2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Strict enforcement of vaccination is important for preventing and stopping outbreaks. Mumps vaccine (usually MMR) is the best way to prevent mumps. Children should be given the 1st dose of MMR vaccine soon after the 1st birthday (12 to 15 months of age). The 2nd dose is recommended before the start of kindergarten.\n\nSymptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite; followed by swelling of salivary glands. The parotid salivary glands (which are located within the cheek, near your jaw line, below your ears) are most frequently affected. While rare, other severe complications are possible -- seeking medical attention at the onset of symptoms is important.\n\nMumps occurs worldwide and there are still outbreaks in the United States. Humans are the only known host to mumps. Outbreaks can occur in highly immunized populations, most often in people who have not been immunized; however, there have been outbreaks in individuals who are fully immunised. Mumps virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract and is spread through direct contact with respiratory secretions or saliva. The infectious period or time that an infected person can transmit mumps to a non-infected person is from 3 days before symptoms appear to about 9 days after the symptoms appear. The incubation time, which is the period from when a person is exposed to virus to the onset of any symptoms, can vary from 16 to 18 days (range 12-25 days).\n\nIndividuals, whether they have been vaccinated against mumps or not, [who] exhibit the above symptoms, need to seek medical attention immediately to be evaluated. Anyone who is being considered [as] having a possible case of mumps needs to be appropriately excluded from social settings that may enable transmission, and should be immediately reported to the Ocean County Health Department. Anyone with mumps should not go back to child care, school or work for at least 5 days after symptoms begin. It is extremely important that individuals who may have been in contact with a suspected mumps case should be educated on the signs and symptoms of mumps and should seek medical attention if any of these symptoms begin.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Unfortunately, this report provides little information concerning the number of cases diagnosed, the ages of the victims and their vaccination status. This information is important because the risks for transmission of measles, rubella, and mumps at post-high school educational institutions can be high because these institutions bring together large concentrations of persons who may be susceptible to these diseases. Therefore (in the United States), colleges, universities, technical and vocational schools, and other institutions for post-high school education require that all undergraduate and graduate students have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before enrolment. Students who do not have documentation of MMR vaccination or other acceptable evidence of immunity at the time of enrolment should be admitted to classes only after receiving the 1st dose of MMR vaccine. These students should be administered a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine one month later (but no sooner than 28 days after the 1st dose).\n\nLakewood Township is a township in Ocean County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census the township had a total population of 92 843. The township ranked as the 7th-most-populous municipality in the state in 2010 after having been ranked 22nd in 2000. The sharp increase in population from 2000 to 2010 was led by increases in the township's Orthodox Jewish and Latino communities. Lakewood is one of the hubs of Orthodox Judaism and is home to one of the largest yeshivas in the world. The large Orthodox population comprises more than half of the township's population. This may explain the occurrence of mumps virus infection in the township, since Orthodox Jewish communities in general decline to have their children vaccinated.\n\nA map of the counties of New Jersey showing the location of Ocean County can be accessed at: http://www.funnewjersey.com/upload_user/New_Jersey_State_info/MAP_OF_NEW_JERSEY_COUNTIES.HTM. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/7F8d.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n It is extremely important that individuals who may have been in contact with a suspected mumps case should be educated on the signs and symptoms of mumps and should seek medical attention if any of these symptoms begin.

Cases have been confirmed by doctors in St Hilda's and Corpus Christi, while students are reporting further unconfirmed cases in St John's. Cherwell understands that several students who have caught the illness are approaching exams.\n\nIn an email to Corpus students, the Welfare Dean Judith Maltby told the college, 'It has been brought to our attention that there are several cases of mumps within the University and there have been 2 confirmed cases within Corpus.' The email continued, 'If it is confirmed that you have the virus you will be encouraged to go home (where possible) for 5 days. If going home is not possible please contact the College Office immediately.'\n\nStudents have alleged that Corpus's Boat Club has been particularly affected. Students have stated that 2 M1 rowers, and one W1 rower, have been affected by the illness. Clare Franklin, President of Corpus Christi College Boat Club, told Cherwell, 'There have been 3 confirmed cases of mumps within the boat club, which is less than ideal in the run up to Summer Eights. However, all affected members have gone home, and we are hopeful that they will recover quickly.' Guy Ward, a 1st year lawyer and rower for Corpus, said, 'It's certainly not helping our Summer Eights efforts, as rowers tend to be fairly close. All it takes is one rower to get it and, due to the proximity, everybody is at risk.'\n\nThere have also been 4 reported cases in St Hilda's College. One medical student at St Hilda's commented, 'It seems like quite a few people have been affected, one of whom has had the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] jab. No one is safe.' Pete Evans, a 1st year German and Linguistics student at Hilda's, said, 'This outbreak is terrible for finalists. I hope the university takes the illness into account when marking exams, otherwise this could be disastrous for students.'\n\nOxford University's Exam Regulations make allowances for illness. They state in section 11, if the examiners 'consider, on the evidence of the work submitted, that but for the illness or other urgent cause affecting the candidate's performance, he or she would have obtained Honours, they may deem the candidate to have obtained Honours.'\n\nAn Oxford University spokesperson was unable to confirm the number of students affected by mumps, but stated, 'In any such case the network of college nurses and doctors will work in partnership with the local Health Protection Agency to take all the appropriate measures.' She added, 'Any student who suspects they might have mumps-like symptoms should stay in their room or at home and phone their college doctor, nurse or GP for advice.'\n\nMumps is a viral illness which is rarely fatal, but is highly contagious. Its symptoms include a headache and fever, followed by swelling and soreness of the parotid salivary gland, located behind the jaw. According to the Oxford University website, 'Over the last 4 years there has been a large outbreak of mumps in young adults across the UK and there has been a recent increase in mumps amongst students.' Scientists have linked the recent growth in mumps outbreaks to public opposition to the MMR jab, after a 1998 study linked the vaccination to autism. Its researcher, Andrew Wakefield, has since been struck off the medical register, and his conclusions are largely discredited. However, after his findings were reported globally, the number of children receiving the vaccination in the UK fell from 92 percent to below 80 percent. The last major outbreak was in 2008, when 1348 cases were confirmed, and 2 people died.\n\n[Byline: Rowan Borchers]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Outbreaks of mumps occur occasionally in universities and similar educational institutions where young adults from diverse backgrounds congregate.

Several patients have been admitted to hospital, though none has become seriously ill.\n\nThe Health Department's latest Virus Watch bulletin said there had been 3 new cases in the past week and urged GPs to be on the lookout for patients with the highly infectious viral illness. It said most of the Perth patients had been infected locally and were older teenagers or adults aged in their 20s and 30s, and many were partially or fully vaccinated against mumps. A department spokeswoman said yesterday that none of the confirmed cases was in young children. 'We are not aware of any cases with serious complications, although a few cases have been admitted to hospital with [mild] complications, including orchitis (swollen testicles) in men and meningitis,' she said. Although mumps is highly contagious, it is rarely seen any more because of the widespread use of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in childhood. But if untreated, it can lead to serious complications including meningitis, miscarriage, encephalitis, hearing loss and pancreatitis.\n\nThe department said the cases did not appear to be linked, suggesting mumps virus was in wide circulation and there were many other cases in the community not being detected. It said GPs should test for mumps in all patients showing signs, regardless of whether they had been vaccinated, using blood and urine tests and throat swabs. Symptoms of mumps include fever, loss of appetite, tiredness and headaches, followed by swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands. The infection spreads when a person breathes in mumps virus, usually after someone infected has coughed or sneezed. Doctors say people born after 1965 need to ensure they received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine and not just one, which might not provide enough protection.\n\n[Byline: Cathy O'Leary]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps disease occurs world-wide. Mumps vaccine is an attenuated virus included as a component of the MMR triple vaccine of childhood. Typically outbreaks of mumps occur where young adults are congregated together in university dormitories or under similar circumstances. Indeed nowadays some universities and similar institutions may require confirmation of previous mumps vaccination in childhood prior to admission of applicants. Even so outbreaks are not infrequent in such circumstances, hence the recommendation for revaccination wherever the disease reappears.\n\nThe reason for the reappearance of mumps among those vaccinated in childhood is attributed to waning immunity rather than the emergence of mumps virus antigenic variants in the population, although genetically distinct mumps virus strains are present globally.

The students who came down with mumps live on and off the North Baltimore campus. Mumps virus used to be very common in the United States among infants, children, and young adults, but became rare after a widespread vaccination campaign for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). The MMR vaccine is one of the recommended childhood immunizations, given first when a child is 12 to 15 months old and followed up with a 2nd shot, usually before the child enters school by age 6. The MMR vaccine is reputed to be 90 per cent effective, and like many schools, Loyola University requires the MMR vaccination for all enrolled students.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mumps symptoms start with several days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, which are followed by swelling of the salivary glands and testicular or ovarian inflammation within 2 to 4 weeks of infection. Half of the people who get mumps, however, show mild or no symptoms.\n\nMumps virus is contagious, and spreads through the saliva or mucus of an infected person. Anyone who is not already immune to the mumps virus from vaccination or previous infection can be afflicted by it. As one might imagine with a disease that spreads through bodily fluids, mumps outbreaks are most common in places that bring together many young people living in the same place, like summer camps and universities.\n\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, Loyola University officials notified the campus community of the 1st cases before spring break started on 4 Mar 2013, and sent a warning letter this week [week of 11 Mar 2013] about the growing number of cases.

The university is warning the campus about the outbreak, which heightened since early March [2013]. Virginia Health Department officials say they have lab-confirmed 5 to 10 cases of mumps. Another 10 patients showed symptoms which may be resulting from the virus. University officials say they wasted no time in warning everyone on and off campus. Emails were mass sent to students, parents, faculty and staff.\n\nMost children in the U.S. are immunized for MMR -- measles, mumps and rubella. Generally, you can't get into schools, including the University of Richmond, without [evidence of] those shots. However, doctors say that doesn't mean a rare outbreak of the virus can't happen. Dr. Parham Jaberi of the Virginia Department of Health says 'Mumps is a similar illness] to a cold [with symptoms of) fever, headache, muscle aches. People feel tired. They may have a loss of appetite,' said Jaberi. Another common symptom of mumps is swollen cheeks. Patients may also develop other inflammation of other organs, including testicular inflammation in men. Mumps is contagious. It's transferred through droplets of body fluid, mainly saliva. The best way to avoid mumps is to cover your mouth and wash your hands.\n\nDoctors say mumps is usually not serious and can be fended off in a few days.

These are cyclic outbreaks. There was one of such instances between 2001 and 2002, another one between 2005 and 2006, so now another outbreak was expected and it is occurring in Vigo, the most populated area of Galicia, compared with elsewhere in the autonomous region. So far this year [2013], 193 persons in Vigo have become infected with mumps.\n\nFor the last week for which official information is available, 4-11 Feb 2013, 39 persons became infected in Vigo, whereas in the rest of Galicia, 43 people became infected. So, what is going on in Vigo to explain this high incidence of mumps?\n\n'It is merely chance,' said the chief of the Epidemiological Alert Service in the Sanitation Council in this province. She explained that, for instance, the previous outbreak started in the Pontevedra area and then it spread outwards. 'We foresee that this outbreak may extend to the whole of Galicia.' Considering past experience, experts expect that this increase in the number of cases may last for the whole year. When measuring the incidence of a disease, the value is expressed as the number of (new) cases per 100 000 inhabitants. For 2012, the incidence of mumps in Galicia was 1.5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. During the last 4 weeks of 2012, the figure increased to 6.8 per 100 000. In Vigo at present, the incidence of mumps is 33.1 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. In other words, the figure has skyrocketed 22-fold.\n\nHealth officials do not completely know what has happened but several hypotheses have been proposed. A mumps vaccine is included in the routine immunization schedule. One dose is administered at 15 months of age and the other at 3 years, as part of the so called triple viral [MMR] vaccine, which also includes immunisation against measles and rubella. This schedule was introduced in Galicia in 1982. One hypothesis explaining this occurrence states that the triple vaccine may lose its effectiveness with time. Another hypothesis proposes that there may be a group of persons that missed one dose of vaccine because until 1999 the 2nd dose was administered at 11 years of age, and subsequently the vaccine was administered at 3 years of age. The 3rd hypothesis proposes that persons born before 1980, who never received the vaccine, may play a role in this occurrence [that is, the persistence of mumps virus infection].\n\nMs. Maria Jose Faraldo notes that mumps is 'a benign and mild viral infection'. Nowadays this condition is particularly affecting young people between 15 and 25 years of age. Many cases have been detected in different health centers in the city. Health authorities recommend that in order to avoid spreading the disease, affected persons not go to school or to their workplace during a 5 day period after the occurrence of swelling in the parotid gland area.\n\n[Byline: Angel Paniagua]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The periodicity of epidemics of mumps virus infection in Spain is an interesting phenomenon and may be a consequence of the properties of the vaccine strains incorporated into the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccines employed in earlier years.

Dr. Alemany explained that vaccines used in Spain before 1999 had a 50.5 percent antigen content [protective capacity?], whereas those vaccines used more recently, particularly those manufactured 'using more advanced technology,' have a 'much higher protection capacity,' between 88 and 90 percent. Dr. Alemany recognized that children vaccinated before 1999 have a 50.5 percent likelihood of being protected, meaning that 'they do not have a complete defense' against the disease as a consequence of the characteristics of that particular vaccine they had received.\n\nDr. Alemany also stated that, from an epidemiological point of view, 'being that this disease is quite communicable, we can expect that the number of cases of mumps in Madrid may increase,' but he pointed out that there is no [reason] for concern 'because of the typical characteristics of this condition.' Dr Alemany also stated that: 'It depends on the characteristics of the virus and climatic conditions, since outbreaks may occur more frequently during the cold season.' Dr. Alemany also indicated that cases of mumps are occurring in several autonomous communities, 'since viruses do not recognize borders or geographical limits.'\n\nAccording to Dr Alemany, mumps is a common disease during infancy 'that usually does not necessitate hospitalisation and can be treated at home with plenty of rest, lots of non-acidic fluids, with use of analgesics for alleviating headache or for temperature control.' He explained also that in many cases, a person may have the virus and not develop the disease, or he/she may develop a mild form of this condition.\n\nOn the other hand, Dr. Salvador Victoria, Counselor of the Presidency and Spokesman for the Madrid Community Local Government, stated last Thursday [14 Feb 2013] that the outbreak of mumps recorded in Madrid 'is similar to the situation occurring in other areas in Spain, and that it does not have a special significance.'\n\nAccording to the General Direction for Primary Care, the present situation is not a general outbreak, but it consists of 'local outbreaks occurring in specific sites' in which 'timely epidemiological investigations are being carried out.' When asked about this situation in a press conference after the Government Council meeting, Dr. Victoria explained that the Madrid Health Council had changed the vaccine in 1999 that was provided at that time by the Spanish Ministry of Health; and he mentioned also that in 2007, a vaccination campaign was carried out in 9- to 12-year old children, 'so they may have complete immunity against mumps.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Outbreaks of mumps have been frequent throughout Spain in recent years. The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after a person is infected with mumps virus. The average incubation period is around 17 days. Swelling of the parotid glands is the most common symptom of mumps. Both glands are usually affected by the swelling, although only one gland can be affected. The swelling can cause pain, tenderness, and difficulty with swallowing. Other symptoms of the mumps include: headache, joint pain, sickness, abdominal pain and fever.\n\nMumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu: via infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and passed into the mouth or nose. A person is most contagious 1-2 days before the onset of symptoms and for 5 days afterwards. During this time, it is important to try to prevent spreading the infection to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated. Normally, infection resolves without complications and provides life-long immunity.\n\nFor unvaccinated persons born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should consider vaccinating these individuals with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for measles and mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), respectively. For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and one dose during an outbreak of rubella.\n\nTwo doses of mumps vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective at preventing the disease; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49-92 percent) effective. The 1st vaccine against mumps was licensed in the United States in 1967, and by 2005, high 2-dose childhood vaccination coverage reduced disease rates by 99 percent. Adults at higher risk, such as university students, health care personnel, and international travelers, and persons with potential mumps outbreak exposure, should ensure that they have been vaccinated.

Until the end of November 2012, the island had seen 196 cases so far this year [2012]. More have been reported since the beginning of this month [December 2012]. Usually, the figures would be measured in dozens.\n\nDr Paul Emerson, consultant in public health medicine, said: 'It is down to a combination of things. In the 1990s, uptake of the MMR vaccine [among children] fell because of the Wakefield fiasco, which linked MMR to autism and which was proven to be unfounded.' That generation, now adolescents and in their 20s, have been hit in the latest outbreak. Those born before 1970, before vaccination, were more likely to have natural lifelong immunity. The MMR vaccine drops off in effectiveness 10 to 15 years after it's given. So anyone who had the jab when they were younger should see their GP again to get a booster.\n\n'Mumps is more serious in men,' said Dr Emerson. 'It can lead to sterility. It can lead to a nasty fever and pain in the groin area.' Women are also more likely to miscarry if they get mumps in the 1st trimester of a pregnancy. Dr Emerson stressed there was no evidence it could lead to foetal abnormalities.\n\nThe virus is not as infectious as measles or chicken pox. However, it is spread the same way as flu, though direct contact with saliva, coughing, sneezing, and kissing. Encounters under the mistletoe during the festive season might be best avoided. Dr Emerson advised anyone with mumps to treat the symptoms. Earlier this year [2012], St. George's football team was hit, as 5 players contracted the virus.\n\nAnecdotal reports received at Isle of Man newspapers suggest a number of school classes and workplaces have been affected. Mumps is a serious infection which can cause deafness, among other problems. The MMR vaccine is the best way to prevent mumps. It should be routinely given when children are 12 months old, and a 2nd dose should be given when they are 3 years 4 months old.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown Dependency; it is neither part of the United Kingdom nor the European Union, although its foreign relations and defense are the responsibility of the United Kingdom government.

'When there is a large group of unimmunized children it is very easy to see an outbreak such as this one,' Dr Buttha Tariq, Unicef responsible for immunization in neighboring Punjab province, told EFE news agency, adding that mumps 'is one of the most contagious diseases and it spreads very quickly.'\n\n'The outbreak was declared at the beginning of last month [December 2012]; just during that month about 90 children died, and in January [2013] we've had 14 deaths already,' said Dr Suresh Kumar of the Sindh Provincial Health Ministry.\n\nKumar added that a vaccination campaign that aims to reach more than 3 million children aged between 6 months and 12 years was launched months ago, and he hopes the outbreak [will be contained] by immunisation and greater awareness of parents. Kumar, like other experts consulted, said that the affected area, close to the river Indus, has been badly hit by flooding in the past 3 years, which has worsened the living conditions of many households. 'Many lost their homes and now live with other families crammed into small houses with limited resources, which is an ideal breeding ground for infections such as mumps,' said Kumar.\n\nA spokeswoman for the World Health Organization (WHO), Maryam Yunus, also recalled that child malnutrition is directly related to the risk of mumps virus infection and its effects are greater. 'Many of the people displaced by the floods are malnourished,' she said, adding that most deaths of affected children occur from complications such as pneumonia or diarrhea. 'Pneumonia is the most common complication and that which causes most deaths,' said Buttha.\n\nThe experts agreed that now it is important to focus on the treatment of those affected (in December there were at least 2500 cases, according to official figures) with antibiotics and vitamins to improve the immune system of sick children.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus of the genus _Rubulavirus_. The classic symptoms of mumps include parotitis in about 50 percent of the cases, either unilateral or bilateral, which develops an average of 16 to 18 days after exposure. Swelling can also be seen in the submandibular and sublingual gland in a small percentage. Nonspecific symptoms including myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-grade fever may precede parotitis by several days. As many as 40-50 percent of mumps infections are associated with nonspecific or primarily respiratory symptoms, particularly among children less than 5 years of age. Only 30-40 percent of mumps infections produce typical acute parotitis. In 15-20 percent of infections, cases are asymptomatic. The average incubation period for mumps is 16-18 days, with a range of 12-25 days. Fever may persist for 3-4 days and parotitis, when present, usually lasts 7-10 days. Persons with mumps are usually considered most infectious from 1-2 days before until 5 days after onset of parotitis. Outbreaks of mumps accompanied by high mortality are rare and not usually associated with outcomes such as pneumonia and gastroenteritis. Further information would be appreciated.\n\nHowever, mumps can cause acquired sensorineural hearing loss in children; incidence is estimated at 1 in 20 000 cases. Mumps-associated encephalitis occurs in less than 2 per 100 000 cases and approximately 1 percent of encephalitis cases are fatal. Some complications of mumps are known to occur more frequently among adults than among children. Adults have a higher risk for mumps meningoencephalitis than children. In addition, orchitis occurs in up to 30-40 percent of cases in post pubertal males. Although it is frequently bilateral, it rarely causes sterility. Mastitis has been reported in as many as 31 percent of female patients older than 15 years who have mumps. Other rare complications of mumps are oophoritis and pancreatitis. Aseptic meningitis occurs in 10 percent of cases and is associated with a good prognosis. Although mumps infection in the 1st trimester of pregnancy may result in fetal loss, there is no evidence that mumps during pregnancy causes congenital malformations.

On 29 Sep 2011, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 3 cases of mumps among students recently evaluated at their university's student health services with symptoms suggestive of mumps. An investigation by CDPH, student health services, and the local health department identified 29 mumps cases. The presumed source patient was an unvaccinated student with a history of recent travel to Western Europe, where mumps is circulating. The student had mumps symptoms over 28 days before the onset of symptoms among the patients confirmed on 29 Sep 2011. Recognizing that at least 2 generations of transmission had occurred before public health authorities were alerted, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was provided as a control measure. This outbreak demonstrates the potential value of requiring MMR vaccination (including documentation of immunization or other evidence of immunity) before college enrollment, heightened clinical awareness, and timely reporting of suspected mumps patients to public health authorities [see also the ProMED-mail reports listed below. - Mod.CP].\n\nOn 25 Aug 2011, the presumed source patient, an unvaccinated male aged 21 years, arrived at the university's student health services with fever and unilateral facial and jaw swelling. The initial diagnosis was cellulitis, and antibiotics were prescribed. By day 6 after symptom onset, the patient complained of testicular pain, and mumps was suspected. He had not been vaccinated against mumps and had traveled to Western Europe during the exposure period. He was referred for mumps serological testing, but did not follow through. His illness was not reported to the local health department when mumps was suspected. Approximately 3 weeks later, a 2nd student, the source patient's roommate, was treated at student health services for fatigue and unilateral pain and swelling of the jaw and neck. This patient, a male aged 21 years with a history of receiving 2 doses of MMR vaccine, received a diagnosis of parotitis. Mumps serologies were drawn, and he was advised to isolate himself in his room for 5 days. Mumps immunoglobulin M (IgM) testing was negative, and immunoglobulin G testing was positive, a pattern that does not rule out acute mumps because the ability to detect IgM is poor in vaccine recipients. The local health department was not notified. When 3 subsequent cases of mumps were confirmed by PCR on 29 Sep 2011 at CDPH, an investigation was initiated.\n\nDuring the outbreak period (25 Aug 2011-7 Jan 2012), investigators identified 29 cases that met the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists 2010 case definition of mumps.* The outbreak period extended from the symptom onset date of the source patient through 2 incubation periods after the symptom onset of the last laboratory-confirmed case. The average incubation period for mumps is 16-18 days (range: 12-25 days); thus, the timing of the 1st 5 patients indicated that at least 2 generations of transmission had occurred by the time public health was notified. Case-finding activities included notifying health-care providers serving the affected community, requesting PCR testing for persons with clinically compatible symptoms, and alerting adjacent local health departments to notify CDPH of suspected mumps cases.\n\nAll patients had epidemiologic links to the university: 27 (93 percent) were students; one was a close contact of a student, and one was a public health staff member who assisted during a mumps vaccination clinic. Among the 29 cases, 13 (45 percent) were laboratory confirmed by PCR; one was confirmed by the presence of mumps IgM, and the remainder were confirmed on the basis of symptoms clinically compatible with mumps together with epidemiologic links to the university. Of the epidemiologically linked cases, 11 were negative and 4 were not tested by PCR. All viral specimens were genotype G, the predominant mumps genotype circulating in Western Europe. Eight patients (28 percent), including the source patient, were students who participated in organized sports. Four of the 1st 5 patients resided in congregate housing, and 17 (59 percent) illnesses occurred among students living in congregate housing. Among the 29 cases, 22 (76 percent) mumps illnesses occurred among persons previously vaccinated with the recommended 2 doses of MMR vaccine.\n\nCDC recommendations for mumps outbreak control include defining the at-risk population and transmission setting, and rapidly identifying and vaccinating persons without presumptive evidence of immunity (1). Other recommended control measures include cough etiquette, respiratory and hand hygiene, and isolation of infectious patients for 5 days. Early in the outbreak, the university arranged alternate housing to isolate infectious patients who resided in congregate housing; however, as the number of patients increased, this became less feasible. Students were encouraged to monitor themselves for mumps symptoms, and symptomatic students were encouraged to go to student health services for testing.\n\nOf approximately 36 000 students enrolled at the university; an estimated 9300 reside in housing owned by, operated by, or affiliated with the university. Recognizing that at least 2 generations of transmission had occurred before public health authorities were alerted to this outbreak, and wanting to avert a larger outbreak, the local health department and the university, in consultation with CDPH and CDC, decided to provide MMR vaccine as a control measure. The university recommends that matriculating students receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine but does not require proof of MMR vaccination before matriculation, making student vaccination status difficult to assess. Therefore, messages sent to the university community advised that an additional dose of MMR vaccine, irrespective of previous MMR vaccination status, was recommended for all university community members, with an emphasis on those residing in congregate housing. Beginning one week after the local health department was alerted, 5 vaccination clinics were held during a 4-week period; a total of 3631 persons received a dose of MMR vaccine.\n\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n\nThis outbreak demonstrates that even persons who have received 2 doses of mumps vaccine might not be protected against mumps and highlights the importance of heightened clinical awareness and timely reporting of suspected mumps cases to public health authorities (2). The effectiveness of MMR vaccine to prevent mumps has been estimated at medians of 78 percent (range: 49-91 percent) for one dose and 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) for 2 doses (3). Despite a substantial decline in U.S. mumps cases since mumps vaccine licensure in 1967, large mumps outbreaks have occurred in recent years among vaccinated populations. The World Health Organization indicates that only 62 percent of countries use mumps vaccine in national programs. Although MMR vaccine is included in national programs in Europe, MMR vaccination rates declined in many European countries over the last decade because of vaccine safety concerns, and outbreaks of measles and mumps have occurred. Public colleges and universities in 22 states and the District of Columbia require that enrolling students provide documentation that they have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine.\n\nAlthough mumps outbreaks have occurred in populations in which many persons have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine, prematriculation MMR vaccination might prevent the introduction of mumps and limit its spread if it is introduced into a university setting. In this outbreak, the suspected source patient was unvaccinated, and the outbreak might have been prevented if a prematriculation requirement had been in place. Documentation of MMR vaccination also can allow public health officials to rapidly assess the mumps vaccination status of exposed students and prioritize vaccination efforts.\n\nRecognition and prompt reporting of clinically suspected mumps, even in the absence of laboratory confirmation, facilitates early implementation of control measures and can mitigate outbreaks. Reliable identification of mumps infections can be difficult; PCR testing is preferred when testing previously vaccinated persons. Control measures for mumps are limited. Neither MMR vaccine nor immune globulin is effective as postexposure prophylaxis; however, in an outbreak setting, MMR vaccine might reduce transmission to susceptible persons not yet exposed to the mumps virus.\n\nEven though a population might be highly vaccinated, some persons who have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine still will be susceptible. Data collected during previous mumps outbreaks on college campuses indicate that extended person-to-person contact, in combination with waning vaccine-induced immunity, might make colleges and universities high-risk settings for outbreaks, even when 2-dose MMR vaccination coverage is high. In addition, patients are infectious before onset of parotitis, and asymptomatic persons can transmit disease. Isolation of patients for 5 days after parotitis onset and monitoring of contacts for symptoms are primary control measures. However, even strict isolation of reported patients is unlikely to completely interrupt disease transmission. CDC has evaluated use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control during 2 previous mumps outbreaks in which transmission was sustained despite high 2-dose coverage. During both outbreaks, targeted vaccination was followed by a decrease in mumps incidence among the target group. Available data are insufficient to recommend for or against the use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control. Because control measures for mumps are limited, the ability to offer a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine might be a tool that could be used in an attempt to limit the extent of mumps outbreaks, particularly in high-risk settings.\n\nColleges and universities should consider implementing prematriculation immunization requirements similar to those recommended by the American College Health Association, including ensuring that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine.

Clinicians should be diligent about reporting suspected cases of mumps to local health departments, and PCR testing should be performed for vaccinated persons with suspected mumps.

This outbreak demonstrates that even persons who have received 2 doses of mumps vaccine might not be protected against mumps and highlights the importance of heightened clinical awareness and timely reporting of suspected mumps cases to public health authorities. \n\nAlthough mumps outbreaks have occurred in populations in which many persons have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine, prematriculation MMR vaccination might prevent the introduction of mumps and limit its spread if it is introduced into a university setting. CDC has evaluated use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control during 2 previous mumps outbreaks in which transmission was sustained despite high 2-dose coverage. On 29 Sep 2011, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 3 cases of mumps among students recently evaluated at their university's student health services with symptoms suggestive of mumps. Despite a substantial decline in U.S. mumps cases since mumps vaccine licensure in 1967, large mumps outbreaks have occurred in recent years among vaccinated populations. Clinicians should be diligent about reporting suspected cases of mumps to local health departments, and PCR testing should be performed for vaccinated persons with suspected mumps. Recognizing that at least 2 generations of transmission had occurred before public health authorities were alerted to this outbreak, and wanting to avert a larger outbreak, the local health department and the university, in consultation with CDPH and CDC, decided to provide MMR vaccine as a control measure. Because control measures for mumps are limited, the ability to offer a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine might be a tool that could be used in an attempt to limit the extent of mumps outbreaks, particularly in high-risk settings. Among the 29 cases, 13 (45 percent) were laboratory confirmed by PCR; one was confirmed by the presence of mumps IgM, and the remainder were confirmed on the basis of symptoms clinically compatible with mumps together with epidemiologic links to the university. Among the 29 cases, 22 (76 percent) mumps illnesses occurred among persons previously vaccinated with the recommended 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Among the 29 cases, 22 (76 percent) mumps illnesses occurred among persons previously vaccinated with the recommended 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Data collected during previous mumps outbreaks on college campuses indicate that extended person-to-person contact, in combination with waning vaccine-induced immunity, might make colleges and universities high-risk settings for outbreaks, even when 2-dose MMR vaccination coverage is high. The effectiveness of MMR vaccine to prevent mumps has been estimated at medians of 78 percent (range: 49-91 percent) for one dose and 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) for 2 doses (3). This outbreak demonstrates the potential value of requiring MMR vaccination (including documentation of immunization or other evidence of immunity) before college enrollment, heightened clinical awareness, and timely reporting of suspected mumps patients to public health authorities [see also the ProMED-mail reports listed below. Case-finding activities included notifying health-care providers serving the affected community, requesting PCR testing for persons with clinically compatible symptoms, and alerting adjacent local health departments to notify CDPH of suspected mumps cases. Recognizing that at least 2 generations of transmission had occurred before public health authorities were alerted, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was provided as a control measure.

Neither MMR vaccine nor immune globulin is effective as postexposure prophylaxis; however, in an outbreak setting, MMR vaccine might reduce transmission to susceptible persons not yet exposed to the mumps virus. The average incubation period for mumps is 16-18 days (range: 12-25 days); thus, the timing of the 1st 5 patients indicated that at least 2 generations of transmission had occurred by the time public health was notified. Mumps immunoglobulin M (IgM) testing was negative, and immunoglobulin G testing was positive, a pattern that does not rule out acute mumps because the ability to detect IgM is poor in vaccine recipients. All patients had epidemiologic links to the university: 27 (93 percent) were students; one was a close contact of a student, and one was a public health staff member who assisted during a mumps vaccination clinic. Although MMR vaccine is included in national programs in Europe, MMR vaccination rates declined in many European countries over the last decade because of vaccine safety concerns, and outbreaks of measles and mumps have occurred. Documentation of MMR vaccination also can allow public health officials to rapidly assess the mumps vaccination status of exposed students and prioritize vaccination efforts. An investigation by CDPH, student health services, and the local health department identified 29 mumps cases. \n\nColleges and universities should consider implementing prematriculation immunization requirements similar to those recommended by the American College Health Association, including ensuring that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "measles", "mumps", "rubella"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis", "meningitis"], "event_date": ["2011-09-29 00:00:00", "2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-08-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00", "1967-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "CALIFORNIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the District of Columbia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1441128", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps - Spain (06): (AS)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1441128", "date": "2012-12-06 18:31:09", "main_text": "MUMPS - SPAIN (06): (ASTURIAS)\n******************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 6 Dec 2012\nSource: El Comercio [in Spanish, machine trans. edited]\nhttp://www.elcomercio.es/v/20121206/asturias/salud-detecta-brote-paperas-20121206.htmlomersio\n\n\nA mumps outbreak in Asturias was confirmed yesterday [5 Dec 2012] after the Health Department indicated that 150 cases had been diagnosed in recent weeks. This is the 3rd outbreak occurring in the region in the last decade. Epidemiological Surveillance experts relate it to the ease of transmission of the disease in which 1/3rd of the infections are so mild that there is no warning of an outbreak.\n\nMost of the patients are male, aged between 15 and 34 years. Langreo is the area with the largest number of detected cases, but the outbreak has spread to Gijon, Oviedo, and Aviles. Although much of the population is vaccinated, the Health Ministry stated yesterday [5 Dec 2012] that the virus spreads easily because the vaccine is not 100 percent effective, and occasionally there can be an abrupt increase in the number of cases. One of the outbreaks was centered in the faculty of biology at Oviedo, where several of the students contracted the disease, spreading alarm among their fellow students.\n\nThe Directorate General of Public Health recommends that patients do not go to school or work until 4 days after the onset of symptoms. The Director General also advises those under 35 who have not been vaccinated previously to go to their health center to be vaccinated.\n\nMumps can cause major complications, particularly in men, in whom complications can result in sterility if not properly treated.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Outbreaks of mumps have been frequent throughout Spain in recent years. The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after a person is infected with mumps virus. The average incubation period is around 17 days. Swelling of the parotid glands is the most common symptom of mumps. Both glands are usually affected by the swelling, although only one gland can be affected. The swelling can cause pain, tenderness, and difficulty with swallowing. Other symptoms of the mumps include: headache, joint pain, sickness, abdominal pain and fever.\n\nMumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu: inside infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and passed into the mouth or nose. A person is most contagious 1-2 days before the onset of symptoms and for 5 days afterwards. During this time, it is important to try to prevent spreading the infection to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated. Normally, infection resolves without complications and provides life-long immunity.\n\nFor unvaccinated persons born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should consider vaccinating these individuals with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for measles and mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), respectively. For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and one dose during an outbreak of rubella.\n\nTwo doses of mumps vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective at preventing the disease; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49-92 percent) effective. The 1st vaccine against mumps was licensed in the United States in 1967, and by 2005, high 2-dose childhood vaccination coverage reduced disease rates by 99 percent. Adults at higher risk, such as university students, health care personnel, and international travelers, and persons with potential mumps outbreak exposure should ensure that they have been vaccinated.

Officials at the Ministry of Health insist that this is not a serious outbreak. However, many children are not attending school out of fear of infection.\n\nMumps is caused by mumps virus and is spread when a person comes into contact with infected droplets of saliva or mucus, usually through coughing, sneezing, or sharing dishes. Symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, and fatigue, along with serious complications such as inflammation of the brain and deafness.\n\nEgyptian officials are working to provide treatment for infected youth. However, vaccination is considered the best strategy for avoiding mumps infection. The vaccination for mumps is a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella, (MMR). It is recommended that children receive 2 doses: one at age 12-15 months and another at age 4-6 years. The 1st MMR vaccine became available in 1967 and has reduced mumps prevalence by 99 percent.\n\nThis outbreak has occurred alongside news that Egypt is facing a nationwide vaccine shortage. Administrative delays have prevented the health ministry from replacing expired vaccines. While vaccines are available in private clinics, their costs make them unattainable to most patients. 'The longer the government fails to immunize these children, the more vulnerable to disease they are,' explained Eman Masoud, head of the Pediatrics Section at Abul Riesh University Hospital in Cairo.\n\nExperts recommend that people experiencing symptoms of mumps contact a provider immediately and avoid situations where they might infect others, such as in a clinic waiting room.\n\n[Byline: Lauren Edmundson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is likely that this large outbreak of mumps virus infection is a consequence of disruption of the routine programme of immunisation of children with the combined MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) vaccine due to a temporary shortage of vaccine in Egypt.\n\nMumps virus was isolated in 1945, and an inactivated vaccine was developed in 1948.

The extremely contagious disease has struck many adults on the coast and anyone with symptoms is warned to have minimal contact with others. Symptoms include swollen and painful glands, fatigue, and fever.\n\nGold Coast Medical Association president Dr Peter McLaren said it was rare to see mumps in adults. 'It is usually something contracted as a child and can be quite harmful to adults, especially males,' he said. 'Adult men can experience painful swelling in their groin region and this can cause fertility problems.' Dr McLaren said an increasing lack of faith in immunisation meant diseases were spread more easily. 'When someone is immunised it is much harder for them to contract a disease,' he said. 'Many of the adults with mumps may have been immunised but the immunity lessens after so many years. Booster shots can be given but it is up to the individual.'\n\nThose diagnosed with mumps will not show symptoms until about a week after contracting the virus. They are advised to stay away from non-infected people for 5 to 9 days after swelling begins. In rare cases, no symptoms are apparent and a blood test is needed for diagnosis. Anyone with swelling around the jawline, neck, and behind the ears is encouraged to see their doctor.\n\n[byline: Jessica Elder]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report gives no indication of the scale of this outbreak, or any other precise information other than that children appear not to be involved.\n\nMumps typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, and is followed by swelling of salivary glands. Anyone who is not immune from either previous mumps infection or from vaccination can get mumps. Mumps infection is most often confused with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck. Lymph node swelling can be differentiated by the well-defined borders of the lymph nodes, their location behind the angle of the jawbone, and lack of the ear protrusion or obscuring of the angle of the jaw, which are characteristics of mumps. In 50-60 per cent of cases of clinical mumps, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis occurs. However, clinical evidence of meningitis or encephalitis appears in less than 10 per cent of patients with mumps. Serious sequelae are rare. For example, deafness after mumps occurs in 0.5 to 5 per 100 000 cases. Death occurs in less than 2 per cent of mumps encephalitis cases.\n\nOrchitis occurs in about 25 per cent of adolescent and adult males with mumps and is rare in prepubescent males. One or both testes may be involved, with lower abdominal pain, fever, and chills, and possibly epididymitis. The involved testis and adjacent skin become swollen and red. Orchitis occurs within one week of parotitis and usually lasts 4 days. Infertility is rare even when both testes are involved. Oophoritis occurs in 5 per cent of post pubertal females with mumps and is characterized by pelvic pain and tenderness. Infertility generally does not occur. Mastitis may also occur. Less common complications of mumps infection include pancreatitis, myocarditis, arthritis, thyroiditis, deafness, and spontaneous abortion (see http://www.cdc.gov/mumps/clinical/qa-physical-complic.html).\n\nThe HealthMap interactive map of the Australian state of Queensland, showing the location of Gold Coast city, can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/1kAX. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\n[byline: Jessica Elder]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< \n\nOrchitis occurs in about 25 per cent of adolescent and adult males with mumps and is rare in prepubescent males. \n\nMumps typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, and is followed by swelling of salivary glands.

The official responsible for epidemiological surveillance in Girona, Neus Camps, explained that there has been no case since late May 2012 and, therefore, the outbreak is expected to terminate in late June 2012.\n\nIn total, 148 people have been affected, of whom only 3 have had complications that resulted in hospitalisation. Experts point out that vaccination is essential to prevent outbreaks of communicable diseases. This year [2012], nearly 7000 young people between 16 and 19 years of age whose vaccination status was inadequate will have been revaccinated with MMR vaccine.\n\nA group of people from Girona at the end of the year [2011] traveled to an area of the country where mumps virus infection was prevalent. When they returned home, 5 members of the group fell ill a few days after their return. Medical tests diagnosed mumps, a disease that causes a very characteristic swelling of glands located under each cheek. No specific treatment for mumps is available. Vaccination is the best protection.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps spreads from person to person via droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus may also be spread indirectly when someone with mumps touches items or surfaces without washing their hands and then someone else touches the same surface and rubs their mouth or nose. However, mumps is less contagious than measles or chickenpox. The incubation period of mumps is usually 16 to 18 days but can range from 12 to 25 days. Individuals with mumps usually 1st feel sick with nonspecific symptoms like headache, loss of appetite, and low-grade fever.\n\nThe most well-known sign of mumps is 'parotitis,' the swelling of the salivary glands, or parotid glands, below the ear. Parotitis occurs only in 30-40% of individuals infected with mumps. Some people with mumps have no signs or symptoms of illness; others may have respiratory symptoms or only nonspecific symptoms such as headache, loss of appetite, and low-grade fever.\n\nIn children, mumps is usually a mild disease. Adults may have more serious disease and more complications. Central nervous system involvement (meningitis) is common, but is usually not serious. Meningitis (with headache, stiff neck) occurs in up to 15 percent of people with mumps but usually resolves without any permanent damage. Up to 50 percent of postpubertal males experience orchitis (testicular inflammation) as a complication of mumps. This may involve pain, swelling, nausea, vomiting, and fever, with tenderness of the area possibly lasting for weeks. Approximately half of patients with orchitis have some degree of testicular atrophy, but sterility is rare.\n\nInflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis) and/or breasts (mastitis) can occur in females who have reached puberty. An increase in spontaneous abortion has been found among women who developed mumps during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in some studies but not in others; however, there is no evidence that mumps causes birth defects. Deafness, in one or both ears, can occur in approximately one per 20 000 reported cases of mumps.\n\nPeople with mumps are usually considered most infectious from a few days before until 5 days after the onset of parotitis. Mumps patients should be isolated for 5 days after their glands begin to swell. If the exposed person has not been vaccinated against mumps, receiving the vaccine after exposure to the virus will not help prevent disease; vaccination may help against future exposure (from: http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4211.pdf).\n\nGirona is a city in the northeast of Catalonia, Spain at the confluence of the rivers Ter, Onyar, Galligants and Guell.

Most of the cases have been diagnosed at Gozon Health Centre. Nevertheless, this communicable disease that causes a painful inflammation of the salivary glands has been described more frequently in Arriondas and Langreso communities, according to the last report of the Asturias Epidemiological Surveillance System. Up to August of this year [2012], 131 cases of mumps have been reported in Asturias, approximately 80 more cases compared to those reported for the whole year 2011.\n\nHealthcare professionals interviewed by this paper pointed out that the disease has been affecting mainly male subjects more than 20 years old that did not have mumps during their childhood -- after developing the disease, affected subjects become immunized for life -- or who had never been vaccinated with the triple [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine that confers protection against measles, rubella, and mumps. Even so, these mumps outbreaks have not reached a level comparable with an epidemic that occurred in this region in 2002, when more than 1500 cases were diagnosed. There was also an outbreak reported in Asturias in 2007. At that time, the Health Council attributed the reappearance of this disease to persons moving towards and from autonomous communities where the disease had occurred in the past.\n\nThe Health Services in Asturias have advised since year 2000 that every person between 15 and 35 years of age that has not developed mumps in the past must get the vaccination against this infection. The vaccine may protect up to 85 per cent of immunized persons, consequently, some may develop the disease, but in a milder form.\n\nMumps is caused by a virus that is transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets (i.e. by sneezing), or by direct contact with articles that have been contaminated with infected saliva. Mumps occurs more frequently in children between 2-12 years of age who have not been vaccinated, but the infection may occur at any age. The incubation period lasts between 12 and 24 days.\n\nAccording to healthcare experts, the most frequent symptoms are the following: pain in the face, fever, headache, sore throat, parotid gland inflammation, and temple or mandible inflammation. Other symptoms of this disease that may occur in men are testis inflammation and scrotal pain and inflammation. Physical examination generally confirms gland inflammation. There is no specific therapy for mumps. Cold or hot compresses on the affected areas in the neck and paracetamol may alleviate pain. The use of aspirin in children affected by mumps is discouraged in order to prevent the occurrence of Reye's syndrome.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promdmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person. Most mumps transmission occurs before the salivary glands begin to swell and up to 5 days after the swelling begins. Therefore, mumps patients should be isolated for 5 days after their glands begin to swell. The incubation time can range from 12-25 days.\n\nGenerally, persons can be considered immune to mumps if they were born before 1957, have serologic evidence of mumps immunity, have documentation of physician-diagnosed mumps, or have documentation of vaccination with at least one dose of live mumps vaccine on or after their 1st birthday. Demonstration of mumps IgG antibody by any commonly used serologic assay is acceptable evidence of mumps immunity.\n\nFor unvaccinated persons born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should consider vaccinating these individuals with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for measles and mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), respectively. For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and one dose during an outbreak of rubella.\n\nTwo doses of mumps vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective at preventing the disease; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49-92 percent) effective. The 1st vaccine against mumps was licensed in the United States in 1967, and by 2005, high 2-dose childhood vaccination coverage reduced disease rates by 99 percent. Adults at higher risk, such as university students, health care personnel, and international travelers, and persons with potential mumps outbreak exposure should ensure that they have been vaccinated.

Of these cases, 89 (75 percent), were among students. The average age of cases was 22 years old (range 3-37). The outbreak is still ongoing in Novi Sad and is spreading to other parts of the Vojvodina province. As of 30 Apr 2012, 209 cases have been notified in the province among those 119 from Novi Sad.\n\nResurgent outbreaks of mumps have recently been reported from several European Union and neighbouring countries [1-7]. Here we report on an ongoing mumps outbreak in Novi Sad, capital of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia. Similarly to outbreaks in England, Netherlands and Israel in recent years, the present one affects mainly young adults [8-10].\n\nMumps is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by a paramyxovirus. The typical clinical picture comprises fever, headache, malaise, painful unilateral or bilateral parotid swelling and complications such as orchitis, meningitis and encephalitis occur. Mumps is a notifiable disease in Serbia.\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\nOn 16 Jan 2012, the Institute for Student Health Care in Novi Sad reported 2 cases of mumps among students who study at University of Novi Sad, to the Institute of Public Health of Vojvodina. These students had spent the Christmas and New Year holidays [2011] in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a large outbreak of mumps is ongoing [7,11,12].\n\nNovi Sad is the 2nd largest city in Serbia, capital of the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina, and the administrative centre of the South Backa district. The urban area has a population of 221 854, while its municipal area has a population of 335 701 [13].\n\nSince 25 Jan 2012, the Public Health Service in Novi Sad has been registering further cases of mumps among students and residents of the town. These had not travelled during the maximum length of the incubation period, 25 days. Here we provide detailed information about cases up to 30 Apr 2012.\n\nCase definition\n---------------\nAn imported case of mumps is defined as any person in Novi Sad with a history of painful swelling of one or both parotid glands without any other apparent cause, epidemiologically linked with a case of mumps in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the maximum length of the incubation period.\n\nA possible case is defined as a case with a clinical picture compatible with mumps diagnosed by a physician after 16 Jan 2012, in Novi Sad.\n\nAn epidemiologically linked case is defined as any person in Novi Sad meeting the clinical criteria and epidemiologically linked with a confirmed or imported case of mumps.\n\nA confirmed case is defined as a case with symptoms compatible with mumps and with serological confirmation of IgM mumps antibodies and/or verification by PCR from throat swabs in any person not vaccinated in the previous 2 months.\n\nBy 30 Apr 2012, a total of 119 cases had been reported from Novi Sad to the Institute of Public Health of Vojvodina of which 25 were considered as imported. In total, 32 cases were laboratory-confirmed (IgM or PCR-positive), genotyping was not performed. 87 cases were clinically diagnosed as either possible cases (n=45) or epidemiologically linked cases (n=42).\n\nThe average age of cases was 22 years. The youngest case was three years old and the oldest was 37 years of age. Cases occurred most frequently in the 20 to 29-year-old age group (n=91; 76 percent). There were more male (n=70) than female (n=49) cases. 13 cases were hospitalised with complications, 9 with orchitis, and 4 with pancreatitis. In total 13 percent of males over 15 years old contracted orchitis. For 86 cases, there was no information or data about previous mumps vaccination. The remaining 33 cases were vaccinated, among which 29 had received 2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. 4 were vaccinated with only one dose of MMR.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe public health authorities of Vojvodina, advised the paediatric health services to revisit immunisation records of all children between one and 14 years of age and to call-in and vaccinate children who had not received the recommended MMR vaccine for temporary reasons, as soon as possible.\n\nOther epidemic control measures include, disseminating information to health services and the general public about the mumps outbreak by the public health authorities, isolating infected persons and limiting contact with them. Furthermore, persons who had been in contact with those infected, are placed under medical surveillance and receive information about the disease.\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\nImmunisation against mumps was introduced in Serbia in 1986. Between 1996 and 2006, a combined MMR vaccine was administered according to a 2-dose schedule at the ages of 12 months and 12 years but no later than 14 years of age. In 2006, the schedule was changed and the 2nd dose is now administered at the age of 7.\n\nIn Serbia, before vaccination against mumps became part of the Serbian childhood vaccination schedule, mumps occurred frequently among children 5 to 9 years of age. Since the introduction of mumps vaccine into the routine childhood immunisation schedule, the number of cases has declined dramatically from 240 in 1982, to 30 in 1994 [14-16].\n\nIn Novi Sad, after introduction of the MMR vaccine into the national schedule in 1996, a total of 36 cases of mumps were registered between 1996 and 2011. The incidence rate was low and ranged from zero per 100 000 population in the period from 2007 to 2009 to 3.3 per 100 000 population in 2003 [17].\n\nThe importation of mumps cases from Bosnia and Herzegovina contributes to the epidemic spread of mumps in 2012 in Novi Sad and further on in Vojvodina.

In Serbia, before vaccination against mumps became part of the Serbian childhood vaccination schedule, mumps occurred frequently among children 5 to 9 years of age. On 16 Jan 2012, the Institute for Student Health Care in Novi Sad reported 2 cases of mumps among students who study at University of Novi Sad, to the Institute of Public Health of Vojvodina. Since the introduction of mumps vaccine into the routine childhood immunisation schedule, the number of cases has declined dramatically from 240 in 1982, to 30 in 1994 [14-16]. From 16 Jan to 30 Apr 2012, a total of 119 cases of mumps were notified in Novi Sad, Serbia. 87 cases were clinically diagnosed as either possible cases (n=45) or epidemiologically linked cases (n=42).

The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority [WRHA] is using the outbreak to draw attention to the 'Immunization Awareness Week' next week. But the WRHA will not name the school, will not give the ages of the students involved nor say whether the adults are teachers, and will not say if it is a public or private school. There is no public health risk and identifying the school and its community could violate the privacy of health information of individuals, the WRHA said.\n\nSeveral city school divisions said Thursday the outbreak did not occur in any of their schools. The Manitoba Teachers' Society said the teachers' union would expect to be aware of outbreaks of illness in a school, which suggests the outbreak may have been in a private school. 'It's really important that people remember the importance of immunization,' Dr. Michael Routledge, a public officer of health, said Thursday [19 Apr 2012]. Routledge said immunizations are safe and effective, and Winnipeg has a good rate of immunization.\n\nNevertheless, 2010 data showed only 66 per cent of 7-year-olds in the city received every recommended immunization, though most of the rest were missing only one or 2, Routledge said. He said the WRHA became aware of the mumps outbreak in late December [2011] and tracked it for 2 months. 'We identified what ended up as 11 cases,' he said. He said mumps is a viral disease that is usually benign, causing the cheeks to swell. But it can cause sterility in males and in a small number of cases, can lead to encephalitis. It is also contagious, he said.\n\nRoutledge said the cases were in one school and teachers were involved, though the health authority is not saying if the three 3 cases were teachers. 'We worked with the parents associated with the school,' he said. One person who developed mumps had been in the process of receiving immunization, but there was under-immunization in that school population, he said. More than 200 people associated with the school were immunized after the outbreak.\n\nThe WRHA sent all physicians in the province a letter advising them to be on the alert for symptoms of mumps. The Education Department referred all questions about the mumps outbreak to Manitoba Health, which cited the privacy of personal health information and deferred to the WRHA for comment.

During the prevaccine era in the United States, 90% of all children had experienced mumps virus infection by 14 years of age and large outbreaks occurred regularly, especially when those raised in rural areas were brought together into crowded situations, such as military barracks. After a mumps vaccine was licensed in 1968 and recommended for all children in 1977, the reported incidence of mumps began to decline substantially.\n\nA resurgence of outbreaks of both mumps and measles in the mid-1980s, often among high school and college students, resulted in the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee recommendation in late 1989 of a second dose of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. By the 2006\u20132007 school year, between 81% and 100% of children entering schools in the United States had received 2 doses. Between 2000 and 2005, less than 350 cases of mumps were reported annually in the United States, and an elimination goal for mumps was set for the year 2010. In 2006, however, college campuses in Iowa were the initial foci of what became the largest epidemic of mumps in 2 decades; by the end of that year, 6584 cases of mumps had been reported in the United States.

Patricia Quinlisk, Journal of Infectious Diseases, Volume 202, Issue 5 Pp. 655-656; http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/202/5/655].\n\nOutbreaks of mumps have been reported frequently in Canada in the recent past as documented by the ProMED-mail posts listed below. These outbreaks have generally been associated with schools and educational establishments. In the present situation the reluctance of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority to identify the school affected is unusual and seemingly illogical. It suggests perhaps that the school involved actively discouraged vaccination of its scholars and staff members for religious or philosophical reasons.

In response to this outbreak, the Health Advisory Group of the Ministry has recommended that all individuals vaccinated with the triple vaccine [MMR] between 1994 and 1996 return for repeat vaccination. According to one report the Primary Care Centers in Girona reported 3 cases of mumps in the second half of December 2011, with further cases appearing during January, February and March 2012. The 106 identified cases all recovered without incident. The communities with the highest number of reported cases are Girones, Baix Emporda and Selva, although there have been cases in other communities of the region. The Health Council recommends the revaccination strategy as a means of controlling the outbreak and preventing further cases. The rationale for the revaccination is that between 1994 and 1996 vaccination was done using the triple vaccine [MMR] which contained the Rubini strain of mumps virus. The primary health care centers that have received the doses of vaccines are informing those individuals who should be receiving the vaccine. 50 percent of the identified cases in the Girona area are youths between the ages of 16 and 18 years, although the age range for mumps cases include individuals from adolescents through adults, ages 17 to 42 years.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from <HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The mumps virus component of the triple MMR vaccine has been the weakest component of the triple MMR vaccine, tending to induce weaker and less persistent immune responses than the measles and rubella virus components. Different attenuated strains of mumps virus have served as the mumps component of the MMR triple vaccine at various times in the past. The Rubini strain was the mumps component of the MMR vaccine used in Spain previously, and may have been a less effective immunogen. Other strains used in the past, such as the Urabe strain, were latter withdrawn due to cases of transient mild viral meningitis. The Jeryl Lynn strain is now the mumps virus component favoured in most MMR vaccines, although later this strain was found to comprise two distinguishable substrains, JL1 and JL2. The JL1 strain was preferentially selected by propagation in Vero and chick embryo fibroblast cell cultures, whereas the JL2 strain was preferentially selected by passage in embryonated chicken eggs.

Swelling can also be seen in the submandibular\nand sublingual gland in a small percentage of cases. Nonspecific\nsymptoms including myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-grade\nfever may precede parotitis by several days.

On Tuesday [4\nOct 2011], UC Berkeley's health services website posted an alert about\nthe outbreak, encouraging all Cal students, faculty and staff --\nregardless of their vaccination history -- to receive an additional\ndose of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, or MMR. Most people\nreceive 2 doses of MMR, with the 1st administered at 12 to 15 months\nof age and the 2nd given any time at least 4 weeks after the 1st dose.\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus originating from the\nmouth, nose or throat of an infected person.\n\n'University Health Services and the City of Berkeley's Public Health\nDivision are working closely with the California Department of Public\nHealth to limit (the) spread of the disease,' the alert read. Members\nof the UC Berkeley community should review their vaccination history,\nand health officials recommend that people seek vaccination if they\nare not sure whether they have received 2 doses of MMR. Officials also\nsaid that a 3rd MMR dose may be helpful in stopping mumps outbreaks.\n\nThe cases confirmed last week involved students residing on the\nClark-Kerr campus, which is about a half a mile south of the main\ncampus, and living in the Cloyne student cooperative on the north side\nof campus. A suspected case also involved a student residing in the\nCheney Hall dormitory.

Department spokesperson Matt\nConens said in an email Monday [10 Oct 2011] that laboratory-confirmed\ncases of the virus [disease] had increased from 7 to 9 cases and\nsuspected cases had grown to approximately 35 cases.\n\nAccording to Mike Sicilia, spokesperson for the department, the\ndepartment located the source of the outbreak through interviewing\ninfected students. 'We believe this outbreak was started by a student\nwho was exposed to mumps while in Europe and returned to campus and\nunfortunately developed mumps and spread it to others,' Sicilia said.\n'It's actually not unusual for outbreaks of mumps in the US that there\nhas been some contact with someone who has been out of the country.'\n\nUniversity Health Services has been advised by the department as well\nas the City of Berkeley Division of Public Health to refocus its\ncontainment efforts on students in high-population housing, where\nofficials currently suspect the outbreak began. University Health\nServices medical director Brad Buchman said prevention efforts are\nbeing focused on high-population student living areas with shared\ndining and bathroom facilities, including dorms, coops, and\nfraternities and sororities, because these areas have seen the most\nsuspected and confirmed cases. Cases have been reported in the\nresidence halls, coops, and in fraternity and sorority houses across\ncampus, including Cloyne Court and the Clark Kerr Campus.\n\nThe Berkeley Student Cooperative [BSC], which has experienced at least\none confirmed and one suspected case of the virus, has responded to\nthe outbreak by educating residents about preventative measures. 'The\nhealth worker coordinator is disseminating resource material and all\nthe information we've gotten from the chancellor,' said BSC executive\ndirector Jan Stokley. 'We're educating people at the house level about\nwhat the symptoms are and what to do to prevent contagion.'\n\nHealth officials at UC Berkeley and the department are recommending\nthat at-risk individuals who have already received 2 doses of the\nvaccine receive a 3rd dose. According to Buchman, though 2 doses of\nthe vaccine were thought sufficient, previous outbreaks have revealed\nthat up to half the patients with mumps had already had 2 doses.\n\nBuchman said most reported cases of the virus have been mild and\ninvolved swelling of the parotid gland and inflammation of the\ntesticles. The mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine will be available\nfor free to students, faculty and staff at the Tang Center from 12\np.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday [11 Oct 2011] and from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. Friday\n[14 Oct 2011].\n\n[Byline: Jamie Applegate]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose,\nor throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs,\nsneezes, or talks. Items used by an infected person, such as soft\ndrink cans or eating utensils, can also be contaminated with the\nvirus, which may spread to others if those items are shared. In\naddition, the virus may spread when someone with mumps touches items\nor surfaces without washing their hands and someone else then touches\nthe same surface and rubs their mouth or nose. The incubation time can\nrange from 12-25 days. Most mumps transmission likely occurs before\nthe salivary glands begin to swell and up to 5 days after the swelling\nbegins.

Although a serious disease, mumps is\nnow very uncommon. There have been only a total of 8 confirmed cases\nof mumps reported on the island over the past 10 years.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer Dr. John Cann expressed concern over the\nnumber of reported cases this year, in light of our high immunization\ncoverage rates. He noted that mumps is highly communicable and it only\ntakes a few unvaccinated individuals to initiate transmission.\n\nMumps is usually a mild viral disease characterized by mild fever,\nheadache, muscle ache and swelling of the parotid salivary glands\n(located in the area between the neck and jaw, below the ears).\nSerious side effects of mumps are more common among adults than\nchildren. The disease is spread by contact with an infected person,\nthrough coughing and sneezing.\n\nMumps vaccine [contained in MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) combined\nvaccine] can prevent this disease. The vaccine given to children on a\n2-dose schedule prevents almost all cases of mumps [But see:\nProMED-mail post 'Mumps - Czech Republic: (SK) supplementary\nvaccination? 20110822.2553 - Mod.CP]. The MMR vaccine was introduced\nfor general use in Bermuda in 1983 as part of Bermuda's childhood\nimmunization programme. The majority of children have been fully\nimmunized by the age of 6 years. MMR is given at 15 months and a\nbooster is given between the ages of 4 to 6 years.\n\nThe Department of Health recommends that parents check their child's\nimmunization record to see if he or she has had the mumps or MMR\nvaccine. If your child has not been vaccinated and is 15 months of age\nor older, contact your pediatrician or family physician to have your\nchild vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\nIn addition, the department recommends that parents, who suspect that\ntheir child has mumps, contact their physician for diagnosis and\ntreatment Public Health Nurses will contact parents of children who\nmay have been exposed to individuals with mumps to ascertain their\nimmunization status and help determine whether they are protected. The\nHealth Department also said that children with suspected mumps should\nbe excluded from school/day care for at least 9 days after the swollen\nglands 1st appeared.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It may be that MMR vaccine coverage in Bermuda in recent years has\nbeen less than optimal. It is not stated whether the mumps cases are\nunvaccinated individuals. However it is now well established that the\nmumps component of the triple MMR vaccine is less protective than the\nother 2 components, and a small proportion of vaccinated individuals\nmay still be at risk of infection.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Bermuda can be accessed\nat: http://healthmap.org/r/1a6J. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "MUMPS - BERMUDA\n***************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n In addition, the department recommends that parents, who suspect that\ntheir child has mumps, contact their physician for diagnosis and\ntreatment Public Health Nurses will contact parents of children who\nmay have been exposed to individuals with mumps to ascertain their\nimmunization status and help determine whether they are protected.

Dec 2010 to Jul 2011\n----------------------------------------------\n[abridged from: Hukic M, Ravlija J, Dedeic Ljubovic A, Moro A, Arapcic\nS, Muller CP, et al. Ongoing large mumps outbreak in the Federation of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, December 2010 to July\n2011]\n\nSummary\n-------\n>From December 2010 until the end of July 2011, 5261 mumps cases were\nrecorded in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, leading to an\nincidence of 225.8 per 100 000. 15 to 19 year olds (43 per cent) were\nmost affected, and 62 per cent of cases were male. Mumps-specific IgM\nantibodies were found in about 70 per cent of sera investigated,\ncomplications were reported in 41 per cent of 81 hospitalised\npatients. The outbreak affected mainly those unvaccinated or unaware\nof their vaccination status and is probably due to vaccination\nfailures during the war and post-war period (1992-1998).\n\nIn December 2010, the cantons of Zenica-Doboj (n=40) and Central\nBosnia (n=34) reported an increased number of mumps cases to the\nMinistry of Health of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Subsequently, the number\nof mumps patients continued to rise, and more cantons reported cases.\nBy the end of July 2011, a total of 5261 cases were reported to the\nMinistry of Health.\n\nBackground\n----------\nImmunisation against mumps was introduced in Bosnia and Herzegovina in\n1980 in the form of a combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and\nrubella (MMR) [1]. Until 1992, it was recommended to vaccinate\nchildren between one and 14 years of age without documented history of\nmumps with one dose of MMR vaccine. Between 1992 and 1995, the war\ncaused disruptions to the routine immunisation programme in the\ncountry, and these disruptions continued also during the post-war\nperiod (1996-1998). In 2001, a 2-dose schedule with MMR vaccine was\nimplemented throughout the country, with the 1st dose given at the age\nof 12 months and the 2nd dose at the age of 7 years and no later than\n14 years. The MMR vaccine produced by the Institute of Immunology\nZagreb was used until 2009 and contained the L-Zagreb strain as the\ncomponent, and since 2010, the Glaxo SmithKline MMR vaccine containing\nthe Jeryl Lynn strain has been employed [1,2]. The average coverage\nwith MMR vaccine for the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina between\n1998 and 2009 ranged from 84-92 per cent for the 1st dose, and from\n53-92 per cent for the 2nd dose (figure 1).\n\nMumps is a notifiable disease in Bosnia and Herzegovina and is\nreported on the basis of clinical symptoms and epidemiological data.\nReporting of mumps is normally done by the doctors to the Institute\nfor Public Health, which looks for epidemic evidence and provides\ninformation to the Ministry of Health.\n\nThe 1st reports on mumps in Bosnia and Herzegovina date back to 1956\n[3]. In the period before 1980, when vaccination against mumps was\nintroduced, morbidity was high with an incidence ranging from 189 to\n253 cases per 100 000 inhabitants per year (figure 2). After\nintroduction of the vaccine, incidence decreased from 123 in 1981 to\n3.5 in 1992. During the war from 1992 to 1995, the reported incidence\nof mumps was between 7.8 and 5.1, but reporting was irregular, and\nunderreporting is likely. Between 1999 and 2002, 25 smaller outbreaks\nwere reported with a total of 2743 cases. The last outbreak of mumps\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina occurred in 2002 with a total of 410\nreported cases, and until December 2010 only few cases were notified\n[4].\n\nAt the beginning of December 2010, a mumps outbreak started in the\nFederation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is still currently ongoing.\nThis report describes the mumps outbreak in the country and includes\ndata from December 2010 until the end of July 2011.\n\nDescription of the outbreak\n---------------------------\nSince the start of the outbreak in December 2010, 5261 cases have\noccurred in 9 of the 10 cantons of the country; however, cantons are\naffected to a different extent. In December 2010, 85 cases were\nreported, and the peak of the outbreak was in April 2011 with 1240\ncases reported (figure 3).\n\nThe most severely affected cantons are Central Bosnia Canton (n=2156\ncases), Zenica-Doboj Canton (n=1695), Sarajevo Canton (n=1035), and\nHerzegovina-Neretva Canton (n=326). Together, they account for about\n99 per cent of all cases. Only a few cases have been reported in\nUna-Sana, Tuzla, Bosnian Podrinje, West Herzegovina, and West Bosnia\ncantons, and no cases from Posavina Canton (figure 4).\n\nFor 5219 patients, data on age and sex are available. The majority\n(3255/5219; 62 per cent) are male, and the most affected age groups\ninclude the 15 to 19 year olds (2232/5219; 43 per cent), followed by\n20 to 29 year olds (1254/5219; 24 per cent) (figure 5).\n\nPatients with serious clinical symptoms such as fever, temperature\nabove 38.5 C, swelling of the parotid and/or salivary glands, and\nfatigue were hospitalised. A total of 81 patients were admitted to the\nClinical Centre University of Sarajevo, but we have no data for other\nhospitals. The vast majority were male (67/81, 83 per cent), and 30 of\nthem had orchitis (30/67, 45 per cent). One female and 2 male patients\nhad meningitis (3/81, 4 per cent).\n\nVaccination status of cases\n---------------------------\nFor 34 per cent of the cases (1774/5219) vaccination status was\nunknown. About 33 per cent of cases (1722/5219) were unvaccinated, 18\nper cent (939/5219) were vaccinated with one dose of a\nmumps-containing vaccine, and only 15 per cent (784/5219) had received\n2 doses (figure 6).\n\nLaboratory findings\n-------------------\nSamples were collected for laboratory analysis from 104 cases: throat\nswabs from 32, throat swabs and serum from 48, and only serum from 24\nof them. The cases' age ranged from 7-48 years (median: 22.15 \u00b1\n7.47), and 83 per cent were male. All 72 serum samples were tested\nwith the Siemens Enzygnost anti-parotitis virus kit for mumps-specific\nIgG and IgM antibodies. 68 samples were IgG positive (94 per cent), 3\nwere borderline, and one was negative. A total of 50 samples were\npositive for IgM (69 per cent), 8 were borderline, and 14 were\nnegative. The results of PCR and sequence analysis from throat swabs\nare pending.\n\nControl measures\n----------------\nIn March 2011, the federal minister of health declared a mumps\nepidemic. It was recommended to increase the vaccination coverage with\n2 doses of MMR vaccine in children between one and 14 years of age,\nand some schools with increased case numbers were temporarily closed.\nOther epidemic control measures by public health authorities,\nsupported by doctors and/or teachers in the schools included: (i)\nhealth education, (ii) disseminating information about general and\npersonal sanitary and hygienic measures to take, (iii) isolating\ninfected persons and limiting contact with them, (iv) disinfection of\narticles of general use, and (v) frequent hand washing in order to\nlimit further spread of the disease. The control measures were in\naccordance with protocols for prevention and infection control.\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\nIn recent years, mumps outbreaks were reported from many countries all\nover the world [5-8]. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, disruption in the\nimmunisation program during the war (1992-1995) and in the post-war\nperiod (1996-1998) left considerable numbers of children susceptible\nto measles, rubella, and mumps [9]. The children, who were supposed to\nget their 1st vaccination between 1992 and 1998 are now between 14 and\n20 years old and constitute a large proportion of the people affected\nby the current outbreak. Our data also show that most cases in the\ncurrent outbreak (85 per cent) either did not know their vaccination\nstatus or reported being not or incompletely vaccinated.\n\nThe geographical regions with the highest case numbers in the current\nmumps outbreak largely concur with the areas that were most severely\naffected during previously reported rubella and measles epidemics\n[10,11]. Also, during the war from 1992 to 1995, immunisation was not\nfully implemented across the entire territory of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. The program of immunisation was not the same across the\nCantons. Two doses of vaccine were used in the Posavina,\nHerzegovina-Neretva and West Herzegovina cantons, while in other\ncantons, only one dose was implemented. Some small outbreaks occurred\nin Una-Sana Canton and Tuzla Canton, and they had additional\nvaccination with monovalent parotitis vaccine, and that is the\nprobable reason for the smaller number of cases in these cantons in\nthe current outbreak.\n\nSimilar to the rubella outbreak in 2010 [10], more males contracted\nthe disease (62 per cent), and the most severely affected age group\nwere young adolescents (15 to 19 years of age, 43 per cent). High\nnumbers of mumps cases in male adolescents were reported recently from\nseveral countries, such as Israel, the United Kingdom, the\nNetherlands, and the United States [5,12-14].\n\nThe majority of cases reported during the current outbreak were\ndiagnosed based on clinical symptoms, sometimes supported by\nepidemiological data. Only a few samples were collected from\nnon-hospitalised patients for laboratory confirmation, as the clinical\npicture was considered typical.

MUMPS - BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: ONGOING OUTBREAK\n************************************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Some small outbreaks occurred\nin Una-Sana Canton and Tuzla Canton, and they had additional\nvaccination with monovalent parotitis vaccine, and that is the\nprobable reason for the smaller number of cases in these cantons in\nthe current outbreak.\n\n About 33 per cent of cases (1722/5219) were unvaccinated, 18\nper cent (939/5219) were vaccinated with one dose of a\nmumps-containing vaccine, and only 15 per cent (784/5219) had received\n2 doses (figure 6). The majority\n(3255/5219; 62 per cent) are male, and the most affected age groups\ninclude the 15 to 19 year olds (2232/5219; 43 per cent), followed by\n20 to 29 year olds (1254/5219; 24 per cent) (figure 5). The available data point to complications in\nabout 7 per cent of the female (meningitis) and 48 per cent of the\nmale (meningitis and orchitis) hospitalised patients, however, total\nnumbers of cases are low. The last outbreak of mumps\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina occurred in 2002 with a total of 410\nreported cases, and until December 2010 only few cases were notified\n Mumps-specific IgM\nantibodies were found in about 70 per cent of sera investigated,\ncomplications were reported in 41 per cent of 81 hospitalised\npatients. The average coverage\nwith MMR vaccine for the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina between\n1998 and 2009 ranged from 84-92 per cent for the 1st dose, and from\n53-92 per cent for the 2nd dose (figure 1). In Bosnia and Herzegovina, disruption in the\nimmunisation program during the war (1992-1995) and in the post-war\nperiod (1996-1998) left considerable numbers of children susceptible\nto measles, rubella, and mumps [9]. In 2001, a 2-dose schedule with MMR vaccine was\nimplemented throughout the country, with the 1st dose given at the age\nof 12 months and the 2nd dose at the age of 7 years and no later than\n14 years. The geographical regions with the highest case numbers in the current\nmumps outbreak largely concur with the areas that were most severely\naffected during previously reported rubella and measles epidemics\n Monitoring of the immunisation status\nand vaccine effectiveness, high vaccination coverage rates with 2\ndoses, and catch-up campaigns are necessary to avoid measles, mumps,\nor rubella outbreaks in the future. High\nnumbers of mumps cases in male adolescents were reported recently from\nseveral countries, such as Israel, the United Kingdom, the\nNetherlands, and the United States [5,12-14]. \nImmunisation against mumps was introduced in Bosnia and Herzegovina in\n1980 in the form of a combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and\nrubella (MMR) The children, who were supposed to\nget their 1st vaccination between 1992 and 1998 are now between 14 and\n20 years old and constitute a large proportion of the people affected\nby the current outbreak. Between 1992 and 1995, the war\ncaused disruptions to the routine immunisation programme in the\ncountry, and these disruptions continued also during the post-war\nperiod (1996-1998). The MMR vaccine produced by the Institute of Immunology\nZagreb was used until 2009 and contained the L-Zagreb strain as the\ncomponent, and since 2010, the Glaxo SmithKline MMR vaccine containing\nthe Jeryl Lynn strain has been employed [1,2]. The MMR vaccine produced by the Institute of Immunology Zagreb was\nused until 2009 and contained the L-Zagreb strain as component, and\nsince 2010, the Glaxo SmithKline MMR vaccine containing the Jeryl Lynn\nstrain has been employed. As the triple MMR\nvaccine has been in use since 1980, it would be interesting to have\ninformation on the incidence of measles and rubella during the same\nperiod. \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Similar to the rubella outbreak in 2010 [10], more males contracted\nthe disease (62 per cent), and the most severely affected age group\nwere young adolescents (15 to 19 years of age, 43 per cent). In December 2010, 85 cases were\nreported, and the peak of the outbreak was in April 2011 with 1240\ncases reported (figure 3). Our data also show that most cases in the\ncurrent outbreak (85 per cent) either did not know their vaccination\nstatus or reported being not or incompletely vaccinated. \n\nThe majority of cases reported during the current outbreak were\ndiagnosed based on clinical symptoms, sometimes supported by\nepidemiological data. Symptomatic meningitis has been reported to\noccur in up to 15 per cent of patients and orchitis in as many as 50\nper cent of post-pubertal males in other studies [12]. In the period before 1980, when vaccination against mumps was\nintroduced, morbidity was high with an incidence ranging from 189 to\n253 cases per 100 000 inhabitants per year (figure 2). The outbreak affected mainly those unvaccinated or unaware\nof their vaccination status and is probably due to vaccination\nfailures during the war and post-war period (1992-1998). In December 2010, the cantons of Zenica-Doboj (n=40) and Central\nBosnia (n=34) reported an increased number of mumps cases to the\nMinistry of Health of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the start of the outbreak in December 2010, 5261 cases have\noccurred in 9 of the 10 cantons of the country; however, cantons are\naffected to a different extent. From December 2010 until the end of July 2011, 5261 mumps cases were\nrecorded in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, leading to an\nincidence of 225.8 per 100 000. Until 1992, it was recommended to vaccinate\nchildren between one and 14 years of age without documented history of\nmumps with one dose of MMR vaccine. Only a few cases have been reported in\nUna-Sana, Tuzla, Bosnian Podrinje, West Herzegovina, and West Bosnia\ncantons, and no cases from Posavina Canton (figure 4). The level of immunisation achieved in Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite\na decline in cases between 2002 and 2010, has not been sufficient to\ninterrupt the transmission of mumps virus infection. It was recommended to increase the vaccination coverage with\n2 doses of MMR vaccine in children between one and 14 years of age,\nand some schools with increased case numbers were temporarily closed.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "measles", "mumps", "rubella"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["1992-03-25 00:00:00", "1981-03-25 00:00:00", "2002-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2009-03-25 00:00:00", "2743-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00", "2010-03-25 00:00:00", "1956-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-04-25 00:00:00", "5219-03-25 00:00:00", "2010-12-25 00:00:00", "1240-03-25 00:00:00", "2001-03-25 00:00:00", "2032-03-25 00:00:00", "1980-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Zagreb", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bosnia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bosnia and", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the \n Netherlands", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yugoslavia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "symptomatic", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Herzegovna", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Background", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Posavina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Herzegovina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tuzla", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Israel", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "813559", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps - Canada (04): (ON)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=813559", "date": "2011-08-09 16:47:02", "main_text": "MUMPS - CANADA (04): (ONTARIO)\n******************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 8 Aug 2011\nFrom: Effie Gournis\n<egourni@toronto.ca>\n\n\nOutbreak of mumps in Toronto - Canada (Ontario)\n-----------------------------------------------\nToronto Public Health reports 11 cases of mumps (10 confirmed and 1\nprobable) since 20 Jul 2011.

A total of 77\npeople have contracted the disease according to the BCCDC. About 50 of\nthose cases were from an earlier outbreak in Whistler and Squamish and\nthe rest have been in the Lower Mainland. About 70 per cent of the\ncases were between 18 and 35 years of age, but cases have ranged from\none to 54 years of age.\n\n'We do have cases in the Vancouver area now, whereas the earlier part\nof the outbreak was really in Whistler and Squamish,' said Dr Monica\nNaus. It's the 1st sizeable mumps outbreak in the province since 2008\nand it is largely affecting young adults. But the centre did not say\nhow many cases have been discovered or specify where it has been\ndetected around Metro Vancouver or the Fraser Valley. In 2008 nearly\n200 people in the Fraser Valley and Metro Vancouver were infected with\nthe normally rare virus. The outbreak was been traced back to a Fraser\nValley religious group that opposes the mumps vaccination.\n\n'Symptoms of mumps include fever, sore throat or cough, swelling of\nthe salivary glands, usually the parotid glands, resulting in\n'chipmunk cheeks',' said the alert, which was issued on Monday [20 Jun\n2011]. 'Mumps can cause meningitis, and orchitis (inflammation of the\ntesticles) which is more common in adult males and rarely results in\nsterility, as well as other serious complications such as deafness. It\nis spread by respiratory secretions through coughing and sneezing but\nalso direct contact such as kissing or sharing utensils or water\nbottles.'\n\n'Anyone who suspects they have mumps should contact their physician\nby telephone 1st or call the HealthLink BC. Mumps is contagious so\nanyone with this infection should avoid exposing others especially in\nmedical waiting rooms and emergency rooms,' according to the alert.\n\nThe centre is asking parents to immunize their children with the MMR\nvaccine and for adults to make sure their own immunizations are up to\ndate. 'In BC, children receive 2 doses of mumps vaccine at 12 and 18\nmonths. The vaccine is given as the combined measles, mumps and\nrubella (MMR) vaccine, and provides protection against all 3 diseases.\nFor best protection against mumps, those born in 1970 and later should\nalso receive 2 doses.'\n\nSince 1995, children in BC have received a mumps vaccine at 12 months\nof age and 18 months, Dr Perry Kendall, the provincial health officer\nsaid in 2008.

Mumps is a viral illness characterized\nby swollen salivary glands, fever, and headache. In severe cases,\nmeningitis, orchitis (testicular swelling) and hearing loss can\noccur.\n\nSince February 2011, a total of 90 cases have been reported, mostly\nin young adults.\n\nSetting:\nWhistler is a popular ski and outdoor activities destination north of\nVancouver that attracts visitors and seasonal employees from all over\nthe world. The permanent population of Whistler is estimated to be\napproximately 10 500, although the area attracts over 2700 seasonal\nemployees and 14 800 visitors each year. An additional estimated 3700\nemployees commute to Whistler on a daily basis from surrounding\ncommunities, increasing the daily average population to approximately\n32 000. The entire region of Vancouver Coastal Health, which includes\nWhistler, has a population of 1.1 million.\n\nEpidemiology:\nMumps is spread by direct contact with the saliva of an infected\nperson. Current case definition includes individuals having symptoms\nconsistent with mumps illness and:\n(a) laboratory confirmation of mumps RNA; or\n(b) epidemiological links to a laboratory confirmed case; or\n(c) recent travel to Whistler.\n\nThe earliest date of symptom onset was 22 Feb 2011 in a Whistler\nresident, and while cases continue to reside predominantly in the\nWhistler region, increasing numbers of cases in surrounding cities,\nincluding Vancouver and Richmond, have been reported. Several of these\nrecent cases have no known links to Whistler; though many are\nclustered among the same household or social network.\n\nThe disease is primarily affecting young adults; the median age of\nall cases is 27.0 years (age range: 1-54 years), and 54 cases (60.0\nper cent) are male.\n\nTransmission among initial Whistler-linked cases was primarily by\nsharing marijuana joints, cigarettes, drinks, and utensils.\n\nNearly 60 per cent of cases with links to Whistler are employed\neither by the mountain resort or in the hospitality and retail sector.\nThese sectors employ a largely seasonal workforce arising from many\ndifferent countries across the globe.\n\nClinical presentation:\nNearly all cases presented with unilateral or bilateral parotitis\n(97.8 per cent). 22 per cent of male cases presented with orchitis.\nOther symptoms included fever (58.9 per cent), myalgia (34.4 per\ncent), headache (24.4 per cent), pharyngitis (22.2 per cent),\narthralgia (7.8 per cent), fatigue (7.8 per cent), and nausea (5.6 per\ncent).\n\nIdentified cases have been encouraged to self-isolate for 9 days\nfollowing symptom onset.\n\nImmunization history:\nThe majority of cases have not received the 2 doses of\nmumps-containing vaccine needed for full protection. As Whistler hosts\na largely transient (and international) population, immunization\nhistories of residents vary greatly.\n\nIn our health region, most children and youth born between 1970 and\n1995 will not have had 2 doses of MMR, as the 2nd dose was not\nincluded in the routine immunization schedule for this age group. A\n2nd MMR at 18 months of age became part of routine infant immunization\nin 1996.\n\nGenotype:\n16 cases to date have been confirmed as Genotype G, a common genotype\nof mumps that was observed in several other recent North American\noutbreaks.\n\nPublic health response to date:\n- Notification has been given to all primary care providers and\nemergency physicians in the health region to be vigilant for patients\npresenting with swelling of the parotid gland, or other\nmumps-compatible illness.\n\n- Collection of laboratory specimens including blood for serology and\nbuccal swabs and/or urine for detection of mumps virus RNA.\n\n- Recommendation of 2 doses of mumps containing vaccine for all\nindividuals born on or after 1 Jan 1970. One dose is recommended for\nall individuals born between 1 Jan 1957 and 31 Dec 1969 who do not\nhave evidence of immunity to mumps.\n\n- Notification to all health jurisdictions across Canada through the\nCNPHI (Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence) web platform.\n\n- Media advisory in Whistler (March and April 2011) on outbreak and\ninformation on where to access vaccine and messaging for those without\nhealth insurance.\n\n- Drop-in immunization clinics have been held at the Whistler Health\nCare Centre since March 2011.\n\n- A targeted immunization campaign was launched in Whistler to\ncoincide with the 10-day Telus Ski & Snowboard Festival (15-24 Apr\n2011), the largest annual winter sports and music festival in North\nAmerica. Over 600 doses of MMR were given to contacts of cases and\nindividuals who live and work in Whistler through vaccination at\nworksites and a drop-in clinic at a centrally located community\npharmacy. Approximately 50 per cent of those taking up vaccination\nwere overseas nationals of Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom,\nSouth Africa, and smaller numbers from other European and Asian\ncountries.\n\nFurther planned public health response:\n- Continued messaging and immunization to target post-secondary\neducational institutions in the region with a particular focus on new\nstudents arriving in August 2011 for the start of the new academic\nyear.\n\n- Targeted immunization at staff orientations to be held by major\nemployers in the resort municipality of Whistler in anticipation of\nnew international staff arriving in the fall [2011].\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nPaul Martiquet MD\nMedical Health Officer\n\nReka Gustafson MD\nMedical Health Officer and Medical Director Communicable Disease\nControl\n\nEmily Laflamme MPH\nRegional Epidemiologist, Public Health Surveillance Unit\n\nJat Sandhu PhD\nRegional Director, Public Health Surveillance Unit\nOffice of the Chief Medical Health Officer\nVancouver Coastal Health Authority\n800 601 West Broadway\nVancouver, British Columbia\nCanada V5Z 4C2\nhttp:www.vch.ca\n<phsu@vch.ca>\n\n[Contact <phsu@vch.ca> at Vancouver Coastal Health Authority\nhttp:www.vch.ca for further information.\n\nFor the VCH Health Watch monthly public health bulletin (with map of\nregion), see\nhttp://www.vch.ca/your_health/disease_surveillance/health_watch/.\n\nSince the previous report, the number of confirmed cases of mumps\nvirus infection has increased from 77 to 90, indicating that the\noutbreak has not yet been contained.

By J Walker1, S Huc1, K Sinka2, A Tissington1, K\nOates1 At: 1 -- Health Protection, NHS Highland, Inverness, Scotland,\nUnited Kingdom 2 -- Health Protection Scotland, Glasgow, Scotland,\nUnited Kingdom\n\nSummary\n-------------\nWe report on an ongoing outbreak of 119 cases of mumps virus\ninfection in the Oban area of Scotland, from 29 Nov 2010 to 31 Jan\n2011. The median age of cases was 20 years, with the highest incidence\nin the 13-19-year-olds. A total of 53 cases had received 2 doses of\nmeasles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, in accordance with the United\nKingdom vaccination schedule, while 33 had received only one dose, and\n30 had not been vaccinated.\n\nOutbreak description\n------------------\nNHS [National Health Service] Highland Health Protection Team in\nScotland was notified on 29 Nov 2010 of one case of mumps in Oban, a\nrural coastal town, with a population of around 8000, on the west\ncoast of Scotland. There were no further cases for a 2-week period,\nbut by 20 Dec 2010, an outbreak in Oban was obvious, with 23 cases.\nMany of the cases were notified around the Christmas holiday period\nwhen young people returned from work and university in urban areas.\n\nBy 31 Jan 2011, a total of 119 cases had been notified in the Oban\narea. These represented more notifications than for the rest of\nScotland for the same period (90 cases in a population of 5 168 500\nindividuals). Of the 119 cases notified in Oban, 18 were laboratory\nconfirmed, and 101 were clinically diagnosed by local GPs (based on\nthose presenting with typical clinical features, including parotitis\nafter 29 Nov 2010).\n\nBackground\n-----------\nMumps, an infection caused by a paramyxovirus, is characterised by\nparotitis. It may also cause orchitis, pancreatitis and meningitis,\namong other clinical features. In Scotland, mumps is a notifiable\ndisease and is reported electronically to health boards by clinicians,\nin particular by general practitioners.\n\nMumps immunisation was introduced in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1988\nas a single dose of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, for those\naged 12-15 months. Before 1988, mumps virus caused outbreaks among\n5-9-year-olds every 3 years. They would now be aged 23 years and over.\nIn 1996, a 2-dose schedule was introduced: the 1st dose is given to\nchildren aged 13 months, and the 2nd dose is given from the age of 3\nyears and 4 months onwards.\n\nCurrent vaccination uptake rates for the 1st dose of MMR vaccine at\n24 months (for the year ending 31 Mar 2010) were 93.7 percent for\nScotland and 91.5 percent for the Argyll area (in which Oban is\nlocated). However, in the years post 1998, following a vaccine\ncontroversy which involved an alleged link between autism and the MMR\nvaccine, the uptake rates fell, reaching a low level in Scotland of\n88.5 percent and in Argyll of 85.6 percent in 2003. This cohort, who\nwould have been due vaccination in 1998-2003, would now be 8-14 years\nold.\n\nFollowing a large outbreak of mumps which affected the whole of the\nUK in 2005, the number of cases fell until 2009, when an increase was\nseen again. In Scotland, this increase has been characterised by\nperiodic, localised occurrences of mumps cases: the outbreak reported\nhere is the latest. Recently, there have been reports of outbreaks of\nmumps in other parts of the UK and other countries.\n\nCase information\n----------------\nOf the 119 cases, 63 were females and 56 males. The age range of\ncases was 4 to 71 years: 85 of the cases were in the 13-29 age group,\nand 12 were aged over 40 years. Anecdotal information revealed 3 cases\nwith complications (orchitis, pancreatitis). However, more detailed\ninformation on complications overall is currently being evaluated.\n\nBy 31 Jan 2011, vaccination status was known for 116 of the 119\ncases: 53 had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine, 33 had received only\none dose, and 30 received no doses. For those who had one dose, the\ndate of vaccination ranged from 5 Dec 1988 to 23 Feb 2009. For those\nwho had received 2 doses, the vaccination dates ranged from 28 Sep\n1989 for the 1st dose to 13 May 2008 for the 2nd dose.\n\nThe majority of the cases aged under 22 years had received 2 doses of\nMMR vaccine (53 of 80). Among the 9 cases aged 12 years or under, 8\nhad received 2 doses; among the 49 cases aged between 13 and 19 years,\n37 had received 2 doses and 11 one dose.\n\nAnecdotally, it appears that the index case may have been a student\nat one of Scotland's main universities who had returned home for the\nholidays. Many of the initial cases had subsequently attended a school\ndance and a large party in Oban. There was no common link with place\nof residence.\n\nCases continue to be notified, but the rate of notifications has\ndecreased. The peak date of symptom onset for cases was 10 Jan 2011,\nwhen 11 cases were notified. By 31 Jan 2011, there were 18\nlaboratory-confirmed cases; the rest were clinically diagnosed.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nSome GPs reported that not all those affected presented to GP\npractices, and our numbers may, therefore, be an underestimate. On the\nother hand, we applied a non-specific case definition which led to\nwide inclusion of cases.\n\nInitial concerns regarding a historical problem with a vaccine batch\nwere soon discarded as the date ranges for the 1st and 2nd\nvaccinations were wide, and vaccinations were given in different\npractices by different individuals, and there was no link with any\nparticular vaccine batch numbers.\n\nThe main limitation in our study is the low number of\nlaboratory-confirmed cases. We felt that after the initial tranche of\ncases, clinical diagnosis was adequate, and this was undertaken by\nseveral different primary care teams (101 of the 119 were clinically\ndiagnosed). The laboratory has confirmed that the strain involved is\ngenotype G5, in common with all strains currently seen in the UK.\n\nMMR vaccination coverage was affected by adverse publicity some years\nago, and uptake rates fell to a low of 85.6 percent in 2003 in the\nOban area. Unvaccinated individuals, plus those who were immunised but\nin whom protection had subsequently waned, combined to provide a\ncohort of vulnerable individuals who were infected in this outbreak.\nThe 45 percent (n=53) of notified cases who had received 2 doses of\nMMR vaccine is higher than the 29 percent of cases reported in England\nand Wales in 2010 and the 31 percent reported in England in 2004-05\nbut lower than the 61 percent noted in the Netherlands in 2010 and the\n75 percent reported in New Jersey, United States in 2009-10. If we\nlook at the 13-19 years age group in our study -- the most affected\nage group -- 76 percent (n=37) had received 2 doses of MMR.\n\nPublished estimates of MMR vaccine efficacy to protect against mumps\nvary. It has been reported as 88 percent (95 percent confidence\nintervals (CI): 83 percent to 91 percent) for one dose and 95 percent\n(95 percent CI: 93 percent to 96 percent) for 2 doses. In addition, 2\ndoses of vaccine were reported as being more effective (88 percent (95\npercent CI: 62 percent to 96 percent)) than a single dose (64 percent\n(95 percent CI: 40 percent to 78 percent)). Furthermore, waning\nimmunity in older vaccinated individuals has been reported.\n\nAlthough the numbers in our cohort are small, they add to the growing\nbody of evidence which suggests that immunity to mumps virus may wane\nover time. These cases highlight the importance of ensuring high\nuptake of the recommended 2 doses of MMR. They also imply a need for\nfurther research into long-term mumps immunity among those partially\nor fully vaccinated in order to inform future immunisation\nprogrammes.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Readers are recommended to read the full text of this report to view\nthe graphical presentation of the data and the specific references\ncited.

Thousands of holidaymakers and\ndaytrippers are expected to visit Brighton and Hove as the city's\ntourism industry prepares for its busiest time of the year.\n\nThe city's director of public health, Tom Scanlon, said it was 'more\nthan likely' the number of mumps cases would go up during the next 8\nweeks. He said: 'The illness is mainly affecting young people in\ntheir 20s and there are going to be large numbers visiting the city\nand going out and socialising. 'Unlike measles, which normally\naffects schoolchildren and would be likely to show a fall in numbers\nin the summer because of the holidays, I would expect to see an\nincrease when it comes to mumps.'\n\nThere have been 112 confirmed cases across Sussex [county] so far\nthis year and numbers are expected to soon pass the 139 recorded for\nthe whole of 2009. The worst-hit area is Brighton and Hove, which has\nhad 52 cases so far, almost double the number in 2009. A total of 39\npeople have been affected in East Sussex, just 3 short of the 42 in\n2009. West Sussex has had 21 patients struck down so far, which is\nlower than the 70 the year before. However in 2009, there was a large\noutbreak of cases at Chichester College [in West sussex], which\nskewed the numbers. Cases are affecting both young adults and\nteenagers.\n\nThe rise in cases has sparked renewed calls for people to make sure\nthey are vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)\nvaccine. The take-up rate for the 1st of 2 recommended MMR jabs in\nBrighton and Hove is currently 82 percent but the percentage having\ntwo doses is 69 percent. This is well below the 90 percent the World\nHealth Organisation says needs to be vaccinated to protect a\ncommunity. Take-up rates are higher in East and West Sussex but there\nis still room for improvement.\n\nDr Scanlon said: 'It certainly seems as if the numbers of mumps cases\nare actually spreading around Sussex and not just Brighton and Hove\nand that is concerning. 'This is a potentially very serious disease\nand I would urge all those eligible to get vaccinated as soon as\npossible.' Those affected are mainly young adults. This may be\nbecause the MMR vaccine was not available when they were small.\nOthers may not have had the jab [injection] because of concerns about\nresearch published in the late 1990s, which suggested a link with\nautism. This [research] has since been discredited.

Synlab Medical Care Service, Medical Care Centre Weiden, Weiden, Germany\n4. Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University of\nRegensburg, Regensburg, Germany\n\nSummary\n-------\nSince the introduction of the 2-dose MMR vaccination regime, the\nincidence of mumps virus infections has substantially declined.\nHowever, mumps outbreaks have recently been reported from several\ncountries. Here we report an ongoing mumps outbreak in Germany.\nBetween 1 Jul 2010 and 31 Oct 2010, 115 infections have been\nlaboratory-confirmed. Reported complications include one case of\nmeningitis and 21 cases of orchitis, suggesting a high rate of\ncomplications. We suggest a vaccination campaign for young adults in\nnorthern Bavaria to limit severe mumps infections.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nMumps virus infections may have a variable clinical outcome. Most\ncommonly they lead to fever and parotitis. However, up to 30 per cent\nof male adolescent mumps cases develop orchitis. The German Standing\nCommittee on Vaccination (Standige Impfkommission, STIKO) recommends\nthat children be vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR measles-mumps-rubella\n(MMR) or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine within their\n1st 2 years of life (between 11 and 14 months and between 15 and 23\nmonths) [1]. Mumps is not a notifiable disease in Germany, therefore\ninformation about mumps cases or outbreaks is scant. In other European\ncountries, the introduction of a 2-dose MMR vaccination regime\nresulted in a strong decline of the number of mumps virus infections\n[2-4]. However, resurgent outbreaks of mumps were recently reported\nfrom several European countries [2-11], the United States (US) and\nCanada [12-14]. Many of the outbreaks were seen in highly vaccinated\npopulations, calling mumps virus vaccine efficiency into question\n[2-4, 6-9]. Here we report on an ongoing mumps outbreak in Germany.\n\nMethods and Results\n-------------------\nThe Synlab Medical Care Service Centre, Weiden, Bavaria, analyses\nlaboratory samples from about 40 hospitals and more than 2000\nphysicians serving outpatients predominantly from northern Bavaria\n[15]. In this study, results of serological mumps tests were\nevaluated. Data collected between January 2009 and October 2010 were\nexamined. In total, 1248 serum samples were examined for IgM\nantibodies and 4824 samples for IgG antibodies. More than 99 percent\nof these samples were derived from Bavarian patients.\n\nMumps antibody testing of patient sera was performed by using\nEnzygnost ELISA (anti-parotitis-virus/IgM and\nanti-parotitis-virus/IgG, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products,\nMarburg, Germany). Results of IgM ELISA were given as negative,\nborderline (equivocal), and positive. Results of IgG ELISA were given\nas negative (under 230 U/ml), borderline (equivocal) (230-500 U/ml),\nand positive (over 500 U/ml). In the present analysis, acute mumps\ninfection was assumed when patients were IgM antibody positive or when\npatients either showed a borderline IgM antibody test result in\ncombination with typical symptoms or had detectable mumps virus\nribonucleic acid (RNA).\n\nThe German Reference Centre for measles, mumps and rubella virus at\nthe Robert Koch Institut performed PCR [polymerase chain reaction]\nanalyses from either throat swabs and/or urine samples. Genotyping of\ndetected mumps virus was performed as recommended in the Proposal for\nGenetic Characterisation of wild-type mumps strains [16].\n\nClinical data from mumps patients with orchitis were recorded at the\nDepartment of Urology at the St. Josef Medical Centre in Regensburg.\nThe Department of Urology is a facility of the University of Regensburg.\n\nIn the pre-outbreak period from January 2009 to June 2010, the number\nof patients infected with mumps virus was low (median per month N = 1\n(range 0-3)). However, this number has dramatically increased since\nthe outbreak started. In July 2010, 6 patients tested positive for\nmumps IgM antibodies. In August 2010, 18 patients tested positive, in\nSeptember 2010, 22 patients and in October 2010, 32 patients,\nrespectively. Additionally, in August 2010, 11 patients exhibiting\nmumps infection symptoms had borderline IgM test results. In September\n2010, this number was 8, and in October 2010, the number was 13.\n\nFurthermore, positive PCR results were obtained from 7 patients. Only\n2 of the patients showed IgM antibodies, while all PCR-positive\npatients exhibited IgG antibodies (median 14 000 U/ml). Genetic\ncharacterisation of mumps virus detected in the clinical material of 7\ncases revealed presence of genotype G.\n\nIn total, 115 mumps infections were confirmed positive at the Weiden\nSynlab laboratory and at the Robert Koch Institute between 1 Jul and\n31 Oct 2010. The median age was 24.5 years (mean 26.8 years, range\n14-62 years). However, information on the vaccination status was\navailable from only 7 mumps patients. One of them was unvaccinated,\none patient had received one dose of MMR, and 5 patients had been\nvaccinated twice.\n\nThe majority of the infections occurred in the city of Regensburg\n(about 135 000 inhabitants) or in the surrounding area. This finding\nwas most prominent in August 2010, while in September and October\n2010, an increasing number of cases were noted in the region located\nnorthwest of Regensburg.\n\nIn August 2010, one patient was diagnosed with mumps meningitis and a\n2nd case was suspected in November 2010. In total, 21 patients were\ntreated at the St. Josef Hospital in Regensburg (median age 26 years)\nbetween July and October 2010, resulting in a total of 76 days of\nhospitalisation.\n\nDiscussion\n---------\nWe give a preliminary description of an ongoing outbreak of mumps\nvirus infection in northern Bavaria. Similarly to previous outbreaks\nin Austria, Luxembourg, Ireland and the Netherlands, the present\noutbreak affects mainly young adult patients [4, 5, 9,11].\n\nWe suppose that the actual number of affected patients is by far\nhigher than 115 cases, since certainly not every clinical case was\nconfirmed in our laboratory. Furthermore, the present case definition\nin Germany uses positive IgM antibody and/or positive PCR results\n[17]. Many patients with clinical symptoms displayed high IgG antibody\ntitres probably due to prior immunisation or infection. As known from\nother viral diseases a viral re-infection is not necessarily\naccompanied by a rise in IgM antibodies but rather by an increase of\nIgG antibodies. Accordingly, during the outbreak months of July,\nAugust, September and October 2010, the median IgG titres were\nmarkedly higher than those observed in the previous months (January\n2009-June 2010). This supports the hypothesis that many mumps\n(re-)infections were accompanied by an increase of IgG antibody titre\nand not by the formation of IgM antibodies. This may have resulted in\nan underestimation in the number of mumps cases.\n\nAbsence of mumps virus-specific IgM antibodies in the majority of the\nclinical cases, as determined in the current outbreak in Germany, is\nconcordant with the laboratory data reported by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention from an outbreak observed in a highly\nvaccinated population in the USA [12].\n\nIn contrast to Germany, mumps is a notifiable disease in Ireland and\nthe Netherlands, where the collection of epidemiological data from\nmany patients has been possible. In these populations, the majority of\nthe patients had been vaccinated, and, at least in the Dutch group,\nmost patients had been vaccinated twice [9]. Although we could get\nonly limited information about vaccination status, our data support\nthe finding that most patients had been vaccinated completely,\nindicating that complete vaccination does not prevent mumps infection\nin an outbreak situation with absolute certainty.\n\nThe current outbreak in Bavaria was caused by mumps virus genotype G.\nPrevious analyses have revealed that this genotype was associated with\nseveral mumps outbreaks in Europe and the USA [2,5,18,19]. The\npossible emergence of a mutant strain of mumps virus has been reported\nunder the selective pressure of immunisation with limited or no\ncross-protection induced by the vaccine strain [20]. A recent analysis\nindicated that individuals possessing low levels of neutralising\nantibodies may be at risk for breakthrough infections [21]. These\nfindings underline the importance of investigating whether the current\nsituation in Germany is due to a high degree of susceptible\nindividuals or to a breakthrough of a currently circulating wildtype\nmumps virus.\n\nIn the present outbreak, predominantly young male patients have been\naffected. Complications as mumps orchitis have resulted in the\nhospitalisation of at least 13 young adult males. The outbreak started\nin the city of Regensburg (about 135 000 inhabitants) and its\nsurrounding area. In September and October 2010, an increasing number\nof cases was noted in the region located northwest of Regensburg. Due\nto very recent observations, this trend also continued in November\n2010, and it seems probable that the outbreak will soon reach the city\nof Nuremberg (about 500 000 inhabitants) and surroundings with 1.2\nmillion inhabitants.\n\nMeasures taken by public health service in Luxembourg were recently\nproven to help in confining a mumps outbreak among the military staff\n[5]. Furthermore, a mass-vaccination successfully stopped a mumps\noutbreak in Austria [11]. Therefore, it appears highly beneficial to\ninitiate a vaccination campaign in northern Bavaria.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Interested readers should consult the original text via the URL in\nthe heading in order to view the tabulated data, figures and the\nliterature references.\n\nThe analysis of this extensive continuing outbreak of mumps in\nBavaria, Germany raises some interesting questions. Most of the\npatients had received 2 doses of (MMR or MMRV) vaccine previously,\nindicating that complete vaccination does not always provide\nprotection against mumps virus infection in an ongoing outbreak\nsituation such as the current outbreak in Regensburg. It is still\nunclear whether this represents a deficiency in the immunising\ncapacity of the mumps component of the vaccine, or a change in the\nantigenicity of the outbreak strain. The latter seems less likely\nsince the outbreak strain is the ubiquitous G genotype.\n\nRecent observations indicate that the outbreak has continued through\nNovember 2010, and it is likely the outbreak will extend to the more\ndensely populated city of Nuremberg and its surroundings.\n\nA map of Bavaria showing the location of Regensburg can be accessed\nat: <http://munich.usconsulate.gov/news/map.html>.

In other European\ncountries, the introduction of a 2-dose MMR vaccination regime\nresulted in a strong decline of the number of mumps virus infections\n Mumps antibody testing of patient sera was performed by using\nEnzygnost ELISA (anti-parotitis-virus/IgM and\nanti-parotitis-virus/IgG, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products,\nMarburg, Germany). Accordingly, during the outbreak months of July,\nAugust, September and October 2010, the median IgG titres were\nmarkedly higher than those observed in the previous months (January\n2009-June 2010). The\npossible emergence of a mutant strain of mumps virus has been reported\nunder the selective pressure of immunisation with limited or no\ncross-protection induced by the vaccine strain [20]. It is still\nunclear whether this represents a deficiency in the immunising\ncapacity of the mumps component of the vaccine, or a change in the\nantigenicity of the outbreak strain. In total, 21 patients were\ntreated at the St. Josef Hospital in Regensburg (median age 26 years)\nbetween July and October 2010, resulting in a total of 76 days of\nhospitalisation. This finding\nwas most prominent in August 2010, while in September and October\n2010, an increasing number of cases were noted in the region located\nnorthwest of Regensburg.

So\nfar this year [2010], 9 cases of mumps have been reported, 2 more\nthan were seen in all of 2009, according to county health officer\nJonathan Fielding.\n\nFour of the mumps cases may be related to an outbreak, largely among\nOrthodox Jews, that has persisted in New York and New Jersey for\nalmost a year. According to the New York State Department of Health,\nthere have been more than 2800 confirmed and probable mumps cases in\nNew York and 315 in New Jersey. The outbreak has also spread to\nQuebec [Canada], where 20 mumps cases have been linked to the New\nYork outbreak, and to Israel, where more than 2600 have been infected.\n\nDr David Keene, a pediatrician in Beverly Hills, saw 2 mumps cases\nrecently, involving a student who attends the private high school\nYeshiva Ohr Elchonon Chabad in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles\nand a 2-year-old whose uncle attends the school. 'A lot of people\nwent traveling at Passover, which was about six weeks ago. They went\nhome and visited their friends with mumps, and three weeks later they\ngot sick,' Keene said.\n\nHealth officials said the Orthodox Jewish community as a whole has\nhigh vaccination rates, which is limiting the outbreak's size. The\nproblem is that the vaccine is not completely effective. One dose is\n73 percent to 91 percent effective; those who get a booster shot see\n79 percent to 95 percent effectiveness. 'Sometimes, when mumps gets\nestablished somewhat in a community and you determine immunization\nrates are pretty high, sometimes it just has to run its course,' said\nTom Skinner, a spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe New York outbreak began in June 2009 when an unvaccinated\n11-year-old boy visited Britain, where mumps outbreaks remain a\nproblem. He then attended a summer camp in New York's Sullivan County\nfor Jewish boys. The disease, transmitted by coughing and sneezing,\nspread when the campers returned home.\n\nThe outbreak fits the profile of the last major US mumps outbreak in\n2006, spreading in places where people have prolonged, close contact.\nOutbreaks have been notable at boys-only Orthodox Jewish schools,\nwhere students sit for long periods facing a study partner. Another\nreason could be the larger size of many Orthodox families, the CDC said.\n\nRabbi Chaim Cunin of Chabad of California, a Westwood-based Orthodox\ngroup, said his community has been monitoring the outbreak since last\nyear [2009]. 'We live in a frequent-flier age. If the Jewish\ncommunity on the East Coast has an issue, it's certainly something we\nwould monitor on the West Coast,' Cunin said. Private Jewish schools\nhave been on a 'heightened state of alert' to quickly send sick\nchildren home, he said.\n\nMumps, which causes fever, aches, and fatigue, can also swell\nsalivary glands, causing what are called 'chipmunk cheeks.' Most\npeople recover within 10 days. Before the vaccine was released in\n1967, about 186 000 people in the United States got the mumps every\nyear, but the number has since fallen to fewer than 500 cases\nannually. Keene said some of the rare complications of mumps include\ndeafness and inflammation of the testicles. If that happens in males\nafter adolescence, it could in rare cases cause sterility.\n\nHealth officials have been concerned about a drop in childhood\nvaccinations based on allegations, since discredited, that vaccines\ncause autism. The Times in 2009 reported that a rising number of\nCalifornia parents were choosing to send their children to\nkindergarten without routine vaccinations, putting hundreds of\nelementary schools in the state at risk for outbreaks of childhood\ndiseases eradicated in the US years ago.\n\n[Byline: Rong-Gong Lin II]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[The current outbreak of mumps in California may be a delayed\nconsequence of the outbreak, largely among Orthodox Jews, that has\npersisted in New York and New Jersey for almost a year, and\nsubsequently spread to Canada (Quebec) and Israel.

The child, who was not identified, has swollen glands and\nother symptoms associated with mumps, said Allentown Health Bureau\nDirector Vicky Kistler. Health officials are investigating how the\nchild became ill. 'We want to make sure we don't have an outbreak\nhere locally,' Kistler said.\n\nSo far, the child's case does not appear to be connected to other\nconfirmed cases in the state, Kistler said. As of last week, the\nstate Department of Health was reporting 3 cases of mumps in\nsoutheastern Pennsylvania. Those cases were associated with a\nnational outbreak, primarily affecting Hasidic Jewish populations\nfrom New York and New Jersey. The outbreak is the largest in the U.S.\nsince 2006, when almost 6600 cases were reported in six Midwestern\nstates. In a normal year, about 300 cases are reported nationwide.\n\nAs of last week, there were 2903 cases of mumps reported nationally\nsince an outbreak began last summer in a boys camp in the Catskill\nMountains, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMumps typically start with a few days of fever, headache, muscle\naches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, and is followed by swelling\nof glands in the neck. Anyone who is not immune from either previous\nmumps infection or from vaccination can get mumps. But vaccination\nisn't a guarantee against contracting mumps. In New York, almost all\nof those infected had received mumps vaccine, which suggests that\ncrowded households and close contact in schools can sometimes\noverwhelm the protective effects of immunization.\n\nKistler advised parents to monitor children for symptoms. Parents who\nsuspect their children have mumps should keep them away from others\nand seek medical attention, calling doctors in advance so infected\nchildren don't sit in crowded waiting rooms.\n\nBefore the routine vaccination program was introduced in the U.S.,\nmumps was common in infants, children and young adults.

As of 20 Apr 2010,\n172 cases have been notified on the basis of\nlaboratory confirmation or linkage to a\nlaboratory-confirmed case. Of these, 112 were\nstudents, the majority of whom had been\nvaccinated (81 percent). Although outbreaks in\nvaccinated populations have been described\nbefore, risk factors for exposure and\nsusceptibility, and dose-dependent vaccine\neffectiveness in a student population of this nature are relatively unknown.\n\nBackground\n----------\nMumps has been a notifiable disease in the\nNetherlands since 2009. Notification criteria\ninclude at least one related symptom (acute onset\nof painful swelling of the parotid or other\nsalivary glands, orchitis or meningitis) and\nlaboratory confirmation of infection or an\nepidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed\ncase [1]. The measles\u00admumps\u00adrubella (MMR) vaccine\ncontaining the Jeryl Lynn mumps virus strain was\nintroduced in the Netherlands in 1987.\nVaccination is recommended, with a 2 dose\nschedule at the age of 14 months and 9 years. In\n2007 and 2009, an epidemic (genotype D) occurred\nin a socio-geographically clustered, Dutch\nreformed protestant community with low\nvaccination coverage [2]. Nationally however,\nvaccine coverage with 2 doses has been\nconsistently above 93 percent [3]. Despite this,\nan outbreak of mumps occurred among vaccinated\nnational and international students at a\nparticular school in 2004 [4]. A resurgence of\nmumps has been observed in vaccinated populations\nin countries worldwide since 2004 [5].\n\nDescriptive epidemiology\n------------------------\nIn the 11 months from January to November 2009,\n65 cases of mumps were reported to the National\nInstitute for Public Health and Environment\n(RIVM) in the Netherlands. Between 1 Dec 2009 and\n20 Apr 2010, 172 notifications of mumps cases\nwere received, of whom 24 percent became ill in\nlate February (week 11) 2010. Seventy-nine of the\ncases were from the Municipal Health Service\n(MHS) Zuid-Holland West (including the city of\nDelft), 44 were from MHS Hollands-Midden\n(including the city of Leiden) and accounted for\nthe majority of cases in week 11, 11 were\nreported in MHS Utrecht, and an additional 38\ncases were reported from other regions across the\nNetherlands. The median age was 21 years (range:\n4 to 46 years) and 58 percent (n=99) were male.\nMost of the patients had mild symptoms, but 14 (9\npercent) reported some complication, which in 12\ncases was orchitis (12 percent of men). One\nperson was hospitalised for one night due to\nsevere symptoms but had no complications.\nRoutinely collected notification data revealed\nthat a large proportion of cases (n=112, 65\npercent) were students. A further 11 cases were contacts of students.\n\nA total of 27 student-cases (24 percent of cases)\nreported attending a student party (attended by\nover 2000 students) held in mid-February (week 8)\nover 4 days and nights in a building of the\nLeiden student's association. The students\nsuspected this to be the source of infection.\nGiven the incubation period of mumps is typically\n16 to 18 days, this would coincide with the surge\nin cases seen in week 11 in MHS Hollands-Midden.\nSome attended the party for one night only\n(mainly students from Delft and Utrecht), but the\nmajority from Leiden attended for 3 or 4 days and\nnights in succession. An outbreak investigation\ninto risk factors for acquisition of mumps by the\nMHS in Leiden, Delft and Utrecht is currently\nunderway in collaboration with the Centre for\nInfectious Disease Control of RIVM.\n\nMicrobiological findings\n------------------------\nThe clinical diagnosis of notified cases was\nlaboratory-confirmed by at least one method in 46\npercent of cases (n=79): by detection of a\nmumps-specific IgM antibody response in 20\npercent of cases (n=32), by detection of mumps\nvirus RNA in 30 percent (n=48), and/or by\ncultivation of mumps virus in 10 percent (n=16).\nWhere there was no laboratory confirmation, an\nepidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed\ncase was established in 45 percent of cases\n(n=78). 5 cases did not meet notification\ncriteria because they were linked\nepidemiologically to an index case, but\nlaboratory confirmation of that index case was\nnot established at the time of notification. The\nremaining 10 cases reportedly met the\nnotification criteria, but reasons for\nnotification were incomplete or missing (n=6\npercent). Genotyping of isolated mumps viruses\nrevealed that the outbreak strain belonged to the G5 lineage.\n\nVaccination status of cases\n---------------------------\nReported vaccination coverage among cases,\nparticularly among the students, was high. (Data\ntabulated in the original text). Of the 164 for\nwhom vaccine status was known, 115 (70 percent)\nwere vaccinated and 100 (61 percent) had received\nat least 2 mumps vaccinations. Among the 106\nstudents for whom vaccine status was known, 85\n(81 percent) were vaccinated at least once, and\n79 of them were vaccinated at least twice.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nMumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations are\nreported world-wide [5-7]. Clinical attack rates\nare generally lower in vaccinated populations\n(indicating a protective effect), but there is\ngrowing evidence of waning immunity over time,\n[8-10] leading to secondary vaccine failure\n[4,10-12]. The majority of cases in this outbreak\nwere students aged 18 to 24 years, of whom 73\npercent had received at least 2 mumps\nvaccinations. The clustering of cases among\nstudents (in Leiden and to a lesser extent in\nDelft and Utrecht) suggests that intensive social\ncontact during the 4-day party may have\nfacilitated transmission. Shared living\nfacilities among members of the students'\nassociation, and the close contact environment of\nroutine college life are also likely contributing risk factors [13,14].\n\nIn accordance with recommendations from the World\nHealth Organization [15], most countries now\noffer a 2-dose vaccine schedule for mumps. In the\nNetherlands, all birth cohorts since 1982 have\nbeen offered 2 vaccine doses. Exceptionally,\nthere is a suggestion that those born in 1986 and\n1987 (now aged 23), were offered 3 doses of MMR\nat the age of 14 months, 4 years and 9 years\n[16], but this remains to be confirmed. Dutch\nchildren are older when they receive the 2nd\nvaccine dose (at age 9 years) compared to those\nin the United Kingdom, the United States and\nCanada, where it is given at 4 to 6 years of age.\nBoosting of the immune response by circulating\nwildtype virus is unlikely as mumps has not been\nwidespread in the Netherlands except for a\nrestricted outbreak within the religious\ncommunity a few years previously [2]. Primary\nvaccine failure is possible but a\npost-vaccination seroprevalence of 93.2 percent\nhas been shown in children under the age of 3\nyears in the Netherlands [17]. In addition to the\nintensive social contact implicated in this\noutbreak, the fact that it occurred among the\noldest vaccinated cohorts in the Netherlands who\nreceived 2 vaccine doses makes secondary vaccine failure more plausible.\n\nCareful investigation will be required to\nestablish the relationship between increasing age\non the one hand, and incidence rates, severity\nand post-exposure disease susceptibility on the\nother. Comparison of pre- and post-exposure\nantibody titres in a longitudinal study could\ngive clues about correlates for protection\nagainst mumps virus infection, as this is not\nwell understood for persons who have received 2\ndoses of the mumps vaccine. Antigenic differences\nbetween the Jeryl Lynn vaccine strain (genotype\nA) and the viral strain in this and other\noutbreaks (genotype G) have also previously been\nimplicated [11], but recent data suggests a good\ndegree of serologic cross-immunity between Jeryl Lynn and other genotypes [18].\n\nCurrent outbreak response measures concentrate on\ngathering good surveillance data, and students in\nthe cities affected by this mumps outbreak who\nare not fully vaccinated (i.e., with 2 doses of\nMMR) are advised to complete their MMR\nvaccination. In response to an ongoing outbreak\nin the United States among a population of young\nadults (age 7-18 years) with a similar high\nvaccination coverage, public health officials in\nNew York have been offering a 3rd dose of MMR\nvaccine in some schools since January 2010 [12].\nThe lower incidence of mumps in the Netherlands\namong those born in 1986 who may have received 3\nvaccine doses in childhood is certainly\ninteresting in this respect, but further\ninvestigation is required to confirm this.\n\nOn assessment, the risk of a large national\noutbreak in the Netherlands is considered to be\nlow because of high overall vaccine coverage and\nthe clustered nature of student social life.\nOffering a 3rd vaccine dose is not planned at\npresent. With the cooperation of the municipal\nhealth services and the students' associations,\nwe intend to conduct further research to better\nunderstand the risk factors associated with mumps\nexposure and susceptibility, and dose-related vaccine effectiveness.\n\nReferences\n----------\n(1)Parotitis epidemica: Bof (Mumps)\nB26.

Municipal Health Service (MHS), Zuid-Holland\nWest, Zoetermeer, the Netherlands]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Outbreaks of mumps in vaccinated populations\nhave been described repeatedly. Antigenic differences\nbetween the Jeryl Lynn vaccine strain (genotype\nA) and the viral strain in this and other\noutbreaks (genotype G) have also previously been\nimplicated [11], but recent data suggests a good\ndegree of serologic cross-immunity between Jeryl Lynn and other genotypes [18]. In addition to the\nintensive social contact implicated in this\noutbreak, the fact that it occurred among the\noldest vaccinated cohorts in the Netherlands who\nreceived 2 vaccine doses makes secondary vaccine failure more plausible. A total of 27 student-cases (24 percent of cases)\nreported attending a student party (attended by\nover 2000 students) held in mid-February (week 8)\nover 4 days and nights in a building of the\nLeiden student's association. Antibody induced\nby immunization with the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine\nstrain effectively neutralizes a heterologous\nwild-type mumps virus associated with a large\noutbreak. With the cooperation of the municipal\nhealth services and the students' associations,\nwe intend to conduct further research to better\nunderstand the risk factors associated with mumps\nexposure and susceptibility, and dose-related vaccine effectiveness. The lower incidence of mumps in the Netherlands\namong those born in 1986 who may have received 3\nvaccine doses in childhood is certainly\ninteresting in this respect, but further\ninvestigation is required to confirm this.\n\n Although outbreaks in\nvaccinated populations have been described\nbefore, risk factors for exposure and\nsusceptibility, and dose-dependent vaccine\neffectiveness in a student population of this nature are relatively unknown. Dutch\nchildren are older when they receive the 2nd\nvaccine dose (at age 9 years) compared to those\nin the United Kingdom, the United States and\nCanada, where it is given at 4 to 6 years of age. Primary\nvaccine failure is possible but a\npost-vaccination seroprevalence of 93.2 percent\nhas been shown in children under the age of 3\nyears in the Netherlands On assessment, the risk of a large national\noutbreak in the Netherlands is considered to be\nlow because of high overall vaccine coverage and\nthe clustered nature of student social life.\n Boosting of the immune response by circulating\nwildtype virus is unlikely as mumps has not been\nwidespread in the Netherlands except for a\nrestricted outbreak within the religious\ncommunity a few years previously Exceptionally,\nthere is a suggestion that those born in 1986 and\n1987 (now aged 23), were offered 3 doses of MMR\nat the age of 14 months, 4 years and 9 years\n In response to an ongoing outbreak\nin the United States among a population of young\nadults (age 7-18 years) with a similar high\nvaccination coverage, public health officials in\n 5 cases did not meet notification\ncriteria because they were linked\nepidemiologically to an index case, but\nlaboratory confirmation of that index case was\nnot established at the time of notification. The clustering of cases among\nstudents (in Leiden and to a lesser extent in\nDelft and Utrecht) suggests that intensive social\ncontact during the 4-day party may have\nfacilitated transmission. The\nremaining 10 cases reportedly met the\nnotification criteria, but reasons for\nnotification were incomplete or missing (n=6\npercent). In\n2007 and 2009, an epidemic (genotype D) occurred\nin a socio-geographically clustered, Dutch\nreformed protestant community with low\nvaccination coverage [2]. \n\nCareful investigation will be required to\nestablish the relationship between increasing age\non the one hand, and incidence rates, severity\nand post-exposure disease susceptibility on the\nother. Clinical attack rates\nare generally lower in vaccinated populations\n(indicating a protective effect), but there is\ngrowing evidence of waning immunity over time,\n The majority of cases in this outbreak\nwere students aged 18 to 24 years, of whom 73\npercent had received at least 2 mumps\nvaccinations. Of the 164 for\nwhom vaccine status was known, 115 (70 percent)\nwere vaccinated and 100 (61 percent) had received\nat least 2 mumps vaccinations. The fact that the outbreak\noccurred among the oldest vaccinated cohorts who\nhad received 2 vaccine doses suggests that\nsecondary vaccine failure is a more likely explanation. Between 1 Dec 2009 and\n20 Apr 2010, 172 notifications of mumps cases\nwere received, of whom 24 percent became ill in\nlate February (week 11) 2010. Sustained\ntransmission of mumps in a highly vaccinated\npopulation: assessment of primary vaccine failure\nand waning vaccine-induced immunity. Despite this,\nan outbreak of mumps occurred among vaccinated\nnational and international students at a\nparticular school in 2004 [4]. In the 11 months from January to November 2009,\n65 cases of mumps were reported to the National\nInstitute for Public Health and Environment\n(RIVM) in the Netherlands. Where there was no laboratory confirmation, an\nepidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed\ncase was established in 45 percent of cases\n(n=78). As of 20 Apr 2010,\n172 cases have been notified on the basis of\nlaboratory confirmation or linkage to a\nlaboratory-confirmed case.

After\ninitial spread into other populations throughout the state and areas of New\nJersey, CDC epidemiologist Kathleen Gallagher said the disease has now been\nexported to Connecticut, Quebec, and Israel.\n\nIncidence remains highest among boys in the Hasidic community because they\nusually spend longer hours at private schools, Gallagher said, mostly\naround other people belonging to this population. In addition to day\nstudents, these schools also board students from a variety of other regions\nand states. Therefore, boys potentially exposed to mumps may inadvertently\nspread the disease among other communities when they return home for\nholidays, emphasizing the importance of up-to-date, 2-dose vaccinations in\nthis age group.\n\nThe potential for a 3-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR II,\nMerck) was also a focal point at the meeting. Currently, officials in\nOrange County, New York have tried administering a 3rd dose to children in\nefforts to control the outbreak. Although little data are available,\nGallagher said studies to evaluate the efficacy of a 3-dose vaccine regimen\nare ongoing.\n\nAdditional discussion addressed the genotype responsible for the outbreak,\nas well as the current vaccine's ability to effectively prevent the spread\nof disease. Officials have identified genotype G from the United Kingdom,\nwhich was also present in the 2006 mumps outbreak, as the culprit for the\ncurrent outbreak. Gallagher noted that there was 'nothing special' about\ngenotype G, and the MMR vaccine may [induce] antibodies to this strain.\n\nNevertheless, other committee members said the mumps component of the MMRV\n[measles, mumps, rubella, varicella] has always been less effective than\nthe measles and rubella components, and some attributed this to the strain\ncontained in the vaccine. 'It's a complex situation that we have, but as\nI've said to my colleagues from Merck, we do need a better mumps strain\nthan we currently have,' Stanley A Plotkin, MD, of Sanofi-Pasteur, said.\n'Even though we have a number of [mumps strains], none of them are perfect.'\n\n[byline: Melissa Foster]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of cases in this outbreak has increased from the 1521 reported\non 29 Jan 2010 to the current figure of 2336.

As the Health Department\nnoted in a December 2009 medical alert, young men in Williamsburg,\nCrown Heights and Borough Park have experienced high levels of mumps\nfor several months. As of 8 Feb 2010, the agency had confirmed 909\ncases and was investigating an additional 344. Most cases have\noccurred in males, and an increasing number of cases have been in\nyoung adults, ages 18 to 30. Complications from mumps can include\nviral meningitis, hearing loss and reproductive problems for men.\n\n'Vaccination against mumps is important for your health, your\nfamily's health, and your community's health,' said Dr. Jane R.\nZucker, the Health Department's assistant commissioner for\nimmunization. 'Mumps can lead to serious complications in people who\nare not vaccinated, especially adults. If you have not been\nvaccinated against mumps, or do not remember if you have received the\nprotective vaccine, get vaccinated.'\n\nChildren should receive a measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine on or\nafter their 1st birthday, followed by a 2nd dose at 4 to 6 years of\nage. Families that lack regular doctors can call 311 for information\non where children can get vaccinated. People 10 or older who have no\nrecord of past vaccination can get the vaccine on 17 and 18 Feb 2010\nat the locations listed below.

Symptoms\ninclude fever, body aches, headaches, and swelling of the salivary\nglands. The gland just below the ear is most often affected.\n\nAmong males, mumps can lead to orchitis, a testicular inflammation\nthat causes pain, swelling, nausea, vomiting and fever. Among some\nwomen with mumps, inflammation of the ovaries or breasts can occur.\nUp to 15 percent of people with mumps may suffer headaches and stiff necks.\n\nIf you become infected with mumps:\n- Stay at home for 5 days after symptoms begin.\n- Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.\n- Wash your hands frequently with soap and water.\n\nTo protect yourself and your family from mumps:\n- Mumps vaccine is given on or after a child's 1st birthday. It is\ncombined with measles and rubella vaccines in a formulation known as\nMMR (measles-mumps-rubella).\n- A 2nd dose of MMR vaccine is recommended before children enter\nschool at 4 to 6 years of age.\n- Anyone who has received 2 doses of MMR vaccine is much less likely\nto develop mumps. But many adults do not remember their vaccination\nhistory and do not have records of it. Adults who are unsure of their\nvaccination history should get vaccinated.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[This outbreak, now with more than 900 confirmed cases, started as an\ninfection imported from England into a summer camp for Orthodox\nJewish boys in New York State.

The index case occurred in a boy aged 11 years who had\nreturned on 17 Jun 2009 from a trip to the United Kingdom, where\napproximately 7400 reports of laboratory-confirmed mumps were\nreceived by the Health Protection Agency in 2009 [see:\n<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2010/news0210.htm#mmps>]. He then\nattended a New York summer camp for tradition-observant Jewish boys,\nwhere he became symptomatic on 28 Jun 2009. Subsequently, other camp\nattendees and a staff member were reported to have mumps, and\ntransmission continued in multiple locations when the camp attendees\nreturned home. As of 29 Jan 2010, a total of 1521 cases had been\nreported, with onset dates from 2 Jun 2009, through 29 Jan 2010, a\nsubstantial increase from the 179 cases reported as of 30 Oct 2009\n(1). The outbreak has remained confined primarily to the tradition-obse!\nrvant Jewish community, with less than 3 percent of cases occurring\namong persons outside the community. The largest percentage of cases\n(61 percent) has occurred among persons aged 7 to 18 years, and 76\npercent of the patients are male. Among the patients for whom\nvaccination status was reported, 88 percent had received at least one\ndose of mumps-containing vaccine, and 75 percent had received 2\ndoses. This is the largest mumps outbreak that has occurred in the\nUnited States since 2006 (2). Although mumps vaccination alone was\nnot sufficient to prevent this outbreak, maintaining high measles,\nmumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage remains the most\neffective way to prevent outbreaks and limit their size when they occur.\n\nMumps cases included in this report were reported by 29 Jan 2010.\nCases were classified according to the 2008 case definition of the\nCouncil of State and Territorial Epidemiologists; only cases of\nprobable and confirmed mumps are included in this report. In the\nUnited States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\n(ACIP) recommends that children receive 2 doses of measles, mumps,\nand rubella (MMR) vaccine, with the 1st dose administered at 12-15\nmonths and the 2nd dose near the time of school entry (at 4-6 years).\nMethods used to obtain the vaccination status of patients have\nincluded parental report, review of vaccination cards, and\nverification from health-care providers.\n\nThe 1521 outbreak-related mumps cases have been reported from several\ncounties in New York and New Jersey; local transmission is\ncontinuing. The majority (675 [44 percent]) of cases have been\nreported from New York City (primarily Brooklyn), followed by Orange\nCounty, New York (364 [24 percent]); Rockland County, New York (298\n[20 percent]); and 4 counties in New Jersey (159 [10 percent]). 25 (2\npercent) cases (reported during 28 Jun-8 Sep 2009) were associated\nwith the summer camp in Sullivan County, New York; however, no\nadditional cases occurred in the county after the camp ended in late\nAugust 2009. Of the 1521 patients, 1477 (97 percent) are members of\nthe tradition-observant Jewish community. Of the 44 cases not\nassociated with this religious community, 33 have been reported from\nNew York City; 7 from New Jersey; 2 from Orange County, New York; and\n2 from Rockland County, New York. Many of these outside cases have\noccurred among persons who have reported regular contact !\nwith members of the affected community.\n\nDiagnostic laboratory testing for mumps (i.e., detection of mumps\nimmunoglobulin M antibodies by various methods, detection of mumps\nRNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or\nisolation of mumps virus in cell culture) has been performed for 761\n(50 percent) cases. Of these, 385 (51 percent) cases are laboratory confirmed.\n\nOf the 1518 patients whose age is known, 1385 (91 percent) are aged\nover 6 years. The median age of patients is 15 years (range 3 months\nto 90 years) and is similar in all areas with ongoing transmission\nexcept New Jersey, where the median age is 17 years. Of the 1489\npatients whose sex is known, 1136 (76 percent) are male. 65 reports\nof complications from mumps have been received: orchitis (55 cases),\npancreatitis (5 cases), aseptic meningitis (2 cases), transient\ndeafness (one case), Bell's palsy (one case), and oophoritis (one\ncase). 19 hospitalizations from mumps have been reported; no deaths\nhave occurred.\n\nVaccination status is known for 1115 patients: 966 (91 percent) of\n1062 patients aged 18 years and under and 149 (33 percent) of 456\npatients aged 19 years and over. Of these patients, 976 (88 percent)\nhad received at least one dose of mumps-containing vaccine before the\noutbreak, and 839 (75 percent) had received 2 doses. Among patients\naged 7-18 years, the age group with the majority of cases and for\nwhom 2 doses of MMR vaccine is recommended, 93 percent had received\nat least one dose, and 85 percent had received 2 doses. The\nvaccination status of the patients varies by location. The percentage\nof patients aged over 6 years (for whom vaccination status is known)\nwho had received 2 doses of mumps vaccine is highest in Orange\nCounty, New York (86 percent), followed by New York City (83\npercent), New Jersey (76 percent), and Rockland County, New York (73 percent).\n\nPublic health response measures in all affected areas have continued\nthroughout the outbreak. Health-care providers have been notified\nabout the ongoing outbreak, the importance of verifying that children\nhave received all recommended vaccinations, and the need to offer\nvaccinations to adults with unknown vaccination status who do not\nhave a history of mumps. State and local health departments also have\nworked with affected schools to enhance vaccination policies,\nincluding policies to exclude unvaccinated children from school\nduring outbreaks and to isolate children at home for 5 days after\nonset of parotitis. Certain jurisdictions have encouraged providers\nto offer a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine to children aged 1-4 years;\nhowever, this strategy has not been a focus of the public health\nresponse because of the small proportion (4.9 percent) of cases\nreported in this age group.\n\nBeginning on 19 Jan 2010, in Orange County, New York, public health\nofficials began offering a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine in 3 schools\nwhere, despite documentation of a high level of 2-dose coverage among\nstudents, transmission had continued for over 2 months. This\nintervention is being carried out under an Institutional Review\nBoard-approved protocol that provides for an evaluation of the impact\nof the intervention.\n\n(Reported by: P High, MHS, Ocean County Health Dept, EF Handschur,\nMPH, OS Eze, MD, B Montana, MD, C Robertson, MD, C Tan, MD, New\nJersey Dept of Health and Senior Svcs.

I Ogbuanu MD, A Apostolou, PhD, EIS officers, CDC.)\n\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n\nThe mumps outbreak in the New York/New Jersey area has grown\nsubstantially, and anecdotal reports from certain affected areas\nsuggest that the rate of new cases is not decreasing; the appearance\nof a downward trend in recent weeks (illustrated by a figure in the\noriginal text) is partly a result of reporting delays. The outbreak\nis occurring almost exclusively in a specific religious community,\nand no cases outside this community have resulted in sustained transmission.\n\nLike the mumps outbreaks that occurred in 2006 (2), much of the\ncurrent outbreak is occurring in congregate settings, where\nprolonged, close contact among persons might be facilitating\ntransmission. Within the affected religious community, cases have\noccurred predominantly among school-aged boys, who attend separate\nschools from girls. The higher rate among boys might be a result of\nthe additional hours that boys in this community spend in school\ncompared with girls, including long periods in large study halls,\noften face-to-face with a study partner.\n\nIn addition, transmission in the community overall might be\nfacilitated by relatively large household sizes. According to the\n2000 U.S. Census, the mean household size in one of the affected\ncommunities was 5.7, compared with a mean U.S. household size of 2.6.\nThe limited transmission to persons outside the community might be a\nresult of the relatively less interpersonal contact between persons\ninside and outside the community.\n\nAlthough the school settings and large household sizes might be\npromoting transmission, the high vaccination coverage in the affected\ncommunity likely is limiting the size of the outbreak. In addition,\nhigh vaccination coverage in surrounding communities is the most\nplausible reason that the few cases outside of the affected community\nhave not caused other outbreaks.\n\nIn this outbreak, as in other recent mumps outbreaks among highly\nvaccinated populations (3), most cases have occurred in vaccinated\npersons. The mumps vaccine has greatly reduced the incidence of mumps\nin the United States. From 1967, when the mumps vaccine was 1st\nlicensed, to the early 2000s, the number of reported cases decreased\nfrom 186 000 to less than 500 annually (2). Nonetheless, the\neffectiveness of the mumps component of the MMR vaccine is lower than\nthat of the measles and rubella components. Estimates of the\neffectiveness of the mumps vaccine have varied in previous studies,\nranging from 73 percent to 91 percent after one dose and from 79\npercent to 95 percent after 2 doses (3-5). At least one study found 2\ndoses to be more effective than one dose (6).\n\nPublic health officials began offering a 3rd dose of vaccine to\nstudents in certain schools in Orange County, New York, because mumps\ntransmission had continued among students, despite their high rate of\n2-dose coverage. Although a previous study indicated that a 3rd dose\nof MMR vaccine for seronegative college students resulted in rapid\nseroconversion with a low rate of IgM response, which is indicative\nof an anamnestic immune response (7), ACIP has not recommended a 3rd\ndose, and no data exist on the effectiveness of a 3rd dose in either\nreducing the risk for mumps or altering the course of an outbreak.\nData obtained from use of the 3rd dose of MMR vaccine in Orange\nCounty might be used to guide future options for mumps outbreak\ncontrol in settings with high 2-dose coverage.\n\nThis outbreak emphasizes that mumps outbreaks can occur in highly\nvaccinated populations. Although several factors play a role in mumps\ncontrol in the United States, maintenance of high 2-dose MMR vaccine\ncoverage remains the most effective way to prevent and limit the size\nof mumps outbreaks.\n\nReferences:\n(1) CDC.

From mid-September\n2009 to 7 Dec 2009, 173 cases of mumps have been reported to the\nJerusalem District Health Office [up from 105 on 16 Nov 2009. -\nMod.CP]. The patients were mainly (147/173; 85 percent) students in\nyeshivas (religious academies operated as boarding schools) in\nseveral Jerusalem neighbourhoods and 2 neighbouring cities, and 142\nof 173 (82 percent) were males. The epidemic curve is presented shows\na pattern compatible with person-to-person transmission. The median\nage of the patients was 14.5 years and the mean was 14.8 plus/minus\n7.3 years. Altogether, 60 schools have been affected [listed in a\ntable in the original text]. The outbreak spread to other regions of\nthe country, and up to 7 Dec 2009 over 250 cases have been reported\nwith similar demographic and epidemiologic characteristics.\n\nThe clinical picture included unilateral and bilateral parotitis. One\npatient (a 19 year-old) was hospitalised in a urology department with\norchitis and another 3 were admitted to ear, nose, and throat\ndepartments. A further 6 patients were observed for varying periods\nin hospital emergency departments and discharged.\n\nCase ascertainment included: positive mumps IgM antibody (in 20\npatients) and positive real-time RT-PCR in urine (in 4 patients). The\nvirus was classified by the central virology laboratory of the Israel\nministry of health as genotype G5. The remaining 149 cases were\ndiagnosed on the basis of clinical features together with an\nepidemiologic association.\n\nOf the 173 patients, 116 (67 percent) had received 2 doses of\nmeasles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine (Priorix GlaxoSmithKline\nBiologicals-Jeryl Lynn strain), 29 (16.8 percent) had received one\ndose (age-appropriate in 12 of them), 20 (11.6 percent) were not\nimmunised, and in another eight patients (4.6 percent) the\nimmunisation status was unknown\n\nA number of patients reported contact with yeshiva students from the\nUnited States (New York) who visited Israel during the High Holidays\nin mid-September 2009 and some of whom were reported to have recently\nhad mumps.\n\nOutbreak control measures included investigations in the relevant\nschools to determine the students' vaccination status and referral\nfor completion of MMR vaccination where necessary. Information on the\noutbreak was circulated to all health maintenance organisations in\nthe District and to the public via the mass media.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nMumps is an acute viral infection; a third of infections are\nsubclinical, another 30-40 percent are expressed clinically as\nunilateral or bilateral parotitis. Complications occur more\nfrequently in adults than in children; 10-15 percent of mumps\npatients develop meningo-encephalitis. Orchitis occurs in 20-50\npercent of post-pubertal men, but sterility is rare. Other\ncomplications include pancreatitis, oophoritis, deafness, arthritis,\nthyroiditis, and myocarditis. Transmission is through droplet\ninfection. Confirmation of mumps infection includes serological\ntesting (for IgM antibodies by various methods), identification of\nmumps RNA by RT-PCR and viral isolation in cell culture (1).\n\nMumps vaccination was included in the routine childhood immunisation\nschedule in Israel in 1984, and since 1994 has been administered in a\ntwo-dose schedule at ages 12 months and 6 years (1st grade in school)\nin the form of the MMR vaccine, and since 2008 as\nmeasles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine. The average overall\nimmunisation coverage for the 1st dose of mumps vaccine (MMR/MMRV) in\nthe Jerusalem District has been maintained between 93 and 96.7\npercent over the past decade [Jerusalem District Health Office,\nunpublished data]. It is to be noted that in 1992, the coverage for\nthe 1st dose of MMR among the Jewish population of Jerusalem was a\nmere 82.3 percent.\n\nMumps control in Israel improved significantly during the 1990's (2),\nalthough periodic outbreaks still occurred due to under-vaccination,\nprimary vaccine failure, and waning immunity. In 1998 and 2005, 2\noutbreaks (each of the order of 100 cases) occurred in Israel. In\n2006, 12 cases were reported; 6 were reported in 2007 and 13 in 2008.\nSerological studies performed in the late 1990s revealed relatively\nlow mumps antibody levels among adolescents and army recruits in\nIsrael, ranging from 59 to 83.3 percent positivity; such levels do\nnot guarantee adequate herd immunity (3, 4).\n\nMumps outbreaks, mainly involving adolescents and young adults, have\nemerged recently in several countries. A nationwide mumps outbreak\noccurred in the United Kingdom in 2004-2005, with 56 390 reported\ncases. The majority (79 percent) were aged 15-24 years; two thirds\nwere unvaccinated. Non-availability of MMR vaccine probably\ncontributed to susceptibility of the birth cohorts 1983-1986 [5]. In\nthe United States, the largest outbreak in 20 years occurred in\n2006-2007, encompassing more than 6 000 cases centred in college\ncampuses. Of the students aged 18-24 years, 84 percent had been\nvaccinated with 2 doses of mumps vaccine (6). The epidemic occurred\ndespite high vaccination rates and low mumps activity in the community (7).\n\nEngland and Wales are currently in the throes of an outbreak of mumps\ncentred in college campuses, with 998 cases reported in\nJanuary-February 2009, and further cases still being reported, mainly\namong college students. The circulating genotype is G5 (8).\n\nOther European outbreaks have been reported in recent years. In an\nAustrian outbreak involving over 200 cases (9), 49 percent of the\npatients were unvaccinated -- a very different situation from the\noutbreak we report. In the Republic of Moldova, an extremely large\noutbreak of nearly 20 000 cases was reported in 2007-2008 (10). Most\nof the patients (96 percent) had received only one dose of MMR. A\n2-dose schedule was introduced in that country in 2002, for birth\ncohorts from 1995 onwards.\n\nIn an ongoing mumps outbreak in the United States (New York, New\nJersey), and Canada (Quebec), 179 and 15 cases, respectively, were\nreported in August-October 2009. The affected individuals are mainly\nmembers of a Jewish religious community (83 percent males; median age\n14 years). Of those for whom vaccination status is known 72 percent\nwere vaccinated with 2 doses. The virus was of genotype G [?] (11).\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nThe 2 main characteristics of the current outbreak in Jerusalem are\nthe predominance of male adolescents in religious boarding schools\nand the fact that most cases (74 percent) are appropriately\nvaccinated for their age. The male predominance is striking, and\nrequires further study.\n\nIt had been observed that the mumps component of the MMR vaccine\nprovides inferior protection compared to the measles and rubella\ncomponents. Unlike the levels of 95 percent and 98 percent provided\nby the latter 2, the mumps protection levels are approximately 62 85\npercent and 85 88 percent for the 1st and 2nd doses, respectively.\n\nRecently, the effectiveness in the United Kingdom was determined as\n88 percent and 95 percent, respectively. However, the effectiveness\nof one dose waned from 96 percent in two year-olds to 66 percent in\n11-12 year-olds, and the effectiveness of two doses from 99 percent\nin 5-6 year-olds to 86 percent in 11-12 year-olds [12].\n\nThe reasons for the particular characteristics of these mumps\noutbreaks are unclear. Possible explanations include a combination of\nprimary and secondary vaccine failure, waning immunity, inadequate\nvaccine effectiveness, and previous low immunisation coverage.\nContributory factors include living conditions in specific population\ngroups such as college freshmen, army recruits, and adolescent\nstudents in boarding schools.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

New York City is dealing with nearly 600 confirmed and suspected\ncases. Most of the patients have one thing in common: religion. The cases\nstarted turning up in late August [2009].\n\nMumps is an illness characterized by acute swelling of the salivary gland\nlasting 2 or more days. The illness can cause deafness and encephalitis. A\nperson can be infected for 2 days before symptoms appear. The health\ndepartment is telling people who suspect they have mumps to stay home for 5\ndays. Children who are not fully vaccinated against mumps are the highest\nrisk of infection.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 19 Dec 2009\nSource: The Jewish Week [edited]\n<http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c36_a17351/News/New_York.html>\n\n\nNot immune from mumps\n---------------------\nStemming from an initial mumps outbreak that wreaked havoc at a Jewish camp\nthis summer [summer of 2009], 247 New York City residents plus 131 other\nstate residents [as of 1 Dec 2009] have since contracted the disease, which\nremains mostly contained among fervently Orthodox adolescent boys in\npockets of New York, New Jersey, and Quebec, according to official reports\nfrom the New York City and State Departments of Health.\n\nThe trigger case occurred back in June [2009], when an 11 year old boy\nreturned to his Sullivan County summer camp after traveling in the United\nKingdom, where an ongoing outbreak has now reached about 4000 cases [see\n<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/infections/immunisation.htm>, the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. From there, the mumps spread\nto 24 other boys at the camp and continued to plague their local\ncommunities when they returned home, and the median age of patients remains\naround 14.\n\nBut perhaps the most frustrating news to some parents is that most of the\naffected patients had received their proper 2-dose vaccination as children\n-- 83 per cent, according to CDC.\n\n'This is a very confusing issue not only for ourselves but for providers\nand parents,' said Cindy Schulte, vaccine-preventable disease surveillance\nofficer at the New York State Department of Health. 'If you have a\npopulation that's fairly well but unevenly vaccinated, by logic, you're\ngoing to end up having some disease in the effective population.' The\nmeasles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has an 85 to 91 per cent efficacy\nrate among those who take the proper doses, she said.\n\nThe commonest symptoms of this viral disease are fever, muscle aches, and\nparotitis -- the signature inflammation of the salivary glands below the\near. Though no deaths have occurred thus far and symptoms may often be\nsubtle, there have been several hospitalizations and one potential case of\nmeningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain), according to Dr Debra\nBlog, medical director at the Bureau of Immunization Program in the New\nYork State Department of Health.\n\nMumps can be particularly dangerous to pubescent boys, doctors say, because\na small number will develop orchitis, a swelling of the testicles that can\npotentially (though rarely) lead to infertility. The same goes for girls,\nwho can develop swelling of the ovaries that can lead to sterility. While\nmumps cases among women have certainly increased since the summer, New York\nCity infections remain around 79 per cent male, Blog explained.\n\n'These communities tend to have social contact with themselves and tend to\nbe a bit isolated from the outside community,' she said. 'In New York City\nespecially it's going through their schools.'\n\nAs of 30 Oct 2009, CDC had only reported a total of 179 cases in New York\nand New Jersey and another 15 in Canada, but New York City health officials\nsay that the numbers have increased so dramatically in the past month\nsimply because doctors are taking more care to report their ill patients to\nthe government.\n\n'We're still getting cases reported virtually every day,' said Dr Chris\nZimmerman, medical director at the Bureau of Immunization in the New York\nCity Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. 'There was a substantial\nincrease just from the week before the alert to when the alert came out.'\nIt is difficult to maintain an exact number of cases, Schulte added,\nbecause disease spread is a 'fluid number'.\n\nA mumps outbreak of this size has not occurred since 2006, when the United\nStates experienced over 6500 cases that were particularly hard-hitting\namong college dormitory residents in Iowa. But the current wave largely\nremains within pocketed chasidic communities, all linked back to that one\nsummer camp flare-up. 'There have been less than a handful of cases outside\nthe community,' Zimmerman said. 'The population is segregated -- these kids\nare not going to public schools, they're going to yeshivas,' he continued.\n'They only have the opportunity to interact with other boys in their\ncommunity.'\n\nAnd while statistics show that an overwhelming majority of the kids in\nthese neighborhoods are in fact properly vaccinated, the few outliers are\nprobably the ones perpetuating the disease spread, he added. 'Overall,\nimmunization coverage is good, but this is a community that has had\nresistance to MMR vaccines -- their parents have claimed religious\nexemptions,' Zimmerman said.\n\nYet despite outbreaks that have resurfaced from time to time, state medical\nofficials still maintain the mumps vaccine is a successful product,\nparticularly in what Blog calls 'evenly vaccinated communities' -- those\nwho pretty much unanimously undergo the immunization.\n\nRegarding the disease spread, another crucial element worth considering\namong the allegedly vaccinated patients is whether or not their dosages\nwere properly refrigerated speculated Dr Michael Augenbraun, a professor of\nepidemiology at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. 'Breaks in the 'cold\nchain' are a serious problem for vaccine efficacy if, for example, an\noffice allowed for a vaccine to sit out on countertops overnight,'\nAugenbraun said, noting that we have no way of knowing this after so many\nyears, however.\n\nThus far, despite the one hospitalization and some cases of orchitis,\ncomplications from this outbreak have generally been minimal. About 56 per\ncent of the confirmed cases exhibited the parotitis, according to Schulte.\n'We're not seeing the same rate of complications that we saw in the\npre-vaccine era,' Zimmerman said, noting that before the vaccine, another\ndangerous side effect of the mumps was permanent deafness. But the subtle\nnature of so many of these current cases may be yet another reason that the\ndisease is spreading, because parents neglect to see a doctor about their\nchildren's illnesses. So what can parents do to protect their families from\ncatching the mumps?\n\nThey should make sure that their children have received the 2 dosages of\nthe vaccine on time, ideally before their 1st birthday, Schulte said. If an\nolder child has not yet received the vaccine but hasn't yet been exposed to\nthe illness, this child too should be immunized. And if a child or adult\nbecomes sick, the best thing to do, as always, is to stay home from school\nor work, wash hands frequently and see a doctor.

Two vaccination clinics are planned in West Nipissing.\nChirico said 62 percent of cases in the district involve people who\nreceived both doses, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention has seen that in about 72 percent of cases.\n\n'One of the theories is that the virus has mutated. That's possible\n[but unlikely - Mod.CP]. Other possibilities could be that the\nvaccine [i.e., immunity] wears off in a shorter period of time than\nwe had anticipated,' Chirico said. He said close contact in schools\ncould also be behind the outbreak.\n\nMumps is an infection of the salivary glands caused by a virus, and\nit spreads easily through the exchange of saliva by sharing drinks,\nfood, cigarettes, musical instruments, kissing, coughing and\nsneezing. 'Teenagers are more likely to spread it just because of the\nsocial contact that they have. That's why we're trying to get the\nmessage out to them,' Chirico said.\n\nThe health unit recommends people check to see if they have received\nboth MMR vaccine doses, as well as washing hands frequently and not\nsharing personal items that come in contact with saliva. 'If you\ndon't have the catch-up vaccination, you should really look at your\nimmunization records and check with your family doctor to make sure\nthat you've had the 2 doses.' Chirico said affected school boards\nhave been contacted to work with teachers and staff to reduce the\nrisk of exposure.\n\nNorthern Ontario is seeing the same strain as an outbreak that\nstarted in August (2009) in the northeastern United States.

There is no treatment for mumps. Most people will\nrecover from the infection, and some may not even know they have it.\nComplications may include swollen and tender testicles in males, and\novarian inflammation resulting in abdominal pains in women.\n\nMumps rarely leads to sterility, but can lead to meningitis or a\nswelling of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Mumps\nmay also cause hearing loss and miscarriages in the 1st 3 months of\npregnancy. One to 2 cases out of 10 000 can cause encephalitis or\nswelling of the brain that can lead to paralysis, neurological damage\nand seizures.

So far, there is no indication that people outside\nthose communities are coming down with mumps, she said.\n\nThe outbreak started in August [2009] in a Sullivan County, NY summer camp\nfor Orthodox boys, according to the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC). Health officials traced the outbreak to an 11 year old\ncamper who had recently returned from England, where at least 4000 people\nhave come down with the disease. That camper spread the illness to 25 other\npeople at the camp ranging in age from 9 to 30, with a median age of 12,\naccording to CDC.\n\nWhen the campers went home later in the summer, they apparently brought the\ndisease with them to Jewish communities in Rockland and Orange counties,\nthe Borough Park section of Brooklyn, Lakewood, N.J., and Quebec [Canada],\naccording to health officials.\n\n'The outbreak has spread and gradually increased in size and is now the\nlargest US mumps outbreak since 2006,' CDC said in a bulletin. It's also\nthe largest outbreak in New York since 2005, according to Tom Allocco, a\nspokesman for the state Department of Health.

At least 3 people have been hospitalized,\naccording to CDC. The median age of the patients is 14 years, and most (83\nper cent) are male, according to the federal agency.\n\nMumps is caused by a virus that usually spreads through saliva and can\ninfect many parts of the body, especially the salivary glands. It can lead\nto inflammation and swelling of the brain and other organs. It can cause\ndeafness and leave men sterile.\n\nThe vaccine, which also protects against measles and rubella, is given in 2\ndoses: one when a child is 12 months old and the other between the ages of\n4 and 6 or when the child begins kindergarten. The vaccine [measles, mumps,\nand rubella (MMR) vaccine] is thought to be 85 per cent effective during an\noutbreak.

Since the beginning of\nSeptember [2009], 105 people have been diagnosed with mumps, most\nbetween the ages of 10 and 24. During the same period in 2008, only 4\npeople were diagnosed with the disease, a contagious virus\ncharacterized by swollen salivary glands. Only 13 cases were reported\nfor the entire year. In 2007, only 6 mumps cases were reported.\n\nOf the current cases, 82 are people from Jerusalem, but the disease\nhas also been found in the central region (11 cases), Tel Aviv (5),\nthe south (4), and Haifa (2). One of the patients developed\ntesticular infection, a complication of mumps, and is hospitalized in\na Jerusalem hospital.\n\nItamar Grotto, director of Public Health Services in the Health\nMinistry, believes the increase in the number of cases stems from the\nfact that the mumps inoculation was added to the national vaccination\nprogram only in 1988, along with measles and rubella. The mumps\nvaccine is given to children in 2 doses -- at the age of 1 year and\nin 1st grade.\n\n'The outbreak is believed to have occurred among Israelis who didn't\nget both doses,' Grotto said. Most of the patients are believed to be\nfrom communities that refuse to be inoculated, particularly the\nultra-Orthodox. 'People who are not inoculated are not exposed to\nchildren's diseases, because the population around them has been\ninoculated. However, they tend to contract these diseases as adults,\nand at this stage the diseases are more dangerous due to possible\ncomplications,' said Professor David Greenberg, of the Pediatric\nInfectious Disease Unit in the Soroka University Medical Center at\nBen-Gurion University.\n\nIn most cases, mumps runs it course without treatment, but one-tenth\nof patients develop mild forms of meningitis. In other cases, it\ncould lead to testicular infection or ovarian inflammation. In men it\ncould also lead to deafness or sterility. The Israel Pediatrics\nAssociation called on parents to make sure their children receive\nboth doses of the mumps vaccine, in keeping with the national program.\n\nAn increase in mumps cases has also been reported in the United\nStates and Canada. At the end of last week [week of 9 Nov 2009], 15\nstudents at Jerusalem's Or Shmuel Yeshiva came down with mumps,\napparently after being in close proximity to a student who contracted\nthe disease in Brooklyn [currently the site of an ongoing outbreak of\nmumps in the USA, see: ProMED-mail archive references below}.\n\n[Byline: Dan Even]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[The late introduction of universal mumps vaccination in Israel may\nin part explain the extent of the current outbreak of mumps in young\nadults.

Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[The late introduction of universal mumps vaccination in Israel may\nin part explain the extent of the current outbreak of mumps in young\nadults. \n\nItamar Grotto, director of Public Health Services in the Health\nMinistry, believes the increase in the number of cases stems from the\nfact that the mumps inoculation was added to the national vaccination\nprogram only in 1988, along with measles and rubella. Additionally the fact that most of the patients are believed\nto be from ultra-orthodox communities, that decline vaccination, may\nexplain the high incidence of mumps among Yeshiva students as\nreported in the preceding ProMED-mail report archive no. The mumps\nvaccine is given to children in 2 doses -- at the age of 1 year and\nin 1st grade. The Israel Pediatrics\nAssociation called on parents to make sure their children receive\nboth doses of the mumps vaccine, in keeping with the national program. Since the beginning of\nSeptember [2009], 105 people have been diagnosed with mumps, most\nbetween the ages of 10 and 24. One of the patients developed\ntesticular infection, a complication of mumps, and is hospitalized in\na Jerusalem hospital. \nIsrael is in the midst of a mumps outbreak, the Health Ministry\nannounced this week Source: Haaretz - Israel News [edited]\n<http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1128723.html>\n\n\nMinistry: Israel in midst of mumps outbreak\n------------------------------------------- During the same period in 2008, only 4\npeople were diagnosed with the disease, a contagious virus\ncharacterized by swollen salivary glands.

It is\nnever too late to get your child immunised with the MMR vaccine.\nMumps is also on the increase but not because of the recent decline\nin MMR uptake. The high numbers are mainly among older teenagers and\nyoung adults in their early 20s, and mostly among those in further or\nhigher education establishments. Some in this age group were too old\nto be routinely vaccinated with MMR when it was 1st introduced in\n1988, and some others may only have received one dose of MMR. The\nnumber of cases has increased more steeply in recent years because\nmany of the young adults in this cohort (born between 1981 and 1989)\nare now at university or in further education colleges.

Although little\ntransmission has occurred outside the [religious] community, mumps can\nspread rapidly in congregate settings such as colleges and schools;\ntherefore, public health officials and clinicians should heighten\nsurveillance for mumps and ensure that children and adults are\nappropriately vaccinated.\n\nMumps cases in the United States have been classified according to the\n2008 case definition of the Council of State and Territorial\nEpidemiologists, and cases in Canada have been classified in\naccordance with Case Definitions for Diseases Under National\nSurveillance. Patients in the United States are considered to have\nage-appropriate vaccinations for mumps if they are aged 1-6 years and\nhave received 1 dose of a mumps-containing vaccine, aged 7-18 years\nand have received 2 doses of vaccine, or aged 19-52 years and have\nreceived 1 dose of vaccine (3,4). Patients aged 7-18 years who have\nreceived 1 dose are considered to have received a partially\nage-appropriate vaccination.\n\nOutbreak reports\n----------------\nSullivan County, New York. On [18 Aug 2009], the New York State\nDepartment of Health was notified of mumps cases in a summer camp\nserving approximately 400 boys from the tradition-observant religious\ncommunity. The index patient was a boy aged 11 years who had returned\non [17 Jun 2009] from the United Kingdom, where a mumps outbreak is\nongoing with approximately 4000 cases, primarily in unvaccinated young\nadults in the general population. The boy became symptomatic at camp\non [28 Jun 2009]. A total of 25 cases were reported among camp\nattendees and staff members. The median age of patients was 12 years\n(range: 9-30 years), and all were male. Of the 24 patients for whom\nvaccination status was reported, 20 (83 percent) had received\nage-appropriate vaccination with 2 doses, one (4 percent) had received\npartial age-appropriate vaccination with 1 dose, and 3 (13 percent)\nwere unvaccinated. The attack rate in this camp was approximately 6\npercent (25 of 400).\n\nBrooklyn, New York. The majority of campers were residents of the\nBorough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, where mumps transmission began\nafter their return home from camp. Although returning campers were\nimplicated in most of the initial exposures, no predominant focus of\nspread was identified. By [30 Oct 2009], 79 additional persons from\nBrooklyn or other boroughs who were linked to the outbreak had been\nreported, exclusive of returning campers. The median age of these\npatients was 14 years (range: 8 months-84 years), and 81 percent were\nmale. Of the 61 patients (77 percent) for whom vaccine is recommended\nand vaccination status and age were reported, 47 (77 percent) had\nreceived age-appropriate vaccination, 6 (10 percent) had received\npartial age-appropriate vaccination, and 8 (13 percent) were\nunvaccinated.\n\nOcean County, New Jersey. On [26 Sp 2009], the New Jersey Department\nof Health and Senior Services was informed of 8 suspected mumps cases\nin 2 Ocean County private schools for boys with both boarder and\ncommuter students from the same religious community. The index\npatient, who became symptomatic at one of the boarding schools on [6\nSep 2009], was aged 20 years and a resident of the Borough Park\nneighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Transmission was initially limited\nto the schools but subsequently was observed in households and the\ncommunity. By [30 Oct 2009], a total of 40 cases had been reported.\nThe median age of patients was 19.5 years (range: 1-65 years), and 83\npercent were male. Mumps vaccination status was reported for 29 (73\npercent) patients, of whom 28 (97 percent) had received\nage-appropriate vaccination.\n\nRockland County, New York. 4 of the patients who had attended the\nSullivan County summer camp resided in Rockland County, New York. By\n[30 Oct 2009], an additional 27 cases (exclusive of returning campers)\nhad been reported among members of the same religious community, with\ntransmission occurring in a variety of settings, including a school\nfor boys. The median age of patients was 12 years (range: 1-62 years),\nand 23 (85 percent) were male. Mumps vaccination status was reported\nfor 19 (70 percent), of whom 11 had received age-appropriate\nvaccination, and 2 had received partial age-appropriate vaccination.\n\nOrange County, New York. In September [2009], members of the same\nreligious community in Orange County visited a synagogue in Brooklyn.\nDuring [8-14 Oct 2009], 8 cases occurred among the travelers. The\nmedian age of patients was 18 years (range: 11-23 years), and 5 were\nmale. 7 patients had received age-appropriate vaccination with 2\ndoses, and one was unvaccinated.\n\nQuebec, Canada. Members of affected New York and New Jersey\ncommunities traveled to the province of Quebec to attend religious\ngatherings during [19 Sep-11 Oct 2009]. By [30 Oct 2009], 15 cases\n(patient age range: 8-47 years) from Montreal and the Laurentian\nregion of the province had been reported to the Public Health Agency\nof Canada. All patients were male, and 11 had documented vaccination\nwith at least 1 dose of mumps-containing vaccine.\n\nTransmission outside the religious community\n------------------------------------------------\nDuring [28 Jun-30 Oct 2009], 5 cases outside the affected religious\ncommunity were reported. 2 cases occurred in New York City, and 3\noccurred in Ocean County, New Jersey. The 2 New York City patients\nwere a man aged 40 years who had probable worksite exposures to\nmembers of the affected community and a boy aged 4 years who had no\nidentified exposure. The 3 New Jersey cases were patients aged 17, 29,\nand 66 years who had no identified exposures. 2 of the 5 patients had\nreceived 2 documented doses of mumps-containing vaccine, 1 had\nreceived 2 undocumented doses, and 2 had unknown vaccination status.\n\nLaboratory testing\n------------------\nOf the 179 cases reported as of [30 Oct 2009] in the United States, 85\n(47 percent) have been laboratory-confirmed, and the remaining 94\ncases (53 percent) have met the clinical case definition. Laboratory\ntests used to confirm cases of mumps included detection of mumps\nimmunoglobulin M antibodies by various methods, detection of mumps RNA\nby real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (5), and\nisolation of mumps virus in cell culture. These tests were conducted\nby CDC and state and commercial laboratories. Mumps virus classified\nas genotype G was identified from multiple specimens sent to CDC,\nconsistent with the probable importation of mumps into Sullivan County\nfrom the ongoing mumps outbreak in the United Kingdom (6).\n\nEpidemiologic summary\n---------------------\nOf the 178 (99 percent) patients whose sex is known, 149 (84 percent)\nare male. The median age of the 178 patients for whom age is known is\n14 years (range: 8 months-84 years). Of the 141 patients (79 percent)\nfor whom vaccine is recommended and vaccination status and age were\nreported, 113 (80 percent) had received age-appropriate vaccination, 9\n(6 percent) had received partial age-appropriate vaccination, and 19\n(13 percent) were unvaccinated. Of the 141 patients, 102 (72 percent)\nhad received 2 doses, 20 (14 percent) 1 dose, and 19 (13 percent) zero\ndoses.\n\nComplications have occurred in 16 (9 percent) cases, including\norchitis (15 cases) and temporary deafness (1 case). 3\nhospitalizations for orchitis have been reported. No deaths have\noccurred.\n\nResponse measures\n-----------------\nHealth officials issued alerts in New Jersey, New York City, and\nelsewhere in New York state to health-care providers, urging them to\nincrease active surveillance for mumps, to consider mumps diagnoses\neven if patients had documented vaccinations and, when indicated, to\nperform appropriate diagnostic testing. Isolation and quarantine\nprocedures were reviewed, and health-care providers were urged to\nensure that all children and adults were appropriately vaccinated.\n\n[Reported by a long list of names, available at the source URL]\n\nMMWR editorial note\n-------------------\nBefore routine mumps vaccination was initiated, most persons acquired\ninfection during childhood. In 1967, a live, attenuated mumps virus\nvaccine was licensed in the United States, and by 2005 high coverage\nwith 2 doses among children had reduced the incidence of mumps by 99\npercent (2). In 2006, a resurgence occurred in the United States, with\nthe highest attack rate among persons aged 18-24 years; 57 percent of\npatients had previously received 2 doses of vaccine (2). In 2007 and\n2008, incidence declined to 800 and 454 cases, and outbreaks involved\nfewer than 20 cases.\n\nThe ongoing mumps outbreak is the largest since 2006 and primarily has\naffected a tradition-observant religious community. Mumps outbreaks\nperpetuated by community transmission outside of congregate settings\n(such as, camps, schools, and colleges) are unusual in highly\nvaccinated populations (2). In this outbreak, the limited transmission\nof mumps into the general population might be attributable to\ngenerally high vaccination levels and little interaction between\nmembers of the affected religious community and persons in surrounding\ncommunities. Vaccination rates in the religious community in this\noutbreak have not been measured, but according to the 2008 National\nImmunization Survey, overall age-appropriate mumps vaccination rates\nfor children in New York City, New York state, and New Jersey were\nhigh: 90 percent or higher for receipt of 1 dose among children aged\n19-35 months and 90 percent or higher for receipt of 2 doses among\nadolescents aged 13-17 years. However, mumps incidence commonly peaks\nin the winter (2), and vaccine-preventable diseases have spread from\nreligious communities to the general population during the peak\ntransmission season (7).\n\nOf those patients in this outbreak whose vaccination status was known,\n72 percent had received 2 doses of mumps-containing vaccine, compared\nwith 57 percent in the 2006 outbreak. Mumps vaccine effectiveness has\nbeen estimated at 73-91 percent for 1 dose and 76-95 percent for 2\ndoses (8,9). Studies during the 2006 US mumps resurgence suggested\nthat outbreaks could occur among highly-vaccinated populations such as\ncollege students, where frequent close contact occurs and where more\nthan 10 years have passed since most of the population received a 2nd\ndose (9). However, even in such settings, attack rates were less than\n8 percent in 2006 for those with 2 doses, suggesting that the vaccine\nwas highly effective in preventing disease for the vast majority of\nthose exposed (9). In the current outbreak, the attack rate at the\nsummer camp was approximately 6 percent.\n\nBecause 43 percent of the world's nations have no mumps vaccination\nprogram (10), and certain nations with mumps vaccination programs,\nsuch as the United Kingdom, have experienced large-scale outbreaks,\nthe risk for mumps exposure is increased with foreign travel. When\nimportations occur, congregate settings in the United States, such as\ncolleges and schools, have been foci of indigenous mumps transmission\n(2).\n\nWhen possible, persons with suspected mumps should be isolated for 5\ndays after onset of parotitis and, if they visit a health-care\nsetting, droplet precautions should be initiated immediately. Clinical\nspecimens (both serum and buccal swabs) should be collected from\npersons with suspected mumps as soon as possible after symptom onset.\nAdults and children should receive age-appropriate vaccination.\nUniversity students, health-care personnel, and persons with potential\nmumps outbreak exposure should have documentation of 2 doses of mumps\nvaccine or other proof of immunity to mumps. Although vaccination is\nnot considered effective postexposure prophylaxis for mumps,\nnon-immune contacts should be vaccinated with measles, mumps, rubella\n(MMR) vaccine to prevent risk from subsequent exposures. Any suspected\nmumps case should be reported to the health department in the area\nwhere the patient resides.

New figures from the Health\nProtection Agency (HPA) show that there were 39 cases of the infection\nacross the city in 2008 -- many among people in their late teens and 20s.\n\nThe authority has identified people born between 1980 and 1990 as at the\ngreatest risk. Anyone in this age range may have missed out on a\nmumps-containing vaccine or getting natural immunity through a previous\nbout of the illness. Prior to the mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR)\ninjection being introduced in 1988, vaccines were only available for\nmeasles and rubella.\n\nMumps can spread rapidly in environments such as colleges and universities,\nwhere it is passed on by coughing, sneezing, and kissing.\n\nDr Mark Kealy, of the South West Peninsula Health Protection Unit, said:\n'Mumps is a viral illness which can lead to serious complications. At the\nvery best, it takes students out of studies -- and socialising -- for 2\nweeks as they recover. 'We've seen a 40 per cent increase in mumps cases\nover the last 6 months in Devon and Cornwall, and in most cases it is an\nentirely avoidable illness.' The HPA is urging all students born in that\ndecade to check their vaccination history with their GP [general\npractitioner]. Two doses of MMR are required to give the fullest protection\nagainst mumps. The injection is free and there is no upper age limit. The\nnumber of cases across Devon and Cornwall rose from 19 in the 1st half of\nlast year [2008] to 27 cases in the 2nd half. Colleges and universities\nacross the 2 counties are sending out the advice direct to students on\nemail, or placing it on intranet home pages and including it in student\nbulletins. Young people who suspect they have the infection are advised to\ncontact their GP or student health service.\n\nGeneral practices in the Devon and Cornwall area have been alerted to the\nsymptoms, which may include: fever, headaches, aches and pains, and swollen\nglands along the jaw line. There is no specific treatment for mumps, so for\nmost people it will clear up by itself. However, complications may include\nswelling of the ovaries, swelling of the testes, aseptic meningitis, and\ndeafness.\n\nFor further information on mumps and MMR, visit the NHS (National Health\nService) MMR website at <http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Vaccines/MMR>.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Another consequence of the less than optimal uptake of MMR vaccine in the UK.\n\nThe counties of Devon and Cornwall in south west England can be located on\nthe map at <http://www.abcounties.co.uk/counties/map.htm>.

Outbreaks have been reported from several\nuniversities and colleges. A similar increase has been reported from\nthe Republic of Ireland [2].\n\nA large epidemic of mumps affecting university students 1st occurred\nin the academic year 2004/5 [3] and continued into 2005/6, declining\nin 2006/7 and 2007/8. During the final quarter of 2008, 695 cases of\nmumps were confirmed compared to 447 in the previous quarter [4]. So\nfar in 2009, 998 cases of mumps with onset in January or February\nhave been confirmed mumps IgM or RNA positive in England and Wales.\nThis compares to 322, 274, and 1173 cases in the same periods of\n2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively. During 2009, cases have been\nconfirmed in all English regions and Wales with high numbers from the\nSouth West (204), South East (180), and North West (162) regions. For\nthe remaining regions the number of cases confirmed was as follows:\nYorkshire and Humberside (115), London (86), East of England (81),\nWest Midlands (64), East Midlands (48), North East (30), and Wales\n(27). The genotype currently circulating is a G5, the same strain\nthat has been circulating over the past 5 years and responsible for\noutbreaks in other parts of Europe [5,6].\n\n[These data are illustrated in the original text by a figure showing\nthe 5 week moving average of mumps notifications, England and Wales\n2003-2009. - Mod.CP]\n\nReason for the increase\n-----------------------\nThe previous epidemic was attributed to a cohort of young adults,\nborn between 1981 and 1990, who were at increased risk of mumps.\nThese individuals were born before the implementation of the routine\n2-dose MMR programme and had therefore either received no MMR\nvaccine, or only one dose. As control of mumps was excellent after\n1990, this group remained susceptible until they entered the\nuniversity or college setting, when transmission of mumps was\nfacilitated. During 2008, 1403 (57 percent) of the confirmed cases\nwere in those born between 1981 and 1990 . [Data illustrated by a\nfigure in the original text. - Mod.CP]\n\nDespite this clear picture, the reason why the numbers of cases have\nincreased in this academic year, after remaining lower in both 2006/7\nand 2007/8 is not entirely clear. One explanation may be that, since\nthe widespread transmission in 2005/6, 3 new cohorts of students have\nentered college and therefore another susceptible pool has been\nre-established in this setting.\n\nIn the previous epidemic, although the vaccinated cohorts were\nlargely protected from mumps, cases were confirmed in vaccinated\nindividuals. By the 2008/9 academic year, most students would have\nbeen eligible for one or 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella),\nand so a higher proportion of vaccine failures are expected amongst\nthe cases. Initial reports are consistent with this observation.\n\nIn 2004-5, analysis of protection from vaccination showed that,\nalthough individual protection from vaccination was high, there was\nevidence of declining protection over time, particularly in those who\nhad only received one dose of vaccine [7]. Investigations during\nuniversity outbreaks in the United States, where vaccine coverage for\n2 doses has been in place for longer, also suggested that waning\nprotection may have contributed [8]. Secondary vaccine failure may\ntherefore also explain a proportion of cases.\n\nSurveillance and control\n------------------------\nContinued surveillance, including confirmation of the diagnosis, is\nimportant for ensuring accurate epidemiological data. In persons who\nhave been previously vaccinated, the serological diagnosis of mumps\ncan be difficult as the IgM response may be delayed and reach lower\nlevels. For rapid diagnosis, an oral fluid taken in the 1st 14 days\nof illness is preferred as this can be tested for both IgM\n(Immunoglobulin M) and viral RNA (ribonucleic acid). If this is not\npossible then parallel serum and throat swab or paired serum samples\ncan be collected.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, the incident team for the national mumps outbreak\nrecommended that the priorities were to ensure that systems were in\nplace to ensure that those entering university were fully vaccinated\nwith MMR in the future. This included ensuring that pupils attending\nfor the Year 10 booster and university entrants from 2005 onwards had\nreceived 2 doses of MMR.\n\nThe team also concluded that university vaccination campaigns in\nparticular are likely to achieve low uptake and are unlikely to stop\noutbreaks. The offer of individual vaccination, however, should be\navailable to students who are unvaccinated or have received only one\ndose of MMR. Approaches being taken in individual universities this\nyear have included using text messaging and university computer\nnetworks to alert students to these recommendations.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

In persons who\nhave been previously vaccinated, the serological diagnosis of mumps\ncan be difficult as the IgM response may be delayed and reach lower\nlevels. \n\nA large epidemic of mumps affecting university students 1st occurred\nin the academic year 2004/5 [3] and continued into 2005/6, declining\nin 2006/7 and 2007/8. So\nfar in 2009, 998 cases of mumps with onset in January or February\nhave been confirmed mumps IgM or RNA positive in England and Wales. \n\n[These data are illustrated in the original text by a figure showing\nthe 5 week moving average of mumps notifications, England and Wales\n2003-2009. CP]\n\n[Mumps in male college students may lead to orchitis (inflammation of\nthe testes) and sterility, a good selling point for taking the\nvaccine. - Mod. As reported previously [1], the number of mumps cases notified in\nEngland and Wales increased in early 2009 and has continued to\nincrease during March. Approaches being taken in individual universities this\nyear have included using text messaging and university computer\nnetworks to alert students to these recommendations.\n\n In the previous epidemic, although the vaccinated cohorts were\nlargely protected from mumps, cases were confirmed in vaccinated\nindividuals. CP]\n\nDespite this clear picture, the reason why the numbers of cases have\nincreased in this academic year, after remaining lower in both 2006/7\nand 2007/8 is not entirely clear. Long-term persistence of mumps antibody after receipt of 2\nmeasles-mumps- rubella (MMR) vaccinations and antibody response after\na third MMR vaccination among a university population. This included ensuring that pupils attending\nfor the Year 10 booster and university entrants from 2005 onwards had\nreceived 2 doses of MMR. During 2009, cases have been\nconfirmed in all English regions and Wales with high numbers from the\nSouth West (204), South East (180), and North West (162) regions. As suggested above, it may be that\nsince 2005/2006 3 new cohorts of students have entered colleges and\nuniversities and established a new pool of susceptibles.

And there have been a further 31 cases of the illness -- 2\nconfirmed and 29 suspected -- in Anglesey and Gwynedd since 27 Dec 2009. No\nlinks between the 2 outbreaks have been established, but it is thought that\na number of the cases are in children and young people who have previously\nreceived at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nSwansea became the heartland of the MMR backlash in Wales following claims\nin 1998 that the jab was linked to autism and bowel disease. The MMR uptake\nrate is now improving. The National Public Health Service for Wales (NPHS)\nhas urged any teenagers or young adults who have not had both doses of the\ntriple vaccine to ensure they are immunised against measles, mumps and\nrubella. Dr Hoffmann, a consultant in communicable disease control for the\nNPHS, said: 'The MMR vaccine is extremely effective in protecting against\nmeasles and rubella, with 99 per cent of those who have received 2 doses\nprotected for many years. One dose of MMR protects around 65 per cent of\nthose who receive it against mumps, with a 2nd dose of MMR improving\nimmunity to around 85 per cent of recipients. So it is possible to see\nmumps in individuals who have been vaccinated with MMR, although this is\nnot common.'\n\nIn the North Wales outbreak, at least 26 of the people who have developed\nmumps had previously received the recommended 2 doses of MMR. Dr Judy Hart,\na consultant in communicable disease control for the NPHS, said: 'MMR\nuptake is very high on Anglesey, so most school children are protected.\nHowever, young people aged 16 and over were too old to have received a\nroutine 2nd dose of MMR before school entry when it was introduced in 1996.\nThey are more likely to be susceptible to mumps, as it is spread by coughs\nand sneezes and directly through close personal contact.

GPs in the 2\nareas have been alerted to the problem. Health officials from\nAnglesey's Local Health Board (LHB) have sent letters to parents\nthrough Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones in Amlwch where pupils have become\nill. All the suspected cases have emerged since 27 Dec 2008.\n\nThe health service said it is possible, but not common, to get mumps\nafter being vaccinated with MMR which protects against measles, mumps\nand rubella and is given as part of the routine childhood\nimmunisation programme.

All cases\nhave social links, and most of them have received 2 doses of\nmumps-containing vaccine.\n\nSince 27 Dec 2008, the North Wales Health Protection Team of the\nNational Public Health Service for Wales has been notified of 23\ncases of clinical mumps. The onset dates are shown in the Figure\n[displayed in the original text]. The age range was 9-37 years with a\nmedian of 15-16 years, and similar numbers of males and females were\naffected. The cases are all linked via family or social groups.\n\nEpidemiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nThe 1st case reported on 27 Dec 2008 was a student in Manchester\nwhere, as confirmed by the Health Protection Unit, a number of mumps\ncases have occurred among students in recent weeks. They received an\nincrease in notifications in the 1st week of December 2008, which\npeaked in the 2nd week of December, and it is plausible that the\nstudent was infected at this time. Transmission from this case\nprobably occurred at a Young Farmers party held on Anglesey on the 27\nDec 2008. Members of 2 local Young Farmers groups were invited,\ncomprising around 50 young people aged 13 to 27 years.\n\nAn unusual feature of this outbreak is that 20 of the cases had\nreceived 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and 2\ncases had had one dose. The only unvaccinated case was a 37 year-old\npatient who was too old to have been offered MMR as a child. Most\ncases appear to be mild, with no reports to date of orchitis or other\ncomplications. MMR vaccine was introduced into the childhood\nvaccination programme of the United Kingdom (UK) in 1988. The mumps\nstrain currently used in the MMR vaccine is Jeryl Lynn. However, some\nof the older cases (over 17 years-old) in this outbreak will have\nreceived MMR vaccine containing the Urabe strain, which was used in\nthe UK from 1988 to 1992.\n\nLaboratory investigation\n------------------------\nOne case was admitted to the district general hospital where blood\nfor serology was taken. This was reported as negative for IgM against\nmumps virus, but positive for IgG with no evidence of recent\ninfection. This sample was taken the day after onset of symptoms, and\nwould have been too early to capture an IgM response. A convalescent\nsample has been requested.\n\nAnother case, who is a healthcare worker, had paired sera taken by\nthe Occupational Health Department, which showed a rising titre of\nmumps antibodies and was therefore confirmed as recent mumps\ninfection by the regional virology laboratory.\n\nSalivary swab samples of the remaining 21 clinical cases have been\nsubmitted to the reference laboratory at the Health Protection Agency\nCentre for Infections (CfI) at Colindale. The results for 3 cases\nhave been received to date and are as follows:\n\nCase 1: the samples were IgM-negative and IgG-positive (very high\ntitre), possibly indicating infection. A repeat salivary antibody\ntest has been requested to ascertain whether IgM titres have\nsubsequently risen.\n\nCase 2: the samples were IgM-negative and IgG-positive, although the\ntitre was not particularly high. This is consistent with past\nimmunisation, but does not allow confirmation of recent mumps\ninfection. The patient's general practitioner notes that it was a\nvery mild case of mumps.\n\nCase 3: the samples tested IgM-positive and IgG-positive (very high\ntitre). Recent mumps infection is confirmed.\n\nTwo recent cases have been swabbed within 48 hours of onset, and\ntheir samples will be tested by PCR [polymerase chain reaction] at\nthe CfI reference laboratory.\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\nSalivary swabs are usually submitted 2 weeks after notification of\nclinical mumps.

A total of 10 students in Cheltenham\nand Gloucester have been diagnosed with the infection and the number is\nexpected to rise. Health officials are now working at the university's 4\ncampuses in Cheltenham and Gloucester, which house more than 9500 full and\npart time students, in an effort to contain the outbreak. The Health\nProtection Agency is working with the university and is checking all\nsuspected cases of the illness that have been reported in the past 2 weeks.\n\nA warning letter has been sent to all students from the university's\nmedical officer, urging them to check for symptoms. Students and staff\nunder the age of 25 have been asked to check if they have had the MMR\n[measles, mumps, and rubella] jab and consult their GP [general\npractitioner]. They are also urged not to mix with other students for a\nweek if mumps is suspected. Mumps virus is highly contagious and in severe\ncases can cause deafness, viral meningitis, and infertility.\n\nLawrence Knight, of the Health Protection Agency South West, said: 'We are\nawaiting the test results from 3 students to ascertain whether these are\nisolated [cases]. The university's medical officer has taken a proactive\napproach by warning students, and that is quite right so people can look\nout for symptoms [of] mumps. This is an illness that can spread as easily\nas the flu. For some it is a mild infection and for others it is much more\nunpleasant. We would urge anyone who is concerned about symptoms to see\ntheir GP as soon as possible.'\n\nA spokesman for the University of Gloucestershire said: 'We believe around\n10 students have contracted mumps and have been diagnosed at the\nuniversity's medical centre. This is a small isolated outbreak. Students\nliving in Gloucestershire can go to their local GP or to the university\nmedical centre for an MMR jab if they are concerned.'\n\nAndrew Gravells, chairman of Gloucestershire's Health Overview and Scrutiny\nCommittee, added: 'This could be potentially very serious for the people\naffected and I would urge students and staff at the university to act on\nthe good advice that's being made available.'

She said last year [2007], there were\n11 cases in the area but none in 2003 and 2005, and the 2nd-largest\noutbreak of 34 cases dates back to 1997.\n\nThe virus, which affects the salivary glands and causes swollen\ncheeks, among other symptoms, has affected all ages, from a\n2-year-old to a 59-year-old, said Loewen. It's likely a person who\nwasn't immunized against mumps picked up the virus in Alberta, where\nthere is also an outbreak, and spread it to others who weren't\nimmunized. There are also sporadic cases in Abbotsford, Agassiz and\nMission, and officials are determining whether they're connected to\nthe Chilliwack outbreak. She said the high number of cases this year\n[2008] compared with the last 10 years is due to the fact that the\nvirus can take hold and then pick up speed if those affected spread\nit to others who aren't immunized.\n\nThe virus is spread through saliva and can be picked up by sharing a\nwater bottle, glass or cigarette, or through coughing. About 90 per\ncent of the population is immunized, and anyone born after 1956 and\nlikely after 1970 has a natural immunity to it because of exposure to\nmumps as a child, said Loewen.\n\nSymptoms include fatigue, muscle aches and pains, and coughing. Those\nwith the mumps are infectious generally for 9 days after the swelling\nbegins and should stay at home, she said. It can cause swollen\ntesticles or ovaries and lead to sterility and, in rare cases, cause\ninflammation of the brain.

This outbreak appears not to have been contained.\n\nMumps virus, the causative agent of mumps disease, is a paramyxovirus\nclassified in the genus_ Rubulavirus_ of the sub-family\n_Paramyxovirinae_. It is possible that a outsider initiated this\noutbreak in a community containing a few partially vaccinated or\nunvaccinated individuals.\n\nMumps vaccine has had a checkered history. It is now normally\nadministered as a component of the triple MMR (Mumps, Measles and\nRubella) vaccine. The current vaccine is effective, and children\nshould be given the 1st dose of MMR vaccine soon after the 1st\nbirthday (12 to 15 months of age). The 2nd dose is recommended before\nthe start of kindergarten. The current 'Jeryl Lynn' strain of mumps\nvaccine was developed by Dr. Maurice Hillman from the mumps virus\nthat infected his 5-year-old daughter (whose name was Jeryl Lynn).\nOriginally, just one dose of the MMR vaccine was recommended. In\n1989, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy\nof Pediatrics, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices, changed the\nrecommendation to 2 doses, primarily to immunize the small percent of\npeople who do not respond to the measles component of the MMR\nvaccine. Immunity to mumps virus infection is important for adults at\nhigh risk of exposure to mumps infection, including college students\nand health care workers. People born before 1957 are generally\nconsidered immune to mumps through environmental exposure in their youth.\n\nThroughout Canada, there have been occasional outbreaks of mumps in\nuniversity students and others of the same age (see references\nbelow). In the event of a mumps outbreak, students may not be allowed\nto remain in school unless they are vaccinated or have other proof of\nimmunity.

About 200\npeople have been verified to have the virus in areas as far west as Burnaby\nin the Vancouver suburbs, Dr Elizabeth Brodkin, medical health officer for\nthe Fraser Health Authority, said on Tuesday.\n\nIn an average year, fewer than 100 cases are reported across Canada. The\nBritish Columbia Centre for Disease Control is convening a provincial task\nforce to meet in two weeks to develop a strategy for combatting the\noutbreak, Brodkin said. Mumps is spread through saliva, and health\nofficials warned against the sharing of water bottles, drinking cups,\nmusical instruments, and cigarettes as well as coughing and sneezing\nwithout covering the nose and mouth. 'We've tried to do advertising to the\ngeneral public about the importance of not sharing spit because that's how\nthis thing has spread,' she said. 'We're calling it the don't-share-spit\ncampaign.'\n\nThe virus arrived in British Columbia from Alberta, where 300 people were\ninfected, and spread through a Fraser Valley religious group that shuns\nimmunization, Brodkin said. 'It's part of their belief system that this is\nnot the right thing to do,' she said. 'This outbreak, at least, got going\nbecause it took hold in an unimmunized community, so they are the ones who\nare really sitting ducks for infection.'\n\nAbout a third of those who are infected with the virus don't have any\nsymptoms but could still be spreading it. Symptoms include swelling of the\nglands under the jaw and chin and can be as severe as meningitis or\ninflamed testicles. Immunity to mumps dissipates over time, and people\nwho've had the disease 30 years ago could contract it again unless they are\nrevaccinated, Brodkin said.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Previous outbreaks of mumps in Canada have been associated predominantly\nwith the dispersal of young adults from educational institutions.\nInvolvement of religious communities which do not permit vaccination has\nbeen less common, although elsewhere frequently outbreaks of measles have\ninvolved such communities.

A total of 10 cases of mumps have been\nconfirmed, primarily in Norwich Township. A percentage of the\nNetherlands Reformed community who live there have not received the\nMMR vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. 'All 10\nwere unimmunized people,' said Mike Bragg, director of Oxford County\nPublic Health and Emergency Services.\n\nMumps is a viral illness with symptoms that include fever, headache,\nmuscle aches, fatigue, and swelling and pain in salivary glands. Some\nchildren may also experience cold symptoms. Complications from mumps\ncan be serious, including encephalitis, meningitis, arthritis or\ndeafness. One in 3 men may develop painful swollen testicles that, in\nrare cases, result in infertility. Pregnant women with mumps are also\nat an increased risk for miscarriage during their 1st trimester.\n\nEvery year there are on average about 20 cases of mumps in Ontario.\nOther provinces with current outbreaks of mumps include British\nColumbia and Alberta. The Netherlands is also reporting an outbreak.\n\nOutbreaks of mumps in Canada have shown that young adults, who have\nreceived only one dose of mumps vaccine, may also be at risk of\ndeveloping the disease, Bragg said. Oxford County public health\nreceived a report 30 Jul 2008 from an out-of-county hospital that\nblood work from a patient from Norwich indicated a diagnosis of\nmumps, a reportable disease.\n\nAn investigation revealed the cases of mumps date back to May [2008].\nThe MMR vaccine for these groups in the Norwich area is available\nfrom family doctors and clinics offered by public health. The 1st\nclinic will be held at the Norwich Community Centre on Monday [11 Aug\n2008] from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. A 2nd clinic will be at the Norwich\nTownship office in Otterville on Wednesday [13 Aug 2008] from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nIn 2005, an outbreak of measles spread quickly throughout the\nunimmunized population of Rehoboth Christian School in Norwich, whose\n651 pupils are members of the Netherlands Reformed community.

Confirmed cases\nare either laboratory-confirmed or clinically compatible and linked to a\nlaboratory-confirmed case. There have been ongoing outbreaks centered in\nthe Maritime provinces and in the province of Alberta. In addition, several\nother provinces experienced increased mumps activity in 2007.\n\nTable. Geographical and sex distribution of confirmed mumps cases reported\nin Canada. Onset 31 Dec 2006-29 Dec 2007 (n=1284):\nProvince/territory / case count / percentage male\nNova Scotia / 777 / 49\nAlberta / 258 / 58\nNew Brunswick / 124 / 57\nOntario / 48 / 33\nBritish Columbia / 25 / 44\nQuebec / 20 / 55\nPrince Edward Island / 13 / 73\nNewfoundland Labrador / 10 / 40\nManitoba / 7 / 57\nSaskatchewan / 2 / 50\nNunavut / 0 / 0\nNorthwest Territories / 0 / 0\nYukon Territory / 0 / 0\nNational Total / 1284 / 51\n\nIt is assumed that most people born before 1970 (about 40 years old) are\nimmune to mumps, as they were likely naturally exposed to the mumps virus\nin the period before immunization significantly reduced the amount of mumps\nvirus that was circulating. Most people born between 1990 and 1994 (12 and\n17 years old depending on the province/territory of residence) were offered\n2 doses of mumps-containing vaccine due to the introduction of a 2nd dose\nof measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for measles control in 1996-97 in\nmost provinces and territories. This has left a susceptible cohort of\npeople born between 1970 through 1990 (to a lesser extent through 1994) who\nwere only eligible for one dose of mumps-containing vaccine and who are not\nassumed to have natural immunity. It is important to note that the age at\nwhich natural immunity to mumps can be assumed is not known with certainty\nand that some individuals born prior to 1970 may still be susceptible to mumps.\n\n[The interested reader should consult the original text for a more detailed\ngraphic presentation of these data. - Mod.CP]\n\nThe majority of cases (58 per cent) reported in 2007 were aged 20-29 years\n[data illustrated graphically in the original text]. For those cases where\ninformation was reported (n=594), 50 per cent were post-secondary students.\nThe reason for the particular susceptibility among those who are college\nand university-aged is multifactorial. They are too young for natural\nimmunity and too old for routine 2-dose MMR immunization. Mumps has a\nfairly long infectious period (up to 16 days), a long incubation period (14\nto 25 days), and up to 20 per cent of infectious cases show no signs or\nsymptoms. In addition, the very social and mobile lifestyles of this age\ngroup appear to be facilitating disease transmission and interfering with\ncontrol measures. This age group tends not to adhere to isolation requests,\nand they generally do not participate when immunization is offered.\nFurthermore, post-secondary students often share living/sleeping\narrangements, many are involved in competitive sports, they frequent\nbars/pubs/nightclubs and travel during school holidays and breaks.\nAdditional cases in this demographic group and possibly other jurisdictions\nwould not be unexpected.\n\nOf those mumps cases reported in 2007 with known immunization history\n(n=586), 8 per cent (45) had received 2 or more doses, 73 per cent (430)\nhad received one dose and 19 per cent (111) received no doses of\nmumps-containing vaccine.\n\nThe data on mumps hospitalizations and complications are incomplete.\nComplications have been reported in about 8 per cent of cases in 2007.\nThere have been reports of orchitis (76), oophoritis (9), hearing loss (8),\nmastitis (3), meningitis (1), encephalitis (1), pancreatitis (1) and\nnephritis (1). Less than 2 per cent of cases have resulted in hospital\nemergency department visits, overnight observation or hospital admission.\n\nImmunization\n------------\nMumps remains endemic in many countries throughout the world. Mumps vaccine\nis used in only 57 per cent of World Health Organization member countries,\npredominantly in countries with more developed economies. The Public Health\nAgency of Canada encourages parents, guardians and adults to maintain\nup-to-date immunizations for themselves and their children.\n\nThe National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) provides the Public\nHealth Agency of Canada with ongoing and timely medical, scientific, and\npublic health advice relating to immunization. NACI released their updated\nrecommendations for mumps-containing vaccine in August 2007. They recommend\n2 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for infants and\nchildren. In addition, they recommend a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine for certain\nhigh-risk adults born in or after 1970 who have not received 2 doses of the\nvaccine and are possibly susceptible to the mumps virus. This includes\nstudents in secondary and post-secondary institutions and health-care\nworkers. All NACI guidelines can be accessed on the Public Health Agency of\nCanada's website <http://www.naci.gc.ca>.\n\nIndividual provinces and territories implement immunization programs within\ntheir respective jurisdictions according to local need and decision\nprocesses. The 2004 National Immunization Coverage Survey (NICS) found that\n94 per cent of Canadian children had received a single dose of the MMR\nvaccine by their 2nd birthday. Coverage estimates for the 2nd dose of MMR\nvaccine by 7 years of age was 79 per cent. Other results from the 2004\nNational Immunization Coverage Survey can be found in the Canadian National\nReport on Immunization. The recent outbreaks and increases in mumps cases\nacross Canada have led to targeted immunization activities in several\nprovinces and territories. [This information is presented comprehensively\nin tabulated form in the original text, which should be consulted by the\ninterested reader].\n\nOn 11 Dec 2007, Health Canada advised provincial and territorial health\nauthorities not to use 3 lots of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine while the\nDepartment investigated 6 suspected cases of anaphylaxis in Alberta\npatients. All anaphylactic events were associated with the same lot number\nand involved young adults who had a previous history of allergy. All the\nindividuals recovered upon treatment. The vaccinations took place during a\ncatch-up campaign for young adults in response to a mumps outbreak. The\nreview found no link between the vaccine lot and the adverse events in\nAlberta. The suspensions have been lifted, and the lots are available for\nuse by provinces and territories to vaccinate adults and children <http://\nwww.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2008/2008_35_e.html>.\n\nLaboratory testing and viral strain\n-----------------------------------\nThe clinical and laboratory diagnosis of mumps can be difficult. Proper\nspecimen collection and transportation along with appropriate laboratory\ntesting and cautious interpretation of results are important. In 2007, the\nPublic Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory revised\ntheir laboratory guidelines for the diagnosis of mumps. The guidelines are\navailable on the Public Health Agency of Canada's website\n<http://www.nmllnm.gc.ca/english/mumps.htm>.\n\nIdentifying virus strains is useful for differentiating vaccine and\nwild-type strains, linking cases, linking outbreaks, tracking importations,\nand documenting the elimination of a particular strain from a geographic\narea. The viral strain in the 2 2007 Canadian outbreaks (Maritimes and\nAlberta) is identical to the genotype G strain detected from the 2005-2006\nNova Scotia outbreaks, the United States' multistate outbreak in 2006 and\nthe United Kingdom epidemic (2004-2006). In the United States' outbreak,\nthere were over 2500 cases reported in at least 13 states. It involved\nseveral university and college campuses, and the median age was 21 years.\nIn the United Kingdom, the epidemic peaked at more than 50 000\nnotifications, with the majority being 15-24 years old.\n\nThe G genotype is not unusual or rare and, like the rest of known genotypes\nof mumps, it has been circulating globally for decades or longer. There are\nmultiple strains of mumps virus, and there is evidence that the immunity\ninduced by one mumps virus strain protects against infection by other\nstrains (10). However, there is also some evidence suggesting that the\nimmune response directed against one genotype of mumps may not provide\nabsolute protection against infection with mumps viruses of other genotypes\n(11,12). Mumps virus detection, isolation and genotyping are available at\nthe National Microbiology Laboratory.\n\nPublic health actions\n---------------------\nMumps cases are asked to self-isolate for a period of 9 days following the\nonset of symptoms. The vaccine status of close contacts (that is, household\nand intimate contacts/exchange of saliva) is assessed and updated so that\nthey receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Guidelines have been put in place for\nhealth care workers who are cases or who are contacts of mumps cases.\n\nPublic health and primary care providers are encouraged to refer to their\nlocal or provincial/territorial ministry of health for specific\nrecommendations on action that may be required within their jurisdiction.\n\nAll provinces and territories are being kept informed of the epidemiologic\nsituation and the public health management strategies in the affected\njurisdictions. Based on this, all jurisdictions are encouraged to continue\nmonitoring mumps activity within their regions and report any changes\nand/or cases to the Public Health Agency of Canada, particularly in\nprovinces and territories not currently affected by the on-going outbreaks.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada along with the provinces and territories\nis developing national guidelines for mumps outbreak prevention and\ncontrol. This group is drawing on the experiences and expertise both here\nin Canada and other countries.\n\nSeveral provinces, territories and post-secondary institutions are\nencouraging students to ensure their immunization is up-to-date (readers\nshould refer to specific provincial/territorial public health authorities\nand educational institutions).\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada will continue to provide updates on the\ncurrent outbreak of mumps. The agency is working with the affected\nprovinces in monitoring this outbreak, providing technical advice and\nassisting with laboratory testing of clinical specimens at the National\nMicrobiology Laboratory. The Public Health Agency of Canada supports the\nprovincial outbreak response strategies that include the recommended\nisolation of cases and targeted immunization of contacts and susceptible\ncohorts.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada recommends that jurisdictions\nexperiencing outbreaks should consider offering an additional dose of MMR\nvaccine for immunization in outbreak settings. Some jurisdictions are\nencouraging and/or offering MMR vaccine to healthcare workers and\npost-secondary students. In other jurisdictions, there are ongoing\ndiscussions regarding an expanded immunization strategy to target the\nsusceptible cohort. Readers should refer to their local or\nprovincial/territorial ministry of health for specific recommendations.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada encourages parents, guardians and adults\nto maintain up-to-date immunizations for themselves and their children and\nencourages susceptible individuals to be immunized in accordance with the\nNational Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) guidelines. All\nguidelines can be accessed at <http://www.naci.gc.ca>.\n\nNACI currently recommends a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine for certain adults born\nafter 1970. This includes students at post secondary institutions and\nhealth care workers.\n\nSelected references\n---------------------\n1.

In 2007, the\nPublic Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory revised\ntheir laboratory guidelines for the diagnosis of mumps. \n\nThe National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) provides the Public\nHealth Agency of Canada with ongoing and timely medical, scientific, and\npublic health advice relating to immunization. \n\nPublic health and primary care providers are encouraged to refer to their\nlocal or provincial/territorial ministry of health for specific\nrecommendations on action that may be required within their jurisdiction. \n\nAll provinces and territories are being kept informed of the epidemiologic\nsituation and the public health management strategies in the affected\njurisdictions. ---------------------\nMumps cases are asked to self-isolate for a period of 9 days following the\nonset of symptoms. The vaccine status of close contacts (that is, household\nand intimate contacts/exchange of saliva) is assessed and updated so that\nthey receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine. The 2004 National Immunization Coverage Survey (NICS) found that\n94 per cent of Canadian children had received a single dose of the MMR\nvaccine by their 2nd birthday. \n\nIndividual provinces and territories implement immunization programs within\ntheir respective jurisdictions according to local need and decision\nprocesses. The viral strain in the 2 2007 Canadian outbreaks (Maritimes and\nAlberta) is identical to the genotype G strain detected from the 2005-2006\n Some jurisdictions are\nencouraging and/or offering MMR vaccine to healthcare workers and\npost-secondary students.

'It's been\ncoming at us from east to west,' said Fraser Health medical health\nofficer Dr Gillian Arsenault, who pointed to cases documented in Nova\nScotia, and later Alberta.\n\n'Apparently some of those infected [in Chilliwack] had either direct\nor indirect contact with the Alberta connection. So for anyone\nplanning to go to Alberta, now is a good time to get vaccinated,' she\nsaid.\n\nThe local cases are likely just the tip of the iceberg given the\n'sneaky' nature of the mumps virus, she said. The virus is spread by\nsaliva, so a cough or sneeze can send it travelling through the air\nwith fine mist droplets. 'When we have lab-confirmed cases, it means\nthere are more cases we don't know about,' said Dr Arsenault. 'The\nreason for that is roughly one-third of infected people display no\nsymptoms at all. For them it's just like a rotten cold.' Another\nthird of sufferers will experience swollen glands, testicles, or some\nother physical clue, and the swelling always comes on the heels of\nthe cold-like symptoms. An individual who's been exposed can be\ninfected and not know it, she said. 'It only takes one coughing\ninfected person in an ER or waiting room to spread the virus.'\n\nA mumps alert went out from Fraser Health offices last week [3-9 Mar\n2008] warning Chilliwack residents to make sure their vaccinations\nare up to date. Older adults are more at risk for serious disease, if\nthey're not immune through vaccination or through having had the\ndisease. 'People born before 1970 tend to have been around the virus\nand are more likely to be immune,' she said. 'The hardest hit include\nteens and young adults. Those who are 18 years or younger, attending\npost-secondary, or child/health care workers born after 1956, are\neligible for 2 free doses of Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\n'If you have been around someone who has the mumps, you might have\nit, so check your vaccinations and if you think you may have it,\nphone first before heading into your doctor's office,' Dr Arsenault\nsaid. 'There is no 100 per cent guarantee of immunity, so everyone\nneeds to be careful.' Since the mumps infection affects the salivary\nglands, she said it's crucial to avoid sharing mouthpieces, drinking\nglasses, and other ways of 'swapping spit.' Asked if she thought\nBritish Columbia's population was immune enough to stop an outbreak,\nshe couldn't answer definitively. 'We don't know,' she said. Small\nclusters of mumps cases have been reported in other communities over\nthe past year, which didn't in fact turn into larger outbreaks of the\nvirus. 'We're hoping the same will happen here,' said the health\nofficial. 'We don't know how fast or how big this iceberg is, so it's\na good time to get the word out. The more people know, the more\nlikelihood it won't turn into a big outbreak.' Mumps 'very rarely'\nkill people, she said, but they can fall ill and feel awful.\n\nA total of 399 cases were reported in Alberta between 1 Sep 2007 and\n4 Mar 2008, with the majority of cases in the Chinook region of\nsouthern Alberta, and the rest in Calgary.

The reported mumps cases are restricted to\ngeographic regions with a high percentage of residents who are\nmembers of a religious community that rejects vaccination.\nConsequently, two thirds of the mumps patients were not vaccinated.\nHowever, also vaccinated individuals in these regions were affected\n(1). Since 1987, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) combination vaccine\nproduced by the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI) is part of the\nDutch national immunisation programme and administered at the ages of\n14 months and 9 years.\n\nNVI's MMR vaccine contains the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain. The Jeryl\nLynn strain consists of 2 distinct viral isolates (JL-2 and JL-5).\nClinical studies have demonstrated 80-100 percent seroconversion\nafter a single dose of the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine (2).\nOutbreak-based studies have shown an effectiveness of the Jeryl Lynn\nmumps vaccine ranging between 63 percent and 96 percent, depending on\nthe number of vaccinations given (2-4). The Jeryl Lynn strain has\nconsistently been shown to be very safe (4,5). Table 1 shows an\noverview of available mumps vaccine strains [Readers should access\nthe source URL to view these data. - Mod.CP]\n\nThe RIT 4385 mumps strain was derived from one of the 2 distinct\nvirus populations of the Jeryl Lynn strain. Comparative studies of\nthe RIT 4385 and Jeryl Lynn vaccines showed similar seroconversion\nrates, although the geometric mean titre was significantly higher\namong recipients of the Jeryl Lynn vaccine (2). Several vaccines\nderived from the Urabe AM9 mumps strain were withdrawn from the\nmarket due to an excessive number of cases of vaccine-associated\naseptic meningitis (6). The effectiveness of the Urabe vaccine ranges\nbetween 54 and 87 percent (3,5). Another vaccine strain, Rubini, has\nshown to be less potent with respect to effectiveness (2,3,5). For\nthis reason, the WHO (World Health Organisation) recommends that the\nRubini strain should not be used in national immunisation programmes\n(2). The Leningrad-3 strain was developed in the former Soviet Union\nand its protective efficacy has been estimated to be 91-99 percent\n(2,4). Unfortunately, aseptic meningitis is a particularly common\nevent among recipients of this vaccine strain (4,7). Furthermore, it\nhas been reported that the Leningrad-3 strain can be transmitted\nhorizontally, causing symptomatic disease (7). Consequently,\nLeningrad-3 vaccine has not gained much attention outside former\nSoviet Union republics. The Leningrad-3 strain was further attenuated\nin Croatia and was renamed L-Zagreb, which showed equivalent good\nclinical protection (2). Unfortunately, an association with aseptic\nmeningitis has also been a matter of concern for the L-Zagreb strain\nas well as symptomatic transmission of the vaccine virus (4,8,9).\nSeveral other strains have been used for mumps vaccination, but most\nof them on a limited scale. Therefore, little information is\navailable on their safety and effectiveness. Based on the safety and\nefficacy data available for the vaccine strains, it can be concluded\nthat the Jeryl Lynn strain has the most favourable benefit-risk\nprofile.\n\nA mismatch between the genotype of the circulating wild-type mumps\nvirus and the vaccine strain may influence the efficacy of the\nvaccine. At present, the molecular epidemiology of mumps virus is\ncharacterised by the co-existence of 13 different genotypes named A-M\n(10). Those genotypes are defined on the basis of the most variable\npart of the mumps virus genome, that is, the gene encoding the small\nhydrophobic (SH) protein (10).\n\nThe vaccine strains currently available belong to a few different\ngenotypes [Readers should consult Table 1 in the original text to\nview this information. - Mod.CP] Antigenic differences have been\nobserved between different genotypes, which result in incomplete,\ncross-neutralisation (11). The antigenic differences were largest\nbetween genotype A and genotypes B-D and G-I, which correlates well\nwith the relative phylogenetic distance between these genotypes [This\ninformation is presented as a figure in the original text, in the\nform of a phylogenetic tree of published sequences of 53 mumps virus\nstrains, based on the nucleotide sequence of the small hydrophobic\ngene (SH)] (10,11).\n\nAt present, there is no clinical evidence that a genotype mismatch\nleads to vaccine failure or may have epidemiological significance.\nFor example, both the mumps virus in the outbreak in the United\nStates (US) and Canada in 2005-2006 and the virus responsible for the\nmumps outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2004-2005 belonged to\ngenotype G (4,12,13). Nevertheless, the MMR vaccine based on genotype\nA (Jeryl Lynn) appeared to be effective during these outbreaks (12).\nThe mumps strains responsible for the current mumps outbreak in the\nNetherlands and a previous outbreak in an international school in the\nNetherlands in 2004 (14) were both of genotype D, whereas the mumps\nvaccine strain (Jeryl Lynn) belongs to genotype A. Although\ncross-protection after vaccination with genotype A might not be as\neffective after infection with genotype D, no further transmission\ntook place during the outbreak in 2004. This suggests that\nvaccine-induced (herd) immunity was high enough to prevent further\ncirculation of the mumps virus. On the other hand, it is striking\nthat the viruses responsible for reported mumps outbreaks belong to\ngenotypes that are phylogenetically distinct from the vaccine strains\nused in the area of the outbreak [These data are presented as Table 2\nin the original text. - Mod.CP] Therefore, the possibility that the\nmumps virus might evolve under selection pressure from the vaccine\nwarrants surveillance of genotype distribution.\n\nFinally, waning vaccine-induced immunity may contribute to a reduced\neffectiveness of the vaccine. Previously, it was assumed that mumps\nvaccination induces life-long immunity against mumps. However,\nincreasing evidence shows that vaccinated individuals and possibly\nalso naturally infected individuals, become more susceptible with\ntime after the last exposure to the mumps virus (4,12,13). Examples\nare 2 mumps outbreaks that occurred among vaccinated students in an\ninternational school in the Netherlands (14) and on college campuses\nin the US (12). Therefore, stronger precautions should be taken to\navoid an increase in susceptible adolescents and adults that are more\nat risk for mumps-related complications such as orchitis and\nmeningitis. Catch-up immunisations should be considered for\nunvaccinated individuals and susceptible vaccinated people,\nespecially for those living in groups in close contact.\n\nIn response to a mumps outbreak, several countries such as Ireland\nhave decided to move the 2nd MMR vaccination forward to the age of 4\nor 5 years (instead of between 9 and 14 years) to decrease the risk\nof waning immunity between the 2 vaccinations. However, other\noutbreaks show that waning immunity may also occur after the 2nd\nvaccination. Moreover, by decreasing the age of the last MMR\nvaccination, the susceptibility of women for rubella during their\nfertile period may increase, which potentially leads to more cases of\ncongenital rubella syndrome.\n\nConclusion\n----------\nThe 1st priority should be to avoid clustering of unvaccinated people\nby making an effort to convince people to get vaccinated. Although a\nnumber of mumps cases have occurred in vaccinated individuals, no\nother mumps vaccine strain is available at present with equivalent or\nbetter effectiveness and similar safety profile than the currently\nused Jeryl Lynn strain. However, the impact of a genotype mismatch\nbetween the wild-type virus and the vaccine virus on the mumps\nvaccine effectiveness as well as the possibility of waning\nvaccine-induced immunity should be further explored.\n\nAcknowledgments\n---------------\nWe would like to thank Nynke Y Rots, Truus W de Graaf, Andre D\nPlantinga, Renee AJ van Boxtel, Alberdien Haalboom-Clement, and\nMarjolein van Campen-Werkhoven for providing useful suggestions,\nrelevant information, and/or excellent assistance.\n\n[P Kaaijk, BA van der Zeijst, MC Boog, CW Hoitink\nNetherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI), Bilthoven, the Netherlands]\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Although\ncross-protection after vaccination with genotype A might not be as\neffective after infection with genotype D, no further transmission\ntook place during the outbreak in 2004.

On the other hand, it is striking\nthat the viruses responsible for reported mumps outbreaks belong to\ngenotypes that are phylogenetically distinct from the vaccine strains\nused in the area of the outbreak [These data are presented as Table 2\nin the original text. However, the impact of a genotype mismatch\nbetween the wild-type virus and the vaccine virus on the mumps\nvaccine effectiveness as well as the possibility of waning\nvaccine-induced immunity should be further explored. For example, both the mumps virus in the outbreak in the United\nStates (US) and Canada in 2005-2006 and the virus responsible for the\nmumps outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2004-2005 belonged to\ngenotype G (4,12,13). Since 1987, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) combination vaccine\nproduced by the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI) is part of the\nDutch national immunisation programme and administered at the ages of\n14 months and 9 years. Several vaccines\nderived from the Urabe AM9 mumps strain were withdrawn from the\nmarket due to an excessive number of cases of vaccine-associated\naseptic meningitis (6).

However,\nincreasing evidence shows that vaccinated individuals and possibly\nalso naturally infected individuals, become more susceptible with\ntime after the last exposure to the mumps virus (4,12,13). Based on the safety and\nefficacy data available for the vaccine strains, it can be concluded\nthat the Jeryl Lynn strain has the most favourable benefit-risk\nprofile. Examples\nare 2 mumps outbreaks that occurred among vaccinated students in an\ninternational school in the Netherlands (14) and on college campuses\nin the US (12). The reported mumps cases are restricted to\ngeographic regions with a high percentage of residents who are\nmembers of a religious community that rejects vaccination.\n Comparative studies of\nthe RIT 4385 and Jeryl Lynn vaccines showed similar seroconversion\nrates, although the geometric mean titre was significantly higher\namong recipients of the Jeryl Lynn vaccine (2). Therefore, stronger precautions should be taken to\navoid an increase in susceptible adolescents and adults that are more\nat risk for mumps-related complications such as orchitis and\nmeningitis.

This is drawing a concern from the Southern\nNevada Health District. The health department says these recent cases\nprove the virus is in circulation locally.\n\nThe health district says in terms of mumps, 6 cases are more than\nthey would want to see in the county. Now the department is asking\npeople to get vaccinated if they haven't yet. And even if you have\nbeen vaccinated, there is still a small chance you might get the virus.\n\n'It's possible any person at any age can come down with mumps even if\nyou have been vaccinated,' said Southern Nevada Health District\nepidemiologist, Brian Labus. It's a virus that can spread fast. Labus\nsays his office has not seen a trend in mumps cases like this in a\nwhile. 'This is out of the ordinary, that's why were interested and\nthat's why we're letting the community know what's going on. This is\nmore than we would expect to see,' said Labus.\n\nThe more visual symptom of the disease are swollen glands near the\nneck. The greatest mumps epidemic was in in 1941, when children were\nmore prone to it. Labus says the 6 people who have come down with the\nmumps vary in age and it is possible for any person at any age to\ncome down with the mumps.\n\n'You really see this disease against all ages. You used to expect to\nsee it as a childhood disease, but it really affects age ranges from\nthe young to the old -- anybody can be at risk for getting the\ndisease,' said Labus.\n\nThe disease is contagious and usually spread by breathing in the\nvirus after an infected person coughs or sneezes near you or by\ncoming in direct contact with the saliva of an infected person.\n\nMumps symptoms:\n-- Fever of 101 F to 104 F.\n-- Headache, earache, sore throat\n-- Pain when swallowing\n-- Tiredness\n-- Muscle and joint aches\n-- Poor appetite and vomiting.\n\nIf you have had mumps in the past, you are pretty much immune from\ngetting it again.

Before the outbreak, Maine\nhad not reported a case in at least 20 years. Now mumps has spread across\nthe state, reaching its southernmost county and making nearly 75 children\nand adults sick statewide since September [2007].\nDisease trackers suspect that the Maine outbreak was imported from Canada,\nwhere 1140 people have fallen ill this year [2007], 14 times the average\nfor recent years. Most of the cases have been reported by 3 eastern\nprovinces -- Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.\nSpecialists in Massachusetts are watching the migration of mumps with\nincreasing concern, knowing that many of the patients in Maine and Canada\nare college students, a group particularly susceptible because they are\nmobile and live in tight quarters, an ideal combination for disease\ntransmission.\n'We are exploring every possible mumps case,' said Dr Alfred DeMaria,\ndirector of communicable disease control for the Department of Public\nHealth in Massachusetts, where only 3 cases have been reported this year.\n'We're going to be especially vigilant after the holidays,' he said,\nbecause Boston students may have contact with students from Maine schools\nduring the break.\nThe resurgence of mumps illustrates the hardiness of a virus, the\nlimitations of a vaccine, and the realities of a world so hooked on air\ntravel that germs can spread from one country to another in a matter of\nhours. Specialists said they believe that is exactly what happened with\nmumps. Like measles, it was a common childhood scourge that appeared headed\nfor extinction in the United States. But in 2005, a strain widely\ncirculating [not terribly common, clinically. - Mod.SH] in the United\nKingdom, where vaccination rates are significantly lower than in North\nAmerica, was imported to a New York state summer camp. Within a year, that\nsame strain was identified as the culprit in a Midwest outbreak. And it is\nbeing blamed for the cases in Canada this year.\n'Mumps is essentially endemic in the rest of the world,' said Dr James\nAlexander, a medical epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC). 'Canada and the United States were the 2 countries\nwhere mumps was close to being eliminated.'\nThe virus is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person's\nsaliva, meaning it can travel through a kiss or on utensils, towels, or\ntissues. It causes severe swelling of salivary glands and is heralded by\nfever, headache, body aches, and glandular tenderness where the jaw forms\nan angle. Rarely fatal, it can result in significant complications,\nincluding inflammation of the testes, brain swelling, meningitis, and\nsterility. A vaccine introduced in 1967 led to a steep decline in mumps in\nthe United States, but within 2 decades, the virus had reemerged.\n'Mumps has undoubtedly been with us for millennia, and it's not likely to\ndisappear just because we develop an effective vaccine,' said Dr Kenneth\nMcIntosh, a disease specialist at Children's Hospital Boston. One pivotal\nlesson derived from the return of the mumps in the late 1980s: a single\ndose of vaccine did not provide enough of a shield. It was then that\ndisease specialists began recommending that children receive 2 doses and\nthat schools bar students who were not vaccinated.\nAs Canadian specialists began investigating this year's outbreak, they\nquickly homed in on the vaccination history of patients, unearthing\nimportant clues. Nearly 73 per cent had received only a single dose of\nvaccine, while 19 per cent had no vaccination at all. Those who received at\nleast one dose generally had milder cases. 'I like to compare this disease\nto a heat-seeking missile,' said Jeannette Macey, an epidemiologist with\nthe epidemiologist with the Public Health Agency of Canada. 'If there are\npeople in the population who are not protected, it's going to find them.'\nIn Maine, authorities are collecting comparable data, but they know already\nthat many of the adults who became infected probably only got a single dose\nearlier in life. At the University of Southern Maine, where many of the\nstudents are older, at least 10 people have fallen ill, a spokeswoman said.\nDisease specialists from Maine and the federal CDC are also continuing to\ninvestigate exactly where the virus came from, running sophisticated\ngenetic testing and conducting extensive interviews. 'It's not surprising\nthat Maine would have cases,' said Dr Dora Mills, director of Maine's CDC.\n'New Brunswick is adjacent to Maine, and Nova Scotia might as well be,\nbecause there are several boats that go back and forth every day.'\n[byline: Stephen Smith]\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[There has been a considerable increase in the number of mumps cases\nreported in Maine since the initial report on 20 Nov 2007.

The resurgence of mumps illustrates the hardiness of a virus, the\nlimitations of a vaccine, and the realities of a world so hooked on air\ntravel that germs can spread from one country to another in a matter of\nhours.

The case count\nof 7 confirmed and 24 suspected cases of mumps has risen to at least 75\nconfirmed cases. Disease trackers suspect that the Maine outbreak was imported from Canada,\nwhere 1140 people have fallen ill this year [2007], 14 times the average\nfor recent years. One pivotal\nlesson derived from the return of the mumps in the late 1980s: a single\ndose of vaccine did not provide enough of a shield. Now mumps has spread across\nthe state, reaching its southernmost county and making nearly 75 children\nand adults sick statewide since September [2007]. As Canadian specialists began investigating this year's outbreak, they\nquickly homed in on the vaccination history of patients, unearthing\nimportant clues. We're going to be especially vigilant after the holidays,' he said,\nbecause Boston students may have contact with students from Maine schools\nduring the break. It was then that\ndisease specialists began recommending that children receive 2 doses and\nthat schools bar students who were not vaccinated.

'Because this outbreak [in Maine] has spread, we are updating\nvaccination recommendations, especially among children, college and\nuniversity students and hospital workers,' said Dr Dora Anne Mills, head of\nthe Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Because of the\nenvironments where they live and work, such individuals are most likely to\ncontract and spread the virus, Mills said.\n\nSince September [2007], 7 cases of mumps have been confirmed in southern\nand central Maine, 4 of them in November 2007 alone. The state is awaiting\nthe results of lab tests on as many as 24 more suspected cases, according\nto the Maine CDC. The age of the sickened individuals ranges from the late\nteens to the late 50s. While the number of cases in Maine may seem\ninsignificant, more than 900 individuals in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,\nmostly college students, have been sickened with mumps since last winter\n[2006-2007].\n\nOn Monday [19 Nov 2007], a housekeeper at EMMC was given a preliminary\ndiagnosis of mumps pending confirmation by laboratory testing. Donna\nDunton, director of infection control at EMMC, confirmed on Monday evening\nthat the housekeeper has been asked to stay out of work until lab reports\nof her mumps-like symptoms are complete. The employee is not thought to\nhave been in close enough contact with any patients to have spread the\nvirus, Dunton stressed, and routine infection control measures such as hand\nwashing are likely to have minimized the possibility of transmission.\n\nMumps is a viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms typically\ninclude fever, headache, muscle ache, and swelling and tenderness of the\nglands at the corner of the jaw. Symptoms may last 7 to 10 days, and\ninfected individuals are contagious for at least 3 days before becoming ill\nand as long as 9 days after symptoms appear. Infection occurs through\ndirect contact with respiratory droplets from the nose or throat, through\nsaliva, coughing, sneezing, sharing drinks, kissing or from contact with\nany surface that has been contaminated with the virus. Rarely, mumps\ninfection can lead to meningitis, inflammation of the testicles or ovaries,\ninflammation of the pancreas, and temporary or permanent hearing loss.\n\n'Although mumps is a virus and is not treatable with antibiotics, the good\nnews is that mumps can be prevented or its impact reduced with vaccine,'\nMills said. The MMR vaccine -- which protects against mumps, measles and\nrubella, or 'German measles' -- is the most common vaccine used to protect\nagainst mumps.\n\nThe Maine CDC's updated guidelines are as follows:\n- For students in kindergarten through 12th grade, all vaccine records\nshould be reviewed and updated. For any students who are not current with\ntheir MMR vaccines, a letter should be given to the parents notifying them\nof the mumps outbreak and informing them that if their child remains\nunimmunized and the infection is detected in their school, their child will\nbe excluded from school for at least 18 days.\n- For college and university students, all vaccine records should be\nreviewed and updated. All students should have documentation of 2 doses of\nMMR rather than the previously required one dose. Most students will have\nhad 2 doses as part of their routine childhood vaccinations, but older\n'nontraditional' students may be lacking the 2nd dose.\n- Hospital health care workers with direct patient contact should have\ntheir vaccine records reviewed and updated.\n\nAdequate mumps vaccination for those born in 1957 or later now consists of\n2 doses of MMR rather than the previously required one dose. Adequate mumps\nvaccination for those born before 1957 now consists of one dose of MMR,\nrather than no doses, as previously required.\n\nBesides the additional vaccinations, the Maine CDC also recommends that\nindividuals who become infected should be isolated for 9 days after the\nonset of illness. Those who are not immunized and who are exposed should be\nisolated for about 18 days after the last known exposure.\n\nMills acknowledged that compliance with these recommendations may be\nfinancially and logistically burdensome for some individuals, institutions\nand families. The average cost of a mumps vaccine is about USD 45, she\nsaid, but the state is trying to secure supplies of lower-cost vaccine. The\nMaine CDC can assist institutions with the process of reviewing records,\nsetting up vaccine clinics and obtaining vaccine supplies, she said.\n\nMills added that the new recommendations are likely to be upgraded to\nrequirements through departmental rule-making in the near future. 'While\nthere is no apparent direct connection between people in Maine with\nconfirmed infection and the current outbreak in Canada, it is not\nsurprising that a border state like Maine would see an outbreak,' Mills said.\n\nA student health official at the University of Maine was unavailable Monday\n[19 Nov 2007] to comment on how the new recommendations might affect the\nOrono campus.\n\nAt EMMC, Dunton said employee charts have been under review for several\nmonths in response to changes in vaccine recommendations from the Maine CDC\nissued earlier this year [2007]. Monday's [19 Nov 2007] announcement, she\nsaid, is likely to 'step up the pace' of that review, and many employees\nare likely to be asked to roll up their sleeves.\n\n[byline: Meg Haskell]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[For further information, visit the state of Maine's website at\n<http://www.mainepublichealth.gov>.

The outbreak\nstarted in October 2007, with 105 cases notified\nin that month compared to an average number of 24\ncases per month notified between January and\nSeptember 2007. Between 1 Oct 2007 and 31 Dec 2007, 1 524 cases were notified.\n\nIn the Republic of Moldova, mumps monovalent\nvaccination was introduced in 1983 as a\nsingle-dose schedule targeting children aged\n15-18 months-old. Since 2002, a 2nd dose has been\nadministered to 6- to 7-year-olds (birth cohorts\nfrom 1995 onwards), using a combined vaccine for\nmeasles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). Reported mumps\nvaccination coverage has been high since its\nintroduction, except for a period in the early\n1990s when a vaccine shortage occurred due to\npolitical changes. Successful catch-up campaigns\nsubsequently improved vaccination coverage in\nthose birth cohorts affected by the vaccine\nshortage. According to routine national\nsurveillance data, coverage with one dose of\nmumps vaccine is 94 percent in individuals born\nin 1989-1993. Coverage with 2 doses is 96 percent\nin individuals born in 1995-2000. Coverage in the\n1994 birth cohort is 99 percent and 21 percent\nwith one and 2 doses, respectively. The most\nrecent large mumps outbreak in the Republic of\nMoldova occurred in 1996-1998, with 28 845 cases\nreported, predominantly from birth cohorts 1983-1990 (60 percent).\n\nIn February 2008, the country's Ministry of\nHealth invited an international outbreak\ninvestigation team coordinated by the World\nHealth Organization Regional Office for Europe,\nto identify the extent of the mumps outbreak and\nassess cases and their possible risk factors for\nacquiring mumps, and to provide recommendations for the current outbreak.\n\nThe following is a preliminary description of the\nextent and characteristics of the outbreak until 2 Mar 2008.\n\nMethods\n-------\nIn the Republic of Moldova, mumps cases are\nnotified by family doctors, hospitals and health\ncentres to 44 Regional Centres for Preventive\nMedicine (RCPMs), with date of onset, initial\ndiagnosis, hospitalisation, and vaccination\nhistory where available. The RCPMs aggregate and\ntransmit the data to the National Scientific and\nPractical Centre for Preventive Medicine (NSPCPM)\non a monthly and annual basis. In addition to the\nroutine communicable diseases reporting, a weekly\ntransmission of mumps data to the NSPCPM was\nintroduced on 17 Dec 2007 to monitor the\noutbreak. These reports are based on the\nemergency notifications of suspected cases and\ncontain information on age, vaccination status,\nhospitalisation, and number of cases in\neducational institutions. Here we describe the\ncases reported weekly between 17 Dec 2007 and 2 Mar 2008 (n=13 853).\n\nMumps is notified when suspected on clinical\ngrounds by a physician. For a minority of cases\n(n=388, 3 percent), laboratory testing was\ncarried out. Mumps IgM antibody testing in\npatients' sera (n=367) was performed at the\nNSPCPM using a mumps IgM ELISA kit (Novalisa,\nNovatec Immundiagnostica GmbH, Germany).\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) of clinical\nspecimens (n=21) including throat swabs, oral\nfluid, and urine, was performed at the National\nInstitute for Public Health and the Environment\n(RIVM) in the Netherlands, and at the Health\nProtection Agency (HPA), Centre for Infections, in the United Kingdom (UK).\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\nBetween 1 Oct 2007 and 2 Mar 2008, a total of 14\n729 mumps cases were notified in the Republic of\nMoldova. Case notifications increased rapidly in\nthe weeks following the holidays around New\nYear's Day. The outbreak is ongoing at the time\nof writing this report, with a peak of 2096 cases\nin week 9 of 2008 (Figure 1). The monthly\nincidence increased from below one case per 100\n000 population in the months preceding the\noutbreak to 25 case per 100 000 in December 2007\nand more than 170 cases per 100 000 in February\n2008 [Illustrated diagrammatically in the original text].\n\nCase description\n----------------\nThe majority of cases (n=11 128; 80 percent) were\n15 to 24 years old (birth cohorts 1983-1992), and\n60 percent (n=8298) were male [illustrated\ndiagrammatically in the original text. By the end\nof February, all regions of the Republic of\nMoldova were affected by the outbreak.\n\nVaccination data were available for 67 percent\n(9223 of 13 853 cases) and 96 percent of them had\nbeen vaccinated. Of these, 96 percent had\nreceived one dose of mumps vaccine and 4 percent had received 2 doses.\n\nIn total, 5649 cases (41 percent) were\nhospitalised for epidemiological (isolation) and\nclinical indications, and where care was not\navailable (e.g., students living in dormitories).\nInformation about complications was not available\nat the national level. No deaths have been reported.\n\nOf 367 serum samples taken from clinical cases\n(one to 28 days after onset of parotid swelling),\n234 (64 percent) were positive for anti-mumps IgM\nat the NSPCPM. 313 of the 367 sera were collected\n8 to 28 days after disease onset, 68 percent of\nwhich were positive. The highest proportion of\npositive results was found in the sera collected\nbetween 11 and 20 days after disease onset (72\npercent). Of 21 case sera tested with PCR at RIVM\n(3 cases) and HPA (18 cases), 20 were positive\nfor mumps virus. The identified genotype G5 has\nrecently been found in several other countries\nincluding Croatia, Denmark, Germany, the UK,\nCanada, and the United States (US) (personal\ncommunication with Dr K. Brown/Dr L. Jin, HPA).\n\nPublic health measures\n----------------------\nFor this outbreak, the NSPCPM recommended\nhospitalisation for epidemiologic indications of\nthose cases for whom isolation was not guaranteed\nat home, particularly for cases living in\ndormitories and boarding schools. Recommended\nisolation was 10 days from onset of parotid swelling.\n\nIn January 2008, the Ministry of Health and the\nNSPCPM initiated the procurement of 600 000 doses\nof MMR vaccine for a Supplemental Immunisation\nActivity (SIA). As of 6 Mar 2008, a total of 42\n500 doses had arrived in the Republic of Moldova\nand were distributed to health facilities. The\nSIA began in week 9 of 2008 targeting individuals\nin all settings born between 1989 and 1994\n(including pupils, students and postgraduate\nstudents in all educational institutions;\nteaching staff born between 1984 and 1988; army,\npolice, and border troops). Information on the\ntotal number of MMR vaccine doses administered to\ndate during the SIA is not available.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe Republic of Moldova is facing a large ongoing\nmumps outbreak in teenagers and young adults, the\nmajority of whom have previously been vaccinated\nwith one dose of monovalent mumps vaccine. Mumps\noutbreaks comparable to this one with respect to\nsize and affected age group have occurred\nrecently in several countries, including the UK,\nthe US, and Canada. In the outbreak in the UK\n[1,2,3], 79 percent of cases in 2004 occurred in\nindividuals born between 1980-1989. Almost 2-3rds\nof the cases were unvaccinated, however, 30\npercent had received a single dose of MMR. In the\noutbreaks in the US and Canada [4], 49 percent of\nthe cases had been vaccinated twice. Mumps\nvaccine failure has often been attributed to\nprimary vaccine failure; i.e., an insufficient\nimmune response after vaccination [5]. More\nrecent studies have suggested that secondary\nvaccine failure, i.e., decreasing antibody titres\nover time (waning immunity), contributes to the\nrecurrence of mumps outbreaks [6,7]. In the\ncurrent outbreak, the high reported vaccine\ncoverage with a single dose of mumps vaccine\namong the cases suggests that 'failure to\nvaccinate' did not play a major role as the cause\nof the outbreak. Primary and secondary vaccine\nfailure [5,8] for one dose of mumps vaccine are\ncurrently being investigated in a further epidemiological study.\n\nA high proportion of cases in this outbreak were\nhospitalised, mainly to ensure isolation but also\nfor clinical and social indications. However, as\nmumps is most infectious from 2 days before to 4\ndays after onset of illness, and inapparent\ninfections can be communicable, hospital\nadmission is not expected to prevent the majority\nof transmission in the population [9].\n\nOutbreak control is ongoing with vaccination of\nhigh risk groups with MMR vaccine, consistent\nwith a recent WHO position paper on mumps [10].\nTo address potential concerns of adverse events\nfollowing immunisation (AEFI), AEFI surveillance\nincluding laboratory investigation of suspected\nmeningitis cases and training of primary health\ncare staff and epidemiologists will accompany this immunisation campaign.\n\n[Byline: H Bernard (<BernardH@rki.de>)*1,2\nNG Schwarz*3,4\nA Melnic5\nV Bucov5\nN Caterinciuc5\nR Pebody4,6\nMN Mulders7\nC Aidyralieva7, S Hahn7,8\n* first authors\n\n1.

The highly infectious disease has been diagnosed in at\nleast 8 students in the past 2 weeks, with more cases likely. All\nlived in the same student accommodation, which houses about 180\npeople. Health authorities have advised the unidentified university\non isolating those affected and have offered mumps vaccine to all\nunvaccinated residents.\nMumps in adults is an uncommon condition which in rare cases can lead\nto meningitis, hearing loss and sterility. Health Department acting\nchief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips said the disease could\ntake up to 3 weeks to become evident after being exposed.

Most of\nthose affected have been overseas students aged 18 to 24.\nSymptoms include swelling of the sides of the face and jaw line.\nInflammation of the testicles occurs in about 20 per cent of adult\nmale cases and inflammation of the ovaries in 5 per cent of adult\nfemales. Almost 1/3rd of people will have mild or no symptoms but\nwill still be infectious. These apparently well students could be\ninfecting others who will not show signs of the disease for a\nfortnight or more.\nProfessor Phillips said none of the ill students had required\nhospital treatment. 'That's a quite uncommon complication,' he said.\n'Most people have a self-limited, slightly unpleasant illness, no\nresidual effects.' He said many were not fully protected because they\nreceived only one of the required 2 courses of vaccine in childhood.\nAlthough more than 50 doses of vaccine had since been administered to\nstudents, it will take weeks for them to develop immunity. SA has\nrecorded 11 mumps cases this year [2007], compared with 20 for all of\nlast year.

Dr Shelly\nSarwal, the province's medical officer of health, said last week that\nbetween 10 and 20 new cases have been reported each week since the outbreak\nstarted in February, with a jump since students went back to class.\n\nSince schools reopened in September there have been 129 new cases in the\nprovince. The increase was not unexpected because a second round of\nvaccinations has yet to fully kick in, Dr Sarwal said. In July, the\nprovince announced Nova Scotia's post-secondary and Grade 12 students would\nbe offered a second dose of mumps, measles and rubella vaccine.\n\nThe mumps can be spread through coughing, sneezing and exchanging of saliva\nthrough kissing or sharing drinks. Symptoms include aches, pains, fever and\nloss of appetite. In extreme cases, mumps can lead to meningitis,\ninflammation of the testicles or ovaries, hearing loss and, according to\nthe Canadian Medical Association Journal, reduced male fertility.\n\nDr Sarwal said last week it could be weeks before the mumps outbreak is\nbrought under control.

This year, a mumps outbreak centred in the Maritime province has\naffected 9 Canadian provinces, and revealed gaps in MMR (mumps, measles and\nrubella) triple vaccine coverage.\n\nIn the early 1950s, an average of 34 000 cases of mumps were reported each\nyear. By the late 1990s, the average number of cases had declined to less\nthan 400 per year. Occurrence of the disease declined further following the\nintroduction in 1996-97 of a second dose of the MMR vaccine for measles\ncontrol. The second dose was introduced for children at either 18 months of\nage or 4-6 years of age, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nIt is felt that most people over 40 have natural immunity to mumps through\nprevious exposure to the virus. It is possible, however, that individuals\nwho have not received a second dose of the vaccine dose may experience\ndiminishing levels of immunity, and may be susceptible to the virus. In\naddition, some individuals may never have been vaccinated.

And Toronto's public health officials expect the current case\ncount of 3 infections to climb before the outbreak subsides. 'I think\nwe may see more cases,' Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Director of communicable\ndisease control for Toronto Public Health, said in an interview\nTuesday 15 May 2007. That's because one of the infected young adults\nspent a number of hours last Thursday night [10 May 2007] at a\ncrowded nightspot in the city's Kensington Market neighbourhood,\nknown as the Supermarket Restaurant and Bar. 'We know it's a very\npopular place. There were probably around 300 people there, so they\nmay have been exposed to mumps,' said Yaffe.\nToronto Public Health called a news conference to [alert] both to\nyoung people who were at the bar and city doctors who may soon be\ndiagnosing a disease many would not have seen in a very long time, if\never. 'So we're saying to those people: If they develop the signs or\nsymptoms, swelling and pain in the salivary glands around the sides\nof their cheeks, fever, headache, muscle pains, aches, fatigue, or\nloss of appetite, they should [consult their doctor],' Yaffe said.\nShe urged people who believe they may have mumps not to go to their\ndoctor without calling first, so that arrangements can be made to\nensure other people aren't exposed to a potential case.\n'We're also telling people in general, and particularly in that age\ngroup -- the university age group -- to try and modify their\nbehaviour; to do less sharing of saliva. You know, don't share\ndrinks. Don't share water bottles. Because that is a great way of\nspreading infections, including mumps.'\nAs of May 11 2007 -- the most recent date for which national numbers\nare available -- the Public Health Agency of Canada was reporting 271\ncases. But those numbers are already out of date. A spokesperson for\nthe Ontario Ministry of Health said on Tuesday [11 May 2007], that\nthe province now has 9 confirmed cases, up from the 8 in the public\nhealth agency's report.\nThere are other discrepancies. British Columbia has stated it had a\ncase, in a student who has recovered and returned to Nova Scotia. But\nthe public health agency doesn't include that case in its tally\nbecause it doesn't meet the national definition. According to the\nagency's criteria, confirmation requires a positive lab test or a\nknown link between the suspected case and someone who tested positive\nfor mumps.\nThe public health agency reports cases in 4 provinces: Nova Scotia,\nNew Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Ontario. The vast majority\nof the infections -- 222 as of last Friday [11 May 2007] -- have\noccurred in Nova Scotia, where cases first started cropping up in\nHalifax in mid-to-late February [2007]. The city, which boasts a\nvibrant bar scene ideal for the spread of a disease like mumps, has\nbeen the epicentre of this outbreak.\nYaffe said 2 of the 3 Toronto cases are students who attend\nuniversity in Halifax who came home at the end of the school year.\nThe 3rd was a person exposed to one of the 2 cases.\nUniversity aged young adults make up the majority of the cases. They\nappear to be at greatest risk because they would have only received\none dose of measles, mumps, and vaccine rubella (MMRV) in childhood.\nWhile one dose protected a great number of people, in some people it\nwasn't sufficient to prevent infection; since the mid-1990s, 2 doses\nhave been given. But even 2 doses don't always prevent infection.\nYaffe said one of Toronto's cases had 2 shots of MMR vaccine in childhood.\nSymptoms of mumps include aches, pains, fever, loss of appetite and,\nin about 40 percent of cases, the hugely swollen saliva glands that\ngive mumps its characteristic chipmunk-cheek look. In males past\npuberty the virus can also infect one or both testicles, leading to a\npainful condition known as orchitis. Mumps in both testicles can\nresult in sterility. Other potential, if rare, side effects include\nmeningitis and encephalitis. and women who become infected during the\n1st trimester of pregnancy are at increased risk of miscarrying.\n'It's generally a benign childhood disease -- that's what we think\nof,' said Yaffe.

A week ago [6 May 2007], there were 203 confirmed\ncases of the virus in Nova Scotia.\nDr. Shelly Sarwal, the province's medical officer of health, said the\nvaccination program will help the maintain health services in the\nprovince. 'We feel this is an important public health measure,' Sarwal\nsaid in a news release. 'A vaccination campaign will not stop the\noutbreak, but what it will do is help to manage absenteeism in health-care\nworkers as a result of mumps, and therefore help sustain the health-care\nsystem for Nova Scotians.'\nSince the beginning of the outbreak in February [2007], 222 cases of mumps\nhave been reported across Nova Scotia - and the disease is continuing its\ntrack into other provinces. New Brunswick reported on Friday [11 May 2007]\nthat its case load had jumped to 40, up from 34 a week earlier. Prince\nEdward Island remained unchanged at one confirmed case.\nOntario health officials said there are now 8 confirmed cases in the\nprovince, up from 3 a week ago [6 May 2007]. Of those, 6 are university\nstudents in Nova Scotia who recently returned home to Ontario for the\nsummer. The other 2 cases are adults who had been travelling in the\nAtlantic province.\nWhile the number of new cases in the Halifax region is declining,\nelsewhere across the province cases were up from last week [6-12 May\n2007]. Health officials predicted the decline in the Halifax area as\nuniversity students, where the outbreak is believed to have begun,\nreturned home for the summer. Public health officials said they spoke this\nweek with their counterparts in the United States and the United Kingdom\nabout lessons learned from management of mumps outbreaks in those\ncountries.\nNova Scotia is also looking at an immunization program for the\nuniversity-age population. People are being advised to watch for patients\nwith mumps-like symptoms. These include aches, pains, fever, loss of\nappetite and, in about 40 percent of cases, the hugely swollen saliva\nglands that give mumps its characteristic chipmunk-cheek look.\nThe Nova Scotia outbreak, which began in the 3 week of February [2007], is\nthe province's 3rd in 2 years. It is by far the largest; the earlier\noutbreaks, in 2005, involved 13 and 19 cases respectively. It has been\nfuelled by a pool of susceptible young adults. Sarwal has said authorities\nbelieve many of the province's cases were vaccinated with MMR [measles,\nmumps, rubella] in childhood, but received only one dose. The one-dose\nschedule for the MMR vaccine was adequate to protect many people. If it\nhad not been, this outbreak would be much larger. But it's now known one\ndose doesn't protect everyone and MMR is now given in 2 doses. University\ndormitories and crowded student apartments make for easy spread of the\nvirus among susceptible young adults. When they move home, however, they\nspend more time around adults, most of whom would have had mumps in\nchildhood and would be immune.\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 12 May 2007\nSource: globeandmail.com, Canadian Press report, Sat 12 May 2007 [edited]\n<http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070512.MUMPSCASE12/TPStory/National>\n\nNova Scotian health-care workers to be immunized; 1st case in British\nColumbia\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nWith the number of mumps cases rising in the province, the Nova Scotian\ngovernment announced yesterday it will begin immunizing thousands of\nhealth-care workers against the virus as early as next week [14-19 May\n2007]. As of yesterday [Fri 11 May 2007], 222 confirmed cases had been\nreported in Nova Scotia, up 19 from 203 the previous week. Shelly Sarwal,\nthe province's medical officer of health, said about 40 000 doses of the\nmeasles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine are being made available on a\nvoluntary basis to health-care workers, with the aim of protecting health\nservices in the province. 'Providing this vaccine now to health-care\nworkers isn't going to do much for the current outbreak,' Dr. Sarwal said\nin an interview yesterday. 'It's for preventing future outbreaks similar\nto this and for making sure that our population is properly immunized. The\npurpose of this program is to maintain our health-care system and the\nstaffing within the health-care system,' she said. 'We do have some\nhealth-care workers who have been diagnosed with the mumps who are off of\nwork.'\nAbout 900 of the province's 30 000-plus health providers have been exposed\nto mumps, and currently 130 are off the job, she said. Any worker who has\ncome into contact with an infected person could potentially be off work\nfor 2 weeks or more because the incubation period for the virus is 14 to\n25 days. 'We have to be extra cautious within the health-care system,' Dr.\nSarwal added. 'I can't take the chance of a health-care worker\ntransmitting the infection to a patient.'\nWhile the number of new cases in the Halifax region is declining,\nelsewhere across Nova Scotia cases were up from last week[6-12 May 2007].\nThe Nova Scotia mumps outbreak began in February [2007], likely among\nuniversity-aged students with inadequate immunity to the virus. Cases have\nbegun springing up elsewhere in Canada, as those exposed to the disease\nreturn to their home provinces.

Prince Edward Island remained unchanged at one confirmed\ncase. Manitoba and Saskatchewan report no mumps cases, while Alberta has 3\ncases for the year, but they are among unimmunized, international\ntravellers and unrelated to the Nova Scotia outbreak.

Mumps is an\nacute viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms include fever,\nheadache, muscle ache, and swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands\nat the angle of the jaw (parotid glands). Infection occurs through direct\ncontact with respiratory droplets from the nose or throat, through saliva,\ncoughing, sneezing, sharing drinks, kissing, or from contact with any\nsurface that has been contaminated with the mumps virus. Rarely, mumps\ninfection can lead to meningitis, inflammation of the testicles or ovaries,\ninflammation of the pancreas, and transient or permanent hearing loss.\nAs of 4 May 2007, 241 confirmed cases of mumps had been reported from the 4\naffected provinces.\nTable: Age and sex distribution of confirmed* mumps cases reported in 4\nCanadian provinces, 4 May 2007 (N=241):\nProvince / number / median age / percentage males\nNova Scotia / 203 / 22 / 45\nNew Brunswick / 34 / 21 / 44\nPrince Edward Island / 1 / 18 / 100\nOntario / 3 / 29 / 100\n* Confirmed cases include both laboratory-confirmed and clinical cases\n(latter are epi-linked to laboratory-confirmed cases).\nIn Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the majority of cases were reported from\nonly one or 2 public health authorities with limited activity seen\nelsewhere in these provinces. About 90 per cent and 25 per cent of the\ncases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick respectively, are associated with\nuniversity settings. The viral strain in these outbreaks is identical to\nthe strain (genotype G) detected from the 2005-06 Nova Scotia outbreaks,\nthe United States' multistate outbreak in 2006, and the United Kingdom\nepidemic between 2004 and 2006. The Ontario cases are all linked to cases\nin the Maritimes.\nInformation on date of onset is known for 217 of the 241 confirmed mumps\ncases reported, and is displayed as a histogram in the original text. The\nremaining 24 cases are pending or missing dates of onset.\nThe majority of cases are occurring among university-aged individuals. The\nreason for the particular susceptibility among this cohort is\nmultifactorial. The very social and mobile lifestyle of this age group\nappears to be facilitating disease transmission and is posing barriers to\nthe adherence of isolation requests. Communication efforts are increasing\nas the post-secondary academic year [ends] and students disperse.\nAdditional cases in this demographic group and possibly other jurisdictions\nwould not be unexpected. However, during previous outbreaks in Canada, this\nhas not resulted in sustained transmission or large outbreaks.\nIt is assumed that most people over the age of about 40 years have natural\nimmunity to mumps. Most people between the ages of 12 and 17 years\n(depending on the province of residence) have had 2 doses of mumps vaccine\ndue to the introduction of a second dose of measles, mumps and rubella\n(MMR) vaccine for measles control in 1996-97. This has left a susceptible\ncohort of people between the approximate ages of 12 or 17 (depending on the\nprovince or territory) and 40 years who were only eligible for one dose of\nMMR vaccine and who are not assumed to have natural immunity. It is\nimportant to note, that the age at which natural immunity to mumps can be\nassumed is not known with certainty and that some individuals born prior to\n1970 may still be susceptible to mumps.\nThe 2004 national immunization coverage survey (NICS) found that 94 per\ncent of Canadian children had received single dose of the MMR vaccine by\ntheir 2nd birthday. Coverage estimates for the 2nd dose of MMR by 7 years\nof age was 79 per cent. Finally, 93 per cent of Canadians had received one\nor more doses of mumps vaccine by their 17th birthday.\nPublic health actions\n---------------------\n[See Mumps, Canada (multi-province) 20070505.1459]\nDue to a risk of exposure to measles, NACI currently recommends a 2nd dose\nof the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) for certain adults born\nafter 1970.

Given that the original\nNova Scotia outbreak was largely focussed on college students, it is\nnot surprising that the disease has spread to other provinces as\nclasses have ended and students are travelling back to their home towns.\nCBS News reported in a Fri 4 May [2007] update that health officials\nare considering a re-vaccination campaign for mumps. The province of\nNova Scotia and the Public Health Agency of Canada are looking at\nre-immunizing people against mumps.\nNova Scotia has experienced 203 cases of mumps since February [2007],\nincluding about 50 new cases that have surfaced since last week\n[23-27 Apr 2007], public health officials said on Fri 4 May 2007. New\nBrunswick and Prince Edward Island have also reported cases, mainly\namong young adults in their 20s. Half a dozen cases of mumps have\nspread as far as Ontario.\nMumps is a highly infectious disease that is spread by coughing,\nsneezing, sharing drinks or kissing. Many of the cases spread through\ndowntown bars in Halifax and on the campus of Dalhousie University,\nhealth officials said.\nSince exams wrapped up about 2 weeks ago [20 Apr 2007], most students\nhave left campus and the disease seems to be receding, said Marla\nCranston, a Dalhousie spokeswoman. The province is talking about a\nnew immunization program for university-aged students and health-care\nworkers, said Dr. Shelly Sarwal, a medical officer of health with the\nNova Scotia health department.

Previously, officials\nin the province had said that any catch-up campaign -- designed to\ngive a 2nd dose of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to\nyoung adults who only received one in childhood -- would need to be\ndone in conjunction with other provinces and territories.\n'Ideally, we'd have the whole country moving together. And we're\nstill working with the other provinces and with the Public Health\nAgency (of Canada),' said Dr. Shelly Sarwal, a medical officer of\nhealth for the province. 'But, Nova Scotia's going to have to take\nsome steps to protect Nova Scotians.'\nThis week, there was a significant jump in cases in Nova Scotia, to\n203 from 157, with mumps now being reported in all 9 health regions\nin the province. As of yesterday [4 May 2007], New Brunswick reported\n34 cases and Prince Edward Island remains at one confirmed case. For\nthe 1st time the outbreak has moved out of the Maritimes to Central\nCanada, a development public health officials had warned might occur\nas the university year ended and Halifax students dispersed to their\nhomes throughout the Maritimes and beyond.\nDavid Jensen, a spokesperson with Ontario's Ministry of Health and\nLong-term Care, said the province's 3 confirmed cases -- in the\nOttawa, York and Waterloo public health units -- can all be linked to\nthe Nova Scotia outbreak. Test results are still pending on 5\nsuspected cases. Jensen said physicians and public health officials\nin the province should keep mumps in mind if they see patients who\nhave mumps-like symptoms. These include aches, pains, fever, loss of\nappetite and, in about 40 percent of cases, the hugely swollen saliva\nglands that give mumps its characteristic chipmunk-cheek look.\nThe Nova Scotia outbreak, which began in the 3rd week of February\n[2007], is the province's 3rd in 2 years. It is by far the largest;\nthe earlier outbreaks, in 2005, involved 13 and 19 cases\nrespectively. It is fuelled by a pool of susceptible young adults.\nSarwal said authorities believe many of the province's cases were\nvaccinated with MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] in childhood,\nbut received only one dose. The one-dose schedule for the MMR vaccine\nwas adequate to protect many people. If it had not been, this\noutbreak would be much larger. But it's now known one dose doesn't\nprotect everyone; MMR is now given in two doses. Nova Scotia is\nleaning heavily towards topping up those it considers susceptible to the virus.\n'We are looking more seriously at instituting our vaccination\nprograms. An extra dose of MMR for the at-risk groups, which in this\ncase is 2: university students and health-care workers,' Sarwal said.\nThe vaccination campaign likely can't be mounted quickly enough to\nstamp out this outbreak, but could help prevent additional epidemics, she said.\nThe incubation period for mumps is 12 to 25 days. University\ndormitories and crowded student apartments make for easy spread of\nthe virus among susceptible young adults.\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail copy editor Ed Prucha <edprucha@midcoast.com>\n[These reports record a significant increase in number of mumps cases\namong students in the Maritime provinces of Canada; and more\nsignificantly, the geographical spread of the outbreak to Central\nCanada is noted.

Cases have\nbeen confirmed from throat swabs and urine specimens of persons\nmeeting the clinical case definition using RT-PCR [ref 1].\nOutbreak Description:\nThe 1st case was reported to PHS on [25 Feb 2007]. By [28 Feb 2007],\n5 additional cases had been identified. Epidemiologic investigation\nof that initial cluster revealed that the majority of cases (4/6)\noccurred in local university students. These students all attended\nthe same event at a local establishment on [11 Feb 2007], as did a\nknown mumps case from outside of Nova Scotia. This imported case\nappears to have been the source of infection for those 4 students,\nand the index case for the wider outbreak. Subsequent cases have\noccurred mostly in university students. Epidemiologic links to\nconfirmed cases have been evident in nearly all subsequent cases thus far.\nPreliminary analysis of the 25 cases analyzed so far reveals that the\naverage age of the cases is 24.3 years old (mean 20.8; range 6-50).\n64 percent of cases (16/25) have been male. Five cases have had no\nhistory of mumps in childhood or MMR vaccine; 15 cases report having\nhad one MMR, and 2 cases have been confirmed as having had 2 doses of\nMMR vaccine. Vaccine status for the remaining 3 cases is unknown. 20\nof the cases have occurred in university students. No unusual\npresentations of mumps or complications of mumps have occurred in\ncases presenting to this point.\nOutbreak control measures have included:\n- Aggressive contact tracing for each lab-confirmed case, including\nhousehold and intimate contacts as well as casual contacts through\nworkplace, recreational, social, and school settings.\n- Isolation of cases for 9 days post symptom onset (as opposed to the\n5 days used by some authorities)\n- Identification of susceptible contacts via serology; this has\nresulted in 2 non-immune persons quarantined for 25 days to prevent\npossible transmission of disease to high-risk groups.\nVaccine has not been used for outbreak control at this time.\nBackground:\nMeasles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced in Nova Scotia in\n1975 as a single dose to children 12 to 15 months of age. In 1996 a\n2nd dose was added for children 4 to 6 years of age as part of a\nCanadian strategy against measles. Since this time, fewer than 2\ncases of mumps are reported annually in Nova Scotia, most of which\noccur in un-immunized populations [ref 2].\nHalifax is an international port city and home to 6 post-secondary\ninstitutions. Of the city's 370 000 inhabitants, approximately 50 000\nare believed to fall within the age range affected by the recent\noutbreaks, namely ages 15-25 [ref 3]. Vaccine coverage rates have\nbeen high, with our records showing 94-96 percent of children having\nreceived their 2nd dose of MMR just prior to entering elementary\nschool. However, many current university students were born prior to\n1990, and so there remains a large part of this cohort that has\nreceived only one dose of vaccine.\nThis is the 3rd outbreak in the Halifax area in the past 2 years. The\nHalifax outbreaks have occurred in both a doubly vaccinated cohort of\nadolescents and a singly vaccinated cohort of young adults [ref 4].\nThe nature of these outbreaks raises questions as to the efficacy of\nthe MMR vaccine in each of these cohorts. While the Jeryl-Lynn (JL)\nstrain, used in Canada since 1988, is thought to induce antibodies in\n95 percent of people after one dose, recent studies have estimated\nthe efficacy of a single dose to be less than 70 percent [refs. 5,6].\nPrimary vaccine failure has been suggested as a cause of our\noutbreaks and of the similar outbreak in the US Midwest in 2006 [ref\n7]. However, field studies suggest that reductions in vaccine\nefficacy likely reflect a combination of both primary and secondary\nfailure of the mumps component of the MMR vaccine [ref 6].\nUnfortunately, lot numbers for the administered vaccines have not\nbeen available for review during our outbreaks. Our experience with\nvaccine administration and handling errors in physician offices here\nleads us to believe that these issues may also have led to a degree\nof 'failure' contributing to our outbreaks.\nAn ongoing challenge in this outbreak remains the very social and\nmobile nature of university students. Indeed, preliminary results of\na social network analysis here have supported our hypothesis that\ndisease is being spread as much by the off-campus or 'extra\ncurricular' activities of students as by their on-campus activities.\nThe newspaper reports, including the reports picked up by ProMED,\nhave been part of media strategy designed to alert persons to the\npossibility of mumps in our community and to encourage people to\nrefrain from socializing until they see a physician, as well as to\nrefrain from socializing until they are no longer infectious (e.g.\n'stay home while you are sick'). Resources for communicable disease\ncontrol in this part of Canada are limited by comparison to larger\nprovinces, and so enforcement of isolation and quarantine has proven\ndifficult. Analysis of additional options for outbreak management,\nincluding use of vaccine, is ongoing.\n1. World Health Organization.

The newspaper reports, including the reports picked up by ProMED,\nhave been part of media strategy designed to alert persons to the\npossibility of mumps in our community and to encourage people to\nrefrain from socializing until they see a physician, as well as to\nrefrain from socializing until they are no longer infectious (e.g.\n'stay home while you are sick'). A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Our experience with\nvaccine administration and handling errors in physician offices here\nleads us to believe that these issues may also have led to a degree\nof 'failure' contributing to our outbreaks.\n Five cases have had no\nhistory of mumps in childhood or MMR vaccine; 15 cases report having\nhad one MMR, and 2 cases have been confirmed as having had 2 doses of\nMMR vaccine. \nPrimary vaccine failure has been suggested as a cause of our\noutbreaks and of the similar outbreak in the US Midwest in 2006 [ref\n7]. Vaccine coverage rates have\nbeen high, with our records showing 94-96 percent of children having\nreceived their 2nd dose of MMR just prior to entering elementary\nschool. Outbreak control measures have included:\n- Aggressive contact tracing for each lab-confirmed case, including\nhousehold and intimate contacts as well as casual contacts through\nworkplace, recreational, social, and school settings. While the Jeryl-Lynn (JL)\nstrain, used in Canada since 1988, is thought to induce antibodies in\n95 percent of people after one dose, recent studies have estimated\nthe efficacy of a single dose to be less than 70 percent [refs. Indeed, preliminary results of\na social network analysis here have supported our hypothesis that\ndisease is being spread as much by the off-campus or 'extra\ncurricular' activities of students as by their on-campus activities. Resources for communicable disease\ncontrol in this part of Canada are limited by comparison to larger\nprovinces, and so enforcement of isolation and quarantine has proven\ndifficult. Nova Scotia Health Promotion and Protection\nc/o Public Health Services, Capital District Health Authority\nUnit 4, 201 Brownlow Ave.\n However, field studies suggest that reductions in vaccine\nefficacy likely reflect a combination of both primary and secondary\nfailure of the mumps component of the MMR vaccine [ref 6]. Since this time, fewer than 2\ncases of mumps are reported annually in Nova Scotia, most of which\noccur in un-immunized populations [ref 2]. No unusual\npresentations of mumps or complications of mumps have occurred in\ncases presenting to this point. Background:\nMeasles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced in Nova Scotia in\n1975 as a single dose to children 12 to 15 months of age. Vandermeulen C, Roelants M, Vermoere M, Roseeuw K, Goubau P,\nHoppenbrouwers K. Outbreak of mumps in a vaccinated child population:\na question of vaccine failure? Cases have\nbeen confirmed from throat swabs and urine specimens of persons\nmeeting the clinical case definition using RT-PCR [ref 1]. However, many current university students were born prior to\n1990, and so there remains a large part of this cohort that has\nreceived only one dose of vaccine. The\nHalifax outbreaks have occurred in both a doubly vaccinated cohort of\nadolescents and a singly vaccinated cohort of young adults [ref 4]. The\neffectiveness of the mumps component of the MMR vaccine: a case\ncontrol study. Of the city's 370 000 inhabitants, approximately 50 000\nare believed to fall within the age range affected by the recent\noutbreaks, namely ages 15-25 [ref 3]. Epidemiologic investigation\nof that initial cluster revealed that the majority of cases (4/6)\noccurred in local university students. These students all attended\nthe same event at a local establishment on [11 Feb 2007], as did a\nknown mumps case from outside of Nova Scotia. This imported case\nappears to have been the source of infection for those 4 students,\nand the index case for the wider outbreak.

The illnesses occurred between 5 Jan and\n24 Feb 2007 and were epidemiologically related and laboratory-confirmed.\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\nBlood samples taken from 2 patients diagnosed with salivary gland\ninflammation tested positive for mumps-specific IgM at the national\nreference laboratory on 28 Feb 2007. On the following day, an\nepidemiological investigation was carried out in the village the\npatients came from.\nThis established that the 1st case in this outbreak had returned home\non 22 Dec 2006 from the town of Berehove in Ukraine, near the border\nwith Hungary, where he had previously worked for 8 months. He\ndeveloped symptoms on 5 Jan 2007. During January and February 2006,\nmore inhabitants of the village presented with symptoms such as fever\nor elevated temperature and unilateral or bilateral swelling of the\nparotid gland. The patients were aged between 22 and 31 years and\nwere connected with one another through family, friends or work\nrelations. By 15 Mar 2007, 9 mumps cases had been identified\nretrospectively through an epidemiological link and laboratory confirmation.\nAll 9 patients were treated either by a local family doctor or at an\nemergency ward on duty in the nearest town. Two patients were\nreferred further to an infectious diseases specialist. The 1st\nclinical diagnosis in 5 cases was mumps, in 2 cases salivary gland\ninflammation, in one case conjunctivitis and acute pharyngitis, and\nin one case infra-auricular lymphadenitis.\nThe serological analysis performed at the national reference\nlaboratory confirmed all 9 cases to be mumps infection. By the time\nof the epidemiological investigation, however, all patients had\nalready recovered. According to the patient history, none of the\npatients have been previously vaccinated against mumps.\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe above example shows that the mumps virus circulation in a group\nof closely interrelated susceptible individuals can trigger a local\noutbreak. In 2003, comparable outbreaks affecting a similar number of\ncases were reported in close communities of unvaccinated people\n(student houses, schools).\nThe childhood vaccination coverage for mumps in Hungary is high, so\nthe risk of infection is predominantly by virus importation. The\npresent outbreak could have been avoided had the 1st cases been\ncorrectly diagnosed. In Hungary, laboratory testing of all suspected\nmumps cases has been mandatory since September 2006.\nIn the outbreak described here, only the cases with manifest parotid\nswelling have been identified; no wider investigation of other\npossible symptoms and complications has been carried out. In general,\nmumps is a mild and self-limited viral infection; an estimated 1/3rd\nof infections are asymptomatic. However, mumps infection can lead to\nserious complications, such as meningitis, of which a small\npercentage can progress to encephalitis. In addition, mumps causes\nunilateral or bilateral orchitis in approximately 20-30 percent\npost-pubertal males. It is therefore very important to prevent the\nvirus from circulating in groups of young adults.\nBackground information\n----------------------\nThe trivalent measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) was introduced\nin Hungary in March 1991. As a result, the MMR vaccination coverage\nin children born after 1 Jan 1990 is more than 98 percent. Between\n1993 and 1996, follow-up vaccination campaigns were carried out\ntargeting cohorts born between 1 Jun 1985 and 31 Dec 1989. The\nrevaccination started in 1999 at 11 years, and, therefore, cohorts\nborn after 1 Jun 1987 should have been vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR\nvaccine. The present routine childhood immunization schedule uses the\nMMR vaccine given as a 1st dose at 15 months of age, and as a 2nd\ndose at 11 years of age.\nSince 1973, mumps has been a mandatory notifiable disease in Hungary.\nBetween 1973 and 1990, there were 20 000 to 50 000 mumps cases\nregistered per year. After the introduction of the universal\nvaccination program in 1991, the incidence began to decrease slowly;\n2000 cases were registered in 1994, and 500 cases in 1995. Between\n1996 and 2001, the number of cases reported per year ranged from 180\nto 240, whereas between 2002 and 2005 the number of reported cases\nwas around 100 per year.\nReferences\n----------\nLocal mumps outbreak in Hungary, 2007.

This number includes\nlaboratory-confirmed and probable epidemiologically-linked clinical\ncases in line with the EU case definition and case classification\nthat have been adopted for mumps surveillance purposes in Bulgaria\nsince 2005 [1].\nFor comparison, only 22 cases were reported in the 1st 11 weeks of\n2005, and 311 cases were registered in the same period in 2006.\nAltogether, 608 cases were notified in 2005, and 919 cases were\nreported during 2006. An increase of the number of reported cases was\nnoted already in 2006, and since the beginning of 2007, the number of\ncases has continued to rise. [The text at this point is supplemented\nby a figure plotting reported mumps cases during weeks 1 to 11 in\n2005 (n=22), 2006 (n=311) and 2007 (n=997)].\nThe present mumps epidemic affects mostly teenagers and young adults.\nMore than 60 percent of the cases reported in 2007 occurred in\npatients aged 15 to 19 years, and about 20 percent in patients aged\n20 to 24 years. To date, 112 out of 997 cases (11.2 percent) have\nbeen laboratory-confirmed.\nConclusion\n----------\nThe outbreak investigation is still ongoing, but preliminary data\nindicate that the predominance of patients in age groups 15-19 and\n20-24 years may be a result of poor immunisation of these birth\ncohorts in general. About 1/3rd of patients aged 15 to 19 years have\nnot been vaccinated at all, whereas more than half have received only\none dose of monovalent mumps vaccine strain Leningrad 3, which has\nbeen shown to have a lower effectiveness [2]. Among the 20- to\n24-year-old patients, over 90 percent have never been immunised against mumps.\nVaccination against mumps in Bulgaria started in 1972, and a routine\nmumps immunisation program was launched in 1976. However, different\nvaccine strains and vaccines have been used, and different\nimmunisation strategies implemented, including a suspension of mumps\nimmunisation for almost 4 years during the period 1982 to 1986.\nDue to the past changes in the immunisation program and occasionally\nincomplete immunisation coverage, the conditions in which outbreaks\ncan occur still exist, despite the current up-to-date mumps\nimmunisation strategy.\nControl measures\n----------------\nA risk assessment carried out following the outbreak concluded that\nbirth cohorts 1982 to 1992 that are at higher risk of mumps infection\nshould be offered supplementary mumps immunisation.\nAs a result, the Bulgarian Ministry of Health decided to provide\nsupplementary doses of MMR vaccine and to conduct immunisation\ncampaigns targeted at these cohorts. In early March 2007, the\nMinistry of Health organized a meeting to inform regional\nepidemiologists about the situation and to discuss with them the need\nfor strengthening disease surveillance and undertaking control\nmeasures to prevent further spread of mumps. Furthermore,\ncommunication aimed at the general public, conveying information\nabout the risks related to mumps infection and the preventive\nmeasures, including immunisation, has been intensified through the\nparticipation of national experts in a series of briefings, TV and\nradio broadcasts.\nA longer article on the epidemiology of mumps in Bulgaria, including\na detailed risk assessment, is planned for publication in the monthly\nrelease of Eurosurveillance.\nReferences\n----------\n(1.)

The\n1st outbreak of 19 cases was reported on 10 Aug\n[2006] in Viana, a village with a population of\n3860 people. The chain of transmission was\nthought to have begun at the summer festival in\nViana, on 22-25 Jul [2006], attended by several\nhundred inhabitants of the neighbouring villages\n[1]. In the following months, cases of mumps\noccurred throughout the entire region of Navarra,\nincluding the capital, Pamplona.\nAn increase of the number of mumps cases has been\nnoted since week 32 [5 - 11 August] of 2006,\nwhich has been linked to a series of outbreaks in\nplaces frequented by young adults [illustrated by\na histogram in the original text]. By the end of\n2006, 908 cases had been reported. In 2007 so\nfar, the incidence has continued to increase,\nwith 489 cases notified up to 2 Feb 2007. The\nhighest incidence was noted in the 2nd week of\n2007 (mid January), with 33 cases per 100 000\ninhabitants.\nThe modal age of patients was 19 years, with 82\npercent of cases occurring in patients aged\nbetween 16 and 30 years and 34 percent between 18\nand 20 years [illustrated by a histogram in the\noriginal text].\nThe following case definition was used in this outbreak:\nClinical case: Disease with sudden onset, uni- or\nbilateral facial swelling, duration of more than\n2 days and limited in time; no other apparent\ncauses.\nConfirmed case: Clinical case with\nlaboratory-confirmed virology (virus detection,\nPCR), serology (IgM positive) or epidemiological\nassociation with other confirmed cases.\nOf all reported cases, 210 (15 percent) fulfilled\nthe criteria for a laboratory-confirmed case\neither by virology or serology (IgM positive).\nThe remaining 85 percent of cases were clinically\ncompatible with mumps, and very likely to be\nconfirmed on the basis of epidemiological\nassociation, given the large scale of the\noutbreak. The epidemiological investigation,\nhowever, is still ongoing.\nCases with mild symptoms were frequent. Often the\nsymptoms lasted fewer than 5 days. Severe\ncomplications arose in 17 patients who presented\nwith orchitis (testicular inflammation) and 3\npatients who developed meningitis.\nLaboratory results\n------------------\nSerology was performed for 708 (51 percent)\ncases. Of these, 26 percent were serologically\npositive for IgM, and 74 percent were positive\nfor IgG and negative for IgM. As we do not have a\nprevious serology study for comparison, this\npattern might be due to prior vaccination failure\nsignified by a decrease of protective antibodies.\nWe considered these as non laboratory-confirmed\ncases, but we included them as part of the\noutbreak, because their clinical symptoms and the\nepidemiological context were compatible with\nmumps.\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was\nintroduced in the childhood immunisation\nprogramme in Navarra in 1982, with one dose given\nat 15 months of age. Since 1995 a 2nd dose has\nbeen added, initially given at 11 years, and\nsince 1999, at 6 years. Vaccination coverage with\n2 doses has reached more than 90 percent in all\ncohorts born after 1985. The Rubini mumps strain\nwas used in MMR vaccine in Navarra only in the\ncohorts born between 1986 and 1988 in a 2nd dose\ngiven at the age of 11 years. Vaccines produced\nusing the Rubini strain have previously been\nfound to have low efficacy [2,3,4].\nSeroepidemiological surveys show that more than\n90 percent of people born before 1975 have\nantibodies against mumps [5], acquired during a\nclinical or subclinical contact with the virus.\nIt means that most people in these cohorts are\nnaturally immunised.\nIn the recent outbreak, in 143 cases the\nvaccination history was known, 112 patients had\nreceived 2 doses of the vaccine. Almost all (138)\npatients vaccinated with at least one dose were\naged 25 years or less.\nCases in vaccinated patients can be explained\nbecause the efficacy of the MMR vaccine to\nprevent mumps is 75-91 percent [6,7]; and it is\neven lower in patients who received only one dose\nas children [8,9], especially if the mumps\ncomponent included the Rubini strain [2-4, 9,\n10]. However, vaccination with the Rubini strain\ncan explain no more than a small proportion of\ncases, since only patients aged between 18 and 20\nyears (34 percent of all cases) received this\nvaccine in the past.\nIn conclusion, several causes are thought to have\ncontributed to this outbreak. They include the\nincomplete effectiveness of the vaccine against\nmumps, the limited coverage of vaccination in the\n1st years after introduction, the unvaccinated\npopulation that had not been naturally exposed to\ninfection in childhood and the low effectiveness\nof the Rubini strain. This outbreak could also be\npartially explained by the waning immunity in\nolder vaccinated populations, as has been\nsuggested by other authors [11].\nIn order to control this outbreak, the Public\nHealth Institute of Navarra has recommended the\nfollowing measures:\n* The maintenance of high vaccination coverage\nwith 2 doses of the MMR vaccine in the childhood\nimmunisation programme;\n* The vaccination of people born after 1980\nwho have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine;\n* A specific vaccination programme for young\nadults who were born in 1986, 1987, and 1988 and\nreceived only one MMR dose with Rubini strain;\n* The home isolation of cases and vaccination\nof all contacts aged 35 or less, who have not\nreceived 2 doses of MMR vaccine and have not\npreviously been infected with mumps.\n[Byline: J Castilla, M Garc\ufffdCenoz, et al]\nReferences:\n1.

For the Suva area, there have\nbeen anecdotal reports of increasing number of mump cases occurring\nin various schools in Suva for the past 2 months.\n'Labasa Hospital has [had] an average of 120 cases for the past 12\nmonths. Lautoka Hospital reported about 30 cases in total for the\npast 2 months, and the Suva Private Hospital reported 15 cases last\nmonth [August 2006],' he said.\nHe said the reported mumps cases were based solely on clinical\nsymptoms of the patients since no blood test had been sent to Suva\nfor laboratory confirmation.\nDr. Samuela said mumps was the commonest cause of painful and swollen\nsalivary glands. 'The most prominent symptoms are the presence of\npainful swelling or lumps at the angle of the jaw. These swellings of\nthe salivary glands could be on one or both sides. Associated\nsymptoms include body aches, loss of appetite, generalized weakness,\nheadache and low grade fever,' he said. He said that panadol was a\nsuitable and effective medicine for both fever and pain relief and\nthat soft food should be given to the affected child, as chewing made\nthe pain worse.\nDr. Samuela said the child infected with mumps should be stopped from\ngoing to school until symptoms subside.\nLast week, Fiji College of General Practitioners president Doctor\nWahid Khan said children suffering from mumps should be allowed a lot\nof bed rest and not sent to school. He said that more than 50\npatients had visited his general practice seeking treatment for mumps\nand that proper care should be taken by the parents on the issue.\n'If there are more than one child living in a household whose member\nhas the virus, the sick child's utensils should be kept separately\nfrom the rest of the family, because it is a contagious disease that\ncould be passed easily from one member to another,' he said.\nHe said children suffering from mumps should wear warm clothing and\ndrink a lot of fluids with paracetamol, panadeine and codeine.\n'I have seen some boys who come with mumps and complain of pain in\nthe scrotum, and this was not good, so extra care should be taken at\nall times,' he said.\nHe said those infected with mumps should not be given orange or any\ncitrus drink to take while being infected because it could worsen the pain.\nMeanwhile, Health Ministry chief executive officer Doctor Lepani\nWaqatakirewa said the current outbreak was viral in origin and\nantibiotics such as amoxycillin are for bacterial infections.\nIn a statement reacting to the current outbreak of mumps among\nchildren, Dr. Waqatakirewa said virus and bacteria were different and\ngiving antibiotics for viral infection was a waste of medicine.\nSome parents had shown concern that their children with virus-related\ninfectious were in fact given antibiotics.\n'However, do note that in some children, there could be co-exiting\nbacterial infection in the chest or elsewhere in the body. In such\ncases, antibiotics such as amoxycillin could be prescribed,' he said.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This is the 1st ProMED report of mumps in Fiji and the 2nd in\nSoutheast Asia.

In 2005, the\nPublic Health Institute of Navarra received only 33 mumps\nnotifications for the whole region of Navarra (population 560 000).\nSince December 2005, mumps outbreaks have been reported from several\nregions of Spain [1] including the neighbouring region of La Rioja.\nAn investigation into the outbreak in Navarra was begun and\ninformation on the patients' vaccination status and possible sources\nof infection was collected in order to recommend measures to prevent\nfurther spread of mumps in the area.\nMumps is a notifiable disease in Spain and vaccination was introduced\nin 1981. A seroprevalence study for measles in Navarra in 1993 showed\nthat more than 95 percent of people between 0-34 years were\nprotected, indicating a high vaccine coverage for measles, mumps and rubella.\nSince 1995, the childhood immunisation programme has included 2 doses\nof trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, initially given\nat 15 months and 11 years of age, and since 1999, given at 15 months\nand 6 years of age. Since 1985, the annual incidence of mumps in\nSpain has decreased, although 3 epidemics have occurred, most\nrecently in 2000. Between 1996 and 1998, as in most regions of Spain,\nthe mumps component used in Navarra included the Rubini strain, and\nthis was withdrawn in 1998 because it was found to have reduced\neffectiveness [2,3].\nMethods\n-------\nA probable case was defined as a person from village A who had acute\ninflammation of the parotid glands on or after 1 Jul 2006. A\nconfirmed case was defined as a probable case with mumps IgM or an\nelevated IgG or isolation of mumps virus. The mandatory notifications\nof the region of Navarra was checked for patients fulfilling the case\ndefinition. The general practitioner who worked in the only\nhealthcare centre in village A was asked to report additional cases\nto the regional epidemiology division and to collect samples. Blood\nwas tested for IgM and IgG against mumps virus with ELISA; saliva and\nurine were tested by PCR. A telephone questionnaire was administered\nto all patients, asking them about their vaccination status, symptoms\nand activities since the 15 Jul 2006. Mumps vaccination status was\nverified through regional vaccination records and personal vaccination cards.\nResults\n-------\nA total of 19 cases was identified in village A, 10 (53 percent) of\nwhom were male. Patients' ages ranged between 18 and 37 years.\nSamples from 2 cases were laboratory tested and both were confirmed\nby serology. None of the 18 patients interviewed was admitted to\nhospital. One patient had orchitis. Symptom onset of the 18 patients\ninterviewed was between 3 to 31 August, with a peak on 8 August\n[These data are presented graphically by date of onset in the\noriginal text, which should be consulted for more detailed information].\nSix patients reported that they had never been vaccinated, and a\nfurther 2 patients reported that their vaccination status was\nunknown. Eleven patients reported having been vaccinated twice, and\nthis was verified for 10 cases. Two of these were verified through\npersonal vaccination cards only, and 2 through the regional\nvaccination records only; the remaining 6 were verified by checking\nboth records. Six of the patients who had been vaccinated twice had\nreceived 2nd dose of mumps vaccine between 1996 and 1998, when the\nRubini vaccine was being used (Table). No patients received their 1st\nMMR dose between these dates.\nTable: Vaccination history of cases of mumps during the outbreak in\nVillage A, Navarra, Spain, August 2006 (n=19).\nVaccination history / No. of cases ( percent) / Vaccine status verified\nUnvaccinated / 6 (32 percent) / 2\n1 dose / 0 (0 percent) / 0\n2 doses, date unknown / 1 (5 percent) / 0\n2 doses, 2nd <1996 or >1998 / 4 (21 percent) / 4\n2 doses, 2nd 1996-1998 / 6 (32 percent / 6\nUnknown / 2 (11 percent) / 0\nTotal / 19 (100 percent) / 12\n17 (94 percent) of the 18 patients interviewed about their activities\nsince 15 Jul 2006 reported attending the annual festival held in the\nvillage from 21 to 25 Jul 2006. These traditional festivals (fiestas)\ninclude bullfighting, processions, music, fireworks, and eating and\ndrinking special dishes. They are attended by people who live in the\nvillage and many people from neighbouring villages. Other common\nactivities reported in the interviews included visiting the swimming\npool in the village (9 cases, 50 percent) and bars in the village (10\ncases, 56 percent).\nDiscussion\n----------\nConsidering the mean incubation of 18 days, the outbreak probably\nbegan with transmission at the village festival. As we did not\nconduct an analytical study, it was not possible to identify risk\nfactors or transmission routes. The places where there was a\npossibility of close contact, and where exposure could therefore have\ntaken place, include the swimming pool, bars and the village\ncelebrations. These may well reflect the average summer activities in\nvillages in Spain.\nOur results suggest that this outbreak occurred partly because of the\npresence of susceptible people in cohorts who received a second dose\nof MMR vaccine between 1996 and 1998 with the Rubini strain, even\nthough this group had received a different vaccine strain in the\nfirst MMR dose. As the data for calculating vaccine effectiveness was\nnot collected, the precise role of the Rubini vaccine remains\nunclear. The outbreak follows the known cyclical pattern of mumps,\nand the presence of other susceptible persons (including\nnon-vaccinated people and non-responders') in the population may have\ncontributed to its occurrence.\nRecommendations\n---------------\nCases in neighbouring villages started to appear from 14 August and\nfurther spread of mumps in Navarra seemed likely. We recommended\nenhanced surveillance in schools and universities where there would\nbe people who had received the Rubini strain-containing vaccine at\nthe start of the new academic year in September. Susceptible contacts\nof the cases, including those people who had been vaccinated with the\nRubini strain, were vaccinated soon after the cases were ascertained.\nFollow up\n---------\nDespite these measures, from 1 Sep to 15 Oct 2006, 58 further cases\nof mumps were notified in different places in Navarra. As the current\nmeasures do not seem to have been effective in preventing further\nspread of mumps, further studies in Spain and in other countries that\nused the Rubini strain such as Switzerland, Italy and Portugal\n[2,4,5] are needed to investigate whether large scale vaccination\ncampaigns in people vaccinated with the Rubini strain of the vaccine\nwould be appropriate to prevent further outbreaks within a country.\nThese studies should include an estimation of the costs and side\neffects of revaccination with MMR in young adults and the amount\n(burden) of disease that can be prevented.\n(Acknowledgements: The authors would like to thank J Castilla\nCatalan, M Arriazu Berastegui and A Barricarte Gurrea from the\nEpidemiology Division of the Public Health Institute of Navarra,\nPamplona, Spain for inviting fellows of the Spanish field\nepidemiology programme (PEAC) and for their support during the study\nand the coordinators of the European Programme for Intervention\nEpidemiology Training (EPIET)and PEAC for their supervision and support.)\n(By L Gerstel1,2\n(<lissana@isciii.es>), A Lenglet1,2, M Garcia Cenoz3\n1 Spanish Field Epidemiology Programme (PEAC) and European Programme for\nIntervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET)\n2 National Centre for Epidemiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III,\nMadrid, Spain\n3 Epidemiology Division, Public Health Institute of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain)\nReferences:\n-----------\n[1] Cardenosa N, Dominguez A, Camps N, Martinez A, Torner N, Navas E\net al.

By Mon 3\nJul 2006, the outbreak was estimated to include at least 150 cases.\nAs mumps is not a notifiable disease in Austria, data protection\nissues are hindering appropriate investigation. The 3 provinces\naffected by the unusually high number of mumps cases since May 2006\nhave documented a total of 107 serologically confirmed cases,\nincluding 56 cases in Kaernten [Carinthia] (involving 7 health\ndistricts), 22 from Niederoesterreich, 19 from Wien [Vienna], and 10 cases for\nwhich the province of origin is unknown.\nThe 107 serologically confirmed cases include 2 cases of mumps\nmeningitis, 9 cases of orchitis, and 2 cases of pancreatitis. One\ncase involved a pregnant woman. The initial analysis of case data had\nsuggested that attendance at an Easter celebration on 16 Apr 2006\ncould be a common link between the initial cases in Kaernten [see the\nepidemic curve illustrated by a histogram in the original text].\nAnonymised questionnaires have been completed for 46 cases. The\nprimary case among these 46 had symptom onset on 10 Apr 2006,\nand the most recent case had symptom onset on 2 Jul 2006. The\nepidemic curve [not shown here] illustrated a propagated spread.\nAccording to the questionnaires that have so far been completed, men\nwere 1.3 times more often affected than women. Of the 46 cases, 12\n(26 percent) were admitted to hospital. All but one of these 46 cases\nwere in patients aged between 16 and 32 years (median age 23,\ninterquartile range 21-28) and one female patient (the mother of an\ninfected teenager) was 59 years old.\nThe 45 cases aged 16 to 32 years were born into birth-cohorts that\nshould have been vaccinated with at least one dose of mumps vaccine\nin the years from 1974 to 1990. In our initial report, we\nhypothesised that teenagers and young adults born before 1994 had\neither not been vaccinated or had been vaccinated with one dose only.\nOnly 4 of the 46 cases (9 percent) had received 2 vaccine doses.\nFourteen cases (30 percent) received only one dose, and 25 cases (54\npercent) were unvaccinated; in 3 cases, vaccination status was\nunknown. A bivalent mumps-measles (MM) vaccine provided by Merck\nSharp & Dohme was introduced in Austria in 1974, and was replaced in\n1994 by the trivalent mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\nReliable data on vaccination coverage for MMR in Austria are not\navailable. Since 31 May, MMR vaccine has been offered to the\npopulation of Kaernten (population approximately 550 000) by local\nhealth authorities, physicians and hospitals. Approximately 1200\npeople have so far been vaccinated.\nA final analysis of the outbreak will be published soon.\n(From D Schmid1, A-M Pichler1, H Wallenko2, H Holzmann3, T\nPopow-Kraupp3, F Allerberger1 (<franz.allerberger@ages.at>) 1-\nOesterreichische Agentur fuer Gesundheit und Ernaehrungssicherheit,\nVienna, Austria;2 - Landessanitaetsdirektion Kaernten, Klagenfurt,\nAustria; and 3 - Institute of Virology, Medical University of Vienna,\nVienna, Austria\nReference\n---------\n(1) Schmid D, Pichler A-M, Wallenko H, Holzmann H, Allerberger F.\nMumps outbreak affecting adolescents and young adults in Austria,\n2006.

More than 600 cases have been reported in Illinois\nthis year. Prior to 2006, Illinois averaged about10 mumps cases per year.\nDuPage County averages from zero to 3 mumps cases per year over the past 5\nyears.\nIf a person is vaccinated against mumps, his or her risk of getting mumps\nis very low. It is important, however, to be aware of the signs and\nsymptoms of mumps, because a person can still get mumps, regardless of age\nor vaccination status. Symptoms of mumps [virus infection] include swollen\nglands near the jaw, fever, headache or muscle aches.\nAnyone who exhibits any of the symptoms of mumps should contact their\nfamily physician for further evaluation. In Illinois, patients with mumps\nmust be isolated from day care, school, work, and public gatherings until\nat least 9 days after the onset of symptoms. Complications of mumps\ninfection are rare, and can include deafness, meningitis/encephalitis, or\ninflammation of the testicles, ovaries, or breasts. With the exception of\ndeafness, these complications are more common among adults than children.\nSince mumps is primarily spread by direct contact with respiratory\ndroplets, persons may prevent contracting mumps with a few simple actions:\n(1) Children and adults should be up to date with their immunizations.\nPlease discuss your family's vaccination history with your physician.\n(2) Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and\nthrow the tissue away after use.\n(3) Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough\nor sneeze.

A total of 87 cases have been reported. The main\naffected provinces are Kaernten (known in English as Carinthia,\nlocated in southern Austria), Niederoesterreich and Wien (both in\nnortheast Austria). The age group most affected is people between 18\nand 30 years old.\nThe provincial health authorities in Karnten were informed of an\nincreased number (n=16) of cases of mumps in adolescents and young\nadults aged 16-20 years that occurred in 5 neighbouring health\ndistricts in Kaernten in April and May 2006. On 22 May 2006, the\nAustrian Agency for Health of Food Safety's department for infection\nepidemiology was asked for help to investigate a temporal and\ngeographical cluster of mumps. As mumps is not a notifiable disease\nin Austria, data protection issues have hindered the investigation of\nthis outbreak, and active case finding by personal interviews of the\n87 passively ascertained cases was not possible.\nBy 14 Jun [2006], 47 cases of mumps from 5 neighbouring districts in\nKaernten had been serologically (blood samples) confirmed in the\nnational reference laboratory in Vienna. Data on possible or probable\ncases are not yet available. In 2 further Austrian provinces local\nmedical laboratories have noticed an unusually high number of mumps\ncases since April 2006 (18 cases in Niederoesterreich and 13 cases in Wien).\nBy 14 Jun [2006], there were 2 serologically confirmed cases of mumps\nmeningitis, 5 serologically confirmed cases of orchitis, and one\nserologically confirmed case of pancreatitis, and another case\ninvolved a pregnant woman.\nInvestigation:\nAfter the first alert in Kaernten, mumps information sheets (one type\nfor healthcare providers and another type for the affected\npopulation) were disseminated to local physicians and hospitals in\nthe 5 districts. The local physicians and hospitals were asked to\ncomplete a questionnaire which, despite data protection requirements,\nshould enable a proper case series investigation. Currently,\ndemographic data, clinical onset, case classification (possible,\nprobable or confirmed case), complications (such as meningitis and\norchitis), admission to hospital and history of mumps infection and\nmumps vaccination is being collected.

Reliable data on vaccination coverage for MMR\nin Austria are not available.\nSince 31 May [2006], MMR vaccine has been offered to the population\nof these 5 health districts by local health authorities, physicians\nand hospitals. Between 500 and 600 people have so far been\nvaccinated.

The provincial health authorities in Karnten were informed of an\nincreased number (n=16) of cases of mumps in adolescents and young\nadults aged 16-20 years that occurred in 5 neighbouring health\ndistricts in Kaernten in April and May 2006. As mumps is not a notifiable disease\nin Austria, data protection issues have hindered the investigation of\nthis outbreak, and active case finding by personal interviews of the\n87 passively ascertained cases was not possible. After the first alert in Kaernten, mumps information sheets (one type\nfor healthcare providers and another type for the affected\npopulation) were disseminated to local physicians and hospitals in\nthe 5 districts. On 22 May 2006, the\nAustrian Agency for Health of Food Safety's department for infection\nepidemiology was asked for help to investigate a temporal and\ngeographical cluster of mumps. The main\naffected provinces are Kaernten (known in English as Carinthia,\nlocated in southern Austria), Niederoesterreich and Wien (both in\nnortheast Austria). In 2 further Austrian provinces local\nmedical laboratories have noticed an unusually high number of mumps\ncases since April 2006 (18 cases in Niederoesterreich and 13 cases in Wien). By 14 Jun [2006], 47 cases of mumps from 5 neighbouring districts in\nKaernten had been serologically (blood samples) confirmed in the\nnational reference laboratory in Vienna. The bivalent mumps-measles (MM) vaccine was introduced in Austria in\n1974, and was replaced in 1994 by the trivalent mumps, measles and\nrubella (MMR) vaccine.

This includes 2597 cases previously reported by 11\nstates during the period 1 Jan to 29 Apr 2006 (1). This report\nsummarizes the epidemiology of mumps cases in the United States\nduring 2006. With low levels of reported mumps continuing,\nhealth-care workers should remain alert to suspected mumps, conduct\nappropriate laboratory testing, and use every opportunity to ensure\nadequate immunity, particularly among populations at high risk for mumps.\nCases of mumps are reportable through the National Notifiable\nDiseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Reports are transmitted\nelectronically via NNDSS to CDC each week and include individual case\ninformation such as age, sex, date of symptom onset, vaccination\nstatus, and complications of illness. Mumps cases included in this\nreport are those with onset from 1 Jan to 7 Oct 2006 (week 40).\nThe clinical case definition of mumps is an illness with acute onset\nof unilateral or bilateral tender, self-limited, swelling of the\nparotid or other salivary gland, lasting 2 or more days, and without\nother apparent cause. A confirmed case of mumps is one that is\nlaboratory confirmed or meets the clinical case definition and is\nlinked epidemiologically to a confirmed or probable case. A probable\ncase meets the clinical case definition but is neither laboratory\nconfirmed nor linked to another confirmed or probable mumps case (2).\nOf the 5783 cases, 3113 (54 percent) were confirmed, and 2612 (45\npercent) were probable; for 58 cases (1 percent), classification was\nunknown. Six states reported 84 percent of the cases: Iowa (1968),\nKansas (904), Wisconsin (750), Illinois (591), Nebraska (357), and\nSouth Dakota (288).\nFor 5747 (99 percent) of the 5783 mumps cases with patient age\navailable, the median age was 22 years (range: 1 month to 96 years).\nAmong the 5739 (99 percent) patients for whom sex was known, 3644 (63\npercent) were female. As reported previously (1), the highest\nage-specific rate continues to be among persons aged 18 to 24 years,\nmany of whom were college students.\nData regarding vaccination status are incomplete. In Iowa, one of the\nstates with the most complete data, preliminary vaccination data have\nbeen reported through 20 Sep 2006. Among 1798 patients with completed\nfollow-up reports, 123 (7 percent) were unvaccinated; 245 (14\npercent) had received one dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)\nvaccine, and 884 (49 percent) had received >2 doses of MMR vaccine.\nThe vaccination status of 546 (30 percent) patients, the majority of\nwhom were adults, was unknown (3).\nAmong the 5783 cases for which weeks of onset are known, cases peaked\nduring the period 16 to 29 Apr 2006, the onset period for 1498 (26\npercent) cases. The number of reported cases decreased during the\nperiod May to September, when most students were not attending\ncollege. However, since students began returning to school in August,\nmumps clusters have been reported from three college or university\ncampuses in Illinois (84 cases), Kansas (22 cases), and Virginia (12\ncases). Most of these cases (96 percent) were reported in persons who\nhad received 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Because 2 doses of\nmumps-containing vaccine are not 100 percent effective, in a setting\nwith high vaccination coverage such as the United States, most mumps\ncases likely will occur in persons who have received the 2 doses.\nMultiple other factors might have contributed to the spread of the\nmumps outbreak (e.g., the close-contact environment of college\ndormitories or varying college admission requirements for MMR vaccination) (1).\nHealth-care providers should continue to remain alert for suspected\nmumps cases, conduct appropriate diagnostic testing, and report these\ncases to local or state health departments. At the initial visit,\nrecommended specimens for laboratory testing include serum to test\nfor mumps immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and a swab from the\nparotid duct or other affected salivary gland ducts for viral\nisolation, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing,\nor both. Parotid duct swab is the preferred viral sample for mumps;\nurine samples are no longer recommended. The first (acute) serum\nspecimen should be collected within 5 days of illness onset. If the\nIgM antibody titer is negative, a 2nd (convalescent) serum specimen\nfor IgM antibodies is recommended 2 to 3 weeks after onset of signs\n(e.g., parotitis) or symptoms; a delayed IgM response has been\nobserved in patients with confirmed cases of mumps, especially in\nvaccinated persons. The paired serum specimens also can be used to\ndetect a significant rise (as defined by the testing kit\ninstructions) in immunoglobulin G (IgG seroconversion) if measured by\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or a fourfold rise in titer if\nmeasured using plaque-reduction neutralization assays or similar\nquantitative assay.\nNegative laboratory tests, especially in vaccinated persons, should\nnot be used to rule out a mumps diagnosis, because these tests are\nnot sensitive enough to detect infection in all persons with clinical\nillness. In the absence of another diagnosis, cases meeting the\nclinical case definition should be reported as mumps cases.\nIn response to this nationwide mumps outbreak, ACIP recommendations\nfor prevention and control of mumps were updated (4). Evidence of\nimmunity through documentation of vaccination is now defined as one\ndose of live mumps vaccine for preschool-aged children and adults not\nat high risk for exposure and infection and 2 doses of live mumps\nvaccine for school-aged children (i.e., grades kindergarten-12) and\nadults at high risk for exposure and infection (i.e., health-care\nworkers, international travelers, and students at post-high-school\neducation institutions). Additional recommendations for outbreak\ncontrol include administering a second dose of MMR for preschool\nchildren and adults not at high risk for exposure and infection if\nthese persons are part of a group that is experiencing an outbreak\n(4). To ensure high levels of immunity, especially among groups at\nhigh risk for exposure and infection, every opportunity should be\nused to provide the 1st or 2nd dose of MMR vaccine to those without\nadequate evidence of immunity (e.g., documentation of vaccination).\nPrivate health-care providers, clinics, health departments,\nhealth-care institutions, schools, universities, and colleges should\nconsider offering MMR vaccine through such settings as routine\npreventive health services and special immunization clinics,\nincluding providing MMR in conjunction with influenza vaccine.\n(Reported by: S Reef, MD, G Dayan, MD, W Bellini, PhD, A Barskey,\nMPH, S Redd, D Bi, MS, P Rota, PhD, J Rota, MPH, Div of Viral\nDiseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases\n(proposed), CDC.)\nReferences\n-----------\n(1) CDC.

Nearly 100\npupils who suffered from the disease were forced to stay home. Up to now,\nan average of 10-20 students daily have been affected and ordered not to\nattend class. The Liou-He district health and education authorities are\ninvolved in the investigation.\nAfter 2 pm [on 12 May 2006] afternoon, a reporter visited to Cheng-xi\nprimary school and talked to several pupils.

So they had to stay home.' The reporter [was shown] a copy of\nthe daily tally of mumps-infected students. On 12 May 2006, a total of 27\nstudents in the whole school were found infected with mumps and were forced\nto stay home. One day earlier, on 11 May 2006, there were 11 students in a\nsimilar condition.\nTeacher Wang explained that the mumps first appeared in a student in March\n2006. The school arranged for this student to stay at home. The next day,\nanother student fell ill similarly, and the school made the same\narrangement. 'Between that time and the May 1st Laborer's Day, few students\nwere ill. Shortly after Laborer's Day, the cases mounted considerably.' An\ninsider told the reporter that from March 2006 to now, there were nearly\n100 pupils who suffered from mumps in this school. From grade one to grade\n6, nearly each class had sick students.\nThe school authority admits to having insufficient knowledge of the\noutbreak. The reporter has met the school headmaster, Mr Jin-Fong Ping. Mr\nPing was quoted as saying that as soon as the school found out that there\nwere students who suffered from the mumps, the school ordered the ill\nstudents to stay home and not to come to school. Besides taking the measure\nof home quarantine, the school did not disinfect the classrooms or engage\nin vaccine inoculation of the other students.\nMr Ping said the school had established a mumps prevention and treatment\nmanagement group, which is responsible for vaccine inoculation, medicines\ndelivery, and data collection, etc. 'Up till now, I have not obtained any\nconcrete data yet, because some students went home without suffering from\nthe mumps, but [from] catching a cold, or having a fever etc.'\nAt present, the Disease Prevention and Control Centers (DPCC) as well as\nthe Bureau of Education of Liou-He District have already gone to the school\nto carry out an investigation.\n--\nDan Silver\n<dgsilver@yahoo.com>\n[A map of China with the mumps-affected area, Nanjing, can be accessed at:\n<http://www.lonelyplanet.com/mapshells/north_east_asia/china/china.htm>.\nMumps is a viral infection of the salivary glands that is vaccine\npreventable (90 per cent efficacy).

Meghan Harris M.P.H., of the Iowa Department of Public Health, said\nthat the latest state affected by mumps is Missouri, which has reported a\nsingle case. The tally, which was released here today [5 Apr 2006], has\nincreased by 55 cases since Fri 31 Mar 2006. Harris said she expects the\nnumbers to be higher when the next scheduled update is issued Thu 6 Apr 2006.\nFollow-up reports have been completed on 154 cases. Of those, 68 percent\noccurred in people who had received the recommended 2 doses of the\nmeasles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Iowa, according to Harris, is a state\nwith a high vaccination rate, and she anticipates the majority of mumps\ninfections will occur in people who are considered safe on the basis of\ntheir immunization records. 'But we know the vaccine doesn't work in\neveryone,' she said. Harris said published data suggest that the vaccine\nfailure rate for mumps is about 5 percent. 'So by my estimate, there are\nabout 200 000 people in Iowa who have received the recommended vaccinations\nbut who have no immunity to mumps.' The current recommendation is that a\n1st dose of MMR triple vaccine be administered at age 12-15 months, with a\n2nd dose at 4-6 years. But Blaise Congeni, M.D., director of infectious\ndiseases at the Akron (Ohio) Children's Hospital, said that if the 2nd dose\nis missed, it can also be administered during adolescence.\nThe 300 confirmed, probable, or suspected cases of mumps represent the\nnation's largest mumps outbreak in 17 years. Early on, most of the Iowa\ncases were reported in college-age students. The mean age at onset was 21,\nand almost 45 percent of the cases occurred in 19-year-olds. But Harris\nsaid that no single college or university was implicated in the outbreak.\n'We can assume that this outbreak is associated with some aspects of\ncollege life, such as living in dorms or mixing together at the same\nclubs,' she said. The best explanation, according to Harris, is that\ncollege students 'in general have a higher risk of sharing saliva.' But the\nnewer numbers confirmed that the outbreak is moving beyond the college\ncampuses. 21 percent of cases occurred in students attending college, down\nfrom 23 percent of cases reported by 30 Mar 2006.\nThe public health data include confirmed, suspect and probable cases of\nmumps. Probable cases are those that meet the clinical case definition but\nhave no confirmed serologic or virologic testing. Suspect cases are those\nwith positive IgM serology, and confirmed cases are cases that meet\nclinical definition that are also laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically\nlinked.\nDr. Congeni speculated that it may be difficult to identify an index case,\nbecause the primary symptom of mumps, parotitis, is often not fully\nevaluated by clinicians. 'If the patient's record indicates that he or she\nhas been received 2 MMR doses, the assumption would be that this is caused\nby another virus,' he said. If the symptoms abate, the episode would be\nlittle more than a notation in a medical record.\nHarris agreed that Dr. Congeni's theory best explains what has happened in\nIowa, especially since the mumps strain is the same one that caused\noutbreaks in England over the past few years. That suggests that mumps\narrived with a recent visitor from Britain, but 'because these symptoms are\noften overlooked -- especially in people who have received the required\nvaccinations -- we doubt we will ever identify the index case,' she said.\nDr. Congeni said, however, that a mumps outbreak does not carry the\npotential for public health disaster that would be associated with a\nmeasles or rubella outbreak. 'There is a small risk that some kids will\ndevelop viral meningitis, and orchitis is a concern, but we know that\norchitis doesn't cause sterility,' Dr. Congeni said. As of today, 5 percent\nof cases included orchitis among symptoms, and there was one case of\nencephalitis being investigated.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Suspect cases are those\nwith positive IgM serology, and confirmed cases are cases that meet\nclinical definition that are also laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically\nlinked.

Most are in Iowa, where 815 cases have been\nrecorded, the CDC said.\nAn additional 350 mumps cases have been reported in Minnesota,\nKansas, Illinois, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Missouri and Oklahoma,\nofficials said. Investigators are reviewing possible cases in 7 other\nstates that were not named.\nMumps usually is not serious and rarely kills. None of the cases in\nthe recent outbreak have been fatal.\nOnce a common childhood illness, mumps was virtually eradicated with\nwidespread use of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. But\nthe vaccine is effective in only about 90 percent of people, which\ncould partly explain the recent outbreak, CDC Director Julie Gerberding said.\n'Although this is a very good vaccine, it's not perfect,' Gerberding\nsaid at a news conference.\nMany college-age students may have received just one of the 2\nrecommended doses when they were young, and therefore may not have\nthe same level of immunity as others, she said.\nFederal officials urged students, people who work in school or\nuniversity settings and health-care workers who did not get both\ndoses to get a 2nd dose.\nThe CDC is sending 25 000 doses of MMR vaccine to Iowa for that\npurpose, Gerberding said. Drug maker Merck & Co. Inc. has donated an\nadditional 25 000 doses for health officials to use as they see fit.\nInvestigators do not yet know how many of the people infected with\nmumps were vaccinated. So far, 'we have absolutely no information to\nsuggest there's a problem with the vaccine,' Gerberding said.\nMumps is a viral infection of the salivary glands. It causes\nunpleasant illness including fever, headache and swelling of the\nglands around the jaw.\nUp to 10 percent of patients may develop encephalitis. Other serious\ncomplications that sometimes occur include meningitis, inflammation\nof the testicles, ovaries or pancreas, or permanent deafness. There\nis no approved treatment.\nThe mumps virus is transmitted by coughing and sneezing. Experts say\nit is about as infectious as influenza. People can transmit mumps to\nothers for 3 days before they have any symptoms.\nIn the United States, an average of 265 mumps cases have been\nreported each year since 2001. Mumps vaccinations started in 1967.\n[Byline: Lisa Richwine]\n--\nGeorge Robertson\n<geo456@comcast.net>\n******\n[2] Nebraska\nDate: 18 Apr 2006\nFrom: Dr. Alfonso J.

'However, we're seeing cases in children as young as 2 and adults\nup to age 64,' she said.\nThe mumps epidemic is the nation's first in 20 years.\nSome 600 suspected cases have been reported in Iowa, according to the\nnational Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are also\ncases reported in Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri,\nWisconsin and Minnesota.\nMumps is a viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms include\nfever, headache, muscle aches and swelling of the glands close to the\njaw. It can cause serious complications, including meningitis, damage\nto the testicles and deafness. Mumps is spread by coughing and sneezing.\nNo deaths have been reported from the current epidemic.\nA 2-dose mumps vaccine is recommended for all children and is\nconsidered highly -- but not completely -- effective against the illness.\nAccording to HHS, Nebraskans ages 30 to 65 years old are the most at\nrisk to catch the disease because they probably never were vaccinated\nor had the disease.\nNebraska law for years has required 2 doses of the mumps vaccine\nbefore a child can enter school or college. Thus Nebraskans under the\nage of 30 who followed the K-12 and college entry requirements\nprobably have been vaccinated. Nebraskans over the age of 65 are\nlikely to have natural immunity to the virus.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nsaid it is the only major outbreak in the nation.\n'We are calling this an epidemic, not just an outbreak,' said Iowa state\nepidemiologist Dr. Patricia Quinlisk, explaining that mumps has spread to\nmore than a 3rd of the state and does not appear to be confined to certain\nage groups or other sectors of the population. Quinlisk said Iowa has had\nabout 5 cases of mumps a year in recent years, and this is the 1st large\noutbreak in nearly 20 years. 'We're trying to figure out why is it\nhappening, why is it happening in Iowa and why is it happening right now.\nWe don't know,' she said.\nCDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said the federal agency has no answers yet.\nQuinlisk said one theory is that the infection was brought over from\nEngland -- perhaps by a college student -- because the strain seen in Iowa\nhas been identified by the CDC as the same one that has caused tens of\nthousands of cases of the mumps in a major outbreak in Britain over the\npast 2 years. 'It may have been a college student, since we did see the 1st\nactivities on college campuses, but we can't prove that,' Quinlisk said.\nThe Public Health Department said 23 percent of the 245 reported patients\nare in college.\nMumps is a viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms include fever,\nheadache, muscle aches and swelling of the glands close to the jaw. It can\ncause serious complications, including meningitis, damage to the testicles\nand deafness.\nA mumps vaccine was introduced in 1967. Iowa law requires schoolchildren to\nbe vaccinated, and the state's last major outbreak was in 1987, when 476\npeople were infected.\nOf the 245 patients this year [2006], at least 66 percent had had the\nrecommended 2-shot vaccination, while 14 percent had received one dose, the\nPublic Health Department said.\n'The vaccine is working,' Quinlisk said. 'The vaccine certainly was made to\ncover this particular strain, because it's a fairly common strain of\nmumps.' Quinlisk said the vaccine overall is considered about 95 percent\neffective.\nQuinlisk said the mumps started in eastern Iowa and is spreading statewide\nand possibly into the neighboring states of Illinois, Minnesota and\nNebraska. Those states may have one or 2 cases of the mumps, she said.\nWhen an [11-year-old boy] of Davenport starting feeling sick in mid-January\n2006, his family thought he had a bad case of the flu. But his face and\nthroat swelled, and his temperature climbed to 103. His parents took him to\nthe doctor, and he was diagnosed to their surprise with full-blown mumps.\nAbout 2 weeks later, his 21-year-old sister came down with the mumps too.\nBoth children had gotten the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR. So\nhad their other 13-year-old brother who did not get the mumps.\n'He had all the shots and everything.

All regions have reported cases in 2004, and all\nexcept 2 have already had more cases this year than in the whole of 2003. Of\nall cases this year, 78 percent (2886 cases) were reported in young people\naged 15-24.\nImmunisation against mumps was introduced in England and Wales in October\n1988 as a component of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and\noffered routinely to all children aged 12 to 15 months. A 2nd dose of MMR\nvaccine at pre-school age was introduced in October 1996. Before the\nintroduction of MMR in 1988, mumps was not notifiable and surveillance was\nbased on laboratory reports. Since 1989, mumps has been notifiable and since\nlate 1994, the facility to test saliva for [mumps] IgM has been available to\nfamily doctors.\nFollowing the introduction of MMR, the incidence of mumps decreased rapidly\nuntil 1997. Since then the number of confirmed cases has increased. In 2003,\nthere was a rise in notifications which has continued throughout 2004, with\nfurther increases in the numbers of confirmed cases (illustrated as a figure\nat URL above). A 2nd figure (also at URL above) shows the number of\nconfirmed mumps cases by year of birth in 2004 compared to previous years.\nThere is a slight shift in incidence in 2004 to the older cohorts.\nThis increase in mumps cases in England and Wales since 1997 was predicted\nby seroprevalence studies in 1993. The results suggested that certain\ncohorts had remained susceptible -- probably due to reduced exposure to\nnatural infection following high uptake of MMR vaccine [1][which would have\nreinforced their vaccine-produced immunity. - Mod.JW]. The cohort identified\nto be at particularly high risk of mumps were those who are too old to have\nreceived 2 doses of MMR in the routine schedule (born before 1992) but young\nenough to have grown up during a period of low incidence, and so have\nescaped mumps infection in childhood. Confirmed mumps cases have been mainly\nin older teenagers and young adults (born between 1982 and 1990), and\noutbreaks have moved from being mainly in secondary schools to universities\nand further education colleges. Many of this group received measles-rubella\n(MR) vaccine in 1994, as at that time there was a shortage of MMR. Some may\nnot recall that the 1994 vaccine campaign was not the MMR vaccine, and so\nthey are not protected against mumps.\nThe Health Protection Agency and the Department of Health recommend that all\nschool-leavers and university entrants who have not received MMR vaccine or\nwho have only received one dose should have the opportunity to get MMR.\n<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/news/articles/press_releases/2004/041102_mumps.htm\n>\nMany universities across England and Wales have experienced outbreaks of\nmumps this year and have organised institution-based vaccination campaigns.\nReference\n---------\nGay N, Miller E, Hesketh L, Morgan-Capner P, Ramsay M, Cohen B, Brown D.\nMumps surveillance in England and Wales supports introduction of two dose\nvaccination schedule.

Mary Gilchrist, director of the State University's Hygienic\nLaboratory, said the genotype G strain is infrequently seen in the\nUnited States. With the number jumping from 17 cases just 2 weeks\nago, she predicted there could be more outbreaks this spring [2006].\n'If the past predicts the future, it will get worse in April,' she\nsaid.\nSo far, there are 18 cases recorded in Johnson County, 16 in Dubuque,\n5 in Black Hawk County and 4 in Scott County. 2 cases were confirmed\nin Linn County, while other counties have one to 3 cases, according\nto the lab's website.\nThe patients with confirmed cases of mumps range in age from 11 to\n41, but Gilchrist said half have been college students. She said the\nvirus may have come from Europe, but a similar strain has been\ndetected in New Jersey. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention is investigating the source.\nSymptoms of mumps include fever, headache and swollen salivary glands\nat the jaw line, below and in front of the ears. Mumps is generally a\nmild illness for healthy people and is spread through coughing or\nsneezing. It can cause serious complications, including deafness in\nchildren and spontaneous abortion in pregnant women.\nA mumps vaccine was introduced in 1967. People born before 1957 are\nbelieved to have been exposed to mumps during childhood and therefore\nshould be immune, according to the CDC. The last mumps outbreak in\nIowa was in 1987, when 467 cases were recorded.

However, in 2006, by March\n28, a total of 219 mumps cases had been reported in Iowa (illustrated by a\nfigure in the original text), and an additional 14 persons with clinically\ncompatible symptoms were being investigated in 3 neighboring states (11 in\nIllinois, 2 in Nebraska, and one in Minnesota) in what has become the\nlargest epidemic of mumps in the United States since 1988 (1). This report\nsummarizes and characterizes the ongoing mumps epidemic in Iowa, the public\nhealth response, and recommendations for preventing further transmission.\nMumps is an acute viral infection characterized by fever and nonsuppurative\nswelling of the salivary glands; an estimated 20-30 percent of cases are\nasymptomatic. Complications can include inflammation of the testicles or\novaries, meningitis/encephalitis, spontaneous abortion, and deafness.\nDuring the prevaccine era, nearly everyone in the United States experienced\nmumps, and 90 percent of cases occurred among children aged less than 15\nyears. In 1977, Iowa law mandated one dose of measles, mumps, and rubella\n(MMR) vaccine for entry to public schools; in 1991, the mandate became 2\ndoses. For the 2004-05 school year, 97 percent of children entering school\nin Iowa had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine (2).\nThe first reports to the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) of\nmumps-like illness occurred in December 2005 at a university in eastern\nIowa, where several students with glandular swelling were tested, 2 of whom\ntested positive for mumps-specific IgM antibodies. In mid-January 2006, an\nisolate from an unrelated patient was cultured and identified as mumps\nvirus at the University Hygienic Laboratory (Iowa's state public health\nlaboratory). Viral isolates were sent to CDC, and the mumps strain was\nidentified as genotype G. By mid-February, active surveillance had been\ninitiated in 7 geographic areas, including the campuses of the 3 largest\nuniversities in Iowa.\nOf the 219 cases reported in Iowa, the median patient age was 21 years\n(range: 3-85 years), with 48 percent of patients aged 17-25 years\n(illustrated by a figure in the original report); 30 percent (34 of 114)\nwere known to be college students. Of the 133 patients with investigated\nvaccine history, 87 (65 percent) had documentation of receiving 2 doses, 19\n(14 percent) one dose, and 8 (6 percent) no doses; vaccine status could not\nbe documented in 19 (14 percent) patients. Among the 114 patients for whom\nsymptomatic information was available, the most common symptoms were\nparotitis in 94 (83 percent) patients, submaxillary/sublingual gland\nswelling in 46 (40 percent), fever in 41 (36 percent), and sore throat in\n36 (32 percent); average duration of illness was 5.1 days. Six (5 percent)\npatients reported complications (e.g., orchitis); one suspected case of\nencephalitis is being investigated. As of 28 Mar 2006, investigators had\ndetermined that only 36 (16 percent) of the 219 cases were linked\nepidemiologically (i.e., a source of infection was identified), suggesting\nfrequent unapparent transmission.\nThe source of the Iowa epidemic is unknown; however, the United Kingdom\n(UK) experienced a recent mumps epidemic that peaked during 2005 with\napproximately 56 000 cases and a high attack rate among young adults (3).\nThe mumps strain in the UK epidemic also was identified as genotype G (4),\nand the UK epidemic has been linked to a 2005 mumps outbreak in the United\nStates (5).\nTo educate health-care professionals in Iowa regarding the epidemic and\nmumps, information has been distributed via Iowa's Health Alert Network\n(HAN), in weekly electronic newsletters, and via frequent conference calls.\nThe IDPH website has provided biweekly updates, county case counts, fact\nsheets, and guidance to local health departments and health-care facilities\non case investigations. IDPH recommendations include 1) requesting at least\n5 days of isolation for all patients (quarantine is not being used), 2)\nensuring that students and staff members on all Iowa college campuses have\nhad 2 doses of MMR or are immune from mumps (6), 3) assessing vaccination\nstatus of all health-care professionals in Iowa and offering vaccination\nwhere appropriate (7), and 4) sending all specimens collected from possible\ncases to University Hygienic Laboratory for testing.\nDespite control efforts and a highly vaccinated population, this epidemic\nhas spread across Iowa and potentially to neighboring states.

Dr Chandrakumar said the rise was not an\nepidemic, but protection was needed. Health officials are targeting up to\n30 000 at-risk teenagers at 8 tertiary education sites.\nDr Chandrakumar told BBC South East Today: 'We don't need to be worried as\nlong as this campaign is successful, and we can prevent large numbers of\ncases. We know it works, because, when we had an outbreak in the University\nof Kent, we carried out a campaign, and we stopped it in its tracks; we did\nnot have any further cases.' The mumps immunization centers include the\nfollowing: Canterbury College (Canterbury); Christchurch University College\n(Canterbury and Thanet); South Kent College (Ashford); West Kent College\n(Tonbridge); Oakwood Park Centre (Maidstone); and Mid Kent College (City\nWay site).\nDr Chandrakumar said outbreaks were occurring in people too old to have\nbeen offered measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) jabs routinely as children.\nThe MMR program only started in 1988. Dr Chandrakumar said the vaccination\nwas 'perfectly safe' and did not have any serious side effects.\nKent University completed a round of immunizations for new students at the\nstart of term in late October 2004. Other UK universities are also\nlaunching mass MMR vaccinations to stem the mumps threat.\nMumps is a viral infection that is transmitted through airborne droplets\nfrom the coughs and sneezes of infected people. It takes about 16 to 21\ndays between coming into contact with an infected person and the appearance\nof symptoms, such as painful swelling of saliva-making glands found on\neither side of the face. The vast majority of people make an easy recovery\nfrom mumps infection. However, it can rarely cause unpleasant and painful\ncomplications and can be particularly dangerous in young men who may\ndevelop swelling of the testis that can cause infertility.\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 16 Nov 2004\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Cambridge News, Tue 16 Nov 2004 [edited]\n<http://w3.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/story.asp?StoryID=64957>\n\nEngland: meningitis warning for Cambridge students\n--------------------------------------------------\nStudents in Cambridge could be at risk from a new outbreak of the\npotentially deadly illness meningitis. This is the warning issued by the\nmedical charity the Meningitis Trust. They say the recent outbreak of mumps\namong university students could lead to an increase in cases of particular\nstrains of viral meningitis, because the viruses that cause both illnesses\nare closely linked. Although the strains of meningitis concerned are very\nrarely lethal, they can lead to severe side effects and after effects such\nas headaches, fever, joint pain and stiffness in the neck, diarrhea,\nvomiting, and aversion to light.\nIn total, 38 students have been struck down with mumps so far this term,\ncompared with a recent average of only one or 2 per academic year.\nUniversity authorities are urging students under 24 years of age to take\nthe triple MMR vaccine, which prevents mumps, measles, and rubella.\nBridie Taylor, community services manager with the Meningitis Trust, said\nthat most of the current generation of students at Cambridge had not\nreceived the triple vaccine, because it was not introduced until the late\n1980s, after their infancy. But some symptoms of mumps are similar to those\nof meningitis, and Miss Taylor said: 'the incubation period for mumps is\nanything up to 3 weeks.'\n'We do not want GPs to be inundated. But, it is an especially nasty kind of\nillness, and we want people to be aware of the risks. If any of these\nsymptoms persist for more than 3 weeks, people should seek medical help.'\n******\n[3]\nDate: Tue 16 Nov 2004\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: The National Student, November 2004 [edited]\n<http://www.national-student.co.uk/2004_11/national_news_mumps.htm>\n\nUK: students are being warned of an imminent mumps epidemic\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nUniversities and colleges from the Scottish Highlands to Cornwall are\nreporting massive increases in mumps cases this year [2004]. The problem is\nbeing taken seriously in all areas. The Edinburgh Evening News reports that\n'thousands of students are being offered a vaccine against mumps, after\ncases in the Lothians soared 5-fold in a year.' The number of suspected\ncases in Grampian region alone has risen to 10 times what it was last year\n[2003]. There had been 37 confirmed cases in Grampian region, 53 in Tayside\nand 18 across the Highlands and Islands. In the same period, suspected\ncases in Grampian have risen to 88, compared to just 8 for the whole of\n2003. Almost all of the cases involve adolescents aged 13 to 25, with the\nmajority falling into the 17 to 20 age group.\nDr Arun Mukarjee, an expert in communicable diseases at NHS Grampian, said\nthat the age group accounted for about 50 per cent of the number of\nreported cases this year [2004], and the high incidence of mumps could be\nexplained by the introduction of the MMR vaccine when they were children.\n'The MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988,' he said. 'Initially, we started\nwith one dose, and the uptake was very good. As a result, mumps and measles\nwere almost eradicated in this country. We soon realized that not one but 2\ndoses of MMR were needed to give over 99 per cent protection from mumps,\nso, in 1996, we gave a 2nd dose, but those born between 1984 and 1987\nmissed out.'\nDr Mukarjee said youngsters born between those dates would have received a\n2nd measles and rubella vaccine, introduced in 1996 [this was actually a\none-off campaign late in 1994. See\n<http://www.hpa.org.uk/cdr/CDRreview/1994/cdrr1294.pdf> - Mod.SH], but the\njab would not protect them against mumps. 'No one knows why cases are on\nthe increase for this age group this year [2004], as opposed to last year\nor next year,' he added. 'What we do know is that the disease spreads like\nwildfire in areas like universities.' Health authorities have written to GP\npractices around the north and north-east [of Scotland] asking them to\nconduct selective immunization for young people aged 17 to 20.\nIn England, there is a similar picture. The Bath Chronicle reports that\n'thousands of adults are to be offered vaccinations to prevent a mumps\nepidemic in Bath. A program of inoculations is being devised to target 16\nto 25 year olds, after a massive increase in cases of the infection over\nthe past year.' The Express reported that 'an outbreak of mumps has struck\n85 1st year students at one university. Mass vaccination schemes are being\nset up over fears of an epidemic sweeping the country.' Colleagues of\nstudents at Exeter University have been offered vaccinations, and 1000 1st\nyear students have so far been given the MMR jab. Stuart Franklin, a\nspokesman for the university, said that 'it is too early to say we are on\ntop of the situation, but in the last few days the number of cases has\ndropped off.' Oxford, Manchester, Leeds, Kent, Nottingham, and Birmingham\nuniversities have all recently reported outbreaks of mumps. Official\nfigures show a dramatic rise in cases from 180 in 1996 to 3756 so far this\nyear. The number of cases of mumps reported at Lancaster University has\nrisen to 30, as health bosses warn of a national outbreak among students,\nreports the Lancaster Guardian.

We soon realized that not one but 2\ndoses of MMR were needed to give over 99 per cent protection from mumps,\nso, in 1996, we gave a 2nd dose, but those born between 1984 and 1987\nmissed out.'\n The mumps immunization centers include the\nfollowing: Canterbury College (Canterbury); Christchurch University College\n(Canterbury and Thanet); South Kent College (Ashford); West Kent College\n(Tonbridge); Oakwood Park Centre (Maidstone); and Mid Kent College (City\nWay site). Dr Arun Mukarjee, an expert in communicable diseases at NHS Grampian, said\nthat the age group accounted for about 50 per cent of the number of\nreported cases this year [2004], and the high incidence of mumps could be\nexplained by the introduction of the MMR vaccine when they were children. They say the recent outbreak of mumps\namong university students could lead to an increase in cases of particular\nstrains of viral meningitis, because the viruses that cause both illnesses\nare closely linked. \nDr Mathi Chandrakumar, director of the Kent Health Protection Unit,\nannounced a mumps vaccination program, after cases rose from 39 last year\n A warning of increased risk of viral meningitis, as a consequence of\nthe mumps epidemic, has been issued by the Meningitis Trust, although the\nextent of the risk, and the viral pathogen(s) involved, have not been\nspecified.

The\nconsequences of CNS infection caused by mumps virus infection extend from\naseptic meningitis (common and mild) to fulminant encephalitis (rare but\nlife threatening). Bridie Taylor, community services manager with the Meningitis Trust, said\nthat most of the current generation of students at Cambridge had not\nreceived the triple vaccine, because it was not introduced until the late\n1980s, after their infancy. Stuart Franklin, a\nspokesman for the university, said that 'it is too early to say we are on\ntop of the situation, but in the last few days the number of cases has\ndropped off.' Although the strains of meningitis concerned are very\nrarely lethal, they can lead to severe side effects and after effects such\nas headaches, fever, joint pain and stiffness in the neck, diarrhea,\nvomiting, and aversion to light. It takes about 16 to 21\ndays between coming into contact with an infected person and the appearance\nof symptoms, such as painful swelling of saliva-making glands found on\neither side of the face. However, it can rarely cause unpleasant and painful\ncomplications and can be particularly dangerous in young men who may\ndevelop swelling of the testis that can cause infertility.\n \nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n The Edinburgh Evening News reports that\n'thousands of students are being offered a vaccine against mumps, after\ncases in the Lothians soared 5-fold in a year.' But some symptoms of mumps are similar to those\nof meningitis, and Miss Taylor said: 'the incubation period for mumps is\nanything up to 3 weeks.' In recent weeks, Exeter University has had 76 confirmed cases\nof mumps in 3 of its halls of residence on campus, and 300 of its students\nhave already received the MMR vaccine.

As of 10 Apr 2006, a total of 515\npossible mumps cases have been reported to the Iowa Department of\nPublic Health (IDPH) during 2006 (2). This outbreak has spread across\nIowa, and mumps activity, possibly linked to the Iowa outbreak, is\nunder investigation in 6 neighboring states, including Illinois (n =\n4), Kansas (n = 33), Minnesota (n = one), Missouri (n = 4), Nebraska\n(n = 43), and Wisconsin (n = 4) (CDC, unpublished data, 10 Apr 2006).\nThe reasons for this outbreak are under investigation.\nMumps is an acute viral infection characterized by a nonspecific\nprodrome, including myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and fever,\nfollowed by acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender swelling of\nparotid or other salivary glands (2). An estimated 60 percent to 70\npercent of mumps infections produce typical acute parotitis (3).\nApproximately 20 percent of infections are asymptomatic, and nearly\n50 percent are associated with nonspecific or primarily respiratory\nsymptoms. Complications include orchitis, oophoritis, or mastitis\n(inflammation of the testicles, ovaries, or breasts, respectively),\nmeningitis/encephalitis, spontaneous abortion, and deafness.\nTransmission occurs by direct contact with respiratory droplets or\nsaliva. The incubation period is 14-18 days (range: 14-25 days) from\nexposure to onset of symptoms. The infectious period is from 3 days\nbefore symptom onset until 9 days after onset of symptoms.\nIDPH has identified 2 persons who had mumps diagnosed and were\npotentially infectious during travel on 9 different commercial\nflights involving 2 airlines during 26 Mar-2 Apr 2006. The commercial\nairline flights identified with a potentially infectious traveler are\nlisted below by date, carrier, and flight number:\nNorthwest Airline (NWA) flights:\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3025 from Waterloo, Iowa to Minneapolis, Minnesota\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA #760 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Detroit, Michigan\n27 Mar 2006 - NWA #0260 from Detroit, Michigan, to Washington,\nDC--Reagan National\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA #1705 from Washington, DC--Reagan National to\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3026 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Waterloo, Iowa\nAmerican Airlines (AA) flights:\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #1216 from Tucson, Arizona, to Dallas, Texas (DFW)\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #3617 from DFW to Lafayette, Arkansas (Northwest\nArkansas Regional [NAR])\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5399 from NAR to St. Louis, Missouri\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5498 from St. Louis, Missouri, to Cedar Rapids, Iowa\nPersons on these flights who have symptoms consistent with mumps\nwithin 21 days of travel should be evaluated for mumps by an\nhealth-care provider. Health-care providers should remain vigilant\nfor mumps among persons with parotitis or other salivary gland\ninflammation. Cases of suspected mumps should be reported immediately\nto public health officials.\nA multistate investigation has been initiated by CDC and the state\nhealth departments in affected states to notify potentially exposed\npassengers (i.e., those seated in close proximity to the index\ncases). This investigation is using a new software application,\neManifest, developed by the CDC Division of Global Migration and\nQuarantine (DGMQ) to securely import, sort, and assign\npassenger-locating information to jurisdictions to facilitate timely\nidentification of exposed persons.

The patient is a 17 year old female\nfrom Manassas with no known recent contact with anyone having mumps and no\nrecent travel or visitors from outside Virginia. She became ill with fever\nand headache about 5 days ago and developed symptoms of bilateral parotitis\nwithin the last 2 days.\nLaboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is pending. What ties this case to\nthe other outbreaks is the fact that this patient is originally from Kansas\nand received her 2 MMR vaccinations there in 1990 and 1994.\nThis occurrence makes me wonder: 1. Since this patient was vaccinated in\nKansas, but no longer lives there, could this be an indication of vaccine\nfailure? 2. Does her development of mumps, with no known contact with the\nillness, in a community with a high vaccination rate and where an outbreak\nis not occurring, indicate that there may be an intermittent subclinical\noccurrence of the illness? I can imagine a scenario where this might occur\nin patients who have partial immunity from previous vaccination and who\nmight shed virus without having any symptoms, or at least symptoms to\nsuggest mumps.\n--\nRaymond Weinstein, MD\nManassas,Virginia\nUSA\n<AlaskaRay@aol.com>\n[Some of Dr Weinstein's observations are dealt with in detail in the\nfollowing MMWR dispatch. - Mod.CP]\n******\n[2] Mumps - multi-state outbreak\nDate: Fri 19 May 2006\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: MMWR Dispatch 18 May 2006 / 55(Dispatch);1-5 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm55d518a1.htm?s_cid=mm55d518a1_e>\n\nUpdate: multi-state outbreak of mumps - United States; 1 Jan to 2 May 2006\n-----------------------------------------------------\nCDC and state and local health departments continue to investigate an\noutbreak of mumps that began in Iowa in December 2005 (1) and involved at\nleast 10 additional states as of 2 May 2006. This report summarizes\npreliminary data reported to CDC from these 11 states and provides\nrecommendations to prevent and control mumps during an outbreak.\nCases of mumps are reportable through the National Notifiable Diseases\nSurveillance System (NNDSS) (2). NNDSS reports are transmitted\nelectronically to CDC each week and include information on individual cases\nsuch as age, sex, date of symptom onset, vaccination status, and\ncomplications of illness. Mumps cases included in this report are those\nwith onset from [1 Jan 2006] (MMWR week 1) through [29 Apr 2006] (MMWR week\n17) that were reported to CDC as of [2 May 2006] through NNDSS (or the Iowa\nmumps outbreak-specific reporting system) from Iowa and 10 additional\nstates that reported one or more cases of mumps epidemiologically linked to\nthe multistate outbreak. In addition to cases reported through NNDSS, to\nprovide information rapidly during this outbreak, states have been\nreporting aggregate numbers of mumps cases and mumps-related\nhospitalizations and complications biweekly to CDC. Cases reported in this\nmanner through [2 May 2006], also are included in this report.\nThe clinical case definition of mumps* is an illness with acute onset of\nunilateral or bilateral tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or\nother salivary gland, lasting 2 or more days, and without other apparent\ncause. A confirmed case of mumps is one that is laboratory confirmed or\nmeets the clinical case definition and is linked epidemiologically to a\nconfirmed or probable case. A case is classified as probable if it meets\nthe clinical case definition but is neither laboratory-confirmed nor linked\nto another confirmed or probable mumps case. In accordance with these\ndefinitions, asymptomatic, laboratory confirmed infections were counted as\nconfirmed cases in all states except Iowa. In Iowa, laboratory-confirmed\ncases that were asymptomatic or had clinical information pending, and cases\nfor which high suspicion for mumps existed but case classification was not\nyet determined were classified as suspect.\nDuring the period 1 Jan to 2 May 2006, 11 states reported 2597 cases of\nmumps. Eight states (Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska,\nPennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wisconsin) reported mumps outbreaks with\nongoing local transmission or clusters of cases; 3 states (Colorado,\nMinnesota, and Mississippi) reported cases associated with travel from an\noutbreak state. The majority of mumps cases (1487 [57 per cent]) were\nreported from Iowa; states with the next highest case totals were Kansas\n(371), Illinois (224), Nebraska (201), and Wisconsin (176) (Figure 1 [see\nURL link above]). Of the 2597 cases reported overall, 1275 (49 per cent)\nwere classified as confirmed, 915 (35 per cent) as probable, and 287 (11\nper cent) as suspect; for 120 (5 per cent) cases, classification was\nunknown. Twelve mumps viral isolates from 6 states were characterized; all\nwere mumps genotype G.\nFor 2067 (80 per cent) of the 2597 mumps cases with patient age available,\nthe median age was 21 years (range: less than 1 year to 96 years). In the 8\nstates with outbreaks, the incidence rate was highest among persons aged 18\nto 24 years (17.1 per 100 000 population), followed by persons aged 5 to 17\nyears (5.2) and 25 to 39 years (4.8) (Figure 2 [see URL link above]). Among\nthe 2073 patients for whom sex was known, 1244 (60 per cent) were female.\nAmong the 2073 cases for which week of onset was known, 1426 (69 per cent)\nwere reported in April (Figure 3 in original text). The peak week of onset\nhas been April 2 to 8 (week 14) in Iowa and April 16 to 22 (week 16) in\nother states.\nHowever, additional cases with onset dates in April continue to be\nreported. Parotitis was reported in 870 (66 per cent) of the 1327 patients\nfor whom such data were available. Data regarding mumps complications and\nhospitalizations are incomplete. However, complications have included 27\nreports of orchitis, 11 meningitis, 4 encephalitis, 4 deafness, and one\neach of oophoritis, mastitis, pancreatitis, and unspecified complications.\nA total of 25 hospitalizations were reported, but insufficient data were\nprovided to determine whether mumps caused all the hospitalizations. No\ndeaths have been reported.\nVaccination status of reported mumps patients is being ascertained. In\nIowa, preliminary vaccination data were reported through [3 May 2006].***\nAmong 1192 patients, 69 (6 per cent) were unvaccinated, 141 (12 per cent)\nhad received 1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and 607\n(51 per cent) had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine; the vaccination status\nof 375 (31 per cent) patients, the majority of whom were adults who did not\nhave vaccination records, was unknown. Preliminary data, as of [10 Apr\n2006], from 2 mumps outbreaks on college campuses in an Iowa county\naffected early in the outbreak, identified attack rates of reported mumps\ncases*** of 2.0 per cent (31 of 1542 students) and 3.8 per cent (44 of 1168\nstudents). Preliminary data from vaccine coverage surveys suggest that the\ncollege with the higher attack rate had a smaller proportion (77 per cent\nversus 97 per cent) of students documented as having received 2 doses of\nMMR vaccine.\nAs of [10 May 2006], a total of 11 persons potentially infected with mumps\nwho traveled by aircraft during [26 Mar-25 Apr 2006] had been identified on\n33 commercial flights operated by 8 different airlines. Notifications had\neither been initiated or completed for persons potentially exposed on all\nidentified flights. As of [12 May 2006], of about 575 persons potentially\nexposed on the flights, 132 had received follow-up greater than 25 days\nafter their potential exposure. Two cases of mumps were identified,\npossibly associated with transmission during air travel. Both cases\noccurred among Iowa residents, one of whom was a traveling companion of a\nperson known to have mumps.\n(Reported by: K Gershman, MD, S Rios, D Woods-Stout, Colorado Dept of\nPublic Health and Environment.

After expanded recommendations for a 2-dose MMR\nvaccine schedule for measles control in 1989 (3), mumps cases declined\nfurther (Figure 4 [see URL link above]). During the period 2001 to 2003,\nfewer than 300 mumps cases were reported each year, a 99 per cent decline\nfrom the 185 691 cases reported in 1968 (2).\nThe current multistate mumps outbreak, with 2597 cases reported through [2\nMay 2006], is the largest number of mumps cases reported to CDC in a single\nyear since 1991, when 4264 cases were reported (2). The first cases in the\ncurrent outbreak were detected on a college campus in eastern Iowa in\nDecember 2005; the source of these initial cases is unknown (1). Although\nthe age group most affected (38 per cent of cases) has been young adults\naged 18 to 24 years, many of whom are college students, the outbreak has\nspread to all age groups (1). Multiple factors might have contributed to\nthe spread of mumps in this outbreak and on college campuses. First, the\ncollege campus environment (such as living in dormitories with frequent and\nextended close contact with other students) facilitates transmission of\nmumps and other illnesses that are spread through respiratory and oral\nsecretions. Second, only 25 states***** and the District of Columbia report\na college admission requirement of 2 doses of MMR vaccine, including 3 of\nthe 11 states with outbreak-associated cases of mumps; no data on\nimplementation and evaluation of the 2-dose college admission requirement\nare available (CDC, unpublished data, 2006). Thus, 2-dose coverage with\nmumps-containing vaccine among college students likely is lower than the\nmedian 97 per cent (range: 57 per cent --99 per cent) coverage for\nmeasles-containing vaccine (almost exclusively administered as MMR vaccine)\nfor students entering elementary school and the median 98 per cent (range:\n62 per cent -- 99 per cent) coverage for students entering middle school\nreported in 2000 from 38 and 25 states, respectively (4). Third, delayed\nrecognition and diagnosis of mumps cases might have contributed to the\nspread in this outbreak; younger physicians in the United States likely\nhave not seen mumps, and physicians might not consider the diagnosis in\nvaccinated persons. Fourth, 2 doses of MMR vaccine are not 100 per cent\neffective in preventing disease, and accumulation of susceptible persons\nwho were not successfully immunized might be sufficient to sustain\ntransmission in certain settings. In addition, the vaccine might be less\neffective in preventing asymptomatic infection or atypical mumps than in\npreventing parotitis, and persons with asymptomatic infection or mild\ndisease might contribute to transmission. Finally, waning immunity has been\npostulated as a contributing factor in this outbreak. Young adults aged\n18-24 years would most commonly have received their most recent dose of\nmumps-containing vaccine (i.e., MMR vaccine) 6-17 years ago. High\nvaccination coverage with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, especially in school-aged\npopulations in the United States, likely prevented thousands of additional\ncases of mumps in this outbreak. Post-licensure studies conducted in the\nUnited States during the period 1973 to 1989 determined that one dose of\nmumps or MMR vaccine was 75 to 91 per cent effective in preventing mumps\nwith parotitis that lasts greater than 2 days (5). Although fewer data are\navailable on the effectiveness of 2 doses of MMR vaccine against mumps, one\nstudy from the United Kingdom documented vaccine effectiveness of 88 per\ncent with 2 doses (6). In a mumps outbreak in a high school in Kansas,\nstudents vaccinated with 1 dose of MMR vaccine had an attack rate 5 times\nthat of students vaccinated with 2 doses (7). In a mumps outbreak in a\nmiddle school in 1982, before mumps vaccination became widespread, attack\nrates of 25 to 49 per cent occurred among unvaccinated students, depending\non how cases were ascertained (8). During the 1986 to 1990, after\nwidespread implementation of a 1-dose mumps vaccination policy, attack\nrates of 2 to 18 per cent (most greater than 6 per cent) were documented in\nmumps outbreaks among junior high and high school students with vaccination\ncoverage of greater than 95 per cent (7,9). In contrast, preliminary data\nfrom 2 colleges in Iowa during the current outbreak identified attack rates\nof 2.0 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively, with the lower attack rate\nin the college with higher 2-dose vaccination coverage.\nTo prevent mumps, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\nrecommends a 2-dose MMR vaccination series for all children, with the first\ndose administered at ages 12-15 months and the second dose at ages 4-6\nyears (3). Two doses of MMR vaccine are recommended for school and college\nentry unless the student has other evidence of immunity (3). In a specially\nconvened meeting on [17 May 2006], ACIP redefined evidence of immunity to\nmumps through vaccination as follows: 1 dose of a live mumps virus\nvaccine** for preschool children and adults not at high risk; 2 doses for\nchildren in grades K--12 and adults at high risk (i.e., persons who work in\nhealth-care facilities, international travelers, and students at post-high\nschool educational institutions). Other criteria for evidence of immunity\n(i.e., birth before 1957, documentation of physician-diagnosed mumps, or\nlaboratory evidence of immunity) are unchanged. Furthermore, health-care\nfacilities should consider recommending 1 dose of MMR vaccine to\nunvaccinated health-care workers born before 1957 who do not have other\nevidence of mumps immunity.\nDuring an outbreak and depending on the epidemiology of the outbreak (e.g.,\nthe age groups and/or institutions involved), a 2nd dose of vaccine should\nbe considered for adults and for children aged 1-4 years who have received\n1 dose. The 2nd dose should be administered as early as 28 days after the\nfirst dose, the minimum recommended interval between 2 MMR vaccine doses.\nIn addition, during an outbreak, health-care facilities should strongly\nconsider recommending 2 doses of MMR vaccine to unvaccinated workers born\nbefore 1957 who do not have other evidence of mumps immunity. An MMWR\nNotice to Readers will be published, summarizing these interim\nrecommendations in more detail.\nAdditional means to decrease transmission in outbreak settings include\nexclusion of persons without evidence of immunity to mumps from\ninstitutions such as schools and colleges that are affected by the\noutbreak. Once vaccinated, students and staff can be readmitted to school\nimmediately, even if they have been exposed to a case of mumps. The period\nof exclusion for those who remain unvaccinated is 26 days after the onset\nof parotitis in the last person in the affected institution. Students who\nacquire mumps illness should be excluded from school until 9 days after the\nonset of parotitis. After an exposure to mumps, unvaccinated health-care\nworkers without evidence of immunity should be vaccinated and excluded from\nduty from the 12th day after the first exposure through the 26th day after\nthe last exposure. Health-care workers with mumps illness should be\nexcluded from work until 9 days after the onset of parotitis.\nIn response to the current outbreak, the Iowa Department of Public Health\n(IDPH) issued vaccination recommendations in March targeting college campus\nand health-care worker populations at high risk. On 14 Apr, CDC issued a\nHealth Advisory Notice summarizing vaccine policy recommendations for mumps\nprevention and control. In conjunction with local health departments, IDPH\nlaunched a statewide vaccination campaign during 24-26 Apr, targeting\npersons aged 18-22 years in the 35 Iowa counties with the state's largest\ncolleges and universities. In the second phase of the campaign, conducted\n2-4 May, vaccination was expanded to the remaining 64 counties, targeting\npersons aged 18-25 years. A third phase of the vaccination campaign was\nbegun 10 May and targets persons aged 18-46 years. Vaccination activities\nalso are being conducted or planned in Kansas, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.\nThe data presented in this report are preliminary; the case count is likely\nto change as additional data become available. Certain reported cases might\nnot have been caused by mumps; cases in persons without parotitis might\nhave been masculinized on the basis of serologic tests. Because of the low\nnumber of reported mumps cases during the last decade, laboratorians have\nlimited experience with mumps tests, particularly IgM antibody tests (10).\nSeveral different mumps IgM antibody tests are in use; however, neither the\nsensitivities nor specificities of these tests when used with serum\nspecimens from either unvaccinated or vaccinated persons have been clearly\ndefined. Consequently, interpretation of these antibody test results is\ndifficult, especially in previously vaccinated persons.\nStudies to define the sensitivity and specificity of mumps IgM antibody\ntests and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests\nfor mumps virus RNA are in progress. CDC continues to work with state and\nlocal health departments to conduct mumps surveillance, assist with\nprevention and control activities, and evaluate vaccine effectiveness,\nduration of immunity, and risk factors for mumps illness.\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Mumps cases included in this report are those\nwith onset from [1 Jan 2006] (MMWR week 1) through [29 Apr 2006] (MMWR week\n17) that were reported to CDC as of [2 May 2006] through NNDSS (or the Iowa\nmumps outbreak-specific reporting system) from Iowa and 10 additional\nstates that reported one or more cases of mumps epidemiologically linked to\nthe multistate outbreak. Among 1192 patients, 69 (6 per cent) were unvaccinated, 141 (12 per cent)\nhad received 1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and 607\n(51 per cent) had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine; the vaccination status\nof 375 (31 per cent) patients, the majority of whom were adults who did not\nhave vaccination records, was unknown. Preliminary data, as of [10 Apr\n2006], from 2 mumps outbreaks on college campuses in an Iowa county\naffected early in the outbreak, identified attack rates of reported mumps\ncases*** of 2.0 per cent (31 of 1542 students) and 3.8 per cent (44 of 1168\nstudents). During the 1986 to 1990, after\nwidespread implementation of a 1-dose mumps vaccination policy, attack\nrates of 2 to 18 per cent (most greater than 6 per cent) were documented in\nmumps outbreaks among junior high and high school students with vaccination\ncoverage of greater than 95 per cent (7,9).

Third, delayed\nrecognition and diagnosis of mumps cases might have contributed to the\nspread in this outbreak; younger physicians in the United States likely\nhave not seen mumps, and physicians might not consider the diagnosis in\nvaccinated persons. In contrast, preliminary data\nfrom 2 colleges in Iowa during the current outbreak identified attack rates\nof 2.0 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively, with the lower attack rate\nin the college with higher 2-dose vaccination coverage.\n First, the\ncollege campus environment (such as living in dormitories with frequent and\nextended close contact with other students) facilitates transmission of\nmumps and other illnesses that are spread through respiratory and oral\nsecretions. Post-licensure studies conducted in the\nUnited States during the period 1973 to 1989 determined that one dose of\nmumps or MMR vaccine was 75 to 91 per cent effective in preventing mumps\nwith parotitis that lasts greater than 2 days (5). In a mumps outbreak in a\nmiddle school in 1982, before mumps vaccination became widespread, attack\nrates of 25 to 49 per cent occurred among unvaccinated students, depending\non how cases were ascertained (8). In addition to cases reported through NNDSS, to\nprovide information rapidly during this outbreak, states have been\nreporting aggregate numbers of mumps cases and mumps-related\nhospitalizations and complications biweekly to CDC. Although fewer data are\navailable on the effectiveness of 2 doses of MMR vaccine against mumps, one\nstudy from the United Kingdom documented vaccine effectiveness of 88 per\ncent with 2 doses (6). High\nvaccination coverage with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, especially in school-aged\npopulations in the United States, likely prevented thousands of additional\ncases of mumps in this outbreak. Of the 2597 cases reported overall, 1275 (49 per cent)\nwere classified as confirmed, 915 (35 per cent) as probable, and 287 (11\nper cent) as suspect; for 120 (5 per cent) cases, classification was\nunknown. Preliminary data from vaccine coverage surveys suggest that the\ncollege with the higher attack rate had a smaller proportion (77 per cent\nversus 97 per cent) of students documented as having received 2 doses of\nMMR vaccine. CDC continues to work with state and\nlocal health departments to conduct mumps surveillance, assist with\nprevention and control activities, and evaluate vaccine effectiveness,\nduration of immunity, and risk factors for mumps illness. To prevent mumps, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\nrecommends a 2-dose MMR vaccination series for all children, with the first\ndose administered at ages 12-15 months and the second dose at ages 4-6\nyears (3). \nCDC and state and local health departments continue to investigate an\noutbreak of mumps that began in Iowa in December 2005 (1) and involved at\nleast 10 additional states as of 2 May 2006. During an outbreak and depending on the epidemiology of the outbreak (e.g.,\nthe age groups and/or institutions involved), a 2nd dose of vaccine should\nbe considered for adults and for children aged 1-4 years who have received\n1 dose. The majority of mumps cases (1487 [57 per cent]) were\nreported from Iowa; states with the next highest case totals were Kansas\n(371), Illinois (224), Nebraska (201), and Wisconsin (176) (Figure 1 [see\nURL link above]). Measles, mumps, and rubella---vaccine use and strategies for\nelimination of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome and\ncontrol of mumps: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization\nPractices (ACIP). Furthermore, health-care\nfacilities should consider recommending 1 dose of MMR vaccine to\nunvaccinated health-care workers born before 1957 who do not have other\nevidence of mumps immunity. Although\nthe age group most affected (38 per cent of cases) has been young adults\naged 18 to 24 years, many of whom are college students, the outbreak has\nspread to all age groups (1). In Iowa, laboratory-confirmed\ncases that were asymptomatic or had clinical information pending, and cases\nfor which high suspicion for mumps existed but case classification was not\nyet determined were classified as suspect. In the 8\nstates with outbreaks, the incidence rate was highest among persons aged 18\nto 24 years (17.1 per 100 000 population), followed by persons aged 5 to 17\nyears (5.2) and 25 to 39 years (4.8) (Figure 2 [see URL link above]). Additional means to decrease transmission in outbreak settings include\nexclusion of persons without evidence of immunity to mumps from\ninstitutions such as schools and colleges that are affected by the\noutbreak. The clinical case definition of mumps* is an illness with acute onset of\nunilateral or bilateral tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or\nother salivary gland, lasting 2 or more days, and without other apparent\ncause. In addition, the vaccine might be less\neffective in preventing asymptomatic infection or atypical mumps than in\npreventing parotitis, and persons with asymptomatic infection or mild\ndisease might contribute to transmission. Does her development of mumps, with no known contact with the\nillness, in a community with a high vaccination rate and where an outbreak\nis not occurring, indicate that there may be an intermittent subclinical\noccurrence of the illness? After an exposure to mumps, unvaccinated health-care\nworkers without evidence of immunity should be vaccinated and excluded from\nduty from the 12th day after the first exposure through the 26th day after\nthe last exposure. The current multistate mumps outbreak, with 2597 cases reported through [2\nMay 2006], is the largest number of mumps cases reported to CDC in a single\nyear since 1991, when 4264 cases were reported (2). Fourth, 2 doses of MMR vaccine are not 100 per cent\neffective in preventing disease, and accumulation of susceptible persons\nwho were not successfully immunized might be sufficient to sustain\ntransmission in certain settings. Several different mumps IgM antibody tests are in use; however, neither the\nsensitivities nor specificities of these tests when used with serum\nspecimens from either unvaccinated or vaccinated persons have been clearly\ndefined. I can imagine a scenario where this might occur\nin patients who have partial immunity from previous vaccination and who\nmight shed virus without having any symptoms, or at least symptoms to\nsuggest mumps. Both cases\noccurred among Iowa residents, one of whom was a traveling companion of a\nperson known to have mumps.\n In conjunction with local health departments, IDPH\nlaunched a statewide vaccination campaign during 24-26 Apr, targeting\npersons aged 18-22 years in the 35 Iowa counties with the state's largest\ncolleges and universities. NNDSS reports are transmitted\nelectronically to CDC each week and include information on individual cases\nsuch as age, sex, date of symptom onset, vaccination status, and\ncomplications of illness. The peak week of onset\nhas been April 2 to 8 (week 14) in Iowa and April 16 to 22 (week 16) in\nother states.\n However,\nthe possibility of introduction of the virus and its spread to neighboring\nstates within the United States by exposure during airline travel could not\nbe confirmed conclusively.

From: Raymond Weinstein <AlaskaRay@aol.com>\n\nI thought you might be interested to learn that today [Thu 18 May 2006] I\ndiagnosed what I believe is the 1st case of mumps in Virginia associated\nwith the current multistate outbreak.

These people being born\nbefore the MMR programme began -- my own 2 eldest children included -- are\nnot the problem. The problem is that this cohort has had on average only a\nsingle dose of mumps immunisation.\nFollowing the start of the single-dose MMR programme (given at age about 13\nmonths) in the UK in 1988, there was also a catchup programme targeted at\nsuccessively older groups of children. By 1993-4 the experience\nof countries that had had a successful MMR programme for longer than the\nUK showed that measles outbreaks were again occurring. This was due to the\nslow accumulation of susceptibles, due in large part to the 5-10 percent of\nimmunoconversion failure rate for the measles component of the MMR.\nIn 1994 the UK added a 2nd dose of MMR to the scheduled pre-school booster\nimmunisations given at age 4, and at the same time carried out a catch-up\n2nd dose programme for all children aged 5 to 15. For logistical reasons,\ninsufficient MMR was obtainable to maintain the primary programme AND\nservice the catch-up, so the 1994 catch-up consisted of a measles-rubella\n(MR) vaccine.\nThe programme was a success. Uptake levels were high (I don't have the\nexact figures), and the UK averted the measles recurrences seen elsewhere.\n(The later MMR-autism bad science and media frenzy is another story.)\nHowever, that 1994 group of 5-to-15 year-olds, having had only one dose of\nmumps vaccine, must include a minority remaining susceptible. As they come\ntogether in tertiary and further education institutions, there is the\nopportunity for susceptibles to cluster and to meet a new virus.\n--\nDr Gary Reynolds\nConsultant in Health Protection\nHereford-Worcester HPU\nPublic Health, Belmont Abbey, Hereford HR2 9RP\n<gary.reynolds@herefordpct.nhs.uk>\n[Dr. Reynolds comments are very much appreciated. As stated above, the\naddition of the second dose of vaccine (MMR) served to capture those\nindividuals who did not seroconvert after receipt of the first dose of\nvaccine.\nClinical vaccine efficacy in the US is estimated to be 95 percent (range 90\n- 97 percent) following a single dose of the vaccine.

Information on the population at risk was not available to\nattempt to calculate vaccine efficacy during this outbreak.\nPugh et. al. ( ref. 2) reported on a mumps outbreak among school aged\nchildren in Walsall, UK in 2000. In this outbreak, 49 percent of cases\nhad a history of one dose of vaccine and 18.5 percent of cases had a\nhistory of 2 doses of vaccine (overall 68 percent of cases had a history of\nreceiving mumps vaccine). The authors concluded that with the decrease in\nvaccination coverages observed in the UK in recent years (to below 90\npercent), future mumps outbreaks in schools and among older age groups can\nbe predicted since most older children and young adults have received only\none dose of MMR vaccine or no vaccination at all.\nNardone et al (ref. 3) reported the results of a serosurvey for prevalence\nof mumps antibodies in Europe (Denmark, England and wales, France, Germany,\nItaly and The Netherlands) as part of the European Sero-Epidemiology\nnetwork (ESEN). The authors concluded that a build-up of susceptibles in\nolder children and adolescents in England and Wales, France, the former\nWest Germany and Italy indicates the possibility of further mumps outbreaks\nin secondary school environments\nAmela, Pachon, and de Ory (ref. 4) reported on a serologic study done in\nSpain showing a vaccine efficacy of 76.7 percent in children 2-5 years of\nage felt to be associated with use of the Rubini vaccine strain. Lopez\nHernandez et. al.

(ref. 6) reported on a study comparing vaccine efficacy\nof 3 different mumps vaccine strains in Switzerland during a mumps outbreak\nwhere they observed a similar attack rate in unvaccinated children (63\npercent) and children vaccinated with the Rubini strain (67 percent) but\nsignificantly lower in those vaccinated with the Jeryl-Lynn (14 percent) or\nthe Urabe strain (8 percent).

So far this\nyear, there have been more than 2000 formal notifications of the disease in\nEngland, at least half of them thought to be positive. In Wales there have\nbeen 323 confirmed cases, compared with just 2 in 1999.\nPublic health doctors have warned that in some areas, one child in 5\nstarting primary school this year was not protected against the disease.\nThe massive rise in mumps cases is a cause of huge concern for health\nofficials, who have seen the take-up of the triple measles, mumps and\nrubella (MMR) vaccination drop alarmingly because of health scares.\nMumps can cause fever, headache and inflammation of the salivary glands,\nand occasionally infection of the membrane covering the brain. The disease\ncan also cause permanent deafness. About one in 5 adolescent or adult males\nwho contracts mumps develops a painful inflammation and swelling of the\ntesticles, which can in a small number of cases result in infertility.\nCentral nervous system complications are not uncommon. Teenagers are the\ngroup most at risk because they may have missed out on the MMR, which was\nintroduced in 1988. Some universities are now offering MMR vaccinations to\nstudents.\nLatest provisional figures show that for the 2nd quarter of this year there\nwere 1439 notifications of mumps in England, the highest number since 1995.\nIn the previous quarter, there were 972 notifications, also the highest\nsince 1995. It is estimated that around half of those notifications are\npositive. 'In the 2nd quarter of this year, there were 1439 notifications\nof mumps, and saliva tests were sent out and returned for 824 of those\ncases, of which 47 percent were positive,' said a spokesman for the Health\nProtection Agency. 'From that, we estimate that the number of positive\ncases overall for that quarter was around 700. It is high and it is the\nhighest for some years.' In Wales, both mumps and measles are on the\nincrease, and doctors are warning of outbreaks of both diseases.\n'The number of mumps cases stands at 323 so far, compared to 2 in 1999,'\nsaid a spokeswoman for the National Public Health Service for Wales. 'We\nare seeing cases of mumps and measles in younger children because of poor\nuptake of the MMR vaccine. 'Our overall uptake is 78 percent, but in some\nareas it is as low as 69 percent. One in 5 children who started school in\nSeptember was not protected against mumps, measles or rubella. We are\nworried and we are warning of the danger of outbreaks. 'We think about 3/4\nof the cases of mumps are teenagers, and the majority of these cases are\npeople who were born before the MMR launch in 1988. They may have had\nrubella and measles vaccine, but that didn't contain mumps. Our advice is\nthat people who are not protected, including teenagers, should have the MMR.'\nThere have been warnings that the fall in the take-up of the MMR, blamed on\ncontroversial and hotly disputed links that have been made between the\nvaccine and autism, will result in more outbreaks of measles and rubella.\nLess attention has been paid to mumps, which is often considered a benign\nillness with low mortality rates. But doctors warn that it should not be\nunderestimated.\n--\nH.Larry Penning\n<hlpenning@yahoo.com>\n[Similar data have been reported by the Information and Statistics Division\nof the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland. Over the past 18 months the\nincidences of suspected (but not necessarily confirmed) mumps rose by 27\npercent, rubella by 22 percent, and measles by 18 percent in children under\n15 (see: <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/uk_news/scotland/3227345.stm>).

Notifications of rubella increased from 222 in\n2001 to 270 in 2002. In Scotland take-up rates for the triple measles,\nmumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine are running at their lowest levels for at\nleast 8 years.\nA similar upsurge in mumps cases in Northern Ireland was reported in\nProMED-mail in 2001. The increase in mumps cases is occurring nationwide,\nirrespective of social or local economic factors, and can be related\ndirectly to the decline in acceptance of the MMR triple vaccine by parents.\nSince replacement in September 1992 of the Urabe strain of mumps virus by\nthe Jeryl Lynn strain, the triple MMR vaccine has performed satisfactorily\nwith no serious complications, notwithstanding the subsequent finding that\nthe Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps virus is a mixture of 2 distinct isolates\n(Afzal et al., J Gen Virol 75, 2139, 1994).

Since 1990 three strains of mumps virus - Urabe,\nJeryl-Lynn, and Rubini - have been used in MMR vaccines. The Urabe strain\nwas withdrawn in 1992 after an increased risk of aseptic meninigitis was\nreported in other countries and the Rubini strain was purchased between\n1993 and 1995. In more recent years the Jeryl-Lynn strain (vaccine efficacy\n75%) has also been used (KT Goh, personal communication). The incidence of\nmumps increased from 674 cases in 1997 to 1183 cases in 1998, 2586 cases\nwere reported in the first seven months of 1999, and it is estimated that\nthe incidence will reach 200 per 100 000 population by the end of 1999.\nForty-four per cent (258) of 592 cases that arose in the last four months\nof 1998 had received MMR vaccine. Of 195 whose mumps vaccine strain was\nknown, 144 (74%) had received the Rubini strain, 42 (22%) the Jeryl-Lynn\nstrain, and nine (5%) the Urabe strain. About 75% of cases had received MMR\nvaccine between one and four years before developing mumps.\nEpidemiological evidence suggested that the Rubini vaccine strain offered\nno protection. One hundred and forty of 1546 children who had been\nvaccinated with the Rubini strain developed mumps - an attack rate of 9%.\nThe short interval between vaccination and illness indicated primary rather\nthan secondary vaccine failure due waning immunity over time.\nSeroepidemiological evidence showed that the prevalence of mumps antibody\nin children aged under 5 years of age was 22% in 1989 before MMR was\nintroduced. It increased to 72% in 1993 after mumps vaccination with the\nUrabe and Jeryl-Lynn strains was introduced, but it fell to 26% in 1998.\nThe Ministry of Health in Singapore deregistered the MMR vaccine containing\nthe Rubini strain in May 1999.\nThe poor protection of the Rubini strain in mumps vaccine has been noted in\nother countries (2-4). In Portugal, Rubini replaced the Urabe strain in MMR\nvaccine in October 1992 and resulted in a large increase in the incidence\nof mumps in children (5). The highest rates of mumps occurred in children\naged 1 to 4 years during a mumps epidemic in 1995/96. By January 1998 all\nPortuguese health centres had begun to use MMR vaccine containing the Jeryl\nLynn strain in place of the Rubini strain (6).\nReferences:\nGoh KT.

The newspaper said that\naccording to the Public Health Laboratory Service, cases of mumps have\nalmost doubled following a drop of 12% in the number of children being\nimmunized with the MMRV. There is continuing public anxiety that the\ncombined vaccine might trigger autism or bowel disease. It said the\noutbreak was particularly severe in Northern Ireland, where cases of mumps\nhad risen tenfold from 95 cases in 1999 to 1000 last year.\nMeanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph reports that a doctor who has been offering\nsingle vaccines instead of the triple vaccine has been ordered to appear\nbefore the General Medical Council (GMC) disciplinary body and could be\nbarred from medical practice. It said that Peter Mansfield, a former\ngeneral practitioner (GP) who has been seeing up to 70 families [at] a time\nat twice-monthly private clinics in Worcestershire, was told last week that\nthe GMC intends to consider his conduct because 'it may pose an immediate\nrisk to patient safety.' The GMC's intervention follows a complaint by\nWorcester Health Authority alleging that Mansfield has been putting\nchildren 'at risk' because his actions are 'outside normal clinical\npractice' and against Department of Health advice. Mansfield told the\nnewspaper he would vigorously defend his actions. 'The people who have come\nto us have denied their children MMR, in some cases as long as 3 years ago.\nThe single measles vaccine I am prescribing is the best available for\nsomeone who is unwilling to have MMR. The Department of Health's view is a\ndenial of choice.' The report notes that a GMC ruling against Mansfield\nwould make it difficult for any other doctor to continue to offer the 3\nvaccines separately and would have far-reaching implications for the\nfreedom of doctors to prescribe the medicines of their choice.\nThe row over MMR began 3 years ago and continued earlier this year when Dr.\nAndrew Wakefield, a researcher at the Royal Free Hospital in London, said\nhe had seen 170 children with a new syndrome of digestive problems and\nautistic behavior, the 'majority' of whom had fallen ill after the triple\njab. He suggested that the safest option was for children to be given the\nvaccines separately. The Department of Health dismissed the research as\n'bad science' and launched a GBP 3 million [(US $4.25 million)] campaign in\nJanuary to reassure parents. Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer,\nadvised doctors that children should not be given separate measles, mumps\nand rubella vaccines in place of MMRV because there was a 'clear risk of harm.'\n[Byline: Richard Woodman]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[An increase in measles as a consequence of reduced uptake of MMR vaccine\nhas been forecast, but the increase in incidence of mumps is potentially a\nmore serious development. - Mod.CP]\n....................cp/pg/ds\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

An investigation\nwas initiated with the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC).\nBetween 1 January 1997 and 31 March 1997, a total of 83 cases of mumps were\nreported via the BC Communicable Disease Surveillance System.\nA universal combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) immunization program\nwas introduced in BC in 1981 for children aged >12 months.\nInitial case follow-ups by the V/RHB suggested that public social events\nwere risk factors for acquiring mumps in the young adult age group. A\ncase-control study was initiated to examine this hypothesis and to further\nexplore the outcomes of mumps illness. Vaccine effectiveness, ascertained\nby self-reported immunization status, was estimated to be 80% (95%\nconfidence interval [CI] = 29% to 96%).\nEighty-eight percent (45/51) of the cases reported being in the Greater\nVancouver area during the exposure period. Among the 47 matched\ncase-control pairs, contact with a person with mumps was significantly\nassociated with illness (odds ratio = 13, 95% CI = 1.95 to 552). Sixteen\nof the 40 cases aged 17 to 40 years, and one of the nine cases aged <17\nyears reported attending a 'rave' party during the exposure period.\n'Raves' are very large gatherings of teenagers and young adults who listen\nand dance to electronic music in warehouse type venues. Of the risk\nfactors examined, exposure to rave parties was the most strongly associated\nwith illness (odds ratio = 17, 95% CI = 2.7 to 710). All 'rave' attendees\nreported sharing drinks and dancing in close proximity to others.\nAttending educational institutions, having contact with >50 persons per day\nat work, being a health-care professional, attending dance clubs, bars, or\nother social events, and playing group sports were not associated with\nillness.\nThe increased incidence rates in this outbreak suggest that the 1957 to\n1980 birth cohorts were most at risk. These incompletely vaccinated birth\ncohorts sustain an adult population susceptible to outbreaks of mumps in\nthe future.

Attending educational institutions, having contact with >50 persons per day\nat work, being a health-care professional, attending dance clubs, bars, or\nother social events, and playing group sports were not associated with\nillness. \nProMED-mail\ne-mail: <promed@usa.healthnet.org>\n Sixteen\nof the 40 cases aged 17 to 40 years, and one of the nine cases aged <17\nyears reported attending a 'rave' party during the exposure period. These social events, characterized by close contact and sharing\nof drinks, should be considered as a risk factor for mumps and other\nillnesses transmissible by person-to-person droplet spread. Among the 47 matched\ncase-control pairs, contact with a person with mumps was significantly\nassociated with illness (odds ratio = 13, 95% CI = 1.95 to 552). Of the risk\nfactors examined, exposure to rave parties was the most strongly associated\nwith illness (odds ratio = 17, 95% CI = 2.7 to 710). In response to the outbreak and this investigation, the V/RHB released a\npublic notice about 'raves' as a risk factor for acquiring mumps and a\nreminder about MMR vaccinations. This is the second communicable disease outbreak reported to be associated\nwith 'rave' parties in Canada, the first being a 1996 meningitis outbreak\nin Quebec. This investigation highlights, as previously described, the\nhigh proportion of extra-salivary symptoms of mumps experienced by an adult\npopulation. A\ncase-control study was initiated to examine this hypothesis and to further\nexplore the outcomes of mumps illness. These incompletely vaccinated birth\ncohorts sustain an adult population susceptible to outbreaks of mumps in\nthe future.
