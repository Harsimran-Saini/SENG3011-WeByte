In August and September 2020, 44 Danes became ill, including 30 women and 14 men between 0 and 75 years old; 13 people were hospitalized. Those sickened mostly live in Hovedstaden.\n\nA case was defined as a patient with either a culture-positive sample for _Shigella sonnei_ or people PCR-positive for the ipaH gene, which is a marker for all _Shigella_ species and enteroinvasive _E. coli_, from August 2020 onward. The Statens Serum Institut (SSI) investigated the outbreak with the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestyrelsen) and DTU Food Institute.\n\nInquiries showed the majority of patients had eaten fresh mint bought at local greengrocers or bazaars in and around the Copenhagen area from mid to late August 2020. Because of the herb's short shelf life, it is thought there is no longer any contaminated product on the market and no risk of more people being infected.\n\nAmong the 36 interviewed patients, 24 had eaten fresh mint before disease onset. Of the 24 cases, 22 had bought it in a greengrocer or bazaar. It was not sold in retail chains. A total of 12 different places were mentioned, which indicated the source of infection was a locally traded food. Traceback was difficult, as the mint sellers had several suppliers during the outbreak period and had bought different types of mint packed in a variety of ways. A lack of invoices for purchase of the mint also hampered the investigation. The duration of the outbreak indicated there was probably only one or a few contaminated batches.\n\nThe Danish Veterinary and Food Administration has seized mint lacking traceability details and has taken some test samples with results pending.\n\nLuise Muller, an epidemiologist at SSI, said the outbreak was an opportunity to remind consumers that fresh herbs must always be washed thoroughly before eating them. SSI checked with European health agencies, but no other countries have reported an increase in _Shigella_ infections in the same time period. Infections with _Shigella_ are not common in Denmark and are most often acquired in connection with travel abroad. Interviews with those affected showed they had not been traveling before they became ill.\n\nPrevious outbreaks in Denmark include one in 2007, when more than 210 people became ill from eating contaminated imported baby corn. Another outbreak in 2009 involved 10 people and was traced to fresh, raw sugar peas (sugar snaps) imported from Kenya.\n\nMost people infected with _Shigella_ develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or 2 after they are exposed to the bacteria. Shigellosis usually resolves in 5 to 7 days, but some people may experience symptoms from a few days to 4 or more weeks. People who are in poor health or who have weakened immune systems are more likely to get sick for a longer period of time.\n\n[Byline: Joe Whitworth]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named.

Officials said Tue 6 Nov 2018 that 22 cases of shigellosis have been confirmed among Wake Robin residents, staff, and visitors, and 44 probable cases have been reported. Shigella is a type of bacteria that causes diarrhea, stomach cramps and sometimes a fever.\n\nThe Health Department says it started its investigation on 18 Oct 2018. It says the CDC is helping to recommend treatment alternatives and prevention for the extensively drug-resistant _Shigella sonnei_ infections. Shigellosis spreads easily from person to person.

In patients with no fever and significant abdominal pain with or without blood in the diarrhea, the institution of antimicrobials, if the patient is infected with an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, could precipitate hemolytic uremic syndrome. Clearly, viral diarrhea requires no intervention with antibacterial agents.\n\nRegarding shigellosis, CDC made new recommendations about increasing fluoroquinolone resistance in 2017 (see below). In its classic form manifesting as bacterial dysentery ('the bloody flux') with high fever, bloody and mucous containing diarrhea and tenesmus (spasmotic pain when passing the diarrhea), patients are usually hospitalized and empiric antimicrobials begun prior to the confirmation of shigellosis. Withholding therapy in these cases not only may prolong illness but also prolong the infectivity period in this highly transmissible enteric infection.

Between March and November 2018, 17 cases of _Shigella_ dysentery with resistance to several 1st-line antimicrobials were detected. It appears that transmission is clustered among gay and other men who have sex with men (MSM). As many as 14 of the 17 UK cases involve men and 9 further cases have been identified in the USA, all involving MSM, AIDSmap reports.\n\nStandard treatment with 1st line antimicrobials such as azithromycin and ceftriaxone may not be effective, though other oral antimicrobials will still work.\n\n_Shigella_ causes severe, prolonged diarrhea and stomach cramps. It is transmitted by contact with very small amounts of human feces and can be passed on during certain sexual activities. Rimming, fingering, fisting, anal sex, handling sex toys after use in the anus and occasionally oral sex can all carry a risk. The bacterium may pass from fingers to the mouth, AIDSmap reports.\n\nSymptoms typically occur within 3 days of exposure and include frequent diarrhea lasting more than 48 hours, stomach cramps, fever, vomiting, general weakness and tiredness.

Current interpretive criteria provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) categorize these strains as susceptible to ciprofloxacin, which is a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent and a key agent in the management of shigellosis.\n\nHowever, recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local public health partners show that these strains often have a quinolone resistance gene that may lead to clinically significant reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. Clinicians treating patients with multidrug-resistant shigellosis for whom antimicrobial treatment is indicated should avoid prescribing fluoroquinolones if the ciprofloxacin MIC is 0.12 \u03bcg/mL or higher even if the laboratory report identifies the isolate as susceptible, and should work closely with their clinical microbiology laboratory and infectious disease specialists to determine appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Shigellosis is a nationally notifiable condition, and all cases of shigellosis should be reported to local health departments.\n\nCDC has identified an increase in _Shigella_ isolates in the USA with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL for the fluoroquinolone antimicrobial ciprofloxacin. Preliminary data suggest that all _Shigella_ isolates with ciprofloxacin MICs in this range for which results are available harbor at least one quinolone resistance gene known to confer reduced susceptibility in enteric bacteria. _Shigella_ isolates without a quinolone resistance gene typically have a ciprofloxacin MIC of \u22640.015 \u03bcg/mL. Current CLSI criteria categorize _Shigella_ isolates with a ciprofloxacin MIC of \u22641 \u03bcg/mL as susceptible to ciprofloxacin (1).\n\nCDC does not yet know whether fluoroquinolone treatment of a shigellosis with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL is associated with a worse clinical outcome for the patient or if such treatment increases the risk of transmission to other individuals. In _Salmonella_ isolates, ciprofloxacin MICs of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL have been associated with reduced susceptibility, prolonged clinical illness, and treatment failures and are now categorized by CLSI as intermediate or resistant to ciprofloxacin in _Salmonella_ species.\n\nFluoroquinolone resistance is of particular concern given that data from the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System indicate that many _Shigella_ isolates with a quinolone resistance gene also are resistant to many other commonly used treatment agents, such as azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and ampicillin. This susceptibility profile may encourage clinicians to prescribe fluoroquinolone antibiotics to patients who require treatment.\n\nRising fluoroquinolone MIC values among _Shigella_ isolates may be related to the emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes in _Shigella_ species in the USA. _Shigella_ strains harboring PMQR genes were identified earlier this year [2017] following whole genome sequencing of isolates from a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Shigella flexneri_ infections predominantly affecting adult men, many of whom identify as men who have sex with men, according to epidemiologic data collected by CDC's _Shigella_ program as part of outbreak response. PMQR genes have also been identified in sporadic cases of _Shigella sonnei_. Plasmid-mediated resistance genes are of particular concern because of their ability to spread between bacteria and their ability to promote chromosomal mutations conferring quinolone resistance, potentially resulting in rapid spread of fluoroquinolone resistance within or between populations of bacteria. The prevalence of PMQR genes among all USA _Shigella_ isolates is currently unknown.\n\nAny patient with shigellosis could carry a strain harboring a quinolone resistance gene with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL.\nThe emergence of _Shigella_ species with ciprofloxacin MICs of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL and their association with quinolone resistance genes raises the following concerns:\n\n-Fluoroquinolone treatment of shigellosis with a strain harboring a quinolone resistance gene may be less effective and may increase the risk of a more severe clinical course for the individual (e.g., increased duration or severity of symptoms, increased need for hospitalization or admission to an intensive care unit, increased length of hospitalization, or increased risk of death).\n-Fluoroquinolone treatment of shigellosis with a strain harboring a quinolone resistance gene also may increase the risk of secondary cases, if the treatment prolongs the duration or increases the quantity of organisms shed in the stool, given the very low infectious dose required for transmission of _Shigella_ bacteria.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICIANS\nDiagnosis:\n-Order stool culture for patients suspected of having shigellosis to obtain isolates for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.\n-Culture-independent diagnostic testing does not provide an isolate and therefore cannot be used to assess susceptibility.\n-Order antimicrobial susceptibility testing when ordering stool culture for _Shigella_.\n-When antimicrobial susceptibility testing is performed by broth microdilution, request ciprofloxacin testing that includes dilutions of 0.12 \u03bcg/mL or lower.\n-Even when treatment is not indicated, identifying patients with drug-resistant infections (i.e., ordering susceptibility testing) will help to inform public health management, such as when to return to work, school, and group settings.\n\nManagement:\n-Do not routinely prescribe antimicrobial therapy for shigellosis. Instead, reserve antibiotic therapy for patients for whom it is clinically indicated or when public health officials advise treatment in an outbreak setting.\n-Shigellosis is generally a self-limited infection lasting 5-7 days.\n-Unnecessary treatment with antimicrobials promotes resistance.\n-Treatment can shorten the duration of some illnesses, though typically only by 1-2 days.\n-Empiric treatment with an antibiotic to which the organism is resistant may worsen symptoms or prolong the duration of shedding of the organism.\n-If empiric treatment is clinically indicated before antimicrobial susceptibility results are available, refer to recent hospital, clinical laboratory, or public health agency antibiograms.\n-Antimicrobial treatment is recommended for patients who are immunocompromised or who develop severe illness (e.g., patients requiring hospitalization, those with invasive disease, or those with complications).\n-Local or state health officials may advise antimicrobial treatment to mitigate or prevent outbreaks in certain settings (e.g., childcare, food handling).\n-When antimicrobial treatment is indicated, tailor the choice to antimicrobial susceptibility results as soon as possible with special attention given to the MIC for fluoroquinolones.\n-Avoid prescribing fluoroquinolones if the ciprofloxacin MIC is 0.12 \u03bcg/mL or higher even if the laboratory report identifies the isolate as susceptible.\n-Know the potential risks of fluoroquinolone treatment of shigellosis with ciprofloxacin MICs in this range, including possible treatment failure and increased risk of secondary transmission.\n-The interpretation of MIC values varies for the different fluoroquinolones; if susceptibility results are reported for a fluoroquinolone other than ciprofloxacin, contact the microbiology laboratory for assistance with interpretation.\n-If MIC values are not reported to the clinician with susceptibility results, consider contacting the microbiology laboratory where the susceptibility testing was performed to determine the ciprofloxacin MIC value before treating a patient with a fluoroquinolone agent. Some susceptibility testing methods do not produce a MIC value; the impact of a quinolone resistance gene on test results by other methods (e.g., disk diffusion) is not yet known.\n-Consult an infectious disease specialist for cases where the _Shigella_ isolate is resistant to multiple antimicrobials and appropriate treatment is unclear.\n-Obtain follow-up stool cultures in shigellosis patients who have continued or worsening symptoms despite antimicrobial therapy.\n-Consult your local or state health department for guidance on when patients may return to childcare, school, or work.\n-Counsel patients with active diarrhea on how they can prevent spreading the infection to others, regardless of whether antimicrobial treatment is prescribed.\n-Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet, after handling a soiled diaper, and before eating.\n-Avoid preparing food for others, when possible.\n-Children with active diarrhea should not attend childcare, school, or group activities while they are ill.\n-Wait to have sex (vaginal, anal, and oral) for 2 weeks after you no longer have diarrhea. Use safe sex practices for several weeks after resuming sex, because _Shigella_ bacteria may still be in stool for several weeks.\n\nReporting:\n-Shigellosis is a nationally notifiable condition. Report all cases of shigellosis to your local health department.\n-Clinicians who identify a patient with shigellosis and a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL should include this finding along with other information regarding the case to their local health department to facilitate further testing of the isolate.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR LABORATORIES\n-Know that a _Shigella_ isolate with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL may be associated with the presence of a quinolone resistance gene.\n-Test _Shigella_ isolates using susceptibility panels that include 0.12, 0.25, and 0.5 \u03bcg/mL dilutions for ciprofloxacin, when using a commercially available automated system (such as BD Phoenix, MicroScan, Vitek 2, or similar system) for susceptibility testing.\n-Include MIC values for fluoroquinolone agents in the susceptibility testing report for _Shigella_ isolates.\n-Report all findings of strains of _Shigella_ with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL to the state public health laboratory, and submit isolates to it to facilitate further phenotypic and genetic testing.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS\n-Know that a _Shigella_ isolate with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL may be associated with the presence of a quinolone resistance gene.\n-Contact CDC at <EntericBacteria@cdc.gov> if you receive reports of patients with shigellosis and possible fluoroquinolone treatment failure.\n-Submit _Shigella_ isolates with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL to the state public health laboratory for whole genome sequencing, if possible. If the state laboratory does not have capacity to sequence the isolate, please notify CDC at EntericBacteria@cdc.gov.\n\nWhat CDC is Doing:\n-CDC is working with state and local public health departments and clinical partners to investigate if clinical outcomes are worse for patients infected with _Shigella_ strains harboring a quinolone resistance gene who receive ciprofloxacin treatment.\n-CDC has notified representatives at the FDA and CLSI, who will review CDC's findings to determine whether a change to the susceptible range of MIC values for ciprofloxacin in _Shigella_ is warranted.\n-CDC will continue to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibility of _Shigella_ isolates and will perform genetic testing on select strains with ciprofloxacin MICs of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL or higher to confirm the presence and type of quinolone resistance genes.\n\nReference\nClinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.

For self-limited milder bacterial enteric diseases, antimicrobials offer little to the patient except for select of increasingly resistant microflora and drug reactions. Unless salmonellosis is associated with bacteremia, there is little reason to treat. In patients with no fever and significant abdominal pain with or without blood in the diarrhea, the institution of antimicrobials, if the patient is infected with an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, could precipitate hemolytic uremic syndrome. Clearly viral diarrhea requires no intervention with antibacterial agents.\n\nThese CDC recommendations related to shigellosis. In its classic form manifesting as bacterial dysentery ('the bloody flux') with high fever, bloody and mucous containing diarrhea and tenesmus (spasmotic pain when passing the diarrhea), patients are usually hospitalized and empiric antimicrobials begun prior to the confirmation of shigellosis. Withholding therapy in these cases not only may prolong illness but also prolong the infectivity period in this highly transmissible enteric infection. These recommendations relate more to the milder nonhospitalized cases where withholding antimicrobials can be beneficial, not only for the patient but also for public health. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]", "summary": "The emergence of _Shigella_ species with ciprofloxacin MICs of 0.12-1 \u03bcg/mL and their association with quinolone resistance genes raises the following concerns:\n\n-Fluoroquinolone treatment of shigellosis with a strain harboring a quinolone resistance gene may be less effective and may increase the risk of a more severe clinical course for the individual (e.g., increased duration or severity of symptoms, increased need for hospitalization or admission to an intensive care unit, increased length of hospitalization, or increased risk of death). \n\nWhat CDC is Doing:\n-CDC is working with state and local public health departments and clinical partners to investigate if clinical outcomes are worse for patients infected with _Shigella_ strains harboring a quinolone resistance gene who receive ciprofloxacin treatment.

Those cases are in 2 counties: Saginaw and Genesee, which is where Flint is located [on the eastern side of the state - Mod.LL]. At least 27 people have been hospitalized in this particular outbreak because their illnesses were so severe.\n\nOfficials say that there were fewer new shigellosis cases in September 2016, and the cases that were reported in October 2016 are being analyzed. The CDC is working with state and local officials, partner organizations, and community residents to try to find the source of this outbreak. The illnesses in this outbreak were reported to public health officials between 1 Mar 2016 and 26 Oct 2016. While there are typically about 300 to 400 cases of shigellosis in Michigan every year, this is a disproportionately high number of Shigella cases, especially since those sickened live in only 2 counties.\n\nOfficials will be contacting people who are sick to interview them about foods eaten and other activities that could have caused this outbreak. Some think that the water crisis in Flint, which was created when an administrator switched the city's water supply to the Flint River, may have contributed to this outbreak since residents are now fearful of using the water to bathe.\n\nShigella outbreaks are caused by the fecal-oral route. In other words, a small amount of feces contaminated with the pathogenic bacterium gets into someone's mouth, through contaminated food or drink or poor hygiene, and makes them sick. People can get sick when they change diapers of children who are sick, touching people who are sick, or eating food prepared by someone with this infection.\n\nThe best way to prevent the spread of this illness, and most other infectious diseases, is proper handwashing. Washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is the best way to remove any bacteria from your hands. Hand sanitizers that contain at least 60 percent alcohol will kill Shigella bacteria, but don't work well if your hands are greasy or very dirty. Baby wipes do not kill Shigella bacteria and are not recommended for cleaning your hands.

For comparison, they also sequenced resistant samples from Australia and Ireland.\n\nThe study, results of which were published in the journal PLoS Medicine in August 2016, showed that all of the resistant _S. sonnei_ formed a single clade found in South Asia and that most of the positive results reported outside of Asia could be linked to recent travel to India.\n\n'We were running a project on some shigella isolates from Bhutan that were fluoroquinolone-resistant,' corresponding author Stephen Baker, a microbiologist based at the hospital, one of Oxford University's clinical research units, told SciDev.Net. Fluoroquinolones are a family of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is commonly prescribed to treat shigellosis. 'We started working on some resistant strains from Viet Nam also and found they were much more closely related than we thought they would be,' said Baker.\n\nBaker and colleagues sequenced 12 resistant samples from Bhutan, 11 samples from Viet Nam, and a sample each from Thailand and Cambodia. They also worked with partners to sequence 19 samples in Australia and 16 in Ireland. 'Once we had found the relationship between the Bhutanese isolates and the Vietnamese [samples], I contacted some of my collaborators and asked what strains/data they had; they all had a common ancestor,' Baker said.\n\nOf the 45 samples obtained from outside South Asia, 27 were from people who had travelled to the region, and 80 per cent had visited India. Baker said the resistant _S. sonnei_ strain is most likely 'very common in India, but infrequently reported.'\n\nBased on the data, Baker and his colleagues were able to pinpoint South Asia as the primary source of antibiotic-resistant _S. sonnei_ that is spreading throughout Asia, Australia, the US, and Europe. 'The genetics show these organisms have arisen and are spreading from South Asia,' he said. Baker attributed the outbreak to increased prosperity in South Asia and the overuse of fluoroquinolones, creating 'huge selective pressure' on _S. sonnei_.\n\nJason Andrews, assistant professor of infectious diseases at Stanford Medicine, University of California, said that the results of the study were both 'compelling and alarming' and 'underscore the urgent need to address drug-resistant pathogens through vaccination or other measures.'\n\nIn particular, Andrews noted, the antimicrobial resistance problem in Asia has quickly become a global problem, 'requiring a global response in terms of resources and strategies for containing resistant enteric bacteria.'\n\n[byline: Sanjit Das]\n\n[1.

Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue in the _Shigellae_, particularly as a specific multidrug-resistant (MDR) lineage of _Shigella sonnei_ (lineage III) is becoming globally dominant. Ciprofloxacin is a recommended treatment for _Shigella_ infections. However, ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ are being increasingly isolated in Asia and sporadically reported on other continents. We hypothesized that Asia is a primary hub for the recent international spread of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_.\n\n'Methods and Findings. We performed whole-genome sequencing on a collection of 60 contemporaneous ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ isolated in four countries within Asia (Viet Nam, n = 11; Bhutan, n = 12; Thailand, n = 1; Cambodia, n = 1) and 2 outside of Asia (Australia, n = 19; Ireland, n = 16). We reconstructed the recent evolutionary history of these organisms and combined these data with their geographical location of isolation. Placing these sequences into a global phylogeny, we found that all ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ formed a single clade within a Central Asian expansion of lineage III. Furthermore, our data show that resistance to ciprofloxacin within _S. sonnei_ may be globally attributed to a single clonal emergence event, encompassing sequential gyrA-S83L, parC-S80I, and gyrA-D87G mutations. Geographical data predict that South Asia is the likely primary source of these organisms, which are being regularly exported across Asia and intercontinentally into Australia, the United States and Europe. Our analysis was limited by the number of _S. sonnei_ sequences available from diverse geographical areas and time periods, and we cannot discount the potential existence of other unsampled reservoir populations of antimicrobial-resistant _S. sonnei_.\n\n'Conclusions. This study suggests that a single clone, which is widespread in South Asia, is likely driving the current intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ and is capable of establishing endemic transmission in new locations. Despite being limited in geographical scope, our work has major implications for understanding the international transfer of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, with _S. sonnei_ acting as a tractable model for studying how antimicrobial-resistant Gram negative bacteria spread globally.'\n\nShigella causes about 500 000 cases of diarrhea in the United States annually (https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/resources.html). Of the 4 species (_Shigella sonnei_, _Shigella flexneri_, _Shigella boydii_, and _Shigella dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the commonest species in the United States, as well as becoming the predominant species worldwide according the authors of the journal article. Humans are the only reservoir for shigella, which is easily transmitted person-to-person, because shigella are relatively resistant to gastric acidity and only a few organisms if swallowed are sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract. The organism is spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that has come into contact with stool of a person infected with shigella.\n\nSince shigellosis usually resolves in 5-7 days without antibiotic treatment, antimicrobial treatment is used for more severe disease. Antibiotics have also been often used to lessen transmission by limiting the duration of fecal shedding that may otherwise last up to several weeks. However, resistance to antimicrobials has restricted treatment options. Resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is common, and resistance to ciprofloxacin and azithromycin, as well as 3rd-generation cephalosporins, is increasing in the US and worldwide (http://www.cdc.gov/narms/pdf/2012-annual-report-narms-508c.pdf). Outbreaks of infections caused by multidrug-resistant shigella, including isolates resistant to azithromycin or ciprofloxacin -- the 2 antibiotics most commonly used to treat shigellosis -- have been reported in Australia, Europe, and North America among men who have sex with men (MSM).

But one infection in particular has seen a dramatic increase in 2015.\n\nShigellosis is a diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium _Shigella_. According to the Kansas City, Missouri, Health Department, there are normally only 10 cases of shigellosis per year in the area. However, this year [2015], that number has spiked to more than 150. Most of the cases in Kansas City have been children in daycare and elementary schools.\n\nShigellosis is transmitted by direct or indirect fecal-oral contact with someone who has symptoms. For example, you could contract it from someone who didn't wash their hands thoroughly before preparing your food or from swimming in a contaminated pool.\n\nMost shigellosis cases resolve on their own. While some cases respond to antimicrobials, 3 strains have been found in Kansas City that are resistant to some antimicrobials. For those with no complications, the main focus is to stay hydrated when losing fluids through diarrhea.\n\n[Byline: Dr Greg Sweat]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Missouri outbreak is not likely to be a mostly point-source foodborne outbreak from a restaurant, as occurred in the California posting above, but rather introduction of shigellosis into settings where person-to-person transmission is more likely to occur, such as day care and elementary schools and additional cases in the household setting. - Mod.LL\n\nThe state of Missouri can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/227. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Missouri outbreak is not likely to be a mostly point-source foodborne outbreak from a restaurant, as occurred in the California posting above, but rather introduction of shigellosis into settings where person-to-person transmission is more likely to occur, such as day care and elementary schools and additional cases in the household setting.

Based on preliminary testing of stool specimens, _Entamoeba histolytica_ infection was suspected as a possible cause. _Shigella_ was also suspected in a subset of samples. On 22 May 2014, the American Samoa Department of Health requested assistance from CDC with the outbreak investigation. The goals of the investigation were to establish the presence of an outbreak, characterize its epidemiology and etiology, and recommend control measures. The CDC field team reviewed the emergency department log book for cases of diarrheal illness during 15 Apr 2014-13 Jun 2014. During this period, 280 cases of diarrheal illness were recorded, with a peak occurring on 10 May 2014. Twice as many cases occurred during this period in 2014 compared with the same period in 2011, the most recent year for which comparable surveillance data were available. Cases were widely distributed across the island. The highest number of cases occurred in children aged 0-9 years. Across age groups, cases were similarly distributed among males and females. These patterns are not consistent with the epidemiology of disease caused by _E. histolytica_, which tends to cause more cases in males of all ages.\n\nHypothesis-generating interviews with families of 13 patients did not reveal any common water, food, sewage, or event exposures. 8 participants reported having ill household contacts, with family contacts often becoming ill within 1-3 days after the participant's illness onset. 6 stool specimens were sent to CDC. All were negative for ameba, including _E. histolytica_, by multiple laboratory methods. All 6 specimens were also negative for Cryptosporidium and Giardia by a polymerase chain reaction test. However, an invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) gene sequence, a genetic marker of _Shigella_, was identified in four specimens. Additionally, 7 isolates sent to the Hawaii Department of Health and CDC were identified as _Shigella flexneri_ serotype 7 (proposed; also referred to as provisional 88-893 or 1c), and 5 shared an indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern.\n\nShigella causes an estimated 500 000 cases of shigellosis per year in the USA (1). Most persons with shigellosis develop diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever, and stomach cramps 1-2 days after they are exposed to the bacteria. The illness usually resolves in 5-7 days. Careful and frequent hand washing and strict adherence to standard food and water safety precautions are the best defense against shigellosis (2).\n\nTogether, epidemiologic and laboratory data suggest this was a shigellosis outbreak with person-to-person transmission. This investigation highlights the importance of building epidemiologic and laboratory capacity for enteric illnesses and enhancing basic hand hygiene and prevention strategies in US territories.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Although many cases in England are associated with travel to high-incidence regions such as the Indian subcontinent, North and East Africa, and South America, outbreaks of _S. flexneri_ and _S. sonnei_ associated with sexual transmission between men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported in the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, Spain, Australia, Canada, and the USA [1-9].\n\nShigella reporting in England\n-----------------------------\nFecal specimens from cases with symptoms of gastrointestinal infection are submitted to local hospital, private and regional laboratories in England for culture of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_, _Salmonella_, _Campylobacter_ and _Shigella_ species. Local hospital laboratories are recommended to submit presumptive strains of _Shigella flexneri_ and other _Shigella_ spp to the Public Health England (PHE) national reference laboratory in London, the Gastrointestinal Bacteria Reference Unit (GBRU), for confirmation and typing, using standard biochemistry and serological tests [10]. Neither sexual behaviour nor orientation are routinely collected in this dataset, but the number of cases associated with sexual transmission among men may be approximated by using the GBRU typing data to identify diagnoses for men and women aged 16 to 60 years and excluding cases where recent travel outside the UK was reported. Given an assumption that equal numbers of men and women would be affected if transmission between men were not a risk factor, excess male cases are deemed likely to be in MSM.\n\nWe have previously reported a national outbreak and investigation of _S. flexneri_ 3a occurring in MSM between 2009 and 2011 [11]. Most of these were white, UK-born MSM, many were HIV-positive, and they reported being part of dense sexual networks involving high numbers of casual and regular partners. This outbreak was associated with (i) low awareness about the risk of enteric infections, (ii) chemsex (sexual activity while under the influence of [typically] stimulant drugs), and (iii) meeting sex partners and locating sex parties through social and sexual networking applications [12,13].\n\nRecent trends in shigellosis in England\n---------------------------------------\nWe examined recent trends in national _Shigella_ spp diagnoses to explore whether there is evidence for (i) ongoing sexual transmission of _S. flexneri_ 3a and (ii) transmission of other Shigella serotypes or species among men.\n\nBetween 1 Jan 2004 and 28 Feb 2015, the total number of _Shigella_ spp. diagnoses in England among 16 to 60 year olds was 9534 and of these, 5051 (53 percent) were not known to be associated with travel outside the UK. Among those without recent travel history, diagnoses of _S. flexneri_ 3a, _S. flexneri_ 2a, and _S. sonnei_ accounted for 77 percent (3795/4909) of all cases (Table [for Table and Figures, see source URL above - Mod.LL]). During the study period, 262 unique laboratories submitted isolates of _S. flexneri_ and 254 laboratories submitted isolates of _S. sonnei_.\n\nDiagnoses of _S. flexneri_ 3a in men increased steadily from 2004 to 2013 (from 3 to 154 cases) and fell in 2014 (118 cases), with sharp increases noted in 2009 and 2013; diagnoses in women during this period remained low (Table; Figure 1A). Diagnoses of _S. flexneri_ 2a in men followed a similar pattern, although increases emerged later, rising from a baseline of 9 cases in 2004 with peaks in 2010 (50 cases) and 2014 (220 cases); diagnoses in women during this period remained low (Table; Figure 1A). Diagnoses of _S. sonnei_ in men began to exceed those in women (147 compared with 133 cases) in 2010, and have since risen steadily in men (267 cases in 2014) while remaining stable in women (Table; Figure 1B).\n\nMale to female sex ratios also rose substantially during this period, and peaked in 2014 at 59.0:1, 16.9:1 and 2.5:1 for _S. flexneri_ 3a, _S. flexneri_ 2a, and _S. sonnei_ (Table). The age distribution for cases of _S. flexneri_ 3a, _S. flexneri_ 2a, and _S. sonnei_ was similar for men and women: 65 percent (1629/2504) of male cases and 61 percent (783/1291) of female cases were in those aged 25 to 44 years. However, geographic distribution differed: 64 percent (1574/2504) of male cases of _S. flexneri_ 2a, _S. flexneri_ 3a and _S. sonnei_ were reported by laboratories in London, Manchester, or Brighton, whereas only 38 percent (491/1291) of female cases were from these areas.\n\nIn 2014, among those with no recent travel history and assuming all excess male cases were in MSM, we approximate that 116 cases of _S. flexneri_ 3a (97 percent of all excess cases), 207 of _S. flexneri_ 2a (89 percent), and 161 of S. sonnei (43 percent) might have been acquired through sex between MSM.\n\nHigh levels of transmission of _S. flexneri_ 3a, _S. flexneri_ 2a, and _S. sonnei_ in men have been sustained into 2015 (Figure 2). Monthly reporting data suggest that a switch in the predominant serotype of _S. flexneri_ from type 3a to type 2a occurred from March 2014.\n\nLaboratory data over an 11-year period show ongoing endemic transmission of _S. flexneri_ 3a among men since 2009, and emerging epidemics of _S. flexneri_ 2a and _S. sonnei_ among men since 2011. Diagnoses in women during the same period have remained stable or declined. These data strongly suggest an intensification of the previously reported shigellosis epidemic in England associated with sexual transmission between MSM. The actual numbers are probably underestimated due to individuals in the community not seeking healthcare or not providing diagnostic stool specimens.\n\nEarly investigations into the _S. flexneri_ 3a outbreak in 2011 failed to identify a point source and found most cases occurred in MSM [11-13]. The present analysis lacks sexual behaviour data, but the concentration of shigellosis diagnoses in urban settings, where we know rates of HIV, gonorrhoea and syphilis in MSM are high, and the increase in specific strains and serotypes found in adult men and not women is consistent with most likely continued sexual transmission of _Shigella_ spp. among MSM. Nevertheless, there are other possible explanations for the excess in men. While reporting guidelines have not changed during the study period, some reporting practices may have changed leading to more samples obtained from men than from women being referred by laboratories. However, it seems unlikely that this would fully explain the extent of increases seen. Proactive campaigns have been undertaken by Public Health England (PHE) and the Terrence Higgins Trust (http://www.tht.org.uk/Shigella) to alert general practitioners (GPs) and other health professionals to sexually transmissible enteric infections (STEI) in MSM and to raise awareness among MSM through social media, the gay press, and leaflets in health clinics. These campaigns may have increased healthcare seeking and diagnostic testing among men. However, the campaigns did not start until 2013, after increases in _Shigella_ spp. diagnoses were first observed.\n\nThe emergence of these STEIs has coincided with increased diagnoses of gonorrhea, lymphogranuloma venereum, infectious syphilis, and a recent cluster of verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O117:H7 among MSM, particularly those co-infected with HIV [14-17]. The characteristics of men affected by these overlapping epidemics are very similar and this suggests an intensification of sexual networking among HIV-diagnosed MSM engaging in HIV seroadaptive behaviours, possibly facilitated by geo-spatial apps [14-18]. Indeed, the different timing and heterogeneity in species and types indicate separate introductions of Shigella spp. into this population, and is consistent with this hypothesis.\n\nRapid intercontinental dissemination through sexual transmission in MSM of a _S. flexneri_ 3a lineage with an azithromycin-resistance conferring plasmid has recently been demonstrated [19], and outbreaks of other STIs in MSM can spread quickly across Europe [20]. There is evidence that MSM may be more likely to engage in sexual risk behaviours while travelling abroad [21], raising the possibility of shigellosis outbreaks occurring elsewhere in Europe. We are currently reviewing laboratory reports of other enteric pathogens to explore whether sex between men might be an important route of transmission. MSM with symptoms of enteric pathogens may present to a range of healthcare settings including primary care, emergency departments, and specialist sexual health and gastroenterology services. To limit missed diagnostic opportunities, facilitate prompt diagnosis and appropriate management, including partner notification and appropriate antibiotic stewardship, healthcare professionals need to recognise the potential for STEIs in MSM and sensitively ascertain sexual history. Public health actions for shigellosis cases are described [22], but for MSM they should additionally include advice about when to resume sexual activity, partner notification, preventative advice about risky sexual behaviours, and screening for co-infection with STIs.\n\n[For References, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease. Shigellosis is acquired by fecal-oral transmission from someone who is excreting _Shigella_ in the stool. The risk for sexual transmission shigellosis has been found to be direct oral-anal contact (rimming) during the week before onset of shigellosis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15307964). Other enteric pathogens, such as hepatitis A, _Entamoeba histolytica_, _Giardia lamblia_, _Campylobacter_, and _Salmonella_, also can be transmitted sexually; but, possibly because _Shigella_ withstand the low pH of gastric juice, the low number of _Shigella_ required for transmission of shigellosis (as few as 10 to 200 organisms), as compared with that of many other enteric pathogens, facilitates person-to-person transmission of shigellosis. However, because feces can contain multiple pathogens, polymicrobial infections can result from a single sexual exposure. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/279.]", "summary": "In 2014, among those with no recent travel history and assuming all excess male cases were in MSM, we approximate that 116 cases of _S. flexneri_ 3a (97 percent of all excess cases), 207 of _S. flexneri_ 2a (89 percent), and 161 of S. sonnei (43 percent) might have been acquired through sex between MSM.

CBS2 was the first to break the story earlier this week of shigellosis in Williamsburg and Borough Park sections of Brooklyn. As CBS2's Weijia Jiang reported exclusively, a new outbreak has stricken residents miles away in Rockland County.\n\n'We began to see it spreading in other counties, not only Rockland, as well,' said Dr. Oscar Alleyne, director of public health planning for the Rockland County Health Department.\n\nAlleyne has been tracking shigella infections - or shigellosis - a highly contagious disease that can cause severe intestinal distress. So far in January 2015, there have been 17 confirmed cases in Rockland County, and from November through December 2014, there were 49.\nAlleyne believes patients may have contracted the shigellosis cases from Brooklyn, where 80 cases have been reported since November 2014.\n\n'A lot of the times, there's a direct pipeline with families,' Alleyne said. 'To be honest, our boundaries are never really boundaries. People travel back and forth all the time.' And just like in Borough Park and Williamsburg, most of the shigella patients in Monsey and Spring Valley are young children.\n\nShigella spreads through person-to-person contact, and direct contact with feces, or contaminated food or water. Symptoms include severe diarrhea, stomach cramps and fever, and the most severe cases involve convulsions and kidney failure. Children between the ages of 2 and 4 are at the highest risk.\n\nIn Brooklyn, Dr. Olitsa Roth told CBS2's Ilana Gold she has treated several cases in recent weeks. She said most cases are very mild and might just involve a bellyache, but some may be more severe. 'The message is for parents -- if the child isn't feeling good, be on high alert and check their bowel movement,' Roth said.\n\nAlleyne said it is nearly impossible to identify the original source of an outbreak, but he said once shigella is in a community, it spreads quickly.\n\nDoctors said the best tip for prevention is washing hands often.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n*****\n[2] New York (Kings County)\nDate: Thu 15 Jan 2015\nSource: DNA Info [edited]\nhttp://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150115/williamsburg/shigella-bacterial-outbreak-strikes-williamsburg-borough-park\n\nChildren in parts of Williamsburg and Borough Park have experienced a spike in cases of shigellosis, a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea, fever and nausea, the Health Department said. 87 cases were reported between 14 Nov 2014 and 13 Jan 2015, city health officials said. About 74 percent of the cases have occurred in children ages 5 and younger.\n\nThe infection, which most commonly impacts young children, is contracted by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, or by direct contact with someone with the infection, according to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n\nThe city has monitored cyclical outbreaks of shigellosis in the traditional Jewish community since the last outbreak between September 2011 and February 2012, where 206 cases were reported, the Health Department said. The Health Department previously warned officials of a potential outbreak, first reported by CBS2, and expected to see an increase in the number of reported cases as doctors became aware of the issue.\n\nGary Schlesinger, CEO of ParCare Community Health Network in Bed-Stuy, said his office has been 'swamped with calls' about shigellosis over the last 2 weeks, though he declined to provide a specific number.

Young children are primarily affected, with 79 per cent of case-patients under 6 years old.\n\nHealth officials say outbreaks of shigellosis have occurred in this community every 3-5 years since the 1980s. Some outbreaks have involved hundreds of cases. The Health Department recommends strict handwashing after using the toilet, after diapering, before eating, and before preparing food. Young children should not attend daycare when they are ill. Children with shigellosis should not return to daycare until their symptoms resolve, and 2 stool specimens obtained at least 24 hours apart are negative for shigella by culture.\n\nNew York City health officials say all isolates to date from this outbreak are resistant to ampicillin, and a third are resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.\n\nShigellosis is an acute bacterial disease of the intestines caused by several species of the bacterium, _Shigella_. It is typified by loose stools, frequently containing blood and mucus (dysentery), accompanied by fever, vomiting, fever, vomiting, cramps and occasionally toxemia. It can cause bacillary dysentery because of the invasive ability of the organism that may result ulcerations and abscesses of the intestines.\n\nThis diarrheal disease is found worldwide with the vast majority of cases and deaths being in children. Outbreaks usually occur where there are crowded conditions and where personal hygiene is poor: prisons, day care centers and refugee camps are 3 examples. It is transmitted primarily by fecal-oral person to person means. It can also occur through contaminated food or water. Those primarily responsible for transmission are people who fail to wash their hands thoroughly after defecation. Because shigella is resistant to gastric acid, a person can be infected with as little as 10 organisms.\n\n[byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nDr Tony Ellam\nConsultant in Communicable Disease Control (ret)\n<tonypj@meadlane.freeserve.co.uk>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Ellam for this posting. - Mod.LL]\n\n******\n[2] Indiana\nDate: Tue 23 Dec 2014\nSource: WNDU [edited]\nhttp://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/Indiana-health-officials-continue-to-see-increase-in-shigellosis-cases-among-kids-286690921.html\n\n\nIndiana State health officials continue to see an increase in shigellosis cases reported in Indiana, especially in the central portion of the state. Shigellosis is a contagious illness that causes symptoms such as abdominal cramping, fever, vomiting and diarrhea. Around this time in 2013, about 100 cases had been reported statewide. This year, 2014, that number is more than 1000. 'Shigellosis has a cyclical trend, so we would expect to see an overall increase in cases some years,' said state health commissioner Jerome Adams, MD, MPH.

Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread.

London is most affected.\n\nInterviews with gay and bisexual men who caught the infection through sex found links to high numbers of partners, often met anonymously online or at sex parties. For many, using drugs, such as mephedrone, methamphetamine (crystal meth), ketamine and GBL [gamma-butyrolactone], before or during sex led to lowered inhibitions and riskier sex. Worryingly, one in 3 men using these drugs had injected them (known as 'slamming'). Most of the men interviewed had not heard of [shigellosis] before and thought they had food poisoning.\n\nOne of the men interviewed, who got shigellosis through anal-oral sex ('rimming'), said: 'Getting _Shigella_ was the lowest point in my life. I suffered uncontrollable bloody diarrhoea with severe stomach cramps. The ferocity of symptoms and dehydration, headaches made me think I was going to die. Initially I blamed it on a bad curry and held off visiting my GP for a week, but really wish I had gone straight away. Although it was treatable with antibiotics, the illness cost me a fortune as I had to take 6 weeks off work on statutory sick pay.'\n\nAs part of the awareness campaign, posters and leaflets are being distributed in nightclubs, saunas, and other gay venues, plus sexual health clinics, highlighting the symptoms of [shigellosis], how it is transmitted and how to avoid it.\n\nDr Gwenda Hughes, PHE head of STI [sexually transmitted infection] surveillance, said: '[Shigellosis] is on the rise, so it is vital gay and bisexual men know about it and how to avoid getting it. We're also seeing increasing HIV and gonorrhoea diagnoses among gay and bisexual men in the UK -- indeed, most of the men with [shigellosis] had been diagnosed with other STIs including HIV. This is a reminder how important it is to use a condom when having sex with casual and new partners.'\n\nCary James, Head of Health Improvement at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'Although on paper the number of documented cases of [shigellosis is] quite small, the concern is that not all cases are being reported. Men with symptoms who haven't heard of [shigellosis] before might assume it's a particularly bad case of food poisoning. However, the infection can be dangerous, even more so if you're already living with HIV or hepatitis C. We would urge anyone who is experiencing symptoms, or who's concerned they may have been at risk, to call our free helpline THT Direct or visit http://www.tht.org.uk/shigella.'\n\nDr Hughes continued: 'The [shigellosis] awareness campaign is part of a broader commitment to helping improve the health of gay and bisexual men, including exploring the links between health and drug use. The level of injecting drug use is a particular concern as we know that this puts men at greatly increased risk of blood-borne viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C'\n\nIndividuals worried about [shigellosis] or their drug use can find out more on the Terrence Higgins Trust website -- including finding a local service to visit for further advice (http://www.tht.org.uk/shigella).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Sexual transmission of shigellosis was first described in the USA during the 1970s and since then, several outbreaks of sexually transmitted shigellosis among men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported in North America, Europe, and Australia.

The strains circulating among MSM have been found by molecular subtyping with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to be different from those circulating in the rest of the community, indicating unique transmission (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5042a3.htm). Subtyping by PFGE also has also been used to identify epidemiologically related shigellosis clusters in the U.K. among MSM due to _S. flexneri_ serotype 3a (see ProMED-mail post Shigellosis, flexneri serotype 3a - UK: MSM 20120330.1085814).\n\nHumans are the only natural reservoir for disease. Shigellosis is acquired by fecal-oral transmission from someone who is excreting _Shigella_ in the stool. The risk for sexual transmission shigellosis has been found to be direct oral-anal contact (rimming) during the week before onset of shigellosis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15307964). Other enteric pathogens, such as hepatitis A, _Entamoeba histolytica_, _Giardia lamblia_, _Campylobacter_, and _Salmonella_, also can be transmitted sexually; but, possibly because _Shigella_ withstand the low pH of gastric juice, the low number of _Shigella_ required for transmission of shigellosis (as few as 10 to 200 organisms), as compared with that of many other enteric pathogens, facilitates person-to-person transmission of shigellosis. However, because feces can contain multiple pathogens, polymicrobial infections can result from a single sexual exposure.\n\n_Shigella_ invade the colonic mucosa and cause an acute inflammatory and ulcerative reactive. The incubation period, the duration of which is inversely proportional to the load of ingested bacteria, varies from 12 hours to 7 days, but is typically 2-4 days. Patients develop sudden onset of severe abdominal cramping and pain, high-grade fever, diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces, and the repeated urge to defecate, even though little stool may be passed (rectal tenesmus). The disease is communicable as long as _Shigella_ are excreted in the stool, which can last for up to 4 weeks from the onset of illness. Persons who receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy will be culture negative at 72 hours.\n\nPrevention of sexually transmitted shigellosis involves avoidance or mitigation of sexual practices that might result in fecal-oral transmission. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1lNY.]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Sexual transmission of shigellosis was first described in the USA during the 1970s and since then, several outbreaks of sexually transmitted shigellosis among men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported in North America, Europe, and Australia.

CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory determined that isolates from this cluster were resistant to ciprofloxacin, the antimicrobial medication recommended to treat adults with shigellosis. To understand the scope of the outbreak and to try to identify its source, CDC and state and local health departments conducted epidemiologic and laboratory investigations. During May 2014-February 2015, PulseNet identified 157 cases in 32 states and Puerto Rico; approximately half were associated with international travel. 9 of the cases identified by PulseNet, and another 86 cases without PFGE data, were part of a related outbreak of ciprofloxacin-resistant shigellosis in San Francisco, California. Of 126 total isolates with antimicrobial susceptibility information, 109 (87 percent) were nonsusceptible to ciprofloxacin (108 were resistant, and one had intermediate susceptibility). Travelers need to be aware of the risks of acquiring multidrug-resistant pathogens, carefully wash their hands, and adhere to food and water precautions during international travel. Clinicians should request stool cultures and antimicrobial susceptibilities when they suspect shigellosis, and counsel shigellosis patients to follow meticulous hygiene regimens while ill.\n\nShigella causes an estimated 500 000 cases of diarrhea in the USA annually (1) and is transmitted easily from person to person and through contaminated food and recreational water. Outbreaks of shigellosis frequently are large and protracted. Although diarrhea caused by _S. sonnei_ typically resolves without treatment, patients with mild illness often are treated with antimicrobial medications because they can reduce the duration of symptoms and shedding of shigellae in feces (2). However, resistance to the oral antimicrobial medications ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is common among shigellae in the USA, and resistance to fluorquinolones is increasing among shigellae globally (3). Because only about 2 percent of shigellae isolated in the USA are resistant to fluoroquinolones (4), ciprofloxacin is the 1st-line treatment for adults with shigellosis and is recommended as an empiric treatment for adult international travelers with diarrhea (5).\n\nBetween 24 May 2014 and 28 Feb 2015, PulseNet detected 157 cases of illness caused by _S. sonnei_ with closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns in 32 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. Most cases were reported in Massachusetts (45 cases), California (25) and Pennsylvania (18). In addition, public health officials in the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) identified an outbreak of 95 cases of ciprofloxacin-resistant shigellosis, 9 of which were tested using PFGE and have been included in the PulseNet cluster, for a total of 243 cases (Figure [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The San Francisco outbreak cases are included in the antimicrobial susceptibility summary but are excluded from other analyses.\n\nState and federal public health officials reported ciprofloxacin nonsusceptibility in 109 (87 percent) of 126 isolates tested (108 isolates were resistant and 1 had intermediate susceptibility). Of the 126 isolates, NARMS tested 19. All were resistant to nalidixic acid, and 6 (32 percent) were resistant to ciprofloxacin; isolates also exhibited resistance to ampicillin (5 percent), streptomycin (84 percent), sulfisoxazole (84 percent), tetracycline (87 percent), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (84 percent). One isolate displayed an azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentration of greater than 256 microg/ml and harbored macrolide resistance genes mphA and ermB.\n\nMedian age of the patients was 34 years (interquartile range = 20-51 years). Among the patients, 48 percent (74 of 153) were female. Among 41 patients with such information, median duration of illness was 7 days (interquartile range = 6-12 days). 19 (22 percent) of 88 patients with such information were hospitalized. Treatment information was not available for most patients.\n\n40 (53 percent) of 75 patients with such information had traveled internationally during their incubation period; destinations included Hispaniola (the Dominican Republic, 22 cases, and Haiti, 4); India (8); Morocco (3); and other destinations in Asia and Europe. No common airline or airport exposures were identified. Most travelers to the Dominican Republic stayed at resorts in Punta Cana; however, no common hotel, resort, restaurant, or event was reported. NARMS detected ciprofloxacin resistance in isolates obtained from travelers to the Dominican Republic (1 of 5 isolates tested) and India (1 of 1 isolate tested), and among nontravelers (4 of 7 isolates tested).\n\nTravel information was available for 23 of 37 children; 10 (43 percent) had recently traveled abroad. None of the 5 children who were enrolled in group child care settings had traveled internationally. One pediatric case occurred as part of a child care-associated outbreak of 5 culture-confirmed and 11 suspected cases of shigellosis. None of the other 4 isolates from this cluster were tested using PFGE; however, a single isolate was tested and found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin.\n\n12 patients self-identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). 11 (79 percent) of 14 men without recent international travel were MSM, compared with 1 of 6 men with recent international travel (Fisher's exact p = 0.02).\n\nSFDPH identified 95 ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ infections in residents of or travelers to San Francisco during 1 Nov 2014 to 15 Jan 2015. 9 isolates underwent PFGE and yielded patterns that were indistinguishable from or closely related to others in the PulseNet cluster. 66 patients (53 percent of those with such information) were hospitalized. 74 cases (47 percent of those with such information) occurred among persons who were homeless or living in single-room occupancy hotels. Although the investigation is ongoing, no point source or common exposures such as shelters, soup kitchens, or restaurants have been identified. No patients reported international travel.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nInternational travelers are at elevated risk for colonization with multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (6). This investigation suggests that ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ is being repeatedly introduced into the USA by travelers from various countries and can lead to large outbreaks domestically. The result has been a greater proportion of Shigella infections in the USA that are resistant to ciprofloxacin than in the past (National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System; Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases; National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC, unpublished data, 2015). Travelers should be encouraged to 1) observe food, water, and hand-hygiene precautions while traveling; 2) use over-the-counter medications like bismuth subsalicylate (e.g., Pepto-Bismol) or loperamide (e.g., Immodium) if they wish to treat mild or moderate travelers' diarrhea; 3) reserve antimicrobial medications for severe cases of travelers' diarrhea; 4) seek health care if they are experiencing diarrhea upon return to the USA or develop diarrhea shortly thereafter; and 5) remain vigilant regarding hygiene practices while ill. Additional studies are needed to clarify the roles of antimicrobial medications, antidiarrheal medications, and other factors in acquiring multidrug-resistant enteric pathogens during international travel.\n\nAlthough this Shigella strain is strongly associated with international travel, it is now circulating domestically. If introduced to populations of homeless persons, MSM, or children in child care settings, Shigella can spread rapidly and cause large, protracted outbreaks, as has occurred in the homeless population in San Francisco.\n\nHygiene promotion and increased access to hygiene and sanitation infrastructure among vulnerable populations such as the homeless might help prevent transmission. MSM can reduce their risk for acquiring this and other Shigella strains by washing their hands meticulously and by preventing fecal-oral exposures during sex (7). Health care providers should culture the stool specimens of patients with symptoms consistent with shigellosis, reculture the stool of patients who fail to improve after antimicrobial therapy, and test bacterial pathogens for antimicrobial susceptibility. Reserving antimicrobial treatment for immunocompromised patients and patients with severe shigellosis and using antimicrobial susceptibility data strategically to guide therapy might help preserve the utility of such medications. Clinical guidelines for the testing and interpretation of azithromycin susceptibility among Shigella spp. are needed to improve detection and management of cases of azithromycin-nonsusceptible shigellosis.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

In addition, public health officials in the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) identified an outbreak of 95 cases of ciprofloxacin-resistant shigellosis, 9 of which were tested using PFGE and have been included in the PulseNet cluster, for a total of 243 cases (Figure [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]).

Although diarrhea caused by _S. sonnei_ typically resolves without treatment, patients with mild illness often are treated with antimicrobial medications because they can reduce the duration of symptoms and shedding of shigellae in feces (2). Additional studies are needed to clarify the roles of antimicrobial medications, antidiarrheal medications, and other factors in acquiring multidrug-resistant enteric pathogens during international travel. None of the other 4 isolates from this cluster were tested using PFGE; however, a single isolate was tested and found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin.

Shigellosis is a bacterial infection that causes bowel disease. The infection is transmitted through feces, and symptoms include stomach cramps, diarrhoea, fever, and nausea. The infection can appear any time between 12 hours and 4 days from exposure and symptoms can persist for up to a week.\n\nNSW Health says the increase in cases appears to be amongst gay men in inner Sydney, and coincides with a recent increase in shigellosis cases among gay men in Victoria [the next state south of NSW].\n\nWith an influx of thousands of gay visitors expected for the Mardi Gras season [7 Feb-2 Mar 2014], NSW Health's Communicable Diseases Branch is concerned further infections may occur. Infections can arise from sexual contact during activities such as rimming [anal-oral contact] or when tiny particles of feces enter the mouth. The best way to avoid infection is to wash hands thoroughly after any sexual activity, after touching equipment like used condoms and sex toys, and after going to the toilet or before handling food.\n\nACON [health promotion organization with a central focus on HIV/AIDS] CEO Nicolas Parkhill said infection could be dangerous for those with compromised immune systems. 'The disease can be worse in anyone with a poor immune system, such as people with HIV who are more likely to have severe symptoms which may result in a prolonged illness and even hospitalisation,' he said. Parkhill advised gay men should also avoid sex while they have symptoms and for at least 7 days after the symptoms clear.\n\nNSW Health said anyone with prolonged diarrhoea should see a doctor, as antibiotics may need to be prescribed if a shigella infection is present.\n\n[Byline: Cec Busby]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Shigella_ was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named.

An additional 14 cases were reported from people who recently swam at Wallum Lake, and more cases were reported from Rhode Island residents who swam in Massachusetts.\n\nThe Director of Health, Michael Fine, recommends washing your hands frequently and not swimming if you have been sick with diarrhea in the past 48 hours.\n\nMost people with shigellosis develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting one to 3 days after exposure. Most infections are not severe and last between 48 and 72 hours.\n\nThe Department of Health investigated an outbreak of the gastrointestinal sickness after people were sickened after swimming in Burrillville.

The organism is frequently found in water polluted with human feces. The infective dose is as few as 10 cells depending on age and condition of host. The _Shigella_ spp. are highly infectious agents that are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.\n\nAssociated foods include salads (potato, tuna, shrimp, macaroni, and chicken), raw vegetables, milk and dairy products, and poultry. Contamination of these foods is usually through the fecal-oral route. Fecally contaminated water and unsanitary handling by food handlers are the most common causes of contamination.\n\nClearly, unlike foodborne infections in humans due to _Salmonella_ (except for typhoid fever), _E. coli_ O157, and _Campylobacter_, shigellosis is associated with food contaminated by human, not animal, feces. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/7d9b.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The posting seems to suggest the shigellosis clusters have occurred from multiple lakes in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

Since March 2014, more than 118 residents have been diagnosed with shigellosis, which is a bacterial infection that affects the intestines. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps. A severe infection with high fever may be associated with seizures in children younger than 2 years old. Dehydration may also occur, especially in warm weather. Some of those who are infected may show no symptoms at all but can still pass the shigella bacteria to others. The illness usually resolves in 5 to 7 days and rarely requires hospitalization. It can be treated through antibiotic therapy, reducing both the severity of the symptoms and the risk for spreading the illness.\n\n_Shigella_ is spread from one infected person to another in several ways. It is present in the diarrhea stools of the infected person and can be passed along when changing diapers or assisting toddlers with potty training. Family members, caregivers and playmates of sick children are at high risk of becoming ill. Failure to wash hands often and well also increases the risk of the spread of shigella bacteria.\n\nSwimming in public pools while ill can also result in the spread of the disease.\n\nTo prevent the spread of _Shigella_, take these precautions:\n- Wash hands often and well and help young children with their hand washing.\n- Store diapers in a closed-lid garbage can and wash hands immediately after changing.\n- Wipe diaper changing areas with a disinfectant such as diluted household bleach, Lysol or bactericidal wipes.\n- Seek medical attention for diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps.\n- When possible, isolate a sick child from other children to prevent the spread of the illness.\n- Do not send a sick child to day care, and do not allow sick children to swim in public pools.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Nebraska can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/20315.

It's a disease on the rise in Marion County. It's most commonly found in children, and leaders with the Marion County Health Department want you to know how to prevent the spread of shigellosis.\n\n'We are seeing this in young children here in Marion County as of today we have 175 confirmed cases,' said Melissa McMasters, Marion County Health Department. That number is up from just 34 in 2013. It spreads when people do a poor job of washing their hands after using the bathroom.\n\nStopping the spread of germs is a full-time job for nursery school teacher Nina Woodbury. 'After they get their diapers changed or go to the potty- all day long they are washing their hands,' said Woodbury.\n\nWoodbury says she knows how quickly germs spread amongst children, which is why she is adamant on proper hygiene. 'As much as we emphasize the safe hand washing and all of those things children at this age still explore everything with their mouth,' she said.\n\nMcMasters says public pools are also a breeding ground for the disease to spread. 'We mention pools because obviously if a child is sick and has diarrhea they don't belong in a pool,' said McMasters.\n\n[Byline: Charlie De Mar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Indiana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/848.

The Nueces County Health Department said that, in a normal year, they would have had 68 cases reported by this time; but the number so far in 2014 is up to 154. That number could be seriously underreported because many people, especially adults, tend to tough out the illness, which generally lasts less than a week.\n\nThe disease is harder on children, and the number of cases being treated at Driscoll Children's Hospital has reached 180. City-County Health Director William Burgin said even a fly landing on a child's hand can spread the illness. 'If you have diarrhea, stay home. Don't go to work. Don't spread it around,' Burgin said. 'And if you have high fever and you think you've got a bad case of shigellosis, please see your doctor.

To date, 92 individuals have been identified as ill and 16 have been hospitalized with bloody diarrhea. All swam at Spring Lake Beach in Burrillville on 4 Jul 2013. The department believes that the shigellosis came from fecal contamination of the water on that date.\n\nApproximately 80 percent of the people who are ill are children under 18 years of age.

In addition, _Shigella_ does not survive outside the body for long periods and does not survive in warm temperatures. The water temperature in Spring Lake has been high over the last several days.\n\n'Town officials from Burrillville were extremely helpful throughout this investigation,' said Dr. Fine. 'I thank them for their cooperation and assistance.'\n\nAll licensed beaches in Rhode Island are now open for swimming.

This investigation documented the 1st known transmission of _Shigella sonnei_ with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin in the USA.\n\nCases were defined as an illness clinically compatible with shigellosis in a patient or _S. sonnei_ isolated from stool of a person with an epidemiologic link to the bridge club during 22-26 May 2012. Investigators attempted to interview all bridge club workers and members who had visited the bridge club during the week of 22 May 2012; they collected stool specimens from workers who handled food and from workers and members with diarrhea who had not already submitted a stool specimen for culture at a health facility. 39 cases were identified among club members with diarrhea and 4 among club workers; of the 4 workers, 2, including one who handled food, reported no symptoms. The average age of affected persons was 75.3 years (range: 54-98 years); 55 per cent were female. Among those with symptoms, the duration of illness averaged 5.9 days (range: 1-14 days). Common symptoms included diarrhea in 95 per cent of patients, abdominal cramps in 70 per cent, and fever in 56 per cent. 31 (72 per cent) persons sought medical care, and 10 (23 per cent) were hospitalized. No specific exposures implicated a source for the outbreak.\n\nAmong the 43 cases, 14 were culture-confirmed; 10 isolates underwent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), yielding indistinguishable patterns. 4 isolates submitted to CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) displayed resistance to streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Unlike most isolates tested by NARMS, these isolates also showed elevated azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of greater than 16 microg/mL (1) and harbored a plasmid-encoded macrolide resistance gene, mphA (2).\n\nCDC's PulseNet identified 2 additional isolates indistinguishable from the outbreak PFGE pattern. One was from a man in Pennsylvania aged 23 years who had visited Los Angeles in April 2012, and the other from a man in Hawaii aged 53 years who visited Los Angeles during April and May 2012; both men were hospitalized with diarrhea. Neither case was epidemiologically linked to the bridge club or to each other.\n\nAlthough sporadic cases of shigellosis caused by _Shigella_ strains with increased azithromycin MICs have occurred, this is the first outbreak documented in the USA and might indicate increasing circulation of such strains (1). Illnesses in this outbreak tended to be severe; however, the affected population was much older than the general USA population. Clinical management of such illnesses is likely to be complex; although azithromycin currently is recommended for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant _Shigella_, options for alternative treatment among children with such infections primarily include parenteral antimicrobial medications (3,4).\n\nGuidelines for azithromycin susceptibility testing and criteria for interpretation of MICs for _Shigella_ species have not been published. Clinicians are urged to report azithromycin treatment failure among shigellosis patients to public health authorities and to retain _Shigella_ isolates from such cases for further analysis.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread. Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease.\n\nDysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces, with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/27gI.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Investigators attempted to interview all bridge club workers and members who had visited the bridge club during the week of 22 May 2012; they collected stool specimens from workers who handled food and from workers and members with diarrhea who had not already submitted a stool specimen for culture at a health facility.

A more focused analysis of cases reported since\nNovember 2009 shows that this trend continues, as 78 percent of the 27\ncases reported since then have been due to infection with _S. flexneri_.\n\nPrior to 2009, _Shigella_ infected individuals most commonly reported\ntravel and/or foodborne exposures. The majority (93 percent) of cases\nreported since November 2009 were male (compared to 56 percent male\ncases observed over the previous 10 years) and 67 percent lived in\ndowntown Toronto, an area which includes Toronto's gay village. The\npublic health investigation of those cases reported since November\n2009 revealed that sexual contact reported by men who have sex with\nmen (MSM) was the most widely reported risk (44.4 percent of cases\nconfirmed oral-anal contact as a risk compared to an average of 7\npercent reported in the previous 10 years). As the profile of\nshigellosis shifts from mostly children and travelers to primarily\naffecting MSM in the downtown core, the median age has also increased\nfrom 32 years (1999 to 2008) to 36 years (2009 to January 2010,\ninclusive),\n\nSubstantial increases in shigellosis-HIV co-infection have also been\nnoted. The co-infection rate rose from 7.7 percent of shigellosis\ncases reported between 2000 and 2007 to 20 percent in 2008 and then\n27.5 percent of shigellosis cases reported 2009. The most recent\nreports of shigellosis cases indicate a further increase in the HIV\nco-infection rate, as 44 percent of those cases reported in Toronto\nsince November 2009 also had a documented infection with HIV. The\npattern of sexually transmitted shigellosis among MSM, and the high\nrate of HIV co-infection has only been described a handful of times\nand often attributed to changes in sexual practice among those with\nHIV to 'lower risk' sexual activities (e.g., oral-anal contact and/or\nserosorting of sexual partners).\n\nToronto Public Health is interested to learn if other geographic areas\nare experiencing similar shifts in their shigellosis cases\nparticularly in the northeast parts of Canada and the USA, as there is\nsubstantial mixing of MSM populations in Toronto, New York City,\nBoston and Montreal.\n\nWe are also interested in the description of any strategies that local\nor regional public health authorities have initiated to address this\nshift and/or increase in shigellosis cases. Further investigation of\nthis shift through case control methodology or social network analysis\nto better define the population's risk activities is being considered.\nAny information from other organizations which have recently\nundertaken similar studies would be appreciated.\n\n--\nEffie Gournis\nToronto Public Health\nToronto, Ontario\nCanada\n<egourni@toronto.ca>\n\n[ProMED thanks Effie Gournis for this posting and welcomes discussion\nregarding the observations.\n\nShigellae were described over 100 years ago by the Japanese\nmicrobiologist, Shiga, for whom the genus is named.

Family members and playmates of such children are at\nhigh risk of becoming infected. Some sexual practices performed by MSM\nwill also produce a high risk situation.

Following analyses of laboratory data, an increase in UK-acquired _S. flexneri_ cases was detected in London in November 2010. A subsequent rise in UK-acquired cases was also noted in Manchester in May 2011. The initial cases reported were predominantly of serotype 3a and mostly among men who have sex with men (MSM) aged between 30 and 50 years, some of whom were HIV positive. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PGFE) performed on initial stool specimen showed that some of the isolates were indistinguishable, however preliminary investigation failed to identify a common venue or point source (2,3).\n\nIn response, a national outbreak control team was formally established in September 2011 to investigate and manage the outbreak of _S. flexneri_. Enhanced surveillance was initiated in order to:\n- describe the epidemiology of _S. flexneri_ infection in individuals who had no travel history or who had travelled to countries with low risk for infection;\n- estimate the proportion of UK-acquired cases or cases associated with travel in low-risk countries that are explained by transmission in MSM;\n- identify risk factors for transmission of _S. flexneri_ between MSM.\n\nSexual transmission of shigellosis was first described in the USA during the 1970s (4). Since then, several outbreaks of sexually transmitted shigellosis, predominantly in MSM, have been reported (5-8). In 2006, an outbreak among MSM in London coincided with a similar outbreak in Berlin suggesting that travel plays a role in introducing _Shigella_ species to populations at risk (9,10).\n\nOutbreak investigation\n----------------------\nNational enhanced surveillance of _S. flexneri_ was conducted from September to December 2011 inclusive, in order to describe and monitor the epidemiology of the outbreak. The population under surveillance consisted of UK-acquired _S. flexneri_ infection cases and reported cases associated with travel in low-risk countries.\n\nLow-risk travel-associated individuals were defined as individuals who returned to the UK in the 4 days before onset of illness after travel to countries with low risk for shigellosis (Europe, North America, and Australia). High-risk travel-associated diagnoses were defined as individuals who returned to the UK in the 4 days before onset of illness after travel to countries with high risk for shigellosis (South America, Asia, and Africa) (1). A confirmed case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed case of _S. flexneri_ with a specimen date between 1 Sep and 31 Dec 2011 with no recent travel or who reported recent travel to low-risk countries. A probable case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed case of _S. flexneri_ with an unknown travel history.\n\nCases among people who had traveled to high-risk countries or secondary cases of _S. flexneri_ who were contacts of high risk travel-associated cases were excluded.\n\nAll laboratories were asked to notify _Shigella_ isolations and to send stool specimens to the national reference laboratory (Gastrointestinal Infections Reference Unit, Health Protection Agency - Colindale, London) for serotyping, PFGE analysis and sensitivity testing. Weekly updates on laboratory-confirmed _S. flexneri_ diagnoses were forwarded to the respective regions for further follow-up. Increased awareness and guidance for health professionals and people at risk of infection was issued through HPA [Health Protection Agency] briefings, information leaflets and press releases (11).\n\n_S. flexneri_ diagnoses reported by the national laboratories between 2001 and 2011 were also analyzed to provide context to the current outbreak and to produce historical time trends.\n\nResults\n-------\nDuring the enhanced surveillance period between September and December 2011, 145 _S. flexneri_ diagnoses were reported of which 37 (25.5 percent) were non-travel related. 31 cases were confirmed as being UK-acquired whereas 6 reported diagnoses were likely to be secondary cases linked to a symptomatic contact with recent travel to a high-risk country. 86 cases (59.3 percent) were associated with travel to high-risk countries and the travel history was unknown for 22 individuals (15.2 percent). No low-risk travel-associated cases of _S. flexneri_ were reported during the enhanced surveillance period.\n\nThe UK-acquired cases were predominantly male (n=26) whereas travel-associated _S. flexneri_ diagnoses were equally distributed between both sexes: 11 male cases with UK-acquired _S. flexneri_ reported MSM activity in the week before developing gastroenteritis. 3 individuals refused to disclose their sexual orientation. 10 of the 31 reported UK-acquired cases were serotype 3a, 7 were serotype 1b, 5 were serotype 2a, 3 were serotype 6, and 1 case was reported for serotypes 1a, 1c, 2b, and 3b. The serotype was unknown for 2 reported cases. More than half (n=5) of the infections in MSM were caused by serotype 3a, 4 by serotype 1b, 1 by serotype 2a, and 1 by serotype 6.\n\nIn depth interviews with 7 MSM cases showed that they all had one long term partner and attended regular medical examinations. However, all cases reported having a casual sexual partner in the week preceding illness. These interviews revealed lack of awareness about shigellosis and of the risks associated with unprotected oral and oral-anal sex.\n\nTrends in _S. flexneri_ diagnoses reported between 2001 and 2011 (n=3352) showed a gradual increase in the number of cases with no or unknown history of travel since 2001, with a similar trend in both sexes until 2008 (Figure 2 - [for figures see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). However, from 2009 onwards, numbers of diagnoses rose far more rapidly in men. Data analysis revealed similar trends in cases between sexes and within the same age group, however, since 2009 the increase in the number of _S. flexneri_ cases reported was attributable to an overrepresentation of men aged between 31 and 50 years (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 4 shows the number of _S. flexneri_ diagnoses by serotype from 2004 to 2011. The number of cases infected with serotype 3a has increased considerably and as from 2009 it has become as predominant as the 2a serotype and accounted for the increase in _S. flexneri_ cases between 2009 and 2011.\n\nThe increase in serotype 3a since 2009 was mostly attributable to diagnoses among men aged 30-50 years which constituted 65 percent (211/324) of all _S. flexneri_ 3a reports with no or unknown travel history between 2009 and 2011. When focusing on the male adult cases with serotype 3a, the number of monthly _S. flexneri_ diagnoses in 2007/2008 fluctuates between 1 and 7 cases. The number of monthly reports increases to between 5 and 15 from 2009 onwards. The following graph shows the number of monthly diagnoses from 2007-2012 and a 3-month moving average (Figure 5).\n\nControl measures\n----------------\nThe outbreak control team introduced control measures which focused on actions aimed at prompt and effective management of cases to prevent onward transmission. They included increasing awareness among clinicians and MSM and prompt diagnosis and treatment, increased testing of MSM with diarrhea and treatment of laboratory-confirmed cases with ciprofloxacin (12) subject to antimicrobial sensitivity.\n\nThese actions also included recommendations regarding behaviours that may contribute to prevent further transmission:\n- wash hands after using toilet, before preparing or eating food, and after sexual activity;\n- avoid anal sex, oral-anal sex, scat, and rimming while symptomatic and until test for infection shows clearance;\n- use of condoms, gloves, dental dams during sex;\n- avoid sharing douching materials and sex toys;\n- avoid swimming pools and spa centres whilst ill and for 2 weeks after recovery.\n\nWork is ongoing to identify risk factors for infection and evaluate other possible control measures such as screening of asymptomatic contacts.\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\nAs the outbreak is still ongoing and no similar _S. flexneri_ outbreaks have recently been reported by other countries, increased vigilance, and monitoring by other European countries is recommended in order to promptly and effectively detect any change in the reported trends of _S. flexneri_.\n\nAlthough some people may have been reluctant to disclose details about their sexual orientation, the enhanced surveillance revealed a strong association between UK-acquired _S. flexneri_ and transmission in MSM. The outbreak will continue to be monitored through routine arrangements and information on cases occurring in MSM will continue to be collected in order to effectively describe the epidemiology of the disease in MSM and identify any potential risk factors to inform public health action.\n\nAlthough the outbreak 1st emerged in 2009 and has been sustained since then, it has only been detected relatively recently. An evaluation of shigellosis surveillance will therefore be carried out in order to identify factors leading to the delay in outbreak identification and to explore new approaches to routine surveillance of sexually-transmitted shigellosis.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread. Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease.\n\nDysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1lNY.]", "summary": "Enhanced surveillance was initiated in order to:\n- describe the epidemiology of _S. flexneri_ infection in individuals who had no travel history or who had travelled to countries with low risk for infection;\n- estimate the proportion of UK-acquired cases or cases associated with travel in low-risk countries that are explained by transmission in MSM;\n- identify risk factors for transmission of _S. flexneri_ between MSM. \n\nThese actions also included recommendations regarding behaviours that may contribute to prevent further transmission:\n- wash hands after using toilet, before preparing or eating food, and after sexual activity;\n- avoid anal sex, oral-anal sex, scat, and rimming while symptomatic and until test for infection shows clearance;\n- use of condoms, gloves, dental dams during sex;\n- avoid sharing douching materials and sex toys;\n- avoid swimming pools and spa centres whilst ill and for 2 weeks after recovery. \n\nThe UK-acquired cases were predominantly male (n=26) whereas travel-associated _S. flexneri_ diagnoses were equally distributed between both sexes: 11 male cases with UK-acquired _S. flexneri_ reported MSM activity in the week before developing gastroenteritis. \n\nCases among people who had traveled to high-risk countries or secondary cases of _S. flexneri_ who were contacts of high risk travel-associated cases were excluded. \n\nThe increase in serotype 3a since 2009 was mostly attributable to diagnoses among men aged 30-50 years which constituted 65 percent (211/324) of all _S. flexneri_ 3a reports with no or unknown travel history between 2009 and 2011. \n\nTrends in _S. flexneri_ diagnoses reported between 2001 and 2011 (n=3352) showed a gradual increase in the number of cases with no or unknown history of travel since 2001, with a similar trend in both sexes until 2008 (Figure 2 - [for figures see source URL above.

High-risk travel-associated diagnoses were defined as individuals who returned to the UK in the 4 days before onset of illness after travel to countries with high risk for shigellosis (South America, Asia, and Africa) (1). As the outbreak is still ongoing and no similar _S. flexneri_ outbreaks have recently been reported by other countries, increased vigilance, and monitoring by other European countries is recommended in order to promptly and effectively detect any change in the reported trends of _S. flexneri_. When focusing on the male adult cases with serotype 3a, the number of monthly _S. flexneri_ diagnoses in 2007/2008 fluctuates between 1 and 7 cases. No low-risk travel-associated cases of _S. flexneri_ were reported during the enhanced surveillance period. 86 cases (59.3 percent) were associated with travel to high-risk countries and the travel history was unknown for 22 individuals (15.2 percent). The initial cases reported were predominantly of serotype 3a and mostly among men who have sex with men (MSM) aged between 30 and 50 years, some of whom were HIV positive. \n\n_S. flexneri_ diagnoses reported by the national laboratories between 2001 and 2011 were also analyzed to provide context to the current outbreak and to produce historical time trends. \nNational enhanced surveillance of _S. flexneri_ was conducted from September to December 2011 inclusive, in order to describe and monitor the epidemiology of the outbreak. \n\nFigure 4 shows the number of _S. flexneri_ diagnoses by serotype from 2004 to 2011. 31 Dec 2011 with no recent travel or who reported recent travel to low-risk countries.

A large\ncluster (42 cases) was concentrated in north Norway, while a small\ncluster (4 cases) occurred in the south-east region. Epidemiological\nevidence and traceback investigations have linked the outbreak to the\nconsumption of imported fresh basil. The product has been withdrawn\nfrom the market. No further cases have been reported since 25 Oct\n2011.\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\nOn 9 Oct 2011, the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at\nthe Norwegian Institute of Public Health was informed by the municipal\nmedical officer and the Local Food Safety Authority in Tromso\n(northern Norway) about an unusually high number of cases of\ngastrointestinal disease caused by _S. sonnei_. A delicatessen and\ncatering company located in the center of Tromso received several\ncomplaints from customers who had fallen ill with gastrointestinal\nsymptoms after having eaten food items from there. On 14 Oct 2011, a\nsmall cluster of cases who had not been to Tromso were reported and\nthe outbreak was classified as national.\n\nAn outbreak case was defined as a person with gastrointestinal\nsymptoms with laboratory confirmed infection with _S. sonnei_ with\nindistinguishable multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats\nanalysis (MLVA) profiles in Norway after 1 Oct 2011.\n\nAs of 2 Nov 2011, 46 cases have been reported (Figure - for figure,\nsee source URL above. - Mod.LL). The outbreak-MLVA profile had not\npreviously been seen in Norway. The cases are distributed in 2\nclusters: 42 cases live in Tromso in the north of Norway or had been\nto Tromso within the incubation period of the disease (up to 7 days)\n(1,2), and 4 cases live in a municipality (Ostfold) in south-east\nNorway, without any connection to Tromso. None of the cases had\ntravelled outside the country. All cases are adults (aged 19-84 years)\nand males and females are equally affected. No new cases have been\nreported since 25 Oct 2011.\n\nShigellosis is the 3rd most frequent bacterial gastrointestinal\ninfection reported in Norway. In the last 10 years, between 120 and\n190 cases have been registered annually (about 2.5 per 100 000\ninhabitants to 4.0 per 100 000 inhabitants). Most of the cases (80-90\npercent) are travel-related. _S. sonnei_ is the most frequent species\nidentified (64 percent of all isolates in 2010) (3).\n\nInvestigation into the outbreak\n-------------------------------\nOn 9 Oct 2011, the municipal medical officer in Tromso initiated an\ninvestigation in collaboration with the local Food Safety Authority in\norder to identify the source of the outbreak. The local Food Safety\nAuthority interviewed 38 of the 42 laboratory-confirmed cases in\nTromso: most of them had participated in social events after 30 Sep\n2011 where food provided by the catering company in question had been\nserved. Of the 38 cases interviewed, 36 reported to have eaten pesto\ncontaining basil. The catering company provided a complete list of all\nthe events for which they had served food from 30 Sep 2011, which was\nfollowed up by the local Food Safety Authority.\n\nOne of those events was a baptism ceremony banquet celebrated on 1-2\nOct 2011. Of the 50 attendees, 10 people became sick with\ngastrointestinal symptoms. Among the sick, 3 had laboratory-confirmed\ninfection with _S. sonnei_. In collaboration with the local\nauthorities, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health performed a\ncohort study among the attendees of the banquet in order to identify\nrisk factors for illness. A link to a web-based questionnaire designed\nto collect information on demographics, symptoms, and food exposures\nfrom the menu was sent by email to 42 of the attendees. All of them\nresponded. Preliminary results from the cohort study show that 2\nproducts, a pesto and a soup, were independently associated with\nillness. However, only the pesto was delivered by the catering company\nand could be linked to the other cases occurring in Tromso.\n\nOn 11 Oct 2011, the 1st case in the small cluster of 4 cases in a\nmunicipality in the south of the country with MLVA profiles\nindistinguishable identical to the Tromso profile was identified. 3\nhad been served food containing basil in a specific restaurant.\n\nTraceback investigations of ingredients in the pesto served in Tromso\nare still ongoing. The same distributor that provided the fresh basil\nto the catering company in Tromso also delivered fresh basil to the\nrestaurant implicated in the 2nd cluster in south-east Norway. The\ndistributor imported this herb from a country outside the European\nUnion and has voluntarily withdrawn it from the market. The National\nVeterinary Institute analyzed samples of pesto and other ingredients\nfrom the catering company in Tromso. Samples available for analysis\nhave been negative. An epidemic intelligence information system (EPIS)\nenquiry has been posted to determine whether other European countries\nhave observed a similar increase in cases infected with _S. sonnei_.\nSo far, no other countries have reported any recent increase in cases\nthat can be linked to this outbreak.\n\nConclusion and recommendations\n------------------------------\nWe report an outbreak of _S. sonnei_ in Norway, linked to imported\nbasil used fresh in pesto. The ingestion of very few organisms\n(10-100) is sufficient to cause infection (4). Pesto usually contains\na substantial amount of basil. Thus, if this herb is contaminated with\nthe bacteria, ingesting very small quantities of pesto can lead to a\nhigh risk of getting the infection.\n\nEach year there are a considerable number of outbreaks of shigellosis\naround the world due to consumption of contaminated food. The\ncontamination of foods with _Shigella_ usually results from\ncontaminated irrigation water, infected food handlers or improper\npreparation (5,6). The sources of many shigellosis outbreaks have been\ntraced to the ingestion of raw or fresh vegetables (6). In Norway, for\nexample, iceberg lettuce was incriminated in a _S. sonnei_ outbreak in\n1994 (7). Previous domestic outbreaks of _S. sonnei_ infection in\nScandinavia have been also linked to imported products (8).\n\nFood handlers with gastrointestinal symptoms should avoid involvement\nwith the preparation, management, and transport of food while they are\nsymptomatic in order to prevent spread of the pathogen, and they\nshould also adhere to appropriate hygiene and hand-washing routines.\nControl measures to protect fresh vegetables from air, soil or water\ncontamination should be ensured.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Nasjonalt Folkehelseinstitutt (Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth), Oslo, Norway\n2. Veterinaerinstituttet (National Veterinary Institute), Oslo, Norway\n3. Mattilsynet (Norwegian Food Safety Authority), Oslo, Norway]\n\nIn Norway, shigellosis is a mandatorily notifiable disease, and all\nisolates are submitted to the NIPH [Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth] for verification and typing. Around 150 cases of shigellosis\nare confirmed per year, the majority caused by _Shigella sonnei_. Only\naround 10 to 20 of the shigellosis cases reported each year are\nacquired in Norway, usually as secondary cases caused by fecal-oral\ntransmission in households.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, the National Reference Laboratory at the NIPH alerted\nabout a suspected outbreak involving 4 cases of _Shigella sonnei_\ninfection. The infected persons were living in 2 different counties in\nNorway, and they had no foreign travel history during the week before\nonset of illness. On the same day, a municipal medical doctor reported\nto the NIPH 5 suspected cases of shigellosis in 2 separate households.\n\nEpidemiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAn outbreak investigation was initiated on 27 May 2009 by interviewing\nthe 4 confirmed cases using a trawling questionnaire. On the same day\nthe NFSA [Norwegian Food Safety Authority] inspectors visited the 2\nhouseholds where suspected cases were reported and found an unopened\npackage of sugar peas imported from Kenya in one household, and the\npacking of the same brand of sugar peas in the other. The sugar peas\nwere bought in the same shop. Based on this suspicion, it was decided\nto focus the interviews on consumption of fresh vegetables and lettuce.\n\nMicrobiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAll suspected human _Shigella_ isolates received at NIPH are routinely\nverified, speciated, and typed with multilocus variable-number\ntandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) using a protocol developed by BA\nLindstedt et al (manuscript in preparation). Isolates of _Shigella\nsonnei_ showing a distinct MLVA-profile were defined as the outbreak\nstrain. Food samples were analyzed at the National Veterinary\nInstitute first by using NMKL no. 174 (_Shigella_ spp. PCR method for\ndetection in food), followed by immuno-magnetic separation (IMS) and\nplating on selective agar. Positive PCR results were confirmed by\nusing a modified version of an octaplex PCR developed for\nidentification of human diarrheagenic _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella\nspp._ (1). Any isolates obtained from food samples would be MLVA-typed\nat NIPH to compare with the patient isolates.\n\nResults\n-------\nBy 16 Jun 2009, the reference laboratory has registered a total of 20\ncases with the outbreak strain of _Shigella sonnei_, who had not\ntraveled abroad prior to illness onset. The cases live in different\nmunicipalities, but mainly in the central and western parts of Norway.\nThe date of onset for the 1st case was 10 May 2009 (Figure [for\nfigures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). All cases were adults except for\none teenager, and 16 of them were women. All 20 cases reported to have\neaten sugar peas, and there were no other obvious common exposures\nidentified. The majority of the patients had bought the sugar peas in\none of the large supermarket chains and only a few in another chain.\nThe NFSA traced the suspected food product and found that all the\nimplicated sugar peas were produced in Kenya. One sample from the\nunopened package of sugar peas collected in a patient household was\npositive for _Shigella sonnei_ by both PCR methods, but could not be\nculture-confirmed.\n\nInternational alerts\n--------------------\nOn 27 May 2009 the NIPH sent an urgent inquiry through the European\nFood and Waterborne Diseases Network at the European Centre for\nDisease Prevention and Control (ECDC) asking whether an increase in\nthe number of _Shigella sonnei_ cases had been registered in other\ncountries. On the same day, the NFSA sent an information notice\nthrough the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).\nBased on information from the interviews, the main importer\nvoluntarily recalled the product on 29 May 2009. Further results from\ntracing of the food product and preliminary results from the\nmicrobiological investigation led the NFSA to prohibit all sales of\nsugar peas imported from Kenya later the same day.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nAs a response to our urgent inquiry Denmark reported an increase in\nthe number of domestic _Shigella sonnei_ infections in April and May\n2009. They initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the\nDanish cases were related to the outbreak in Norway. The investigation\nin Denmark also pointed at sugar peas as the source of the outbreak,\nand microbiological investigations (including MLVA typing) to compare\nthe outbreak strains are ongoing.\n\nThe trace-back investigation of the food product appeared to be very\ncomplicated, and the NFSA is still investigating together with the\nindustry. Several wholesalers are supplying sugar peas to Norway, and\nthe product comes from several producers in Kenya. The 2 supermarket\nchains usually do not share the distribution system, but on some\noccasions they are supplied by the same whole-saler.\n\nOnly one previous outbreak in Norway has been associated with fresh\nvegetables. An increase in the number of domestic cases of _Shigella\nsonnei_ infection was detected in several European countries in 1994,\nincluding Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (2). In Norway 110\nculture-confirmed cases of infection were recorded at the time. In all\n3 countries epidemiological evidence incriminated imported iceberg\nlettuce of Spanish origin as the vehicle of transmission. The pathogen\nwas not isolated from the suspected food product.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Fodevarestyrelsen (Danish Veterinary and Food Administration),\nCopenhagen, Denmark\n3. Department of Bacteriology, Mycology and Parasitology, Statens\nSerum Institut (Danish National Institute of Health, SSI), Copenhagen,\nDenmark]\n\nOn 27 May 2009 Norway sent an urgent inquiry through the European Food\nand Waterborne Diseases Network at the European Centre for Disease\nPrevention and Control (ECDC) reporting an increase in the number of\n_Shigella sonnei_ cases. By 1 Jun 2009 Norway informed that they\nsuspected the source to be sugar peas. As an increase in the number of\n_Shigella sonnei_ cases was also observed in Denmark in April and May\n2009, we initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the Danish\ncases were related to the Norwegian outbreak.\n\nMethods\n-------\nAll laboratory-confirmed _Shigella sonnei_ cases since 1 Apr 2009\n(Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]) were interviewed\nby telephone about date of onset, symptoms, travel history,\nconsumption of sugar peas and a small set of other exposure variables.\nPrevious data on sugar peas consumption in the background population\nwas reviewed. Isolates were subjected to typing by pulsed field gel\nelectrophoresis (PFGE) using the enzyme XbaI. Sugar peas sold in 3\nmajor groups of supermarket chains were traced back.\n\nResults\n-------\nIn all, 17 cases of _Shigella sonnei_ were reported from 1 Apr to 1\nJun 2009. 6 cases were travel-related and one was linked to another\nknown outbreak caused by fresh large shrimps from Bangladesh. Of the\nremaining 10 cases, 8 reported having eaten sugar peas prior to onset\nof symptoms. Of these 8 cases all were female and their median age was\n31 years (range 11-46 years). None had travelled abroad, except for\nshort trips to Sweden before getting ill. The dates of onset of\nillness ranged from 7 Apr to 8 May 2009. The 2 additional cases could\nbe related to the outbreak as likely secondary cases as they were\nchildren of one of the cases who had eaten sugar peas. The children\nfell ill 3 weeks after their mother.\n\nA case-control study was not performed; instead, previous food-borne\noutbreak investigations were reviewed. Consumption of sugar peas is\namong the questions included in several of the commonly used trawling\nquestionnaires in Denmark. We looked into 3 different rounds of\ntrawling questionnaire studies performed among cases of a large\noutbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium U292 (1). They were done in\nApril, May, and August 2008. In these studies 3/10, 2/17, and 0/15\ncases reported consumption of sugar peas in a period of 7 days prior\nto illness. This crude comparison indicated to us a significant\nassociation between _Shigella sonnei_ infections and consumption of\nsugar peas (using the persons interviewed in April and May 2009 as\ncommunity controls, comparing 8/8 exposed cases to 5/27 exposed\ncontrols, gives a Fisher p-value of less than 0.0001).\n\nPreliminary PFGE typing results of isolates from 5 of the 10 cases\nassociated with sugar pea consumption suggest highly similar patterns.\nThe PFGE patterns of the isolates from Danish patients resemble those\nobtained from the Norwegian patients but it is still too early to say\nif they are identical. Further typing results (which will include\nmultilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis - MLVA typing) and\ncomparisons between isolates from Denmark and Norway are pending.\n\nThe cases were generally able to recall in detail the type of product\nthey had consumed and in which shop they had bought it; 6 of the 10\ncases associated with the outbreak reported buying sugar peas in\nsupermarkets sharing in part the same distribution systems. Trace-back\ninvestigation of the sugar peas showed that they had been bought from\na single wholesaler in the Netherlands and that they were of 3\ndifferent varieties, which can be distinguished by their shapes,\nnamely sugar snaps, sugar peas (snow peas), and mange touts. They\noriginated predominantly from Kenya (from 4 different farms), but\nother batches sold in the same period came from Ethiopia and from\nGuatemala. The Dutch whole-seller was different from the one that\nsupplied sugar peas to Norway. The 2 remaining cases may have bought\ntheir sugar peas in another group of supermarket chains, which in part\nshares distribution systems with the supermarkets that sold the\nincriminated sugar peas in Norway. Further investigation into the\norigin of the sugar peas sold in this chain during April 2009 is still\nongoing. There were no remains of the batch of sugar peas under\nsuspicion and therefore microbiological analysis was not performed.\nLaboratory results from samples taken from later batches in 2 of the\nsupermarket chains did not reveal contamination by either _Shigella_\nspp. or _Escherichia coli_ (as indicator for fecal contamination).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe investigation points at sugar peas as the source of this outbreak.\nThe Danish and the Norwegian outbreaks do not appear to have been\ncaused by the same type of peas, the batch of sugar snaps that was\nlikely contaminated in Denmark was different from the one imported\ninto Norway and also the Danish outbreak occurred one month earlier\nthat the Norwegian outbreak. It is possible, though, that both\noutbreaks may have been a result of the same contamination event in\nKenya; further investigations may cast light on this.\n\nOutbreaks with a high ratio of females among cases may often point to\nfresh produce as the source. Only one previous outbreak in Denmark has\nbeen associated with sugar peas, an outbreak of _Shigella flexneri_ in\n2002 in which the epidemiological evidence pointed towards fresh\nimported sugar snaps of African origin (unpublished). Other fresh\ntropical vegetables which were eaten raw, have also caused outbreaks\nof shigellosis in Denmark, most notable were 2 _Shigella sonnei_\noutbreaks in 2007 (2,3) and one in 1998 (4) both caused by baby corn\nimported from Thailand.\n\nThis outbreak underlines that some fresh vegetables imported into\nEurope from tropic destinations may pose a food safety hazard. In\nDenmark fresh imported sugar snaps are sold as a ready-to-eat product.\nConsumers should be aware that these types of products may pose a risk\nof microbiological contamination. The sugar snaps will remain crispy\nafter being blanched or boiled briefly and it may be advisable for\nconsumers to heat-treat fresh vegetables of this type before\nconsumption.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

We report a similar outbreak of shigellosis in Queensland,\nAustralia that is possibly linked to the Danish outbreak through a\ncommon source in Thailand.\nQueensland Health has investigated 11 laboratory-confirmed cases of\n_Shigella sonnei_ (biotype g) with most cases having reported either\nconsuming imported baby corn from Thailand or eating at a venue where\nimported baby corn was commonly served. These cases included 2 from\nanother Australian State, Victoria, who had traveled to Queensland. 4\ncases were part of a larger outbreak among a film production crew\nwhere there were a further 43 probable cases (with symptoms including\nacute diarrhea with or without vomiting, stomach cramps, and fever\nbetween 9 and 14 Aug 2007), although it was not possible to conduct a\ncohort study. Another 2 cases were infected while hospitalized and a\nfurther 2 cases ate at a common holiday resort. All case isolates\nwere resistant to augmentin, ampicillin, tetracycline, sulphonamides,\ntrimethoprim, and streptomycin but susceptible to nalidixic acid,\nnorfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and ceftriaxone.\nThe dates of onset of illness among the 11 laboratory-confirmed cases\nwere from 9 to 27 Aug 2007. The median age of cases was 31 years\n(range 18-76 years) and 7 cases were female.\nResults of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) testing of the\nhuman isolates from Queensland show a profile that is\nindistinguishable from that of human isolates from the outbreak in\nDenmark using the enzyme XbaI and the same running conditions as\nDenmark. We plan to run further gels on Australian _S. sonnei_\nisolates from the past 3 years to review the diversity of strains. We\nalso plan to conduct further PFGE using a second enzyme BlnI (AvrII).\nThe traceback investigation to date shows that 8 of the 11 cases may\nhave eaten baby corn that was part of a very small consignment\nimported in late July 2007 by a single wholesaler in Queensland from\nan agent in Thailand. This Thai agent appears to be different from\nthe Thai business that exported baby corn to Denmark, but the\nproducer of the baby corn may still be the same, which remains to be\ninvestigated. Microbiological testing of baby corn from current\nbatches is currently underway, although there was no leftover baby\ncorn from the original consignment for testing.\nAustralia is attempting to trace the source of the baby corn with the\nassistance of Thai authorities. Onset date of illness for the last\nreported case was 27 Aug 2007, and therefore no product recall has\nbeen initiated. Enhanced case surveillance has commenced to enable a\nmore rapid response to the investigation of cases.\nReference:\n1.

Seed companies offer special types of seed\nto grow baby corn, but all of these grow plants and corn ears that\nare just as big as the usual corn.

The 1st cases to be reported were\nemployees of 2 companies. They had eaten a variety of vegetables,\nincluding raw baby corn and sugar snaps in their workplace canteens.\nPreliminary interviews with further cases indicated that the probable\nsource was imported baby corn or sugar snaps that had been\ndistributed at the beginning of August 2007. The suspected foods were\ndistributed by a wholesaler to green grocers, catering firms,\nrestaurants, and shops throughout the country. Due to the strong\nsuspicion about these food vehicles, the Veterinary and Food\nAdministration issued a recall of baby corn and sugar snaps on 17 Aug\n2007. Furthermore, the SSI undertook investigations to determine the\nextent of the outbreak and its source.\nA cohort study was undertaken in one of the many workplaces to have\nbeen affected by the outbreak to test the primary hypothesis that\ninfection was associated with eating baby corn in the work canteen.\nOf 103 web-based questionnaire responses returned by 21 Aug 2007 from\npeople who had eaten in the canteen, 24 reported gastrointestinal\nsymptoms consistent with shigellosis. In the questionnaire, one set\nof questions focused on which days the employees had eaten in the\ncanteen and the others on which food items had been eaten in the\ncanteen on 6 and 7 Aug 2007, the 2 days when the suspected baby corn\nwas known to have been served. There was a higher, although\nnon-significant, relative risk of illness among people who had eaten\nin the canteen on 6, 7, or 8 Aug 2007. The relative risk for\ngastrointestinal symptoms among people who had eaten baby corn was\n4.6 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 2.0-10.9) on 6 Aug 2007 and\n4.0 (95 percent CI: 1.7-9.6) on 7 Aug 2007. The attack rate in those\nemployees who ate baby corn on 6 or 7 Aug 2007 was 64 percent.\nConcurrent with the cohort study, notified cases from different parts\nof Denmark were interviewed and asked about food intake prior to\nonset of symptoms. The results of these interviews were consistent\nwith baby corn being the source of infection. Moreover, a large\nnumber of workplaces were found to be affected by the outbreak and\ntheir canteens had served baby corn from the suspected imported\nbatches in their salad bars. Taken together, the available\nepidemiological and food trace-back evidence strongly supported the\nfinding that baby corn imported from Thailand was the source of the outbreak.\nBetween 6 and 24 Aug 2007, the SSI received notifications of 122 _S.\nsonnei_ isolates. This is almost triple the number of isolates\nconfirmed for the whole of 2006 (46 isolates). A case in this\noutbreak was defined as any case of _S. sonnei_ infection acquired in\nDenmark after 1 Aug 2007 excluding those who had travelled to an\nendemic area in the 3 days before onset of symptoms or those that\ncould be explained by an alternative exposure.\nTo date, 120 cases have met the agreed case definition (2 of the 122\nnotified ones were excluded as travel-related). Cases were reported\nthrough the laboratory surveillance system from the whole of Denmark,\nbut most cases (97/120, 81 percent) were reported from Zealand\n[Sjaelland, the largest island of Denmark (excluding Greenland, which\nis a Danish territory). - CopyEd.MJ]. The median age was 38 years\n(range 1-92 years) and 90 cases (75 percent) were female. Information\non symptom onset dates, which ranged from 6 Aug 2007 until 17 Aug\n2007, was available for 55 cases (Figure [for figure, see source URL\n- Mod.LL]). A quarter of these cases (13/55) were known to have been\nadmitted to hospital. To date, in-depth interviews have been\nperformed for 35 cases. Of these, all reported diarrhea, with half\n(17/35) experiencing bloody diarrhoea and 91 percent (32/35)\nreporting stomach cramps.\nAntibiotic resistance typing on 11 samples taken from cases has\nrevealed that isolates were resistant to tetracycline, ampicillin,\nsulfonamides, cephalothin, and streptomycin, but susceptible to\nnalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, mecillinam\n[amdinocillin - Mod.LL], and gentamicin. Typing of isolates by pulse\nfield gel electrophoresis is ongoing. Microbiological examination of\nthe suspected batches of imported baby corn has detected high levels\nof _E. coli_, indicating fecal contamination. Additionally\n_Salmonella_ (serotypes as yet undetermined) have been found in 2\nbatches. _Shigella_ have so far not been detected, but analyses are\nstill ongoing.\nAn Early Warning Response System report was issued on 18 Aug 2007.\nThe available information suggests that the outbreak is confined to\nDenmark but we encourage other countries to be aware of potential\nclusters of _S. sonnei_ cases. A small number of cases have been\nreported from Sweden but those contacted so far all appear to have\nbeen infected in Denmark. However, it is known that a small part of a\nbatch of baby corn imported into Denmark was sold on to Sweden. This\nis currently undergoing microbiological examination to determine\nwhether it was contaminated. Furthermore, among the cases in the\noutbreak there were individuals who acquired the infection on the\nferry between Oslo and Copenhagen and it was found that baby corn\nfrom an incriminated batch was served on this ferry.\nDue to the long shelf life of baby corn (3 weeks), the interventions\nmade to trace the source of infection and to recall the product are\nlikely to have prevented additional cases of illness. Although\nshigellosis does occur in Denmark and small outbreaks are\noccasionally seen, most cases are travel-related. The last large _S.\nsonnei_ outbreak in Denmark was in 1998, also associated with eating\nraw baby corn imported from Thailand (1).\nReference:\n1.

The curd sold at the 2 markets was produced in a small\ncommercial dairy in Alytus, in the south of the country. An\nepidemiological investigation was begun on 7 Oct 2004 to identify\nrisk factors and the route of transmission, and control measures for\ninfection prevention were implemented.\nShigellosis-related morbidity in Lithuania during the past 10 years\nhas decreased from 143 per 100 000 population in 1995 to 23 per 100\n000 in 2004. Shigellosis is the cause of around 5 percent of all\nacute gastrointestinal infections in Lithuania. In 2002, 70 percent\nof all isolated shigella types were _Shigella sonnei_, 79 percent in\n2003 and 89 percent in 2004. Every year about 50 percent of known\nshigellosis cases are reported to be due to foodborne infections, and\nabout 30 percent are infected through person-to-person transmission.\nBetween 9 and 29 shigellosis outbreaks were reported annually between\n1996 and 2004 (an average of 19 outbreaks a year). 70 percent were\nfamily clusters. Some of these outbreaks were linked to the\nconsumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products that did not\nundergo additional thermal processing.\nCase finding\n------------\nBetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004, the Vilnius Public Health Center\nreceived 41 reports about clinical and/or laboratory confirmed\nshigellosis cases in Vilnius city. All these patients were directly\ninterviewed, and 36 cases were selected for analysis. All 36 of the\nselected shigellosis cases were clinically diagnosed and laboratory\nconfirmed as _S. sonnei_, and all were in patients living in Vilnius,\nwho between 23 Sep and 8 Oct had eaten unpasteurized milk curds\nproduced in a small dairy in Alytus and sold in 2 Vilnius markets.\nThe suspected curd product was thought to have been on sale from 23\nSep 2004, and production and sale were suspended on 8 Oct.\nAnalytical study\n----------------\nDirect interviews were carried out with 36 patients confirmed as _S.\nsonnei_ cases, and 83 controls. 2 types of controls were selected:\nthe 1st group lived in the same household as patients confirmed to\nhave _S. sonnei_ infections and did not have any symptoms in the\nmonth before the interview (symptoms were defined as 3 or more\nepisodes of diarrhea in a 24-hour period, nausea, vomiting, abdominal\npain, or fever). The 2nd control group were patients who had been\ntreated in other units of the hospital and who did not have any of\nthe symptoms described above in the month before interview. Controls\nwere selected according to demographic features, age and sex,\nalthough it was not possible to find an appropriate match for each case.\nCases and controls were interviewed with a standard questionnaire,\nrequesting personal information, clinical data, demographic\ninformation and information on food consumed during the week before\nonset of symptoms (for cases) or the week before the interview (for\ncontrols). The food questions focused on purchase, preparation and\nperiod of consumption of unpasteurized milk products. Information\nabout food eaten by children under 12 years was obtained from\nparents. Survey results were analysed using Epi Info version 3.3.2.\nEnvironmental investigation\n---------------------------\nOn 8 Oct 2004, the dairy in Alytus and the 2 markets in Vilnius were\ninspected by officials from local public health centres and the\nnational food and veterinary service, and raw milk, water, and\nenvironmental samples were taken for culture. The environmental\ninvestigation at the dairy examined milk and milk products, and the\ntransport, storage and preparation processes. Staff working at the\ndairy were interviewed about any recent illness. Vilnius food and\nveterinary service evaluated the condition of food in 2 Vilnius\nmarkets, and took environmental samples to assess bacteriological\nenvironmental contamination. Bacteriological samples were also taken\nfrom staff working in milk curds preparation, transport, and trading.\nFurther results\n---------------\nThe Vilnius Public Health Center reported 41 cases of shigellosis\nbetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004. 36 laboratory-confirmed cases of _S.\nsonnei_ infection were found to be associated with the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk curd that was prepared in a dairy. Samples from 8\npeople living or working in the dairy were laboratory-tested. _S.\nsonnei_ was isolated from the dairy owner and 2 of her household\nmembers (who did not work in food production). 4 workers who handled\nunpasteurized milk curds at the 2 markets were also sampled, and the\nsame type of _S. sonnei_ was isolated from one of these workers. The\ncultures were typed at the laboratory of the National Public Health\nInvestigation Center. All pathogen cultures isolated from patients,\nworkers, and inhabitants of the dairy, and the market worker were of\nthe same type and resistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nChildren under 14 years made up 50 percent of the patients (18/36),\nand people aged 65 years and older made up 16 percent of patients\n(6/36). 23 patients (69 percent) were admitted to hospital. 80\npercent of outbreak cases were in women and 20 percent were in men.\nThe earliest recorded date of symptom onset was 25 Sep, and the\nlatest was 11 Oct 2004 (Figure - To see figure, see original URL).\nThe incubation period was reported to be 24 hours for 50 percent of\ncases, 48 hours for 21 percent, and 72 hours for 29 percent. After\nevaluating maximum and minimum incubation period duration and dates\nof onset, the period during which the contaminated curd was on sale\nwas defined as 23 Sep to 8 Oct 2004.\nVariables were examined for association with illness in single\nvariable analysis. Only eating unpasteurized milk curd remained\nsignificantly associated with shigellosis (odds ratio 14.78; 95\npercent confidence interval 3.33-65.5; p less than 0.05) No other\nfood item was positively associated with the disease.\nThe dairy was licensed to produce unpasteurized milk products and\nsold its products at 2 Vilnius markets. During the outbreak\ninvestigation the national food and veterinary service specialists\nidentified many violations of hygiene and food safety regulations.\nThe counter at one of the markets where milk products were sold was\nfound to be contaminated with coliform bacteria.\nBacteriological samples were taken from all persons working in the\ndairy. _S. sonnei_ isolates were obtained from dairy owner and 2\nmembers of her household who did not handle food. No pathogenic\nbacteria were detected in milk products produced in the dairy.\nControl and prevention measures\n----------------------------------\nThe local food and veterinary service in Alytus temporarily closed\nthe dairy as soon as the unpasteurized milk curd was suspected as a\nsource of infection.\nThe national food and veterinary service withdrew the suspect milk\ncurd from sale in Vilnius. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated from\nsamples, the owner of the dairy and her 2 household members were\nadmitted to hospital. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated, the infected\nperson who worked at one of the 2 markets in Vilnius was instructed\nto stay home from work until she had fully recovered. All staff\nhandling food at the dairy and the markets attended compulsory\nhygiene classes. The suspected risk factors were made public through\nthe media, and the public were recommended to cook unpasteurised milk\nproducts thoroughly before consumption.\nDiscussion\n-----------\nThe results of the epidemiological investigation concluded that the\nshigellosis outbreak in Vilnius was linked to unpasteurized curd that\nhad been contaminated in a dairy because (1) cases of the same type\nof _Shigella sonnei_ were reported only in Vilnius; (2) the milk\ncurds from the dairy in Alytus were on sale only in Vilnius, from 23\nSep to 8 Oct 2004; (3) all patients had bought the curd from the same\nstalls at 1 of 2 markets in Vilnius; and (4) _S. sonnei_ isolates\nfrom patients, dairy staff and market staff were of the same type and\nresistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nShigellosis outbreaks in Lithuania tend to occur within households or\nnursery schools, but this outbreak demonstrated that the risk of\nshigellosis spread through unpasteurized milk products still\npersists. Outbreaks that occur due to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk products are reported every year in Lithuania.\nMost of these outbreaks are linked to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk and milk products bought from unlicensed\nvillage-based producers. Unpasteurized milk products are often\nbought by old people in Lithuania. Generally, _Shigella sp._ are not\nisolated from the milk products that cause outbreaks, and the\noutbreak source is detected only by epidemiological investigation methods.\n[Some] of the main outbreak control measures [are] food safety and\nhygiene training for people handling milk products and\ngastrointestinal infectious disease prevention training for the\npublic. This must involve familiarizing the public with the idea that\n[infected persons] must avoid preparing food, and should stay at home\nand not attend work or school until symptoms have ended.\n[Reported by: Zagrebneviene G (<g.zagrebneviene@ulpkc.lt>),\nJasulaitiene V, Morkunas B, et al]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of\npathogens including _Campylobacter_, _Brucella_, _E. coli_ O157 ,\n_Salmonella_ (including multidrug-resistant strains), _Mycobacterium\nbovis_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_ (1, 2). Persons who drink\nunpasteurized milk and milk products might believe that these\nproducts taste better, provide greater nutrition than pasteurized\nproducts, and/or decrease the risk for various medical conditions\n(3). However, the benefits of consuming unpasteurized milk and milk\nproducts have never been validated scientifically (4). The above\npathogens cause zoonoses -- infections spread to humans from animals.\nShigellosis spread by unpasteurized dairy products is not a zoonosis,\nexcept when related to primates. Since pasteurized milk was not\nfound to transmit shigellosis, the contamination must have occurred\nprior to pasteurization.\nIndividuals with symptomatic shigellosis (bacterial dysentery) are\nmuch less likely to transmit shigellosis by contaminating\nunpasteurized milk, as they can be quite ill. The posting does not\ncomment on symptoms in the dairy and food workers, but their\nhospitalization might suggest that they were symptomatic. It is\npossible that only one of the workers at the dairy caused the\ncontamination; or that the others, with the patients and the market\nworker, were infected by the contaminated milk.\n1.

A week ago, health\nauthorities reported 343 cases, including those of diarrhea. Now the number\nhas escalated to a record 475 of which 27 were confirmed as cholera.\nIn the Engela district of the Ohangwena Region, 10 deaths from acute\ndiarrhea have been reported so far. About 17 cases of diarrhea have been\nfound in Opuwo, while other affected areas are Ruacana and Okatope in the\nnorth.\nIn a brief interview with New Era yesterday, permanent secretary of the\nMinistry of Health and Social Services, Dr Kalumbi Shangula, said 'In all\ninstances, they are imported cases. And the 10 deaths are due to a result\nof acute diarrhea and not cholera,' said Dr Shangula, adding that most of\nthe victims turn out to be elderly people with weak immune systems that\nmake them more prone to the disease.\nHowever, public worry about the scare of a suspected cholera outbreak in\nthe north resulted in May Day celebrations last week being cancelled by the\nNational Union of Namibian Workers at Oshikango.

In a\nseparate event, a 3rd case was hospitalized in early April 2007. All 3\ntravelers had returned from a trip to India (Rajasthan). They all required\nurgent specialized care in an intensive care unit and were treated by\nintravenous rehydration therapy and antibiotics. The _V. cholerae_ O1\nstrains isolated during the 1st cluster of 2 cases and the 3rd unrelated\ncase were tested for antibiotic susceptibility. These tests showed\nresistance to nalidixic acid with decreased susceptibility to ofloxacin and\nciprofloxacin. The isolates were sensitive to tetracycline and doxycycline,\nand one of them was sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\nThe vast majority of cholera cases worldwide are treated by oral\nrehydration therapy (ORT) which, when administered in a timely and\nsufficient manner, has transformed the prognosis of cholera since the early\n1960s and remains the mainstay of cholera treatment (1). A total of 129\nimported cases of confirmed cholera were diagnosed in France between 1973\nand 2005, with a median of 3 diagnosed cases per year (2). An additional 2\ncases were diagnosed in 2006. Although many may go undetected, the number\nof diagnosed cases is on the decrease. Imported cholera cases, however, are\ndiagnosed increasingly in infants or elderly persons who may not tolerate\nwell massive fluid loss (2,3).\nAntibiotics may be a useful adjunct (1) as they have been shown to reduce\nthe duration of diarrhea (1,4-8), the volume of diarrhea (5,6,8), the\nvolume of fluids required for rehydration (9,10), the duration of hospital\nstay (9), and the duration of excretion of _V. cholerae_ (4-8). Although\nemergence of multiple antibiotic resistance during cholera epidemic\noutbreaks has been documented over the past 30 years (11,12), there is\nlittle data on the prognosis of cholera in patients infected with resistant\nstrains. Available data points to longer-lasting and more severe cholera in\npatients treated with inappropriate antibiotics (1). In industrialized\ncountries, treating with inappropriate antibiotics may be associated with\nincreased morbidity in patients and higher costs to the community (1).\nIn a 2004 publication (13), the World Health Organization (WHO) examined\nthe possible antibiotic regimen indicated when needed in outbreak or highly\nendemic situations. The WHO recommends single-dose doxycycline or\ntetracycline 4 times a day for 3 days or erythromycin in young children 4\ntimes a day for 4 days. Although WHO does not recommend fluoroquinolones\nfor treating suspected cholera, they are widely used in the 1st-line\ntreatment of diarrhea caused by infections acquired in developing\ncountries. _V. cholerae_ O1 strains resistant to fluoroquinolones have\nemerged in India (14) and Bangladesh (15,16) over the past years for a\nnumber of reasons. Quite logically, it was only a matter of time before\nresistant strains were imported to Europe. The impact of emerging\nantibiotic-resistant cholera strains is greatest on patients in endemic\ncountries but also affects imported cases. Community- or hospital-based\nclinicians considering antibiotic therapy for cholera in returning\ntravelers before susceptibility testing should bear in mind that at least 3\ncases imported to France from Rajasthan in 2007 showed decreased\nsusceptibility to fluoroquinolones.\nReferences:\n1.

'We're concerned and keeping a\nclose eye on it. We're just re-enforcing good hand-washing,' said Karen\nThoennes, health services coordinator at the Escambia County School\nDistrict.

Condon says shigellosis has become and epidemic in the city\nand that it's 'keeping us very, very busy.'\nRight now, the Lubbock City Health Department is investigating 48 cases of\nshigellosis and that's more than double the number of cases they tracked\nlast month.\nCondon says _Shigella_ is 'very highly contagious, it takes as little as 10\nbacteria to transmit the bacteria from person to person and that's why we\nare so eager to inform people to properly wash hands often using the\nbathroom or before preparing foods.'\nAnd for the little ones at All God's Children Learning Center, washing\ntheir hands is something they enjoy.\n'Our teachers model what we teach to the kids. We have a song that we sing\njust to reinforce in their little minds that every time you hear this song,\nyou need to wash your hands,' says Wellington.\nWithout medical treatment, it takes about 24 to 48 hours for shigella to\nexit your system.

'The outbreak can\ncontinue, because Shigella can also be transmitted by the oral route\nand contact between people; for this reason it is important to\nmaintain good hygiene,' added Campos.

It is most dangerous where there is no proper\nsanitation and human waste is not properly disposed of.'\nKeeping hands clean and ensuring that nobody with diarrhoea prepared food\nor looked after children were among the simple ways to prevent the disease.\n'The awareness campaign, along with the cooler weather, has helped control\nthe number of cases,' said Dr Mahomed.\nThe cleansing department had been asked to address the problem of poor\nsanitation in informal areas, and there were plans to replace the old\nbucket system still in operation.\n'Of course, in the long-term, we are aiming at providing water-borne sewage\nsystems,' said Dr Mahomed.\n[Written by: Di Caelers]\n[Khayelitsha is one of the largest townships in the Cape Town Metropolitan\nCouncil area, with population estimates of over one million.

LaBudde <ral@lcfltd.com>\nSource: FSNET & Communicable Disease -- Australia Vol. 22; No. 13\n\nThirteen out of 32 persons from two states who attended a lunch after a\nfuneral in Adelaide on 2 Jun 1998 became ill with diarrhea. Most had onset\nof illness within three days but one case occurred eight days after and one\n28 days after the lunch. The person whose illness commenced eight days\nafter was the sister of one of the early onset cases and it was her\nboyfriend who became ill after 28 days. The duration of illness ranged from\nthree to 10 days (mean=6.2 days) with reported symptoms in addition to\ndiarrhea being abdominal pain (11), vomiting (7) and macroscopic blood in\nthe stool (3).\nOnly one person had a history of recent travel outside Australia before the\nfuneral. This had been a medically uneventful trip to the Philippines six\nweeks previous. Similarly in the two months before the funeral one person\nhad returned from southern Queensland, one from a trip to Western Australia\nand the Northern Territory and one from Western Australia only. Of these\ntravelers only the third had suffered any illness during their travel.\nSix people came from Melbourne to Adelaide to attend the funeral. Most of\nthe food for the function was purchased the day before from the\nrefrigerated counter of a retail outlet, transported for 20 minutes in the\nboot of a car and then refrigerated overnight in the kitchen of the flat\nwhere the lunch was served. During that night one item (sliced ham) was\nremoved from the fridge and some of it used. The remainder of the ham was\nreturned to the fridge. The person who handled the ham during the night had\nrecovered earlier that week from a diarrheal illness contracted in the\nKimberleys. The cause of this diarrhea had not been determined. _S. sonnei_\nbiotype G was grown from the stool of three of the cases (onset 2 days\n(n=2) and 8 days), _S. sonnei_ not biotyped from one case (onset 28 days\nafter the funeral) and _S. dysenteriae_ type 2 from the stool of one other\ncase (onset of diarrhea 1 day after the funeral). None of the other cases\nprovided a stool specimen.\nA cohort study implicated only the sliced ham of the foods served at the\nfuneral lunch as a possible vehicle for this outbreak. Even including a\nprobable secondary case (8 day incubation) who did not eat ham as a primary\ncase and counting one of the early cases (who was not completely certain\nthat she had eaten the ham) as a non-consumer, the relative risk was 2.77\n(95% confidence limits 1.05-7.27). With these conservative case definitions\nthe attack rate for ham eaters was eight out of 13 (62%). The more likely\nsituation with the late onset case as a secondary case and accepting the\nhistory that the uncertain persons belief that she probably had eaten ham\ngave a relative risk of 5.46 (95% confidence limits 1.40 -21.27).The attack\nrate with these definitions was nine of 14 (64%).\nThe retailer from whom the ham was purchased is a large supplier which\nturns over multiple legs each week. Inspection of this premises two weeks\nafter the funeral by an environmental health officer of the Adelaide City\nCouncil revealed no poor food handling practices. Laboratory cultures of\nham collected at that time did not grow _Shigella_. If there had been a\nproblem at or before the retail stage we would also have expected more\nmetropolitan cases of _Shigella_ notified unrelated to the funeral.\nOur suspicion is that the person recently recovered from diarrhea acquired\nin the north west of Australia who handled the ham the night before the\nfuneral contaminated it. This person also consumed the ham but did not\nsuffer further illness.\nSome person-to-person transmission at the lunch was also possible. The meal\nwas served to a large group of people in a very small flat and one person\nreported that the hand towel in the bathroom became sodden from hand wiping\nduring the afternoon. The multiple _Shigella_ isolates, especially in a\nmetropolitan outbreak, are surprising but it seems unlikely that there\nwould be multiple sources. Nevertheless the one isolate of _S. dysenteriae_\ncame from a person who did not eat ham and who had a flu-like illness on\nthe day of the funeral but developed prolonged (10 days) of diarrhea the\nday after.\nThis is only the second _S. dysenteriae_ type 2 infection notified in South\nAustralia since 1990. By contrast in 1997 and 1998 _S. sonnei_ biotype G\nhas been the commonest _Shigella_ notified. Before 1996 most cases of _S.\nsonnei_ biotype G were acquired overseas but only four of the 30 notified\nso far in 1998 had recent travel histories outside Australia.\nAcknowledgments\nNotifying doctors: S Hadges, B Kitchener, S Nield, C Teh.

Usually less than three domestically\nacquired cases are reported each week. Most of the cases were adults and\nreports were received from all parts of Denmark. In two cases information\nsupplied by the attending physician suggested that uncooked 'baby maize'\nmight be the vehicle of the infection. A case control study conducted on 6\nand 7 August showed an association between consumption of 'baby maize' and\n_S. sonnei_. Of 10 incident cases, 9 had consumed 'baby maize' in a three\nday period before onset of illness, compared with none of 10 controls\nmatched for age, sex, and municipality.\nThe implicated 'baby maize' was imported from Thailand and distributed in\nDenmark in packages of 125 grams. There are only a few importers in Denmark\nand the product was distributed to retail outlets throughout the country.\nA total of 140 cases of _S. sonnei_ [infection] have been reported to week\n32 in 1998. One hundred and one (72%) were not associated with travel,\ncompared with only 25 domestically acquired cases in the same period of\n1997. Many of the cases in 1998 were related to five local outbreaks before\nthe present widespread outbreak. In each of the five outbreaks, vegetables\nor lettuce served in a salad bar or as ingredients in mixed salad have been\nthe suspected vehicles. It was not possible, however, to identify specific\nsalad ingredients as the source of the shigella infections. With hindsight,\n'baby maize' from Thailand may be the source for most of these outbreaks as\nwell as for some other sporadic cases in 1998. 'Baby maize' was served in\nall the five outbreaks and interviews with _S. sonnei_ patients with dates\nof onset of illness before 27 July suggest that this was a more common\nexposure compared with exposures to other raw vegetables. Iceberg lettuce,\nwhich previously has been associated with outbreaks of _S. sonnei_ was not\nconsidered a likely source because the iceberg lettuce consumed at each\noutbreak had been produced in different countries (Spain, the Netherlands,\nand Denmark).\nThe Danish Food Authority was informed. A press release describing the\nproblem was issued to the public on 7 August. At the same time importers\nand major retailers assisted with implementing withdrawal of the product.\nParticipants in the European Union Enter-net surveillance network\n(scientific coordinator Ian Fisher <ifisher@phls.co.uk> are reviewing\nrecent data on _S. sonnei_ infection in their countries.\n[Reported by Kare Molbak <krm@ssi.dk> Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen\nand Jakob Neimann <jne@svs.dk> Danish Zoonosis Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n......................................es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
