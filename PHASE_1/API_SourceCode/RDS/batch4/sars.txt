So this is not a situation of 'if' there will be an outbreak of one of these coronaviruses, but rather when and how prepared we'll be to address it.'\n\nResearchers said their discovery is notable, as it highlights an ongoing debate over the US government's decision to suspend all gain of function experiments on a variety of select agents, earlier this year [2015].\n\nThe move has put a substantial standstill on the development of vaccines or treatments for these pathogens should there be an outbreak.\n\nSARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, first jumped from animals to humans in 2002 to 2003, triggering a worldwide outbreak with around 8000 cases being diagnosed, including one at the university's Chapel Hill location. Almost 800 people lost their lives during the outbreak.\n\nSARS-CoV presents much like flu symptoms, but can accelerate, compromising a person's breathing and lead to a deadly form of pneumonia.\n\nThe outbreak was controlled through public health interventions, and the original virus was thought to have been extinct since 2004.\n\nDr Baric and his team demonstrated that the newly-identified SARS-like virus, labelled SHC014-CoV, can jump from its host, Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\nThe virus latches on to the same receptor in the body as the SARS virus, allowing it to be transmitted across to humans.\n\nIn addition, the team discovered the new virus also replicates as well as SARS-CoV in primary human lung cells, the preferred target for infection.\n\nDr Baric, who works at the university's Gillings School of Global Public Health and is an expert in coronaviruses, added: 'This virus is highly pathogenic and treatments developed against the original SARS virus in 2002 and the ZMapp drugs used to fight Ebola fail to neutralise and control this particular virus.\n\n'So building resources, rather than limiting them, to both examine animal populations for new threats and develop therapeutics, is key for limiting future outbreaks.'\n\nThe findings are published in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\n[Byline: Lizzie Parry]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The finding is presented in the last issue of Nature Medicine http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nm.3985.html.\n\nUsing metagenomic data showed that chimeric SHC014 viruses replicate in human airway cultures, cause pathogenesis in vivo, and escape current therapeutics. This work suggests a potential risk of a SARS-like pandemic that warrants preparedness efforts.\n\nHorseshoe bats (_Rhinolophus_ spp) were the source of SARS-CoV's, as is also the case for SHC014-CoV.

The discovery of RaTG13 bat coronavirus in China suggested a high probability of a bat origin. Here we report molecular and serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses (SC2r-CoVs) actively circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Whole genome sequences were obtained from 5 independent bats (_Rhinolophus acuminatus_) in a Thai cave yielding a single isolate (named RacCS203) which is most related to the RmYN02 isolate found in _R. malayanus_ in Yunnan, China. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were also detected in bats of the same colony and in a pangolin at a wildlife checkpoint in Southern Thailand. Antisera raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of RmYN02 was able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that the RBD of RacCS203 or RmYN02 failed to bind ACE2. Although the origin of the virus remains unresolved, our study extended the geographic distribution of genetically diverse SC2r-CoVs from Japan and China to Thailand over a 4800-km [about 2983 mi] range. Cross-border surveillance is urgently needed to find the immediate progenitor virus of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[_Rhinolophus_ species (horseshoe bats) were found to carry a diverse group of SARS-like coronaviruses and, thus, are thought to be the natural reservoirs of this group of viruses. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 shares approximately 80% and 96.2% nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV RaTG13, respectively. This high homology suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might have originated from bats. However, whether transmission from bats to humans was direct or through an intermediate animal host remains to be determined.\n\nPangolins are peculiar mammals of the order Pholidota, with only one extant taxonomic family, Manidae. There are 8 living species grouped in 3 genera. _Manis_ comprises the 4 species found in Asia, while _Phataginus_ and _Smutsia_ each include 2 species living in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nPangolins entered in the COVID-19 discussion when they were suggested as the possible source of infection for humans, acting as a bridge species which hypothetically exposed humans to a coronavirus that naturally circulates in bats of the genus _Rhinolophus_.

The discovery represents an important discovery in the hunt for the source of SARS. According to researcher Tu Changchun, bats carry more viruses than any other creature. 130 different strains [virus species] have been found. Although in recent years, many types of coronavirus have been found in bats, and it has gradually been established that bats are the natural host of SARS-like coronaviruses, there has been no evidence of transmission to human beings, and no evidence showing there are significant differences in the genetic structure of the virus. A new virus has now been found in Yunnan bats, and the genetic diversity of this new virus has been clarified. The research group also found that a rotavirus infecting bats in the region may be the cause of diarrhea among children in Southeast Asian countries.\n\nIn 2012, the Middle East reported an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus: Middle East respiratory syndrome [virus]. The clinical manifestations are similar to SARS, causing a general panic similar to that accompanying the original SARS outbreak.\n\n[Byline: Shen Jifei]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The preceding news item was translated from a Chinese-language article and refers to a recent paper published in the Journal of Virology entitled 'Identification of diverse alphacoronaviruses and genomic characterization of a novel SARS-like coronavirus from bats in China.' By Biao He and 12 others at the China's Military Veterinary Institute of Military Medical Sciences.\n\nAbstract:\n'Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been identified in bats in China, Europe and Africa, most have a genetic organization significantly distinct from human/civet cat SARS CoVs in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates receptor binding and determines the host spectrum, resulting in their failure to cause human infections and making them unlikely progenitors of human/civet SARS CoV.\n\nHere, a viral metagenomic analysis of 268 bat rectal swabs collected from 4 counties in Yunnan province has identified hundreds of sequences relating to alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed that alphacoronaviruses had diversities with some obvious differences from those reported previously. Full genomic analysis of a new SARS-like CoV from Baoshan (LYRa11) showed that it was 29 805 nt in length with 13 open reading frames (ORFs), sharing 91 percent nt identity with human/civet cat SARS CoVs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367, while 89 percent with other bat SARS-like CoVs. Notably, it showed highest sequence identity with the S gene of SARS CoVs and Rs3367, especially in the RBD region. Antigenic analysis showed that the S1 domain of LYRa11 could be efficiently recognized by SARS-convalescent human serum indicating that LYRa11 is a novel virus antigenically close to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is likely a recombinant descended from parental lineages that had evolved into a number of bat SARS-like CoVs.'\n\nConclusion: The authors conclude that although many SARS-like coronaviruses (CoVs) have been discovered in bats worldwide, there are significantly different genomic structures, particularly in the S1 domain, which is responsible for host tropism determination, between bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS CoVs, indicating that most reported bat SARS-like CoVs are not the progenitors of human SARS CoV. We have identified diverse alphacoronaviruses and a close relative (LYRa11) to SARS CoV in bats collected in Yunnan, China. Further analysis showed that alpha- and betacoronaviruses have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. Notably, full genomic sequence and antigenic study demonstrated that LYRa11 is phylogenetically and antigenically closely related to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is a recombinant from certain bat SARS-like CoVs circulating in Yunnan province.\n\nClearly, the coronavirus described above is closely related to the bat coronaviruses associated with SARS and MERS but is not directly responsible for these diseases. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/351.]", "summary": "\n\nConclusion: The authors conclude that although many SARS-like coronaviruses (CoVs) have been discovered in bats worldwide, there are significantly different genomic structures, particularly in the S1 domain, which is responsible for host tropism determination, between bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS CoVs, indicating that most reported bat SARS-like CoVs are not the progenitors of human SARS Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been identified in bats in China, Europe and Africa, most have a genetic organization significantly distinct from human/civet cat SARS CoVs in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates receptor binding and determines the host spectrum, resulting in their failure to cause human infections and making them unlikely progenitors of human/civet SARS CoV.\n\n Full genomic analysis of a new SARS-like CoV from Baoshan (LYRa11) showed that it was 29 805 nt in length with 13 open reading frames (ORFs), sharing 91 percent nt identity with human/civet cat SARS CoVs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367, while 89 percent with other bat SARS-like CoVs.

The new virus, which they called WIV1, is the closest match yet between SARS [virus] and coronaviruses from bats. In fact, the viruses are close enough genetically that antibodies in stored blood samples from SARS patients neutralized the virus in 7 of 9 samples tested. The scientists also reported that the virus uses the same receptor -- called ACE2 -- to latch onto and infect cells that SARS [virus] does. In laboratory work, WIV1 was able to directly infect human cells. That, they suggested, means that viruses like this may not need an animal go-between to cause human outbreaks -- they may be able to jump directly from bats to people. 'Intermediate hosts many not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoV [ SARS-like coronavirus],' they wrote in the paper, which is published in the journal Nature (see abstract reproduced in part [2] below).\n\nOther scientists, though, cautioned that just because something occurs in the artificial confines of a laboratory doesn't mean it would also happen readily in nature. 'We've known for a long time that bats carry all sorts of dangerous viruses. Yet we don't all die,' said Marion Koopmans, chief of virology in the Dutch National Institute of Public Health's Center for Infectious Disease Control. 'Cells in a test tube in the lab are very different from cells in a human host.' Koopmans said even if it isn't essential to have another animal serve as a bridge -- the way infected civet cats did in Chinese animal markets during SARS -- it may remain more likely that bat viruses might take an indirect route into the human population. 'It may not be essential to have an in-between host, but it may be that if bats carry viruses that easily infect intermediate hosts, that their ability to get to humans is much greater,' she said.\n\nMichael Osterholm, Director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said a factor that needs to be considered is how bat viruses could come in contact with human cells. In other words, what body fluid from the bat -- saliva, urine, feces, blood -- carries and therefore can transmit the virus? 'If the primary body fluid involved with transmitting (bat) coronaviruses to other animal species or humans in feces, the question becomes: How often is that likely to occur?' Osterholm asked.\n\nPeter Daszak, co-senior author of the paper, said it is true that this type of viral species jump is uncommon. But he said as humans encroach on the habitat of bats and other wild species, the risk rises. 'There are many, many thousands of people -- millions -- in China who live close to bats. The problem is that we're doing things that put us at risk. We're increasingly catching bats, bringing them into the wildlife (meat) trade, and eating them globally,'' said Daszak, a disease ecologist who is president of the conservation group Ecohealth Alliance. 'So yes, the risk is low. But actually, multiply that by billions of people and multiply it by an increasing annual encroachment into forest and an increasing connectivity with wildlife, and the risk grows.'\n\nThe finding resulted from work done in China's Yunnan Province. The scientists gathered feces and collected fecal swabs from horseshoe bats over the course of 12 months from April 2011 and September 2012. Of 117 samples, 23 per cent were positive for coronaviruses. Genetic sequencing of RNA from the samples showed evidence of 7 different strains of coronaviruses. The scientists were able to generate genetic sequences for 2, which were a 95 per cent match for a SARS virus known as Tor2. (Its name indicates it was isolated from a Toronto SARS patient.) But WIV1 was the only live virus they were able to extract from the material. Daszak said this is the 1st time, to his knowledge, that has occurred. They tested the virus to see if it could grow in a wide variety of different types of cells from different species -- human respiratory tract and pig kidney cells among them. The virus grew in a surprising number, though not all.\n\nGerman coronavirus expert Christian Drosten was involved in a study published last year [2013] that showed the MERS coronavirus -- a SARS cousin -- had a similar ability to infect cells from a diverse number of animal species. At the time, Drosten and his co-authors reported this was a rare feature of MERS, which is the virus behind the ongoing outbreak in the Middle East. Drosten said seeing similar behaviour in this new virus suggests some coronaviruses probably pose more of a risk to humans than others because they have more potential to jump species. 'Here we have a big challenge for future research: to discriminate those potentially dangerous viruses from those that are ... most likely harmless because they are restricted to their hosts,' Drosten said in an email.\n\nThe [research] was carried out by scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ecohealth Alliance, the University of California, Davis, the CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation] Australian Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong, East China Normal University at Shanghai, and Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore.]\n\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 30 Oct 2013\nSource: Nature journal [edited]\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12711.html\n\n[Ref: Ge XY, Li JL, Yang XL, et al: Isolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor.

An ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus suggests that this group of viruses remains a key threat and that their distribution is wider than previously recognized. Although bats have been suggested to be the natural reservoirs of both viruses, attempts to isolate the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV from bats have been unsuccessful. Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have now been reported from bats in China, Europe, and Africa, but none is considered a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV because of their phylogenetic disparity from this virus and the inability of their spike proteins to use the SARS-CoV cellular receptor molecule, the human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2).\n\nHere we report whole-genome sequences of 2 novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: _Rhinolophidae_) in Yunnan, China: RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat coronaviruses, particularly in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Most importantly, we report the 1st recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9 per cent sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets, and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism.\n\nOur results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen-discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A photograph of a Chinese horseshoe bat can be seen at http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/styles/ss_media_popup/public/media/article/horseshoe_bat-flickr.jpg?itok=QVyS7C4_.\n\nGenome sequencing revealed that 2 of these novel viruses are more closely related to the SARS-CoV than any virus seen before.

As of [3 Jan 2020], a total of 44 patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology have been reported to WHO by the national authorities in China. Of the 44 cases reported, 11 are severely ill, while the remaining 33 patients are in stable condition. According to media reports, the concerned market in Wuhan was closed on [1 Jan 2020] for environmental sanitation and disinfection.\n\nThe causal agent has not yet been identified or confirmed. On [1 Jan 2020], WHO requested further information from national authorities to assess the risk.\n\nNational authorities report that all patients are isolated and receiving treatment in Wuhan medical institutions. The clinical signs and symptoms are mainly fever, with a few patients having difficulty in breathing, and chest radiographs showing invasive lesions of both lungs.\n\nAccording to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or vendors in the Huanan Seafood market. Based on the preliminary information from the Chinese investigation team, no evidence of significant human-to-human transmission and no health care worker infections have been reported.\n\nPublic Health Response\nNational authorities have reported the following response measures:\n- 121 close contacts have been identified and are under medical observation;\n- The follow-up of close contacts is ongoing;\n- Pathogen identification and the tracing of the cause are underway;\n- Wuhan Municipal Health Commission carried out active case finding, and retrospective investigations have been completed;\n- Environmental sanitation and further hygiene investigations are underway.\n\nWHO is closely monitoring the situation and is in close contact with national authorities in China.\n\nWHO risk assessment\nThere is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology. The reported link to a wholesale fish and live animal market could indicate an exposure link to animals. The symptoms reported among the patients are common to several respiratory diseases, and pneumonia is common in the winter season; however, the occurrence of 44 cases of pneumonia requiring hospitalization clustered in space and time should be handled prudently.\n\nWuhan city, with a population of 19 million, is the capital city of Hubei province, with a population of 58 million people. WHO has requested further information on the laboratory tests performed and the differential diagnoses considered.\n\nWHO advice\nBased on information provided by national authorities, WHO's recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza and severe acute respiratory infections still apply.\n\nWHO does not recommend any specific measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share travel history with their healthcare provider.\n\nWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the current information available on this event.\n\nFor more information:\n\nInfection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care, WHO guidelines: (https://www.who.int/csr/bioriskreduction/infection_control/publication/en/)\nWuhan Municipal Health Commission briefing on the pneumonia epidemic situation, 31 Dec 2019 (in Mandarin): http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2019123108989\nWuhan Municipal Health Commission briefing on the pneumonia epidemic situation 3 Jan 2020 (in Mandarin): http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010309017.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee's Report on Unexplained Viral Pneumonia\nDate: 5 Jan 2020\nSource: Wuhan Public Health Commission Press Release [machine trans. edited]\nhttp://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010509020\n\n\nWuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee's Report on Unexplained Viral Pneumonia\nIssuing authority: Wuhan City health committee | Published: 2020-01-05 20:33:24\n\nSince [31 Dec 2019], our committee has carried out search and retrospective investigation of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in the city. As of 8:00 on [5 Jan 2020], a total of 59 patients with unexplained diagnosis of viral pneumonia were reported in our city, including 7 critically ill patients, and the remaining patients' overall vital signs were stable. At present, all patients are being isolated in medical institutions in Wuhan Treatment with no deaths. Among the 59 patients, the earliest onset of the case was [12 Dec 2019], and the latest onset was [29 Dec 2019]; 163 close contacts have been followed up for medical observation, and the follow-up of close contacts is still in progress.\n\nAn epidemiological survey showed that some patients were operating households in Wuhan South China Seafood City (South China Seafood Wholesale Market). As of now, preliminary investigations have shown no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission and no medical staff infections. Respiratory pathogens such as influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, infectious atypical pneumonia (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been excluded. Pathogen identification and cause tracing are still underway.\n\nAt present, with the support of the state and Hubei Province, Wuhan has adopted the following main prevention and control measures:\n- 1st, to treat patients with all its strength.\n- The 2nd is to carry out isolation treatment for all cases.\n- The 3rd is to continue to conduct relevant case searches and retrospective investigations in medical institutions throughout the city.\n- The 4th is to carry out close contact tracking seriously, implement medical observation on the close contacts that have been tracked according to regulations, and have not found any abnormal symptoms such as fever.\n- 5th, we will take measures to suspend the market for South China Seafood City and carry out environmental sanitation and further hygiene investigations.\n- 6th, actively carry out epidemiological investigations.\n- 7th, cooperate with the state and province to carry out pathogen identification (including nucleic acid detection and virus isolation and cultivation) and trace the cause, and prevention and control work is proceeding in an orderly manner.\n\nExperts suggest that the city is currently in the season of high incidence of infectious diseases in winter and spring. Citizens should pay attention to maintaining indoor air circulation to avoid closed and airless public places and crowded places. Wear masks when necessary. If you have fever, respiratory infection symptoms, especially persistent fever, go to a medical institution in time.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n******\n[3] Singapore suspected case, RSV [Respiratory Syncytial Virus) identified - media report\nDate: 4 Jan 2020\nSource: Straits Times [edited]\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/wuhan-pneumonia-first-suspect-case-identified-here\n\n\nThe Ministry of Health said on Saturday [4 Jan 2020] that it had been notified of the 1st suspected case of the mystery Wuhan virus here, involving a 3-year-old girl from China who had pneumonia and a travel history to the Chinese city of Wuhan. She had been warded for further assessment and treatment, and isolated as a precautionary measure, said the ministry.\n\nCountries have grown concerned over a viral outbreak in Wuhan marked by unusual cases of pneumonia. These appear to be linked to a wholesale seafood market there, where not just seafood is sold, but also live animals, including, reportedly, birds and snakes, and the organs of rabbits and other wildlife.\n\nAt least 44 people had been affected there; and 11 were seriously ill, raising the spectre of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which hit Singapore hard in 2003.\n\nSingapore has started temperature screening for passengers arriving from the city at Changi Airport, and doctors are on the lookout for possible cases. Experts, however, say that there have been no reports of human-to-human transmission, which means much less risk to the public.\n\nThe girl in Singapore was in stable condition, MOH said, without giving details on how the case had been uncovered.\n\nIt noted that she had not visited the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan associated with the cluster of pneumonia cases.\n\nPreliminary tests also showed that she was positive for respiratory syncytial virus, MOH added, which is a common cause of childhood pneumonia.\n\nInvestigations are ongoing to confirm this as the cause.\n\nCoordinating Minister for Infrastructure and the Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said on Saturday [4 Jan 2020] that Singapore is monitoring the pneumonia situation in Wuhan closely.\n\n'There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission so will likely be just a normal fever outbreak,' he wrote in a Facebook post. 'But after SARS in 2003, we cannot be complacent.'\n\nThere are 2 airlines connecting directly to Wuhan, he said: Scoot and Urumqi Airlines, and the 1st temperature screening at T1 for a Scoot flight, an uneventful one, was done on Saturday morning [4 Jan 2020].\n\n-\nCommunicated by:\nJohn Cathey <jt.cathey@gmail.com>\n\n******\n[4] Hong Kong 8 more suspected cases, none with 'unidentified strain' - media report\nDate: 5 Jan 2020\nSource: South China Morning Post [edited]\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3044723/six-more-hong-kong-patients-hospitalised-over\n\n\nAuthorities in Wuhan announced on Sunday [5 Jan 2020] that 59 people had been admitted to hospital with an unidentified form of pneumonia, up from 44 on Friday [3 Jan 2020], while 9 more patients were found with fever or respiratory symptoms after returning to Hong Kong from the city in central China.\n\nIn Singapore, the Ministry of Health earlier said it had been informed of a suspected case, involving a 3-year-old girl from China who had pneumonia and a history of travel to Wuhan.\n\nHealth authorities in the mainland city said on Sunday [5 Jan 2020] night that the virus was not severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) but that a final identification of the strain was still in progress.\n\nAlthough the total number of infections had increased, there were fewer people in serious condition, falling to 7 from 11, according to a statement on the website of the Wuhan Municipal Commission. At least 163 people who had been in close contact with those infected were placed under medical observation. A seafood market in the Hubei province city was the site of the outbreak.\n\nThe authorities had previously ruled out common flu, avian flu, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases. Further laboratory tests and investigations were underway.\n\nThe commission added that a preliminary investigation found no evidence of human-to-human transmission, and none of the medical staff had been infected. Some of the patients are vendors at the same seafood market, which has already been shut down and sanitised, it said.\n\nHong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said public hospitals had admitted 8 more patients, including a boy, 9, and a 2-year-old girl, in the 24 hours to noon on Sunday [5 Jan 2020] with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms who had also been to Wuhan in the past 14 days. At least 7 of them confirmed that they had not been to any wet market there.\n\nThe patients were all in stable condition. Apart from the 2 children, the other new cases reported involved 4 men and 2 women, aged between 22 and 55. The 9-year-old boy, who was seen by a private doctor, was the latest suspected case revealed.\n\nAll patients were quarantined and being treated in Queen Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, Ruttonjee, Tseung Kwan O and United Christian hospitals. Four were confirmed to have flu or other related illnesses, while the others were waiting for test results.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese University's student union said a 20-year-old female student residing in a United College dormitory was hospitalised for suspected pneumonia symptoms. It was understood she had travelled to Wuhan \u00adrecently. A university spokeswoman said the student returned to Hong Kong on [29 Dec 2019] and developed symptoms on Saturday [4 Jan 2020]. She and her roommate were sent to hospital for further checks.\n\nThat takes the total number of suspected cases reported in the city to 17. But, of 8 other cases reported by Saturday [4 Jan 2020] evening, none of the patients were found to have the unidentified strain. The Hospital Authority said at least 5 people among all those identified as suspected cases had been discharged from hospital.\n\n'The [Hong Kong] government has been continuously in close contact with the relevant mainland authorities for the latest updates ... people are also reminded not to visit the wet market or eat wild animals when travelling,' Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee said.\n\nChan also said local authorities had adopted an active response to the incident. The health minister visited the infectious disease centre at Princess Margaret Hospital on Saturday [4 Jan 2020] and discussed response policies with medical staff.\n\nA new response mechanism for infectious diseases was launched by the Hong Kong government on Saturday [4 Jan 2020], and it was set to a 'serious' level, the 2nd on a 3-tier scale beginning with an alert and ending with an emergency declared at its peak. Doctors are required to report patient cases with fever and acute respiratory symptoms or pneumonia symptoms who had visited Wuhan within 14 days before the onset of the illness, whether or not they had visited any wet markets or seafood markets there.\n\nWuhan authorities announced on Friday [3 Jan 2020] that 44 people had been admitted to hospital with the unidentified virus, up from 27 on Tuesday [31 Jan 2020]. Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a Chinese University respiratory medicine expert, believed the new cases might not have a direct connection with the wet market in Wuhan, but it was necessary to isolate the patients as a precaution. Hui also said the government should consider further strengthening screening measures on travellers from Wuhan, especially if there were possible risks of a community outbreak there. 'For instance, [the government] can install extra screening facilities on the platforms at the West Kowloon high-speed rail terminus. If there are any passengers who have been to Wuhan, they should be screened,' he said.\n\nOn Saturday [4 Jan 2020], a voluntary lane at the West Kowloon terminus dedicated for travellers from Wuhan was unused, even as passengers got off a train that had stopped in the city. Chan said while not all passengers on trains that stopped in Wuhan had necessarily visited the city, the government would continue to liaise with personnel at each boundary control point to step up quarantine measures.\nIn a statement issued late on Sunday [5 Jan 2020], the Centre for Health Protection said it had received notification from the mainland's National Health Commission on the latest information about the Wuhan cases.\n\n'While the causative pathogen and cause of infection are still under investigation, respiratory pathogens including influenza viruses, avian influenza viruses, adenovirus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome have been ruled out,' it said.\n\n'According to the risk assessment of the World Health Organisation, the reported link of this cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology to a wholesale fish and live animal market could indicate an exposure link to animals.' Macau has reported 4 cases of patients who had recently been to Wuhan and developed suspected pneumonia symptoms, but all have been confirmed to be flu or other common viruses.\n\nMeanwhile, as flu season approaches its peak between January and March 2020, Chan said about 1.15 million doses of flu vaccination had been administered since last October [2019], according to figures by the Department of Health, nearly an 18 per cent increase year on year and a rise especially among children. The health minister said flu activity was still below baseline level, but also noted that flu vaccination rates among people aged 50 to 64 was not as satisfactory despite the government previously rolling out a subsidy scheme targeting the group.\n\n[Byline: Chan Ho-him and Jun Mai]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[First, our thanks go to subscribers for submitting multiple sources of information providing the current updates.

The recent glycan microarray analysis suggested\nthat the haemagglutinin (HA) D222G substitution could cause a shift\nfrom alpha2,6 receptors to the mixed alpha2,3/alpha2,6 receptors\nspecificity which might increase binding to alpha2,3 receptors [2]\nand contribute to severity of disease. This substitution in the HA\ngene has been reported in samples of viruses obtained from cases with\nmild to severe illness from around 20 countries, areas and\nterritories [3]. A recent study from Norway has evaluated the\nclinical relevance of this substitution with severe and mild cases [4].\n\nIn an attempt to understand the relevance of HA D222G substitution\namong pandemic influenza A (H1N1) causing infections in Hong Kong, HA\ngene sequences from respiratory specimens and virus isolates of\nsevere and non-severe cases were examined. Cases were individuals who\nhad laboratory confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza virus by either\nviral culture or reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) of respiratory\nspecimens [5]. The severe cases were individuals classified by the\nattending physician as being in a serious or critical condition.\n\nFrom 1 May 2009 to 31 Jan 2010, 458 respiratory samples were\nexamined. Of 219 severe cases, nine (4.1 percent) showed D222G\nsubstitution while none of the 239 non-severe cases showed D222G\nsubstitution. Four of the nine cases died. The association of D222G\nwith severe disease was statistically significant (p=0.002, Fisher's\nexact test, doubled one-sided). Other substitutions, of D222N (severe\ncases, n=3; non-severe cases, n=1) and D222E (only in non-severe\ncases, n=4) were also found. The 1st severe case appeared on 6 July\n2009 and D222G substitution was detected in July, September, November\nand December of the same year (These data are tabulated in the\noriginal publication, to which interest readers are referred).\n\nNo distinct phylogenetic clusterings of the severe cases with D222G\nsubstitution have been observed (data not shown). To put this in\nperspective, from July 2009 to January 2010, the accumulated severe\ncases were 244 while the number of isolates in our laboratory was 25\n625. Priority of analysis has been given to severe cases over\nnon-severe cases, with 90 percent and 1 percent of cases analysed respectively.\n\nInfluenza is an RNA virus which evolves rapidly, frequently changing\nsurface structures. A recent study at the United States (US) Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 14 cases with D222G\nsubstitution found only in virus isolates but not in the original\nclinical specimens [3]. We observed similar finding with one\nnon-severe case showing D222G substitution in a virus isolate but not\nin the original clinical specimen, however, for the other 9 severe\ncases, we detected D222G substitution in both the virus isolate and\noriginal specimen. Similar to the Norwegian study, we also found\nmixed 222G and 222D in some severe cases [4]. Although experiments\nwith ferrets did not support a causal link of D222G substitution with\nvirulence [3], further study is warranted to elucidate the intriguing\nrelationship between D222G substitution and severe disease.\n\nReferences\n----------\n(1) Shinya K, Ebina M, Yamada S, Ono M, Kasai N, Kawaoka Y.

In fact, in both our data set and the\nHong Kong data, mutant viruses were not found among several hundred\nmild cases. Furthermore, as can be seen from our published data, the\nfrequency may be higher also in fatal outcomes (8 of 27 cases) versus\nsevere non-fatal outcomes (3 of 34 cases). Comparing these\nfrequencies results in p=0.078 with Fisher's exact test (2-sided) and\np=0.046 with the Mid-P Exact test (2-sided). It would be interesting\nto know if the new data from Hong Kong SAR can corroborate this\nobservation. Mak et al. report 4 fatal D222G cases and 5 non-fatal\nsevere D222G cases, but one would also need to know the total number\nof fatal cases versus non-fatal severe cases analysed to make the\ncomparison. Hopefully, this information can be obtained.\n\nD222G substitution in virus isolates only and not in the original\nclinical specimens was found in one case in Hong Kong and 14 cases\nreported by the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention [1]. We have also seen this virus culture artifact in one\ncase with mild disease. This case was counted as wild type in our\ndata set. This further underscores the importance to perform the\nsequence analysis of the primary specimen.\n\nThe frequency of D222G mutant viruses in the severe cases is somewhat\nlower in the Hong Kong data, compared to ours (4.1 percent in Hong\nKong data versus 18 percent in our data set). Whilst this difference\nmay represent a real variation in frequency, it may also arise from a\ndifferent composition of cases; e.g., if the proportion of fatal\ncases were higher in the Norwegian sample of severe plus fatal cases.\nMak and colleagues also observed, as we did, that the 222G mutant\nsometimes occurs in a mixture with non-mutated 222D genomes.\n\nSensitivity of detection of mutant viral genomes when occurring as\nthe minority variant in such mixtures may thus also influence the\nobserved frequency. We have been using a pyrosequencing assay to\nidentify the 222 genotype. Under ideal conditions this methodology\ncan reliably detect and quantitate a mutant when present in the total\nvirus population at levels as low as 10 percent [2]. However, in our\ndata set the initial finding of D222G mutants by pyrosequencing could\nuniformly be verified by conventional sequencing. Therefore, since\nthe Hong Kong data come from a study focusing on this particular\nposition we assume that the methodology difference is not likely to\nhave caused the different frequencies in the 2 data sets. In the\noverall global data, however, it is possible that some cases with\nmutant/wild type mixtures have been overlooked and only the majority\nsequence recorded.\n\nReferences\n----------\n[1] World Health Organization.

In an attempt to understand the relevance of HA D222G substitution\namong pandemic influenza A (H1N1) causing infections in Hong Kong, HA\ngene sequences from respiratory specimens and virus isolates of\nsevere and non-severe cases were examined. Whilst this difference\nmay represent a real variation in frequency, it may also arise from a\ndifferent composition of cases; e.g., if the proportion of fatal\ncases were higher in the Norwegian sample of severe plus fatal cases. \n\nD222G substitution in virus isolates only and not in the original\nclinical specimens was found in one case in Hong Kong and 14 cases\nreported by the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention A recent study at the United States (US) Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 14 cases with D222G\nsubstitution found only in virus isolates but not in the original\nclinical specimens [3]. This substitution in the HA\ngene has been reported in samples of viruses obtained from cases with\nmild to severe illness from around 20 countries, areas and\nterritories [3]. Although experiments\nwith ferrets did not support a causal link of D222G substitution with\nvirulence [3], further study is warranted to elucidate the intriguing\nrelationship between D222G substitution and severe disease. The 1st severe case appeared on 6 July\n2009 and D222G substitution was detected in July, September, November\nand December of the same year (These data are tabulated in the\noriginal publication, to which interest readers are referred). Cases were individuals who\nhad laboratory confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza virus by either\nviral culture or reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) of respiratory\nspecimens To put this in\nperspective, from July 2009 to January 2010, the accumulated severe\ncases were 244 while the number of isolates in our laboratory was 25\n625.

Rather, the duo -- an epidemiologist and an animal health expert whose names have not been released -- will discuss with Chinese officials the scope of a larger international mission later, according to a WHO statement.\n\nBut this initial trip offers real hope that the mystery of the virus' origins, which has become a political powder keg and the subject of countless conspiracy theories, will finally be investigated more thoroughly and transparently. (A similar WHO-led mission to examine how China was handling its fight against the virus, launched after weeks of diplomatic wrangling, returned in February [2020] with a surprising wealth of information) [comment 1].\n\n'Science must stay open to all possibilities' about the pandemic's origins, Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said at a press conference on 7 Jul [2020]. 'We need to lay out a series of investigations that will get the answers that I'm sure the Chinese government, governments around the world, and ourselves really need in order to manage the risk going forward into the future.'\n\nQuestions range from hunting for animals that might harbor the virus to examining the possibility that it came from a laboratory. There are plenty of details to investigate, and it could be a long road. Origin riddles for other new infectious diseases often took years to solve, and the route to answers has involved wrong turns, surprising twists, technological advances, lawsuits, allegations of cover-ups, and high-level politics. Determining how a pathogen suddenly emerges in people requires a lot of sleuthing, but past successes offer clues of where to look for new insights, as do the few data points that now exist for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nThe initial, tidy origin story told by health officials in Wuhan during the 1st few weeks of January [2020] was that a cluster of people connected to a seafood market developed an unusual pneumonia, and that the outbreak stopped after the market was closed and disinfected. But confusion about the origin of the novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan patients arose when researchers published the 1st epidemiologic studies of the city's outbreak: 4 of the 1st 5 cases confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infections had no link to the market.\n\nSoon, other theories emerged. Some believe it's no coincidence that the city is host to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), home to leading bat coronavirus researcher Shi Zheng-Li. Her group, one of the 1st to isolate and sequence SARS-CoV-2, has trapped bats in the wild for 15 years, hunting for coronaviruses to help identify pandemic threats. In their 1st report about the new virus, the scientists described a bat coronavirus in their collection that was 96.2% similar to SARS-CoV-2 [comment 2].\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump early on endorsed speculation that the virus entered humans because of an accident at WIV. A more contentious theory is that the lab created the virus. (Researchers at the lab insist neither scenario has any merit, and evolutionary biologists elsewhere have argued the virus shows no evidence of having been engineered.)\n\nThe most popular hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 spread into humans from an intermediate host, an animal species susceptible to the virus that acted as a bridge between bats and humans. In the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), civets turned out to play that role for the responsible coronavirus. For Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), also a coronavirus disease, it quickly became clear camels were the culprit because highly similar viruses were found in the animals and people caring for them.\n\nChinese officials have reported conducting tests for SARS-CoV-2 at the Wuhan seafood market, but what they found remains sketchy. China's state-run news agency, Xinhua, said 'environmental samples' tested positive for the virus in a zone of the market that sold wildlife, but the report had no details about the results or even a list of the species for sale. Other studies have discovered similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and a coronavirus found in pangolins, an endangered species that eats ants, but the pangolin virus is more divergent genetically from SARS-CoV-2 than the closest bat virus, and there's no evidence pangolins or their scales -- used in traditional Chinese medicine -- were sold at the market.\n\nSo, assuming WHO's team and the Chinese government work out a deal for an international mission to study the pandemic's origins, where would it start? Here are some key questions that need answers.\n\n- What, exactly, did the studies of the Wuhan seafood market sample, and what did the researchers find? With SARS, which emerged in a person in China's Guangdong province in November 2002 -- but was not reported to WHO for 3 months -- extensive sampling of animals at marketplaces in the province found its virus in palm civets by October 2003.\n\n- Does more epidemiological data exist about the earliest cases than have been made public so far (such as in https://tinyurl.com/vssjprg and https://tinyurl.com/w5qfs4w)? Where had they traveled? Were they in contact with any animals? What interactions did they have with each other? Have antibody tests been done on any of their contacts? Do stored blood or tissue samples for any of their contacts exist that could show earlier infections?\n\nFor SARS, by June 2004, 14 months after the discovery of that virus, researchers had reported detailed epidemiological analyses of humans and animals: 39% of the earliest cases were food handlers, traders of live animals were 13 times more likely to have antibodies to the virus, and in that group, 72% handled civets. New interviews with the earliest COVID-19 cases could reveal surprising links between them. COVID-19 clusters, for example, have occurred among people who were dining and drinking together, gathering at religious services, and even playing mahjong.\n\n- How aggressively have Chinese researchers looked for SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected before the 1st known cases in Wuhan? Have they looked outside of Wuhan? How far back in time have they probed?\n\nHospitals and diagnostic labs sometimes store blood, nasal swabs, and tissue samples from patients, especially if they die from unexplained illnesses. Just such samples led to the realization that MERS, 1st recognized in Saudi Arabia in June 2012, had killed 2 people in Jordan in April of that year [2012]. Analyses of stored samples from those 2 people and blood sampling of others who became ill but survived that outbreak confirmed that they all had MERS. Scientists realized camels were the source of Middle East respiratory syndrome when highly similar viruses were found in the animals and people caring for them.\n\n- Can widespread screens be done of bats and other wild animal species thought to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and common in China, including primates, deer, and rodents? Animal feces or urine often contain genetic evidence of viruses. Shi's group at WIV has routinely found coronaviruses in fecal samples and nasal swabs of bats. The sampling of feces from chimpanzees in sub-Saharan Africa has greatly contributed to understandings of the origins of the HIV-1 epidemic, and the Nipah virus, which surfaced in Malaysian pig farmers in 1998, was found in flying bats 2 years later by sampling their urine and fruit that they had partially eaten.\n\n- Can widespread screening of susceptible domesticated animals provide clues to COVID-19's origin? AIDS researchers discovered that pet monkeys harbored a simian immunodeficiency virus that is closely linked to HIV-2, a less common variant that also infects people. Shi's group did a study of domesticated and feral cats in Wuhan and found SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 15% of the 141 samples tested. No antibodies were found in samples taken before the Wuhan outbreak surfaced, but do veterinarians possibly have additional stored samples? Can more feral cats be tested? Cats, notably, have a thing for seafood, and the Wuhan market at least played a role in amplifying early spread.\n\n- Do stored samples from farmed animals exist? The genetic signature of the influenza virus that caused a pandemic in 2009 showed it clearly had a pig origin, but it wasn't until 2016 that researchers reported the likely location of farms in Mexico that raised the infected pigs. Their study found 58 influenza viruses in respiratory samples stored by a central lab that diagnosed sick pigs. In all, the samples came from 22 farms in 6 Mexican states taken between 2010 and 2014. Phylogenetic analyses allowed the researchers to work backward from the genetic sequences of the viruses they found and pinpoint 2 states that likely were the origin of the pandemic. The data further suggest the virus initially came to Mexico from pigs imported from Europe.\n\n- Can widespread screening take place of people in China who might come in contact with bats or other wildlife that harbor SARS-CoV-2? Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance and Shi -- who had their funding from the National Institutes of Health cut in April [2020] after pressure from the White House -- published a study last year [2019] of blood taken from nearly 1500 people in Chinese provinces where bats carry SARS-related coronaviruses. They also interviewed people about their histories of illnesses and contact with animals. Only 9 people had evidence of being infected with a bat coronavirus, but as they noted, antibodies quickly wane. The team showed that spillovers from bats to humans occur routinely.\n\n- Do government health reports contain any information about possible COVID-19 cases that predate 1 Dec 2019, the 1st confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in the scientific literature? The South China Morning Post reported having seen 'government data' that a 55-year-old person from Hubei province had COVID-19 on 17 Nov [2019]. The article says 8 other cases of the disease occurred that month [November 2019]. Wuhan is Hubei's capital, but the government records did not specify where these people lived, the newspaper noted. It's possible the virus was first isolated from patients in Wuhan but emerged outside the city. The influenza virus that caused the pandemic in 2009 first was isolated in San Diego, California, not in Mexico, where it originated.\n\n- Are there stored samples from sewage plants in China that can be probed? Studies of stored sewage samples in Italy described in a press release from that country's National Institute of Health suggest SARS-CoV-2 was circulating there in December 2019, even before doctors noticed the 1st case in Wuhan. A study from Barcelona, Spain, posted on medRxiv and not peer reviewed, claims to have found SARS-CoV-2 in sewage samples from March 2019. These reports have not been independently confirmed and have been subject to much criticism, but that does not undermine the potential value of studying archival sewage samples for SARS-CoV-2.\n\n- What experiments with bat coronaviruses took place at WIV? This is the mother of all questions for those who suspect SARS-CoV-2 came out of the facility. Accidental lab releases do happen, and one even triggered a pandemic: An influenza strain that surfaced in 1977 was linked to strains in Russian labs collected 2 decades earlier.\n\n- Is it possible that somebody at WIV became infected with the virus and then passed it on to others outside the lab? It's unknown which bat viruses WIV has in its collection of samples and whether any of them infect humans. And a controversy surrounds the closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, which is called RaTG13. As Shi and co-workers reported, they only fully sequenced this virus after SARS-CoV-2 surfaced, and they looked through their database for potential relatives. (The group often sequences only one small region of bat coronaviruses genomes that mutates infrequently, so changes indicate distinct viruses.) A great deal of speculation has circled around the naming of the partial sequence: Shi's group earlier had reported a virus named BtCoV/4991 that exactly matches RaTG13 in that small region, but are they one and the same? Or could it be, as some assert, that BtCoV/4991 is SARS-CoV-2 itself? What other bat coronaviruses has the lab yet to fully sequence? Could any of them offer clues?\n\nAnother outstanding question is whether Shi's team or other researchers in Wuhan manipulated bat viruses in 'gain-of-function' experiments that can make a virus more transmissible between humans. In 2015, Shi co-authored a paper that made a chimeric SARS virus by combining one from bats with a strain that had been adapted to mice. But that work was done at the University of North Carolina, not in Wuhan, and in collaboration with Ralph Baric. Did Shi's group later carry out other gain-of-function studies in Wuhan, and if so, what did they find?\n\nFinally, diplomatic cables from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing in 2018 warned that a new, ultra-high-security lab at WIV had 'a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators.' Did Shi's team ever work with coronaviruses in that lab, and, if so, why?\n\nIf history repeats itself, it might take years -- or even decades -- to crack this case. Scientists haven't unequivocally identified Ebola's source 45 years after its discovery. But the key, time and again, to clarifying the origins of emerging infectious diseases is unearthing new data. WHO's push to organize the probe promises to, at the very least, accelerate what has been a plodding pursuit for answers.\n\n[Byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[1. The report of the 1st WHO-China Joint Experts Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), 16-24 Feb 2020, was published on 28 Feb 2020. It included (p 8) the following segment, titled 'Zoonotic origins': 'COVID-19 is a zoonotic virus. From phylogenetics analyses undertaken with available full genome sequences, bats appear to be the reservoir of COVID-19 virus, but the intermediate host(s) has not yet been identified. However, 3 important areas of work are already underway in China to inform our understanding of the zoonotic origin of this outbreak. These include early investigations of cases with symptom onset in Wuhan throughout December 2019, environmental sampling from the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market and other area markets, and the collection of detailed records on the source and type of wildlife species sold at the Huanan market and the destination of those animals after the market was closed.'

Dr York Chow, secretary for Food and Health of Hong Kong Special\nAdministrative Region (HKSAR) government made the announcement after the\nDepartment of Health and the Bureau of Education met last night to review\nthe data of the flu and the response of parents.\n\n'We made the decision given the rising trend of flu infections within the\ncommunity as the flu peak is expected to continue for weeks,' Chow told\nreporters. 'We hope such precautionary measures will help reduce the cross\ninfection of the flu virus in schools and the community.' On yesterday\nmorning, Chow said that an expert group will do its best to investigate the\nrecent deaths of 3 children with flu-like symptoms, adding that at this\nstage, no common factors have been identified. He said the most important\nthing at the moment is to grasp a clear picture of the outbreaks and\nwhether they are spreading.\n\nYesterday, the Center for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of\nHealth (DH) received reports of influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreaks\naffecting 23 schools involving a total of 184 people. A CHP spokesman said\nILI may be caused by influenza or other respiratory viruses. CHP's\nofficials have visited all these institutions and provided health advice to\nthe staff accordingly. CHP will provide the public with information on\nseasonal influenza starting today. A hotline will operate from 9am to 6pm.\nfrom Monday to Friday.\n\nCHP received a report from Hospital Authority yesterday concerning a 3 year\nold boy who was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital Tuesday because of\npersistent fever, cough and shortness of breath. The boy was transferred to\nIntensive Care Unit and is now in stable condition, said the spokesman,\nadding that initial investigation showed his respiratory sample yielded\npositive results for influenza A (H1N1). Further tests are under progress.\n\nRegarding the death of a 7 year old boy with respiratory and neurological\nsymptoms in Tuen Mun Hospital, the spokesman said further laboratory tests\nshowed that the boy's respiratory sample yielded positive results for\ninfluenza A (H1N1) [see the following report for modification of this\ndiagnosis. - Mod.CP].\n\nOn the death of a 21 month old boy who passed away on 24 Feb 2008, the\nspokesman said that examination of the boy's respiratory sample yielded\nnegative results for Influenza A and B. 'There is no evidence at the\npresent stage suggesting the boy has contracted influenza. Further\ninvestigation is ongoing,' he said.\n\nThe Hospital Authority (HA) on Wednesday [12 Mar 2008] announced that a\nspecial fund of 20 million HK dollars (2.6 million USD) had been set aside\nto implement a series of measures run up to the end of April 2008 to cope\nwith recent surge in demand for public hospital services due to seasonal\ninfluenza.\n\nPublic hospitals have been experiencing a prolonged increase in emergency\ndemand lately, in particular the emergency medical admissions, HA chief\nexecutive Shane Solomon told the media during a visit to the North District\nHospital yesterday afternoon.\n\n'Compared with February last year, the daily number of emergency medical\nadmissions is 16 percent higher. At the same time, recent admission to\npediatric wards in public hospitals has also surged,' he said. The sudden\nand unprecedented surge in demand in medical and pediatric wards has\ncreated great pressure on the front line staff, who have worked extra\nhours, with many of them canceling leave, working longer hours and on their\ndays off, he said. 'Over the last 2 weeks, an additional 15 000 hours of\nextra nursing and supporting staff have worked, adding the equivalent of\n192 full-time staff to the ward,' he said.\n\nTo cope with the recent surge, various hospital clusters have opened extra\nbeds and implemented other initiatives to cope with patient needs. Solomon\nalso reassured the public that the HA will closely monitor the situation on\na daily basis to plan for further measures.\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 14 Mar 2008\nSource: Shanghai Daily online [edited]\n<http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/?id=352174&type=National>\n\n\nFlu viruses found in Hong Kong victim\n-------------------------------------\nExperts in Hong Kong found 2 flu viruses and a steroid inside the body of a\nboy who died of influenza in an outbreak that has forced the closure of all\nkindergartens and primary schools in the special administrative region\n(SAR).

The boy's death\nreport is not likely to come out soon, the report said. But scientists have\nalready ruled out the possibility of bird flu or severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome, an epidemic that killed hundreds of people in Hong Kong in 2003.\n\nYuen Kwok-yung, a leading Hong Kong scientist, and a panel of experts\nstudied the 2 deceased flu patients and found that the flu virus had not\nspread beyond their lungs, which suggested the virus was not too virulent.\nThe World Health Organization also said yesterday that there was no reason\nfor concern. WHO spokesman Peter Cordingley called the Hong Kong outbreak\n'just regular seasonal flu.'\n\nLate on Wednesday [12 Mar 2008] the Hong Kong government ordered all\nkindergartens, primary and special education schools to close for 2 weeks\neffective yesterday. This move was reminiscent of measures taken during\nHong Kong's outbreak ofSARS. The closure in effect starts the Easter\nholiday for schools about a week in advance. It will affect nearly 560 000\nstudents at 1745 schools.

Pepito S. Leysa, chief of the Agriculture\ndepartment's Regional Crop Protection Center (RCPC), said that\nvisible manifestations of panama disease, or fusarium wilt, were\ndiscovered in a 3-hectare lakatan banana plantation in Alabel,\nSarangani. Lakatan is a banana variety.\n\nThe banana varieties susceptible to panama disease are latundan,\nsenorita and lakatan. Cavendish banana has succumbed to the new\nstrain (race 4) of the disease. Saba or cardaba, on the other hand,\nis a resistant cultivar, the statement added.\n\nPanama disease was 1st reported in the Philippines in 1920 on\nlatundan variety in Los Banos and Calamba, Laguna, and in\nmunicipalities of Batangas. It was confirmed in commercial Cavendish\nfarms in 1974 and 1979. The pathogen ended up totally destroying 13\nhectares of latundan farms in Eden, Toril in Davao City.\n\nAside from panama disease, the affected banana farm was also infested\nby the banana bunchy top virus, moko and sigatoka diseases, Mr. Leysa\nsaid. It was the 1st time that crop protection experts confirmed the\npresence of the devastating panama disease in Central Mindanao\nregion. The region hosts at least 3 large banana producers.\n\n[Byline: Romer S.

We are combining 4 discrete\ntreatments into an integrated control programme:\n\n1. a beneficial endophyte applied to fresh tissue cultured plants;\n\n2. a _Trichoderma harzianum_ biocontrol agent applied as a drench every month;\n\n3. potassium silicate drenches applied every 2 months (5L x at 1000 ppm);\n\n4. 75 mm of lignitic mulch (macademia nut husks) covering the drip zone.\n\nSo far this integrated package is working well, far better than\ncontrol measures we have tried previously (including fungicides) to\ncontrol _Fusarium_ which is a major problem in South Africa. We are\nalso using the same approach on other tree crops (citrus, avocado,\ncoffee, macademia, papaya) and it is working well there also.\n\n[We are most grateful to Prof. Laing for this valuable contribution. - Mod.DHA]\n\n--\nProfessor Mark Laing\nSchool of Biochemistry, Genetics, Microbiology and Plant Pathology\nUniversity of KwaZulu-Natal\nPietermaritzburg\nSouth Africa\n<laing@ukzn.ac.za>\n<http://www.ukzn.ac.za>\n\n[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt)\nis caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp.\n_cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of\npseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread\nby infected planting material, mechanical means, soil, and water, and\ncan survive in the soil for decades.\n\nSeveral races of the pathogen exist. Races 1 and 2 attack several\ndifferent cultivars of eating and cooking bananas, but not Cavendish\nvarieties (for information on banana genotypes please see link\nbelow); race 3 attacks ornamental _Heliconia_ species only; temperate\nrace 4 and the recently emerged tropical race 4 (TR4) attack\ncultivars in the Cavendish subgroup as well as hosts of races 1 and 2.\n\nDisease management is difficult for PD and mostly relies on\nphytosanitation for pathogen exclusion.

Since then, WHO experts have been supporting the Chinese\nauthorities in their investigation into the cause of the\nlaboratory-acquired cases, and in assessing the effectiveness of measures\ntaken to control the outbreak.\nOn 1 Jul 2004, the Ministry of Health of China released its status report\non the investigation. The outbreak has now been successfully contained, but\ninitial findings from the investigation and the assessment of control\nmeasures have raised several important lessons for global public health.\nInvestigation into the source of the outbreak\n---------------------------------------------\nDuring the investigation, a substantial amount of information was gathered,\nalthough all the practices within the National Institute of Virology in\nBeijing have yet to be thoroughly assessed. Although not all detailed\ninformation has been made available to WHO, the following conclusions have\nbeen made about the source of the outbreak:\n- the National Institute of Virology in Beijing was the most likely source\nof the outbreak.\n- at least 4 individuals may have been infected with SARS at the Institute.\nThese include the 2 laboratory workers reported in April, and 2 additional\nlaboratory workers. These 2 additional laboratory workers appear to have\nsuffered from SARS-like illnesses in early February 2004. Recent laboratory\ntests performed at a national reference laboratory were positive for SARS\nantibodies.\n- the use of inactivated SARS coronavirus, which was not tested to\ndetermine the effectiveness of the inactivation, in a general laboratory at\nthe Institute appears the most likely cause of the outbreak.\nDuring the investigation, it became apparent that all the positive\nlaboratory workers worked in the same general laboratory at the Institute.\nAlthough no research involving live SARS viruses was known to have taken\nplace in this laboratory, SARS coronavirus that had been inactivated in a\nBiosafety Level 3 laboratory in the Institute was used on several occasions\nduring the early months of 2004 in experiments carried out in this area.\nThe timing of the use of inactivated SARS coronavirus in the general\nlaboratory coincides with the presence there of all the positive workers\nand with their likely incubation periods.\nWHO recommends that further work is needed to verify the effectiveness of\nthe method used to inactivate the live SARS virus. At the same time, other\npossible explanations of the cause of the outbreak cannot be fully excluded.\nBiosafety concerns raised by the outbreak\n-----------------------------------------\nThe incident at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing has raised\nconcerns about biosafety in general, and the way in which inactivated viral\nmaterial is handled in particular. 'In light of the investigation, WHO\nbelieves that Member States should carefully review biosafety standards and\nstrengthen them to avoid further incidents,' said Dr Shigeru Omi, regional\ndirector of WHO's Western Pacific Region.\nWHO will be working with Member States and expert groups to develop country\nand regional strategies to strengthen biosafety. Core components of such\nbiosafety programmes at country level are likely to include:\n- a containment policy to reduce the number of laboratories storing and\nworking on SARS coronavirus.\n- a legislative framework and independent advisory body to assist in the\ndevelopment, implementation and evaluation of a national biosafety\nprogramme and in the investigation of biohazard incidents and the\ndissemination of lessons learned to the global scientific community.\n- a laboratory accreditation system based on standardized biosafety criteria.\n- an occupational health service to monitor the well being of laboratory\nworkers.\n- comprehensive biosafety and training programmes in all diagnostic and\nresearch institutes supported by a management framework that facilitates\ncompliance with evidence-based guidelines and the adoption of a positive\nbiosafety culture.\nWHO also emphasizes that scientists working with highly pathogenic viruses\nsuch as SARS need to handle inactivated material with the utmost caution.\nIn particular, WHO recommends that:\n- researchers use appropriate and internationally accepted methods for\nvalidating the inactivation of live viruses.\n- inactivated material should be handled only in laboratories at biosafety\nlevel (BSL) 2 or above.\n- researchers handling inactivated material should wear appropriate\npersonal protective equipment.\n- new methods for inactivation should be adopted only after rigorous testing.\n- clear and comprehensive protocols should be available for all\ninactivation techniques.\nAssessment of effectiveness of outbreak control measures\n--------------------------------------------------------\nIn addition to supporting the investigation into the possible source of the\noutbreak, WHO has worked with Chinese authorities to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the outbreak control measures. Joint WHO-Ministry of\nHealth teams have visited all the hospitals where the recent cases were\ntreated before they were admitted to designated SARS facilities. In\naddition, WHO experts have reviewed data on contact tracing and other\ncontrol measures.\n'Overall,' said Dr Omi, 'WHO believes that the Chinese authorities acted\nswiftly and effectively to control the outbreak once the alarm had been\nraised. Extensive contact tracing was undertaken in a matter of hours, and\nthe effective isolation of cases and identification of contacts appears to\nhave ensured that the outbreak was contained with remarkable speed.'\nBut there was a delay in detecting the initial cases. As a consequence, 2\ngenerations of transmission occurred and the application of effective\nhospital and community control measures took place late in the outbreak.\nThe Ministry of Health of China has acknowledged this and is looking to\nstrengthen further the current detection and response system.\nThere are a number of lessons from this outbreak that are important\nglobally, for member states and for WHO itself:\n- health care workers, laboratory workers and people in close contact with\ncertain animals are at risk of contracting a range of infectious diseases\nwith outbreak potential. Disease detection systems need to be designed to\ntake these risk factors, as well as clinical information, into account --\nand to be robust enough to ensure that nobody slips through the net and\nevades detection.\n- health care workers need to be aware of the risks associated with certain\noccupations (including their own) and to be able to take a detailed\noccupational history from a patient.\n- health care workers also need to be aware of the importance of asking\nabout the health of close contacts of anyone with a potentially contagious\nrespiratory illness. Quickly identifying possible clusters of respiratory\nillness is important in the control of such diseases and the detection of\nnew or rare infectious diseases.\n- all health care workers should be empowered to initiate effective\nmeasures to protect themselves and others from potentially contagious\ndiseases, in a 'safety first' approach. This means that health care workers\nshould be aware of potential clinical and epidemiological risk factors;\nhave ready access to the equipment and knowledge needed to protect\nthemselves and others; and be allowed to initiate the most appropriate\ninfection-control measures immediately -- with validation and approval from\nsenior members of staff later.\nThis recent outbreak has demonstrated once again that SARS is a containable\ndisease. WHO commends the Chinese authorities for taking swift action to\ncontrol the latest outbreak. WHO will be working closely with the Chinese\nauthorities to assist in the strengthening of biosafety, and to build a\nlong-term strategy for strengthening laboratory research and diagnosis in\nChina.\nWHO looks forward to working with China in its efforts to tackle SARS and\nother public health issues in the future.

Researchers found a virus closely related to the SARS\ncoronavirus in bats from 3 regions of China. Writing in the journal\nScience, they say the virus may have needed to infect another animal such\nas the civet before it could transmit to humans. They suggest that live\nhorseshoe bats [should be] kept out of markets until the transmission path\nis fully understood.\nThe SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2002/3 caused\nabout 770 deaths, and economic damage estimated in billions of dollars;\ncentred on east Asia with origins in southern China, fatalities occurred as\nfar afield as Canada. The virus we found is 92 percent similar to the human\nSARS virus. Schools and businesses closed, international trade and travel\nwere restricted; and for a time, until basic public health measures\ncurtailed the outbreak, it seemed as though the next major global disease\nof humanity had emerged.\nBut it emerged from where? In May 2003, the suggestion emerged that the\nvirus responsible had entered the human population from civets, animals\neaten in wildlife restaurants and butchered in live animal markets in\nsouthern China. The World Health Organisation (WHO) endorsed this link\nearly in 2004, an announcement which led authorities in China to embark on\na culling programme which saw an estimated 10 000 civets killed, as well as\nother animals suspected of harbouring SARS virus, such as badgers and raccoons.\nBut for some time, the prevailing theory among scientists has been that\ncivets were not the original source, or reservoir, of infection. One clue\nis that they appear to have little immunity, and become seriously ill;\nwhereas species which harbour pathogens for a long period of history\nusually adapt to them. So where did the SARS virus come from? One theory\nnamed birds; but earlier this month, researchers at Hong Kong University\nfound cause to suspect bats. In a Hong Kong bat species they found a virus\nclosely related to that found in SARS patients.\nNow an international collaboration between scientists in China, Australia\nand the US has gone further, and identified a SARS-like [coronavirus] in 3\nspecies of bats from mainland China. 'The virus we found is 92 percent\nsimilar to the human SARS virus,' said Zhengli Shi from the Institute of\nZoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. 'Why it is there in\nthese bats, why it can infect just these species, we are not sure -- it is\na story we want to discuss,' she told BBC News.\nAll 3 species of bat in which Dr Shi's group found the SARS-like\ncoronavirus, are horseshoe bats of the genus _Rhinolophus_, as does the\nspecies identified in the Hong Kong study. Genomic analysis suggests that\nthe bat coronaviruses found by this group and by the Hong Kong team are\nvery alike, and that both are closely related to the human and civet forms.\nThe major differences lie in genes which relate to the binding of virus\nparticle and the host cell. 'This virus, we are sure, cannot infect\nhumans,' said Zhengli Shi. One of the big questions is, then, how the virus\njumped from bats to humans -- and whether in the body of an intermediary,\nsuch as the civet, it can adapt in such a way that it can then infect a\nhuman. 'At the moment we don't know,' said Peter Daszak, Director of the\nConsortium for Conservation Medicine in New York, who was also involved in\nthe study.\nSo civets could be an 'amplifier host' for SARS. If they are, one\nsuggestion, according to Peter Daszak, is to keep them away from horseshoe\nbats. 'In the east Asian region, we need to face up to high-risk\nbehaviours,' he said, 'and in this situation, bringing these species into\nlive markets, butchering and eating them and using them in medicines, is a\nhigh-risk behaviour.'\nWHO spokesperson Dick Thompson told BBC News: 'We see this as another piece\nof the SARS jigsaw. 'There's an unfinished agenda for SARS, and clearly we\nneed to understand the disease ecology better.' Confirming horseshoe bats\nas the source of SARS would carry implications for future public health\nresearch and policy. 'These bats have a wide distribution in Europe and\nAsia,' said Peter Daszak, 'and what we don't know, and need to know\nurgently, is the distribution of the SARS-like coronavirus in these bats.\nThe last thing we should do is to take it out on the bats, because the\nevidence suggests that they have carried this coronavirus for thousands,\nperhaps millions of years; only recently has it emerged in a big way, and\nit was human behaviours that made the difference.'\n[Byline: Richard Black]\n--\nDr. Stephen D.

The 2 workers who fell ill in February recovered and went back to\nwork, said Roy Wadia, a WHO spokesman in Beijing. He said they weren't\ndetected until they tested positive for SARS antibodies when hundreds of\nlab workers were screened following the April outbreak.\nDoctors couldn't confirm whether the two had SARS because too much time had\npassed since their illness, Wadia said. 'The fact that these cases weren't\nfound sooner suggests that the detection system isn't fully in place\nthroughout the Chinese health system,' said Wadia. He said one of the ill\nworkers oversaw the inactivation of the virus, which should have made her\n'a prime suspect' for SARS. 'It seems that the right questions weren't\nasked,' he said.

But WHO experts and the Chinese authorities are still\ntrying to determine the exact cause of the outbreak. The investigation has\ncentred primarily on the National Institute of Virology in Beijing, where\nexperiments using live and inactivated SARS coronavirus have been carried\nout. Two researchers at the institute developed SARS in late March and\nmid-April 2004. The outbreak was reported on April 22 and the institute was\nclosed a day later.\nPreliminary findings in the investigation have yet to identify a single\ninfectious source or single procedural error at the institute -\u00ad and it is\nconceivable that an exact answer may never be determined. Neither of the\nresearchers is known to have directly conducted experiments using live SARS\ncoronavirus. But investigators have serious concerns about biosafety\nprocedures at the institute \u00ad- including how and where procedures using\nSARS coronavirus were carried out, and how and where SARS coronavirus\nsamples were stored.\nWHO and Chinese authorities view with concern the occurrence of\nlaboratory-associated SARS cases. WHO urges all member states to view this\nlatest outbreak as an opportunity to review the biosafety practices of\ninstitutions and laboratories working with SARS coronavirus.\nDuring and after the SARS outbreak of 2003, a large number of specimens\nwere collected from possible human cases, animals and the environment.\nThese specimens, which may contain live SARS coronavirus, are still kept in\nvarious laboratories around the world. Some of them are stored in\nlaboratories at an inappropriate containment level. SARS coronavirus has\nalso been propagated in reference and research laboratories, and\ndistributed to other laboratories for research purposes. Research using\nlive and inactivated SARS coronavirus -\u00ad and other pathogens capable of\ncausing serious illness -- is being conducted in many laboratories.\nWHO has issued the following laboratory safety guidelines and recommendations:\nWHO biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS specimens (25 Apr 2003)\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/biosafety2003_04_25/en/>\nSummary of the discussion and recommendations of the SARS laboratory\nworkshop of 22 Oct 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/guidelines/en/SARSLabmeeting.pdf>\nWHO post-outbreak biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS coronavirus\nspecimens and cultures (18 Dec 2003)\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/biosafety2003_12_18/en/>\nIn these guidelines, WHO strongly recommends Biosafety Level 3 (BSL 3) as\nthe minimum containment level to work with live SARS coronavirus. WHO also\nurges member states to maintain a thorough inventory of laboratories\nworking with and/or storing live SARS coronavirus and to ensure that\nnecessary biosafety standards are in place.\nWHO commends the Chinese authorities for taking swift action to contain the\nlatest outbreak once it was recognized and reported, by way of extensive\ncontact tracing and the quarantine and medical observation of such\nindividuals.

Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the _Coronaviridae_ family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location. The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined. The independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying the entire (virus) species to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This research will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] COVID-19 the disease, SARS-CoV-2 the virus\nA.

The naming of the virus came from a committee of experts who published a paper on a biology preprint site that described their research and rationale for giving the new virus a derivative name.\n\n'It will be like HIV and AIDS -- different names for virus and disease,' said Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University at Texarkana and a co-author of the paper.\n\nThe naming of the virus came after close study of its genetic makeup by a dozen scientists, including Neuman, who form the Coronavirus Study Group, part of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.\n\nNeuman said the new virus is the same species as the virus that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2002-2003.\n\n'Same species, but different member of the species,' Neuman said.\n\n[Byline: Joel Achenbach]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n---\nB.

'COVI' comes from coronavirus. The 'D' stands for disease. The 19 represents 2019, the year the virus was first identified, in December [2019]. The name will apply for the 'entire spectrum' of cases, from mild to severe, according to a WHO spokesperson.\n\nThe disease had been given the temporary name '2019-nCoV' by WHO in January [2020], identifying the pathogen as a novel (previously unidentified, that is) coronavirus that first emerged in humans in 2019.\n\nAs weeks went by, people began calling it 'Wuhan virus.' But that's a problematic label. WHO guidelines for naming infectious diseases, issued in 2015, discourage names that refer to specific places, people and professions, aiming to avoid negative repercussions from stigmatizing a geographic area or a population group. In addition, no food or animal names should be used, the guidelines say -- 'swine flu' is listed as an example to be avoided after fear of that pathogen led the Egyptian government to order the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of pigs.\n\nThere are other considerations besides stigma. 'The attempt is to describe a disease using terms that people can understand as well as possible,' says Keiji Fukuda, a professor at the University of Hong Kong who helped draft the WHO guidelines. 'So not to be too jargon-y.' And speed is of the essence. Fukuda says in the absence of an easy-to-use, descriptive virus name, it's easy for other monikers to take hold. 'You really are racing pretty quickly to get a name out there. If someone coins a phrase which is catchy and which other people quickly begin repeating, it can be very hard or impossible to pull back,' Fukuda says.\n\nWhen SARS -- a member of the coronavirus family, like COVID-19 -- began spreading internationally in 2003, there was no formal process for naming it. Dr. David Heymann, who was leading the WHO's infectious diseases unit in Geneva at the time, had just left for a camping trip with his son's Boy Scout troop when he got a call about the disease's growing reach. He left his son with the other Scouts and headed back to the office. It was a quick meeting -- half an hour, maybe less. 'There were no rules at that time about how to name it, so we just went ahead and did it,' says Heymann, who is now an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. 'The 1st thing we decided was it would be good to have a name that had the same type of a ring as AIDS -- easy to say and short.'\n\nFukuda says despite the ad hoc nature of Heymann's meeting, the group came up with a solid name.\n\nIn other recent outbreaks, naming the virus didn't go so well. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, named in 2013, now appears in the 'examples to be avoided' column of the WHO's guidance. 'That's currently held up as an example of sort of what not to do,' says Neuman. 'It name-checks a particular region of the Earth, when really a virus is happy infecting anybody that it can get to. It just happens to originate in a particular area.'\n\nIn addition, an 11-member committee from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has proposed a name for the virus that causes the disease now known as COVID-19. The name they are proposing is SARS-CoV-2, which, according to the naming committee 'formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses.'\n\n[Byline: Brett Dahlberg and Elena Renken]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[We will be changing the name of this thread (the subject line) from Novel coronavirus to COVID-19 in keeping with the official naming released today. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[5] Selected media reports of transmission outside mainland China\nA.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the individual was an evacuee from Wuhan, China, who was under federal quarantine in San Diego, CA. But the patient had been allowed to leave UC San Diego hospital and return to the quarantine site after a 'mix-up' with the testing results, a CDC official told reporters Tuesday [11 Feb 2020].\n\n'It turns out there was probably a mix-up, and the original test wasn't negative,' said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC. 'There has been a new test collected in order to understand whether the person is still symptomatic, so there was just a little bit of a mix-up there.' Schuchat did not provide any information about how the mix-up happened.\n\nAccording to a brief statement released by UC San Diego Health late Monday [10 Feb 2020], 4 patients admitted to its isolation units last week were discharged back to their quarantine quarters at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar after the CDC said coronavirus tests came back negative. Further testing revealed that 1 of the 4 patients tested positive for coronavirus, the statement said. The patient was returned to the hospital for observation and isolation until cleared by CDC for release.\n\nSchuchat said the patient's contacts with others are believed to be limited but is being reassessed. The CDC is quarantining an undisclosed number of Americans who have been evacuated from China. Individuals should be removed from quarantine sites and isolated if they begin showing symptoms or test positive for the coronavirus, Schuchat said.\n\nAccording to the university, another patient from the quarantine site was also transported to UC San Diego Health. The patient is being evaluated and will remain admitted until the test results are confirmed by the CDC.\n\n[Byline: Nathaniel Weixel and Jessie Hellmann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is unclear from the above media report as to whether the individual is asymptomatic or symptomatic and what impact the individual's return to the quarantine location will have for others in quarantine and the duration of the quarantine. - Mod.MPP]\n\n---\nC.

All of the respiratory samples tested negative for novel coronavirus.\n\nAmong the 34 households, 2 are from the confirmed cases, about 100 residents from 30 households are being arranged to be transferred to quarantine centres while the remaining 2 households currently do not reside in their units due to individual reasons.\n\nThe CHP is continuing epidemiological investigations into the cases of novel coronavirus infection in Hong Mei House. Together with the Environment Bureau, and departments including Housing Department (HD), the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the Architectural Services Department, the CHP is investigating and examining if environmental factors were involved in the infection of the cases.\n\nAccording to the HD's information, the HD's Maintenance Surveyor and technical inspection team has conducted a detailed inspection at the unit A07 of Hong Mei House where the 62-year-old female patient resides. The vent pipe at the toilet which was altered without permission has been sealed up. The inspection team will inspect other 07 units in the building. If unauthorised alteration of vent pipes in the toilets are detected, immediate and proper follow-up actions will be taken.\n\nAs the investigations by relevant departments are ongoing, the CHP advised that, as a precautionary measure, the residents of Cheung Hong Estate at this stage should not open the window or turn on the ventilator when using the toilet.\n\nThe Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the HD will conduct thorough cleaning and disinfection for the building. The DH today organised a health talk for residents of Cheung Hong Estate to give health advice on the prevention of pneumonia and respiratory tract infection to residents.\n\nA spokesman for the CHP said, 'The public is strongly urged to maintain at all times strict personal and environmental hygiene, which is key to personal protection against infection and prevention of the spread of the disease in the community.'\n\nThe spokesman said, 'On the personal level, members of the public should wear a surgical mask when having respiratory symptoms, taking public transport or staying in crowded places. They should also perform hand hygiene frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes. The public should go out less and reduce social activities, and maintain appropriate social distance with other people as far as possible.\n\n'As for household environmental hygiene, members of the public are advised to maintain drainage pipes properly and regularly pour water into drain outlets (U-traps); after using the toilet, they should put the toilet lid down before flushing to avoid spreading germs.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is impressive to say the least. Lessons were definitely learned and not forgotten from the Amoy Gardens outbreak in 2003. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[6] WHO situation report 22 (as of 11 Feb 2020*)\nDate: Tue 11 Feb 2020\nSource: World Health Organization [edited]\nhttps://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200211-sitrep-22-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=fb6d49b1_2\n\n\n*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. CET.\n\nHighlights\n----------\n- No new countries reported cases of 2019-nCoV in the past 24 hours.\n\n- An advanced team is currently in Beijing to prepare an international mission and to determine the questions the international team will want to learn more about: from characteristics of the virus to public health response China put in place to try to contain the virus. The group of international experts, with a range of specializations, will work with Chinese counterparts on increasing understanding of the outbreak to guide global response efforts. Since being notified of the outbreak on [31 Dec 2020], the WHO Country Office in China, supported by the regional and international offices, has worked to support China, and indeed the world, to scale up the response. A small mission was sent to Wuhan mid-January, and the Director-General visited in January [2020].\n\n- Following WHO best practices for naming of new human infectious diseases, which were developed in consultation and collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), WHO has named the disease COVID-19, short for 'coronavirus disease 2019.'\n\nTechnical focus: Zoonotic component of 2019-nCoV and human-animal interface\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncreasing evidence demonstrates the link between the 2019-nCoV and other similar known coronaviruses (CoV) circulating in bats, and more specifically those of the _Rhinolophus_ bat sub-species. These sub-species are abundant and widely present in Southern China, and across Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Recent studies indicate that more than 500 CoVs have been identified in bats in China. To be noted that serological studies conducted in rural population living close to bats' natural habitat in caves revealed a 2.9% bat-CoV seroprevalence, demonstrating that humans' exposure to bat-CoVs might be common (1).\n\nHowever, the route of transmission to humans at the start of this event remains unclear. Bats are rare in markets in China but hunted and sold directly to restaurants for food (2). The current most likely hypothesis is that an intermediary host animal has played a role in the transmission.\n\nBoth Chinese and external expert groups are working in trying to identify the animal source of this new virus. Identifying the animal source of the 2019-nCoV would help to ensure that there will be no further future similar outbreaks with the same virus and will also help understanding the initial spread of the disease in the Wuhan area. It would also increase our understanding of the virus and help us understand how these viruses jump from animals to humans -- thus, providing critical knowledge on how to protect us from future similar events. In this regard, strengthening food control and market hygiene activities in live food market will be essential to protect people from similar and other zoonotic diseases.\n\nReferences\n1.

This brings the total number of cases in\nChina, reported since 22 Apr 2004, to 9. Of these, one has died.\nThe new case in Beijing is a 49 year old woman retired doctor. On 12 Apr\n2004, she was admitted to the same hospital ward where a 20 year old nurse\nwas being treated for pneumonia. The former doctor began developing\nSARS-like symptoms on 19 Apr 2004 and on 22 Apr 2004 was transferred to\nDitan Hospital and placed in isolation. Her condition is listed as\ncritical. The 20 year old nurse, previously reported to WHO as a confirmed\ncase, has been linked to an additional 5 cases. These include the one\nreported today and 4 reported on Sunday. To date, all cases have been\nlinked to chains of transmission involving close contact with an identified\ncase. The 2nd confirmed case, who remains hospitalized in Anhui Province,\nis a 26 year old postgraduate student who had been conducting research at\nthe National Institute of Virology in Beijing. She is thought to be the\nindex case in the present outbreak.\nDuring the 2003 outbreak, the transmission of SARS was greatly amplified in\nhospital settings. As a risk reduction strategy in Beijing, all 7 SARS\ncases are now being treated in Ditan Hospital. But patients were treated or\nassessed in open wards at 7 hospitals (5 in Beijing and 2 in Anhui) before\nsuspicions of SARS were raised and procedures of isolation and infection\ncontrol were introduced. In addition, the 2 patients in Anhui travelled\nlong distances within China by train. As these events created opportunities\nfor multiple exposures, Chinese authorities have undertaken extensive\ntracing and follow-up of contacts. In Beijing, nearly 700 persons have been\nisolated or placed in quarantine.\nSARS has a relatively long incubation period, generally accepted to be 10\ndays. Based on present knowledge about the disease, people exposed to the\nvirus are not infectious before the onset of symptoms. For these reasons,\nrapid detection and isolation of cases, and rapid tracing and follow-up of\ncontacts have been used successfully to bring a SARS outbreak under control.\nInvestigation of the outbreak\nFollowing a request by the Chinese Ministry of Health, the initial members\nof a WHO team are now in Beijing to assist in the investigation and control\nof the outbreaks there and in Anhui. Investigation of the source of\ninfection will focus initially on biosafety procedures at the National\nInstitute of Virology in Beijing. 2 of the 9 cases reported by China,\nincluding the earliest case, were researchers at the institute, which has\nbeen conducting work using the live SARS coronavirus.\nChinese authorities are providing WHO with detailed clinical and\nepidemiological information on all cases. This information is important in\nassessing the severity of illness caused by the virus and the extent of its\ntransmission. Of the 8 patients currently hospitalized for treatment, the\npatient in Anhui Province continues to improve. In Beijing, 2 patients are\nin critical condition, and the others remain under treatment for pneumonia.\nIf the source of infection is determined to come from the National\nInstitute of Virology in Beijing, this will be the first SARS outbreak\ncaused by a laboratory-acquired virus, which could possibly cause different\npatterns of illness and transmission. Previous laboratory-associated cases\n-- a single case each in Singapore in September 2003 and in Taiwan, China\nin December 2003 -- did not result in any further transmission. Both cases\nfully recovered.\nIn addition, 4 cases (3 confirmed and 1 probable) were reported in\nGuangdong Province in December 2003 and January 2004, presumably acquired\nfrom an environmental source. Unlike the present outbreak, these cases were\nassociated with mild illness only and did not result in secondary\ntransmission to others.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Since the last update additional laboratory results have come in on 2\npreviously reported suspected cases. No reports of new cases associated\nwith this current outbreak have been reported in the past 24 hours.\nAccording to the China MOH daily update, confirmation of SARS Co-V\ninfection in the 2 newly confirmed cases mentioned above was based on IgM\nand IgG serologic findings.

There are no\nadditional case reports from other provinces.\nThe new case reported by Beijing is a 49 year old woman, a retired doctor\nfrom Beijing Xuanwu district. On 9 Apr 2004, the patient had a chest\ninfection with fluid in the chest cavity and was admitted to the Xuanwu\nHospital emergency medical treatment ward.

The\nteam, which is expected to begin work on Wednesday, will include experts in\nepidemiology, virology, infection control, and laboratory biosafety.\nResults of investigations to date point to laboratory research at the\nNational Institute of Virology in Beijing as the likely source of the\noutbreak. The institute has been engaged in research with the SARS\ncoronavirus, including the development of a vaccine.\nTwo of the recently reported cases were conducting research at the\nlaboratory: a 26 year old female postgraduate student from Anhui Province,\nand a 31 year old man. The dates of symptom onset in the 2 cases were\nseparated by 23 days, suggesting that more than one opportunity for\nexposure may have occurred in the laboratory from mid-March through early\nApril 2004. Authorities have closed the virology institute and placed its\nmore than 200 employees under medical observation. Numerous environmental\nsamples from the laboratory have been taken to help assess possible sources\nof contamination, and these samples will be shared with WHO.\nUnderstanding and eliminating the source of infection are critical steps in\nbringing the outbreak under control. An equally important activity is to\nquickly detect all chains of transmission and interrupt them through rapid\ncase detection, tracing and follow-up of contacts, and infection control in\nhospitals.\nWHO is concerned about additional opportunities for exposure that may have\nalready occurred. Some patients were treated or assessed in several\ndifferent hospitals before a suspicion of SARS led to the introduction of\nadequate precautionary measures, including isolation of patients and strict\nprocedures for infection control. One patient travelled a long distance\ntwice by train within China while symptomatic.\nChinese authorities have heightened surveillance and reporting for\nSARS-like illness in health care facilities and have sent investigative\nteams to Anhui Province.\nSince 22 Apr 2004, China has reported that 8 people have been clinically\ndiagnosed as SARS cases or are under investigation for possible SARS\ninfection -- 6 in Beijing and 2, including the single fatality, in Anhui\nProvince. As of today, close to 1000 contacts of these cases are under\nmedical observation, including 640 in Beijing and 353 in Anhui.\nThe most recent cases, announced on Sunday, are 4 close contacts of a 20\nyear old nurse who treated the Anhui student at a Beijing hospital. The\ncases -\u00ad all in Beijing -\u00ad are currently under investigation. They include\nthe nurse\u0092s mother, father, aunt, and a woman who shared a hospital ward\nwith the nurse when she was undergoing treatment. Onset of symptoms for all\n4 occurred between 16 and 19 Apr 2004. The nurse\u0092s mother is in serious\ncondition following the development of pneumonia. The other 3 people are in\na stable condition.\nIn addition, health authorities have reported that 2 doctors who treated\nthe postgraduate student during her hospitalization in Hefai, Anhui, have\ndeveloped fever. A person in close contact with one of the doctors has also\ndeveloped fever.\nTo date, all diagnosed cases and cases under investigation have been linked\nto chains of transmission involving close personal contact with an\nidentified case. There is no evidence of wider transmission in the community.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past 24 hours since the last update (20040425.1150), there are the\nadditional reports of fever in 2 physicians treating the index case in\nAnhui and in a close contact of one of these 2 physicians. According the\nChina Minstry of Health (MOH) website (<http://www.moh.gov.cn>), there has\nbeen the implementation of increased surveillance for 'atypical pneumonia'\ncountry-wide, but no additional suspected cases have been identified.\nAs with 2003, there is an 'outbreak' of newswire reports and speculations\non this current situation, and for this reason we have chosen to be highly\nselective of newswire information we post, preferring to rely upon the\nofficial reports available from WHO and the Chinese MOH. Lessons were\nclearly learned after the 2003 outbreak, and there is now apparent\ntransparency in reporting. We will continue to screen newswire reports for\npossible early introduction of probable SARS activity in new geographic\nregions (outside of the currently identified Beijing and Anhui provinces),\nincluding any possible international spread.\nWe are still awaiting information on the independent laboratory testing of\nspecimens from the currently identified cases in China. Until these results\nare available, the cases are being classified as probable and suspected.\nAccording to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS,\nclassification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires\nindependent verification of results by an external international reference\nlaboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the\nimplications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public\nhealth. Irrespective of the 'tentative' classifications, appropriate\ninvestigations and disease control measures have been implemented, under\nthe assumption that infection with SARS coronavirus has truly occurred.\nHence, it is a semantic discussion that will not delay appropriate control\nmeasures to interrupt transmission.\nFrom the information currently available, there is now evidence of 3\ngenerations of transmission. The 1st generation involved the index case\nfrom Anhui, and possibly a 2nd '1st-generation' case, the postdoctoral\nstudent from Beijing whose onset of illness was 23 days after the onset of\nillness of the index case from Anhui. The 2nd generation included the\nmother of the index case from Anhui and the nurse who cared for the index\ncase from Anhui while she was hospitalized in Beijing, and possibly the\nphysicians who cared for her while hospitalized in Anhui. The 3rd\ngeneration of cases are the family members of the nurse (from the 2nd\ngeneration), a patient hospitalized in the same ward as the nurse before\nSARS was identified as a possible diagnosis for the nurse's illness, and a\nclose contact of one of the physicians who treated the index patient in\nAnhui. This pattern of nosocomial spread due to lack of early\nidentification of SARS as a possible diagnosis is very reminiscent of the\noutbreak in 2003.\nConcern about possible spread outside of the current identified 'close\ncontact' circle around these cases is warranted. It is to be hoped that the\nthreshold for suspicion of possible SARS will be lowered country-wide, so\ncases that may occur related to transmission while travelling on the trains\nbetween Anhui Province and Beijing will be identified and isolated early,\npreventing further generations of transmission.\nIn addition, there are appropriate concerns about laboratory safety\nprocedures. This is now the 3rd incident of SARS transmission within a\nlaboratory working on SARS research. The first 2 occurred in Singapore and\nTaiwan (see ProMED-mail postings SARS - worldwide (185): Taiwan, probable\nlab exposure 20031217.3081 and SARS - worldwide (174): Singapore laboratory\nexposure 20030923.2397).

'The prevention of aerosolization of the virus source\nshould take priority,' especially in hospitals. 'One should think about\ncontaining and/or removing the aerosols through engineering means, and\npersonal protective gear will have to be stepped up.'\nThe SARS outbreak that Dr Yu and his team investigated affected more than\n300 residents of Amoy Gardens, a private housing complex, they explain in\nthe 22 Apr 2004 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine [N Engl J Med\n2004; 1710-2\n<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/350/17/1731>,1731-9\n<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/350/17/1710>]. Hypotheses to\nexplain the spread include direct person-to-person contact, transmission\nthrough the sewage disposal system, use of communal facilities, and even\nroof rats running through sewage and water pipes. The epidemic curve and\nspatial distribution of the cases, however, are consistent with virus-laden\naerosols spread from a single source, the report indicates.\nDr Yu, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and colleagues obtained\ndetailed site plans of the drainage system of the housing complex, along\nwith meteorological data. They modeled the effects of turbulence on airflow\nand the dispersal of pollutants. Among the initial 187 cases in the housing\ncomplex, the index patient and 99 others lived in one building. The\nepidemic started on 21 Mar 2003 and peaked on 24 Mar 2003, with onset of\nsymptoms occurring between 24 and 26 Mar 2003 in most patients. The risk of\ncontracting the infection was 5 times higher in units on middle and upper\nfloors than on lower floors.\nAn environmental health team found that a bathroom exhaust fan could have\ndistributed contaminated aerosols into an airshaft connected to other units\nin the building. It appears that wind then distributed the aerosols from\nopen doors and windows to other buildings.\nThe index patient had extremely high concentrations of SARS coronavirus in\nfeces and urine compared with respiratory secretions, the authors note.\nBecause this patient had used a toilet in the building during a bout of\ndiarrhea, the authors suggest that 'huge numbers of aerosols [were\ngenerated] when toilets were flushed.'\nSimilar events would require 'a large concentrated dose of the virus\nsource, a mechanism of dispersing the source into fine aerosols that can be\nsuspended in air for a long period of time, and the appropriate weather and\nwind conditions and topography so that the virus could be spread to a large\nnumber of people in a short period of time,' Dr Yu said. In such an event,\n'many persons could be affected within a very short period of time [and]\ntransmission [could be] much more efficient than close contact\ntransmission,' he added. The clinical implications of airborne transmission\nare particularly important for infection control in hospitals and in public\nindoor settings such as airplanes and schools,' Dr Chad J Roy and Donald K\nMilton write in a related editorial. Dr Roy at the US Army Medical Research\nInstitute of Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick, Maryland, and Dr Milton\nat Harvard School of Public Health in Boston recommend aggressive\nair-sanitation measures, such as upper-room germicidal ultraviolet irradiation.\nDr Yu and his colleagues are now planning field experiments using tracer\nparticles or gas under similar weather conditions. 'Our team of medical\nepidemiologists and ventilation engineers will continue to collaborate to\nstudy other diseases and health conditions, infectious or non-infectious,\nrelated to airflows and ventilations.'\n[byline: Karla Gale]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[A significant feature of the Amoy Gardens incident would appear to have\nbeen the high concentration of SARS coronavirus present in the feces and\nurine of the index case, relative to the amount present in respiratory\nsecretions.

It was the\nfirst reported death from SARS since a deadly outbreak last year claimed\nhundreds of lives worldwide. China, the country worst hit by severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome, set up emergency controls as it confirmed 2 other\npeople were confirmed to have contracted the disease.\nHong Kong, which was also badly hit last year, raised its alert level. The\nlocal government said in a statement it had sent extra staff to the airport\nand the city's railway station that receives through-trains from China to\nspot ill people.\nChina's health ministry said a woman died, apparently of SARS, on 19 Apr\n2004 after taking care of her daughter, a 26 year old medical student who\nstudied for 2 weeks in a disease control laboratory in Beijing before\nreturning home ill to the eastern province of Anhui. The daughter is one of\nthe 2 patients confirmed to have contracted by the disease. The other\nconfirmed patient, a 20 year old nurse at a Beijing hospital, had treated\nthe medical student, it said in a statement on its website.\nThe ministry quoted experts as saying the source of infection might have\nbeen the lab, adding it had been sealed. 'The investigation shows...the\npatient in Beijing has epidemiological links with the confirmed SARS case\npatient in Anhui,' it added. A 31 year old male post-doctoral student [in\nBeijing] who worked alongside [the 26 year old patient from Anhui] in the\nlab was also suspected of having the disease. The cases in Beijing were the\nfirst recorded in China's capital since it was ravaged by the outbreak last\nyear.\nChina's State Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and\nQuarantine issued a circular ordering the quarantine of anyone found with a\nfever at its borders. China had learned from last year's epidemic and would\nkeep the public alerted, vice minister of health Zhu Qinsheng said, after\nattending a meeting of health ministers from South East Asia, Japan, South\nKorea, and China in the northern Malaysian state of Penang. 'We learned\nfrom the experience of last year's SARS outbreak and this time we will do\nour best and immediately alert the public. We are confident that the\nsituation will be under control,' he was quoted as saying. 'We are\nprepared. We are confident that SARS will not spread like it did in the\npast,' he told reporters.\n[The patient from Beijing], a nurse from Beijing's Jiangong Hospital, was\nin an isolation ward in Beijing's Ditan Hospital, the health ministry said.\nAuthorities have placed 188 people who had close contact with [her] under\nmedical observation, 5 of who have shown symptoms of SARS and been isolated\nat Ditan, it said. The Beijing government said the hospital was well\nprepared to deal with the case and 3 wards had been cleared and disinfected\nfor other possible SARS patients.\n[The patient from Anhui] was in stable condition at a university hospital\nin the Anhui provincial capital of Hefei and another 117 people in Anhui\nwere under medical observation, it said. Three of them had been isolated\nwith fever symptoms, the official Xinhua news agency said. SARS is a type\nof atypical pneumonia that first emerged in the southern Chinese province\nof Guangdong late in 2002, spread to Hong Kong, Beijing and on to more than\n30 countries, infecting about 8000 people and killing nearly 800. China\nconfirmed 4 more cases of SARS in Guangdong early this year, the first\nsince the global outbreak was declared over in July.

During the period 7--22 March she was studying in\nthe Chinese Viral disease control laboratory and on 23 Mar 2004 she took\nthe train to return to Hefei, Anhui. On 25 Mar 2004 she developed fever and\ntook the train back from Anhui to Beijing. On 29 Mar 2004 she underwent a\nmedical examination, was found to have pneumonia and was admitted to\nhospital at the [?Beijing Healthy Palace] hospital. On 2 Apr 2004 she took\nthe train to return to Anhui Huai Nan for treatment. On 4 Apr 2004 she was\ntransferred to the Anhui Medical College for continued treatment of viral\npneumonia. Beginning 31 Mar 2004, her mother continuously cared for and\naccompanied her and provided nursing care.\nOn 8 Apr 2004 [her mother] developed a fever and was admitted to hospital\nin the Anjui Medical College Hospital with viral pneumonia. On 19 Apr, her\nmother worsened and died. Upon receipt of notification of this death by the\nlocal medical department, the early warning mechanism was activated. On 21\nApr 2004, the Anhui Province Disease Control center had IgG positive blood\ntests [for SARS Co-V], this was reexamined by the Jiangsu Province Disease\nControl Center which also had IgM and IgG seropositivity.\nOn the evening of 21 Apr 2004, the Anhui Province Health Department\nreported the findings to the Medical Department. On the morning of 22 Apr\n2004, the Medical Department expert group rushed to Anhui. On 23 Apr 2004\nthe China Center for Disease Control senate compared the laboratory tests\n(IgG and IgM findings). The medical department expert group reviewed the 2\npatients clinical courses/presentations, the laboratory examinations and\nthe epidemiologic investigation and [confirmed] the diagnosis of atypical\npneumonia in the index case from Anhui [the graduate student] and referred\nautopsy specimens for confirmation on the index case's mother.\nAnhui Province has conducted strict disinfection of the areas of the 2\npatients and has identified 117 close contacts of these 2 patients. At\npresent, the index case is stable, and one of her close contacts has\ndeveloped fever.\nFurther investigation revealed that in Beijing on 22 Apr 2004 there was a\nreport of a case of atypical pneumonia that is epidemiologically linked to\nthe index case in Anhui. The case in Beijing, a nurse, cared for the index\ncase from Anhui during the period 29 Mar to ? Apr when the patient was in\nthe Healthy Palace Hospital in Beijing. Given the epidemiologic linking of\nthe 2 patients, Beijing has classified the case in Beijing as a case of\natypical pneumonia [SARS] infection. Currently the case in Beijing is\nafebrile. Of 188 close contacts of this case in Beijing, 5 have fever. 3 of\nthese 5 are close relatives of the Beijing case and 2 are from the hospital\ncontacts at the Earth Temple Hospital (one a patient and one a visitor\ncaring for a patient).\nOn 23 Apr 2004, Beijing reported another case of atypical pneumonia (SARS).\nThis patient is a 31 year old man, doing postdoctoral work at the China\nCenter for Disease Control Viral Disease laboratory. On 17 Apr [???], on 22\nApr 2004 he was admitted to the Earth Temple Hospital. On review of his\nclinical and epidemiologic history, Beijing immediately classified him as a\ncase of atypical pneumonia [SARS].\nIn view of the fact that the index patient in Anhui and the patient from\nBeijing both worked in the China Center for Disease Control viral\nlaboratory the epidemiological investigation is pointing towards the\nlaboratory as the source of infection and further investigations among the\nlaboratory staff are in process. The Medical Department has sealed the\nChina Center for Disease Control Viral laboratory and is investigating the\npersonnel, obtaining laboratory specimens from sampling within the\nlaboratory. Safety control measures are being investigated and implemented.\nThe medical department has requested the fever monitoring be conducted\nunder supervision [of laboratory staff?].

This brings the current number of persons with a\nclinical illness compatible with SARS in China to 4.\nChinese authorities have reported a diagnosis of clinically confirmed SARS\ncoronavirus infection in 2 of these persons. These are the 20-year-old\nnurse in Beijing, reported yesterday, who remains in intensive care, and a\n26-year-old female laboratory researcher, from Anhui Province. During 2\nweeks in March 2004, the researcher worked at the Chinese National\nInstitute of Virology in Beijing, which is part of China's Center for\nDisease Control. This institute is known to be engaged in research\ninvolving the SARS coronavirus. She developed symptoms on 25 Mar and was\nattended, while in a Beijing hospital, by the nurse. Her mother also\nprovided bedside care.\nThe mother became ill in Anhui on 8 Apr and died on 19 Apr. Her clinical\nsymptoms were compatible with SARS, and health authorities have\nretrospectively diagnosed her as a suspected SARS case.\nThe 4th person is a 31-year-old male laboratory researcher who also worked\nat the Beijing virology institute. He developed symptoms on 17 Apr and was\nhospitalized in isolation on 22 Apr. Health authorities have diagnosed him\nas a suspected SARS case.\nIn line with WHO definitions of SARS coronavirus infections, WHO has\nclassified 2 of these persons, the 20-year-old nurse and the 26-year-old\nlaboratory researcher, as probable cases of SARS. The 2 additional persons\nremain under investigation; further laboratory tests are being conducted by\nChinese authorities.\nAccording to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS,\nclassification as a confirmed case requires independent verification of\nresults by an external international reference laboratory. Such procedures\nare considered necessary in view of the implications that confirmed SARS\ncases can have for international public health.\nWHO is working closely with Chinese health authorities to confirm the\nstatus and full extent of this cluster, and to prevent further spread. The\nsituation is considered potentially serious because of the multiple\nopportunities for exposures. To date, more than 300 contacts have been\nidentified and placed under medical observation.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2] China measures taken\nDate: 24 Apr 2004\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: New York Times [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/24/international/asia/24SARS.html>\n\nThe Chinese government began screening travelers at airports and train\nstations on Friday and closed its main SARS laboratory after what appeared\nto be a safety breach at the lab led to 4 confirmed [cases are still\npending confirmation from an independent international laboratory] and\nsuspected cases, including a death, in a new outbreak.\nOfficials are hurriedly trying to determine how widely the disease has\nspread. At least 260 people who came into close contact with the patients\nare being observed, and at least 5 others with fevers have been isolated.\nThere is also concern about the recent travels of one of the patients [the\nindex case], a 26-year-old medical graduate student, who studied at the\nSARS lab. She traveled on at least 3 trains; 2 of the trips came after she\nhad developed a fever and other symptoms. [Her] mother, who cared for her\nand traveled with her, fell ill with pneumonia symptoms this month and died\nMonday.\nThis is the 3rd outbreak from a laboratory accident in the past year; the\nothers were in Singapore and Taiwan. Dr. Alfred Sommer, an epidemiologist\nand dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in\nBaltimore, said Friday, 'The good news is this is not a new emergence of\nyet another strain of virus that we do not know anything about, or how to\ncontain,' like SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, was when first\ndetected in 2003. 'The bad news is that this is the 3rd laboratory release\nof this virus, which keeps taking people by surprise,' he added.\nChinese officials, who were harshly criticized for their mismanagement of\nthe original SARS outbreak, appeared to be responding swiftly. Efforts were\nunder way to find people who had come into contact with the SARS patients.\nOfficials also closed the Institute of Virology at China's Centers for\nDisease Control in Beijing, where the infections originated, according to a\nstatement on the Ministry of Health Web site.\nThe director of Beijing's health bureau, Jin Dapeng, said Friday that the\nchain of transmission had been identified and that authorities had the\nsituation under 'effective control.' The pattern of the outbreak, however,\nhas raised questions about how a safety breach could have occurred at the\nlaboratory and whether medical officials moved quickly enough to isolate\n[the index case] after she exhibited symptoms. The 4 patients were cared\nfor in different hospitals but not initially isolated. Another student\nworking in the lab, developed symptoms more than 3 weeks later and is now\nlisted as suspected of having SARS.\nDr. Julie Hall, the SARS team leader for the Beijing office of the World\nHealth Organization, said health officials held a meeting on Friday with\nthe Chinese Ministry of Health. She said the ministry had asked for their\nhelp in trying to determine what went wrong and to limit exposures.\nAt World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva, a spokesman for the\nUnited Nations agency said that under its rules it could not call the cases\nconfirmed until scientists in a laboratory in its network outside of China\nhad tested specimens from the patients. Until then, the agency is\nconsidering as 'probable' the 2 cases that China has called 'confirmed.'\nThe agency said it is classifying the other 2 cases as 'under investigation.'\nEarly Friday evening, the Chinese Ministry of Health issued a detailed\nchronology that appeared to trace the outbreak to some sort of mishap in\nthe lab. [The index case], a medical graduate student in Anhui Province,\nbegan study at the lab on 7 Mar 2004. She and the other [post doctoral\nstudent case] both studied in a laboratory that handled samples of the SARS\nvirus, according to Dr. Hall.\nThe Health Ministry said that [the index case's] stint at the lab ended 22\nMar 2004 and that the next day she returned by train to Anhui Province. On\n25 Mar 2004, she developed a fever. At some point, she returned by train to\nBeijing for treatment. On 29 Mar 2004, she was admitted to Jiangong\nHospital as a pneumonia patient.\nAt the hospital, one of [the nurses who cared for her], the woman\nidentified Thursday by Chinese officials as suspected of having SARS. On\nFriday, officials reclassified [this case] as a confirmed SARS patient.\nFor reasons that are not clear, [the index case] was discharged from\nJiangong on 2 Apr 2004 and returned by train with her mother to a hospital\nin Anhui. There, she was transferred to a second hospital. The person\napparently most often by [her] side during her illness was her mother. She\nhad started caring for her daughter on 31 Mar 2004 and developed a fever on\n8 Apr 2004. She was hospitalized as a pneumonia patient at the same\nhospital as her daughter. On Monday, [the index case's mother] died.\nThe official New China News Agency reported that [the index case] tested\npositive for SARS antibodies on Wednesday. Health officials from Beijing\nwent to Anhui and tested her again. She again tested positive on Friday and\nwas deemed a confirmed SARS patient. Dr. Hall, said she 'died of pneumonia\nof an unknown cause that is likely to be SARS.'\nMeanwhile, [the other graduate student] developed a fever on 17 Apr 2004\nand was hospitalized Thursday. He is now classified as suspected of having\nSARS.\nDr. Hall said the timetable raised questions about why [the index case] was\nnot promptly isolated when she first developed a fever, particularly\nbecause physicians should have known she had studied in a SARS laboratory.\n'Those alarm bells appear not to have gone off,' she said.\n[Byline: Jim Yardley and Lawrence K.

Dr. Alfred Sommer, an epidemiologist\nand dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in\nBaltimore, said Friday, 'The good news is this is not a new emergence of\nyet another strain of virus that we do not know anything about, or how to\ncontain,' like SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, was when first\ndetected in 2003. ' In addition, this new case of\npossible SARS provides a reminder to all healthcare settings, especially\nphysician offices, outpatient clinics, and emergency departments, of the\nimportance of implementing infection control precautions at the point of\n1st contact with patients who have symptoms of a respiratory infection. The United Kingdom (UK) Health Protection Agency (HPA) recently issued\ninterim guidance (algorithm) for identification of possible cases of SARS\nand avian influenza\n(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/avianinfluenza/pdfs/Algorithm140\n404.pdf>). At World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva, a spokesman for the\nUnited Nations agency said that under its rules it could not call the cases\nconfirmed until scientists in a laboratory in its network outside of China\nhad tested specimens from the patients. \nDr. Hall said the timetable raised questions about why [the index case] was\nnot promptly isolated when she first developed a fever, particularly\nbecause physicians should have known she had studied in a SARS laboratory. This current posting contains\nmore detailed information from WHO and newswires on the chronology of\nevents surrounding the cases with implications for potential spread due to\ndelay in recognition of the disease in the index and other cases. Patients should promptly be tested for evidence of SARS-CoV infection as\npart of the diagnostic evaluation (see Appendix 2, 'Guidelines for\nCollecting Specimens from Potential SARS Patients,' in the CDC document,\n' During 2\nweeks in March 2004, the researcher worked at the Chinese National\nInstitute of Virology in Beijing, which is part of China's Center for\nDisease Control. The pattern of the outbreak, however,\nhas raised questions about how a safety breach could have occurred at the\nlaboratory and whether medical officials moved quickly enough to isolate\n We've\nincluded information from several countries on heightened surveillance\nactivities that are now being taken in order to more quickly identify\npossible spread of disease outside of China.

Altman]\n--\nProMED-mail\n< Source: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/cases_china.html>\n\nHealth Canada has alerted health care officials to the importance of\ncollecting a travel history from people with severe respiratory illness. In line with WHO definitions of SARS coronavirus infections, WHO has\nclassified 2 of these persons, the 20-year-old nurse and the 26-year-old\nlaboratory researcher, as probable cases of SARS. [In the past 24 hours there have been no reports of additional cases other\nthan those reported in the ProMED-mail posting of yesterday SARS -\nworldwide (18): China (cases) 20040423.1125. There is also concern about the recent travels of one of the patients [the\nindex case], a 26-year-old medical graduate student, who studied at the\nSARS lab. For reasons that are not clear, [the index case] was discharged from\nJiangong on 2 Apr 2004 and returned by train with her mother to a hospital\nin Anhui. He developed symptoms on 17 Apr and was\nhospitalized in isolation on 22 Apr. Health authorities have diagnosed him\nas a suspected SARS case. These are the 20-year-old\nnurse in Beijing, reported yesterday, who remains in intensive care, and a\n26-year-old female laboratory researcher, from Anhui Province. Dr. Julie Hall, the SARS team leader for the Beijing office of the World\nHealth Organization, said health officials held a meeting on Friday with\nthe Chinese Ministry of Health. The institute also ordered anyone showing symptoms of severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome, such as a high fever, be reported immediately.\n The National Institute of Health ordered quarantine offices to check\ntemperatures of all travelers from the 2 Chinese cities, and asked them to\nfill out health questionnaires upon arrival. Her clinical\nsymptoms were compatible with SARS, and health authorities have\nretrospectively diagnosed her as a suspected SARS case. According to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS,\nclassification as a confirmed case requires independent verification of\nresults by an external international reference laboratory. We continue to provide ongoing, up-to-date information from Health Canada\nto our provincial and territorial partners on SARS, influenza, avian\ninfluenza, and other emerging severe respiratory illnesses. The HPA has urged clinicians and health professionals in the UK\nto remain vigilant and report any unusual clusters of severe respiratory\nillness in people returning from China. Health Canada has advised Quarantine Officers of\nthe SARS situation in China and has asked them to increase vigilance of any\nreported passengers with respiratory illness. Such procedures\nare considered necessary in view of the implications that confirmed SARS\ncases can have for international public health. \nChinese authorities have reported a diagnosis of clinically confirmed SARS\ncoronavirus infection in 2 of these persons. Health departments should also inform CDC of\nother cases or clusters of pneumonia that are of particular concern by\ncalling 770-488-7100. An early warning, regarding the current Beijing suspect case of SARS, has\nbeen sent to national public health bodies through the European Union's\nEarly Warning and Response System. She\nhad started caring for her daughter on 31 Mar 2004 and developed a fever on\n8 Apr 2004. The reported possible cases of SARS in China represent an evolving\nsituation, and CDC will distribute updates as additional information is\nlearned. Another student\nworking in the lab, developed symptoms more than 3 weeks later and is now\nlisted as suspected of having SARS. In particular, the health status of\nhousehold contacts or persons who provided care to symptomatic patients\nshould be assessed. The 2 additional persons\nremain under investigation; further laboratory tests are being conducted by\nChinese authorities. The director of Beijing's health bureau, Jin Dapeng, said Friday that the\nchain of transmission had been identified and that authorities had the\nsituation under 'effective control.' She and the other [post doctoral\nstudent case] both studied in a laboratory that handled samples of the SARS\nvirus, according to Dr. Hall.

Quarantine Officers on site at\nthese airports provide health assessments for international travellers who\nare identified to be ill. They have been advised to be\nespecially alert to reports of travellers on flights from Beijing who\nappear to be ill from a respiratory illness. Early Friday evening, the Chinese Ministry of Health issued a detailed\nchronology that appeared to trace the outbreak to some sort of mishap in\nthe lab.

Participants agreed on the priority research\nquestions to be addressed in the coming months.\nQuestions fall into the main areas of epidemiology, laboratory\ndiagnostics, outbreak management, case management, including\ntreatment outcomes and infection control, and social impact. The\nresearch agenda, which will undergo further review by participants,\nis expected to be finalized for public release within a week.\nPreparation of the research agenda was based on a discussion of\nseveral problems that emerged during the outbreak and an analysis\nof subsequent data, including areas where additional scientific\nevidence was needed to identify the most cost-effective control\nstrategies. Participants expressed a great need to ensure that the\nworld can recognize and respond to a recurrence of SARS in ways\nthat work faster to achieve control and are less costly and socially\ndisruptive. The following topics were discussed.\nThe Global SARS Alert System\n----------------------------\nConcerning the level of operational preparedness to detect new\ncases, participants noted that the system of alert now in place will\nprobably work well to pick up clusters of severe disease. False-\nalarms are fully expected and have already occurred. They\nprovide reassurance that the alert system is working well. However,\nparticipants agreed that sporadic cases of SARS may not be\ndetected early.\nMild SARS cases and cases with atypical symptoms could be\ninitially missed, hence the importance for several lines of defence\nin which the intensity of surveillance is determined by the level of\nrisk (zone of re-emergence, nodal areas, and low-risk areas).\nMoreover, the system for global alert is weakened by the fact that\nat least half of the world's population has no access to services\nthat can perform simple chest X-rays.\nSome countries are continuing a policy of heightened alert for\npersons with a recent travel history to one of the initial outbreak\nsites. Failure to elicit such a history should not automatically\nexclude SARS as a diagnosis if other clinical, laboratory, and\nepidemiological features are consistent with the diagnosis. The\nHotel Metropole incident, in which contact with a single infected\nperson seeded the outbreak's international spread, was a random\nevent illustrating the limitations that travel history can have in the\npost-outbreak situation. Any major transportation hub near an\ninternational airport could be the scene for a similar seeding of\ninternational spread.\nPreparedness in Resource-poor Settings\n--------------------------------------\nFollowing the global alerts of 12 and 15 Mar 2003, most countries\nexperiencing imported cases were able to prevent any further\ntransmission or hold the number of cases to very small numbers,\nindicating the effectiveness of a high level of alert. It is hoped\nthat, should SARS re-emerge, the disease would occur in small\npockets of cases that could, with the present level of vigilance, be\nrapidly detected and contained.\nA major concern is the occurrence of cases in resource-poor\nsettings, where health infrastructures might not be able to cope\nwith the demands of case detection, isolation, intensive care, and\ncontact tracing. Outbreak dynamics in such settings could take on\ndimensions different than those seen during the initial outbreak. In\nthe absence of sophisticated hospital facilities and treatment\nprocedures, which are known to amplify transmission, developing\ncountries might not experience explosive increases in cases for\nthe same reasons as seen elsewhere. Many other factors, such as\ncrowding on wards and lack of adequate isolation facilities, could\ncontribute to so-called 'super-spreading' events.\nSome discussion centered on ways to identify areas that might be\nat particular risk. One approach would be to assess air passenger\nflows to determine which cities are most vulnerable to international\nspread. Support for enhanced surveillance and preparedness\nplans could then be targeted to areas considered at greatest risk.\nDiagnosis\n--------\nDiagnosis of SARS is difficult, and all currently available\nlaboratory tests have limitations. At present, there is no single\n'gold standard' that can be recommended for laboratory testing.\nDifferent tests are appropriate for different stages of the disease.\nAnother problem affecting the reliability of available serological\ntests is cross-reaction with other human coronaviruses, which are\nwidespread.\nThe laboratory confirmation of 2 or more cases in the same health\ncare unit during a 10-day period would have great significance in\nthe post-outbreak setting, perhaps signalling the start of another\nglobal emergency. For this reason, and in view of the inadequacy of\ndiagnostic tests, the experts recommended a policy of rigorous\nverification, whereby positive tests in one laboratory would need to\nbe confirmed by an external, internationally recognized reference\nlaboratory. A system of quality assurance of tests was also judged\nessential, as were internationally-agreed algorithms that could help\nclinicians make difficult diagnostic choices. These issues are being\ndiscussed further at the SARS Laboratory Network Meeting on\nWed 22 Oct 2003.\nDiagnosis would also benefit from some method of identifying,\nperhaps through immunological or genetic markers, which patients\nmight develop severe illness and which patients might contribute to\nsuper-spreading events. An additional concern is the development\nof diagnostic tests suitable for use in resource-poor settings.\nPossible Evolution of the SARS Coronavirus\n----------------------------------------\nStudies of coronaviruses in a number of animal species indicate\nthat some of these viruses readily cross from one species to\nothers, lending weight to theories that the SARS virus originally\njumped from some natural animal host to humans. Recent\nexperimental studies have easily infected 2 animal species with the\nSARS virus, suggesting that the range of animal hosts where the\nSARS virus could 'hide' between outbreaks is much wider than\ninitially suspected.\nIn animal diseases caused by coronaviruses, the severity of\ndisease can be exacerbated by such factors as co-infection with\nother respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, some forms of\ntreatment, and stress, especially during transport. Virus shedding is\nlonger, and respiratory symptoms are more severe following\nexposure to aerosolized virus. These features may shed some\nlight on super-spreading events, which remain poorly understood.\nIn Hong Kong, for example, transmission was amplified in hospitals\nwhere certain aerosol-producing procedures, including the use of\nnebulizers, were performed during the earliest days of the outbreak.\nAnimal studies indicate that coronaviruses can be spread\nmechanically. This mode of spread may have contributed to\nevents, such as the Amoy Gardens outbreak, in which some\nenvironmental contact with the virus clearly played a role.\nSome coronaviruses are believed to survive in their animal hosts\ndespite seasonal changes in temperature. Others have mutated\ninto strains causing much milder disease. While these features\ncould hold true for the SARS virus, much more research is needed\nbefore any conclusions about the future evolution of the SARS\nvirus can be reached.\nAmplification in Hospitals: the Role of Infection Control\n------------------------------------------------\nThe amplification of transmission within well-equipped hospitals\nwas a striking feature of SARS. In some cases, staff became\ninfected despite wearing full protective equipment. Participants\npresented further compelling evidence that certain sophisticated\nprocedures, especially those that generate aerosols, greatly\namplify the risks of infection; less sophisticated hospitals fared\nbetter.\nSome cases of hospital-based infection could be attributed to clear\nlapses in infection control. In this and several other cases,\nresearch in the social sciences could assist in improving behaviour\nwhile also helping staff cope with the considerable stress of dealing\nwith a new disease, a new type of patient, and new requirements\nfor care.\nA disproportionately large amount of resources is needed to\nprevent transmission of airborne infections. The required infection\ncontrol procedures are also extremely demanding for staff. As\nSARS is not thought to be an airborne infection, research should\nclarify the need for these measures compared with measures\nneeded to prevent transmission via droplets and contact with body\nfluids. It was also agreed that the need for protective equipment is\nrelated to procedures, and that, in advance of another emergency,\nconsideration needs to be given to equipment that provides a good\nstandard of care and adequate protection while also being\naffordable and sustainable.\nLaboratory Biosafety\n--------------------\nBetter measures are needed internationally to prevent the\nrecurrence of SARS following a laboratory biosafety accident.\nHealth authorities should be encouraged to produce inventories of\nall facilities conducting research on the virus or holding samples.\nThis information should then be communicated internationally to\nWHO.\nControl Interventions\n---------------------\nRapid case detection and isolation, along with contact tracing and\nfollow-up, were generally regarded as an effective way to deal with\nthe emergence of a new disease. It reduces the pool of infectious\nindividuals circulating in the community and, in the case of contacts,\nheightens the level of clinical suspicion, especially in the absence\nof reliable diagnostic tests. However, good support from information\ntechnologies is needed to manage the data required for more\nefficient contact tracing. Research on the most effective\napproaches to contact tracing is also needed.\nAnother important need is for the real-time compilation of data from\nepidemiological, clinical, and laboratory sources, and their\nintegration into a single data-set available to the international\ncommunity. Access to such a database would contribute greatly to\nassessment of the effectiveness of all interventions, including\ntreatment, in real time as a SARS outbreak -- or outbreak of any\nother emerging disease -- unfolds.\n--\nDr. Christian Drosten\nVirology/Molecular Diagnostics\nBernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine\nBernhard-Nocht Str. 74\n20359 Hamburg Germany\n<drosten@bni-hamburg.de>", "summary": "In this and several other cases,\nresearch in the social sciences could assist in improving behaviour\nwhile also helping staff cope with the considerable stress of dealing\nwith a new disease, a new type of patient, and new requirements\nfor care.\n A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Preparation of the research agenda was based on a discussion of\nseveral problems that emerged during the outbreak and an analysis\nof subsequent data, including areas where additional scientific\nevidence was needed to identify the most cost-effective control\nstrategies.

My presumption has been that\nMartina et al. did not suggest that either ferrets or domestic cats are\nalternate reservoirs of the SARS coronavirus. Rather, their intention was\nto demonstrate experimentally that many animal species (not just captive\nraccoon dogs and civet cats) might transmit SARS coronavirus and that it is\npremature to jump to conclusions about the source of SARS coronavirus\ninfection on the basis of rather arbitrary studies of captive animals in\nChinese markets.\nMy assumption has been that ferrets and cats were used in these experiments\nbecause these animals were available and convenient laboratory subjects.\nDr. Ruedas presents a critique of these experiments from the standpoint of\nthe discipline of Medical Ecology, which although mathematical in content,\ndeserves consideration. - Mod.CP]\nIn their brief communication on SARS virus infection in wild animals (ref.\n1) indicated that -- based on their findings -- distantly related\ncarnivores (in their instance, ferrets and cats) could act as reservoirs\nfor the SARS coronavirus (SCV). There are some potential pitfalls in their\nreasoning. Susceptibility is defined in medical terms as diminished\nimmunity to a disease, especially an infection, or not having immunity to\nan infectious disease and thus [being] at risk of infection (ref 2). Can a\nreservoir, or host species, be susceptible to the virus it hosts? In\ncertain instances of host-parasite co-evolutionary frameworks, the answer\nis yes: a malarial protozoan, _Plasmodium_, is conferred evolutionary\nadvantage if its human host is incapacitated, because a healthy human\neasily could evade a mosquito, the flight speed of which is estimated at 5\nto 7 Km/h. Incapacitation of the host therefore increases the feeding\nopportunities for the mosquitoes and perpetuates the epidemic and enzootic\ncycles of malaria. In such a system, the vectorial capacity equation of\nMacdonald (ref. 3) may be arranged (ref. 4) to, VC = ma (P/F)(e^(-n/E))E\nwhere: ma = number of bites per human per day (estimated from human bait\ncatches); P = proportion of blood meals taken on human hosts; F = days\nbetween blood meals (from lab studies); n = extrinsic incubation period\n(lab studies); and E = vector's life expectancy.\nIt may be readily appreciated that incapacitation will significantly\nincrease ma and P, hence the vectorial capacity will be significantly\nenhanced, to the benefit of _Plasmodium_. Anderson and May (ref. 5) listed\na number of complicating factors in this system including the effects of\nlongevity (on both human host and vector): decreased life-span in the human\nsignificantly impacts the dynamics of the disease (e.g., their mu [defined\nin next paragraph] less than 1 percent in equation 14.7 et seq.).\nA directly transmitted zoonosis such as SARS is at once a simpler and more\ncomplicated framework to model. A basic SIR\n(susceptible-infected-recovered) model of disease dynamics (ref. 6)\nconsists of the 3 host cell categories (complicating for age, a, at time,\nt), thus: N(a, t) = X(a, t) + Y(a, t) + Z(a, t), where X, Y, and Z\ncorrespond to populations of each of the modeled categories (SIR); an\nadditional category for a latent category (infected but not infectious), H,\nmay be added. A basic set of differential equations describing this\nframework (ref. 5) is beyond the scope of this correspondence, but includes\nage-specific host death rate mu, recovery rate upsilon, disease induced\nmortality rate alpha, and a 'force of infection' component, lambda. An\nideal host species for a directly transmitted viral disease would have a\nnegligible age-specific or otherwise alpha(a), hence upsilon(a) would be an\nirrelevant component of the epidemiological dynamics.\nIn such a situation, the total number of hosts, N, is not equivalent to the\ntraditional equation shown above, rather Z ~= 0, and Y would be a\nproportion of X, but because alpha(a) ~= 0, (i.e., mu + alpha ~= mu) the\nentire host population N can be uniformly modeled.\nAn additional biological factor critical to adequate representation of the\nsystem is the basic reproductive rate, Rsub0, of the virus. Although\ntechnically this should represent the intrinsic reproductive rate of an\norganism, in terms of its representation in disease dynamics, Rsub0\ngenerally is symbolic of infections produced by an infected, infectious\nhost or victim -- given that evolutionarily a virus is dead if it does not\ncolonize a new host. In order to establish itself in a host (or victim)\npopulation -- or establish an equilibrium -- a virus would within this\nframework have Rsub0 > 1. Departures from equilibrium lead to R,\nthe effective reproductive rate, discounted by the fraction of the host\npopulation being susceptible, x*, where R = Rsub0x* =1. Anderson and May\n(ref. 5) lucidly pointed out that Rsub0 must be proportional to the number\n(or density) of hosts candidate for infection such that Rsub0 = N/NsubT,\nwhere N is the population size and NsubT the threshold magnitude. For\ncondition Rsub0 > 1, the corollary condition N > NsubT must hold.\nSynthesizing, it can readily be appreciated that a certain minimal number\nof intrinsic biological factors determine the suitability of an organism to\nbe a potential host for a given virus. In the situation described by\nMartina et al. (ref. 1) it is clear that the ferret cannot in any way be\nconsidered a host. This is because the disease-induced mortality rate\nalpha, as Martina et al (ref. 1) suggest, would be so high that the total\npopulation mortality rate alpha+mu would not support the disease dynamics\nin a sustainable manner. Furthermore, ferrets exist in the wild in\nextremely low numbers (ref. 7). Hence the directly transmitted SCV would\nhave an even lesser probability of transmission given the density-dependent\ndynamics of the epidemiological framework.\nThere is, of course, a more essential flaw: the name _Mustela furo_ applies\nto domestic ferrets only. These animals are reproductively -- hence\ngenetically -- identical to _M. putorius_, the polecat. That is to say, _M.\nfuro_ as a species does not really exist, being no more than a series of\nindividuals drawn from _M. putorius_. The natural range of _M. putorius_ is\nmost of Europe east to the Ural Mountains. (ref. 8). Therefore, even were\nit not for the epidemiological dynamic considerations alluded to above, _M.\n'furo'_ perforce cannot be considered a potential host for SCV. If _M.\n'furo'_ are available in markets in Guangdong these are, by definition,\nimported, and beg the question: why is there no SARS in Europe? An allied\nspecies occupying a range including the epicenter of the SARS epidemic\n(ref. 8, 9), _M. sibirica_, could be considered as a potential host.\nHowever, the low densities prevalent in _M. putorius_ likewise exist in _M.\nsibirica_ and indeed in all species of the genus _Mustela_. As a\nconsequence of the foregoing, mustelids it would seem should be discounted\nas hosts of SCV.\nIn contrast, the situation reported by Martina et al. (ref. 1) regarding\ncats is far more worthy of note. The correct name (by first designation)\napplicable to these organisms is _Felis catus_ (ref. 8) (by Linnaeus in\n1758), rather than _F. silvestris_ (by Schreber in 1775) or _F. domesticus_\n(by Erxleben in 1777), all of which, despite their distinct names, cona = 0\nmakes for highly effective transmission dynamics, as has been shown in\nhantaviruses and their rodent hosts (ref. 10).\nThe typically exponential rise in proportion of infected hosts P(t), has\nbeen shown (ref. 5) to depend on the rate at which new infectives are being\nproduced, lambda, such that P(t) = P(0)exp(lambda t). Furthermore, the\nbiological quality lambda, depends on Rsub0 and on the parasite lifespan,\nD, such that lambda = (Rsub0 - 1)/D. Finally, in a host-virus framework\nsuch as SARS, D represents the duration of infectiousness; however, for\nchronically infected hosts (e.g., rodent hosts of Hantaviruses) D is\neffectively equivalent to the life-span of the host since the host is\ninfected for life and sheds virus for life. Recall that in ferrets, D is\nseverely curtailed by SCV infection due to the high mortality rate, alpha.\nIn contrast, if cats are asymptomatically infected, alpha = 0, and if they\nare shown to be capable of chronic infection with a magnitude of D\nequivalent to their life-span (2-5 years in the wild and 12-14 years as\npets), then the epidemiological potential of cats-SCV vis-a-vis humans-SARS\nwould be of enormous extent. For these reasons, _Felis catus_ also must be\ndiscounted from consideration as the natural host of SCV. If it were the\nnatural host, SCV and the consequent SARS infection of humans would be a\nquotidian affair on a global scale. Instead, it is arguably the first\nemergent infection of the 21st century with a focus in Guangzhou, Guangdong\nprovince, China. The fact that _F. catus_ is capable of asymptomatic\ntransmission is, however, highly suggestive that perhaps another felid\ncould be the host. In the focal area, the wild species _Prionailurus\nbengalensis_ (leopard cat) and _Catopuma temmincki_ (Golden cat) both\noccur, although the range of the former, including most of India,\nIndochina, and the Greater Sunda islands, makes it an unlikely candidate\nspecies for the natural host of SARS.\nMathematical models representing epidemiological frameworks are of\ntremendous heuristic utility, as was recently shown in the pages of the\njournal Nature with respect to smallpox (ref. 6). These frameworks can and\nshould also be used to determine probabilities of particular species being\nhosts, given certain minimal biological properties inherent to the species\n(e.g., geographic range). Medical ecology, integrating as it does disparate\nfields from mathematics, across epidemiology and medicine, to basic and\napplied ecology, has much to offer in the search for viral hosts: because\nof the medical impact of SARS on humans, discounting from consideration\nspecies that cannot be potential hosts is of particular importance in\nelucidating the epidemiology of this fascinating disease. Furthermore,\ngiven that cats are able to be infected but -- unlike humans -- do not\nmanifest any clinical sign of disease, they are not an adequate animal\nmodel for testing therapies against the human virus.\nReferences:\n1.

Preliminary animal experiments\nshowed that inoculation of the orthoreovirus into mice caused death with\natypical pneumonia.\nThe significance of these data is unclear. It is conceivable that the\nexpression of the disease known as SARS is dependent on the presence of one\nor more co-factors, which may or may not be other infectious agents.\nPreviously published data have suggested that Human metapneumovirus, a\ncommon respiratory virus, might be such a co-factor, but this has not been\nuniversally substantiated.

The concern is that viruses such as human\nmetapneumovirus and the 3 types of mammalian orthoreovirus are ubiquitous\nin the normal population. Whereas an orthoreovirus might be a good\ncandidate for inclusion in a general class of co-factors, it is less likely\nto be a specific co-factor.

(full\nreference below). This publication includes a map of the geographical\ndistribution of SARS cases in Guangdong province from Nov 2002 to Feb 2003.\nThe full text is accessible online. The discussion section, which provides a\nbalanced summary of the results of this investigation, is reproduced below. -\nMod.CP]\nVirological surveillance in Guangdong Province in mid-February, 2003, showed\nthat the outbreak of a disease fitting the WHO case definition of SARS\nstarted in mid-November, 2002. Epidemiological investigations suggest that\nSARS probably first emerged in satellite cities of Guangzhou, circulating for\nat least 2 months before causing a major outbreak in Guangzhou itself.\nSerological tests and virus isolation confirmed that SARS CoV was the primary\ninfectious agent of these early cases of SARS. Genetic analysis of these SARS\nCoV isolates showed that they belonged to two different subgroups, one\nclosely related to that noted in Hong Kong and other countries, and one that\nseemingly had not spread to people in other regions. Phylogenetic analysis\nalso suggests that all SARS CoV share the same origin and most probably first\noriginated in Guangdong, southern China.\nIn this report, our investigation covered 55 patients with SARS from\nGuangzhou and its neighbouring cities in the early phase of the SARS\noutbreak. The findings of our study show that most of the patients had\nserological evidence of infection with the novel SARS CoV, while healthy\ncontrols did not. Information generated here suggests that SARS CoV was also\nthe primary infectious agent in the outbreaks in Guangdong Province. Because\nmost people who had SARS in other countries were directly or indirectly\nlinked to Hong Kong or Guangdong Province, we believe that the coronavirus\nmight have originated from this region. Thus, SARS, a new emerging infectious\ndisease that has become the first pandemic of the 21st century, probably\noriginated in Guangdong.\nOur epidemiological findings suggest that SARS had been spreading in an\nunusual pattern. The pandemic began with just a few index cases clustered\nmainly in families and hospital health-care workers in cities around\nGuangzhou. That specific antibodies were not present in any serum samples\nfrom healthy controls suggests that this coronavirus has not previously been\npresent in human beings in Guangzhou.\nOur analyses of genome function segments excludes the possibility that SARS\nCoV was generated by a recombination between human and animal -- or animal\nand animal -- coronavirus. SARS virus might be zoonotic and could have been\nintroduced to humans by inter-species transmission quite recently. Since SARS\nCoV had very low homologies with all known coronaviruses, our postulation is\nthat the new virus might have originally been resident in animals that have\ninfrequent contact with humans, rather than in domestic animals.\nThe strains GZ43 and GZ60 from 2 health-care workers affected within the same\nhospital seem phylogenetically similar; whereas GZ50, which is an independent\ncase from the community, is a distinct lineage. This finding suggests that\nthere were multiple lineages of viruses circulating in Guangdong. One of\nthese lineages (GZ50) maintains an outgroup relation to the major cluster of\ncases in Hong Kong and could represent the precursor virus of the Hong Kong\noutbreak. Whether some lineages are more transmissible than others is not\nclear. An analysis of more strains from Guangdong is needed to address this\nissue.\nThe spread of SARS CoV in Foshan and Zhongshan in November and December,\n2002, did not lead to an outbreak of the same scale as that in Guangzhou in\nJanuary and February, 2003. Foshan and Zhongshan, like Guandong, are large\nurban conurbations of more than 1 million people. One possibility is that the\nvirus was adapting to human beings -- i.e. human transmission with time.\nHowever, spread of the disease might have been promoted by the movement of\npeople during the Chinese New Year holiday season that, in 2003, occurred at\nthe end of January. Furthermore, Guangzhou, being a premier medical centre,\nreceived transfers of several patients with respiratory complications\nassociated with SARS.\nViruses that undergo inter-species transmission tend to undergo more rapid\ngenetic change as they adapt to a new host. In fact, we noted that the\ngenetic variation in the S gene was associated with mutations that were\nmainly non-synonymous. The SCoV isolated in our study are some of the\nearliest isolates in the global outbreak. Further genetic analysis of these\nisolates might enable us to understand the origins of this virus and how it\nbecame established in human beings.\nThe index case of the Guangzhou outbreak actually functioned as the trigger\nfor the pandemic that generated a large number of secondary infections.\nRetrospective analysis of the pathway of the SARS spread from satellite\ncities to Guangzhou, then Hong Kong and other countries, showed that the\nmajor outbreak around the world could be linked to just a small number of so-\ncalled super-spreading incidents. This finding implies that effective human-\nto-human transmission is firmly established and suggests that SARS CoV has\nbecome well-adapted to human beings.\nOne important question that has arisen from the SARS outbreak is why the new\ncoronavirus emerged in Guangdong, southern China. There might be a link to\nthe culinary habits of some southern Chinese, who consume wild game meat as a\ndelicacy. To satisfy this demand, different kinds of wild animals have been\nhunted for consumption, or raised in captivity. These animals are a likely\nsource of new emergent infectious disease to human beings. In fact, the\nemergence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in humans in 1997 and\nin early 2003 (unpublished data) is also zoonotic. The SARS outbreak provides\nevidence to support the hypothesis that southern China could be a site for\nemerging pandemic infectious disease in the future.\nThe investigation of the infectious agent in SARS emphasises the importance\nof international collaboration as an effective strategy to control emerging\ndiseases in people, especially for those diseases with the potential to\nbecome pandemic. The lesson from SARS outbreaks associated with coronavirus\nis that we cannot ignore or underestimate the effect of a new emerging\ninfectious disease. The best way to control a new emerging infection is to\nintervene at an early stage in the outbreak.\n[Reference: Epidemiology and cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome\n(SARS) in Guangdong, People's Republic of China, in February, 2003.

It was led by Dr Antony\nDella-Porta, a WHO biosafety expert. The Panel has completed its\ninvestigation and submitted its Report to the Ministry.\nEpidemiologic Investigation\nFrom the results of its investigations, the Panel has concluded that\nthe patient most likely acquired the infection in the Environmental\nHealth Institute (EHI) laboratory where he had worked.\nInappropriate laboratory procedures and a cross-contamination of West\nNile virus samples with SARS coronavirus in the laboratory led to the\ninfection of the doctoral student. No evidence could be found of any\nother source of infection.\nThe Panel's conclusion is further supported by the results of the\ngenome sequencings on the laboratory strain of SARS coronavirus and\nthat of the patient's. Both genome sequences were found to be closely\nrelated.\nThe Panel also established that there is no evidence of secondary\ntransmission and this is an isolated case of SARS.\nBiosafety Standards\nThe Panel also reviewed the 3 existing BSL3 laboratories and found a\nlarge range of biosafety structures and practices.\nThe Panel recommended that we take the opportunity to put in place a\nnational legislative framework for ensuring international standards\nin biosafety in our laboratories. Where gaps in biosafety standards\nwere identified, the Panel has made specific recommendations to\nrectify them. The details are in their Report.\nIn particular, the Panel highlighted the need for laboratory\ncertification covering both structural integrity and operating\nprocedures. A regular audit process should also be put in place for\nall BSL3 facilities.

The results indicated that\n13 percent of the animal traders, none of whom had SARS diagnosed, had IgG\nantibody to SARS-CoV, compared with 1-3 percent of persons in 3 control\ngroups. Although the results provide indirect support for the hypothesis of\nan animal origin for SARS, they also underscore the need for detailed\npatient histories and more focused animal studies to confirm an animal\norigin for SARS.\nThe seroprevalence study was conducted by the Guangdong Center for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC) in conjunction with the Guangzhou CDC, Baiyun\nDistrict CDC, and Shijing Township Hospital. Traders in 3 animal markets in\nGuangzhou, Guangdong Province, were offered participation in the study, and\nsamples were collected on 4 May 2003 from those who gave consent. The\ntrader test results were compared with those for persons in 3 control\ngroups: 1) health-care workers involved with SARS control in 2 city\nhospitals, 2) public health workers in the Guangdong CDC facility, and 3)\nhealthy adults visiting a clinic for routine physical examinations.\nCompared with the overall control population, the animal traders were more\nlikely to be male and older; the majority of persons in both the trader and\ncontrol groups were aged 20-39 years. A sample of blood (5 mL) was drawn\nfrom each subject, and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV was tested by enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) by using the test kit (batch no. 20030501)\nmanufactured by Beijing Huada GBI Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Beijing.\nOf 792 persons tested, IgG antibody to SARS-CoV was detected in 72 (9.1\npercent). Positive rates were highest in the trader group (13.0 percent),\ncompared with the 3 control groups (range: 1.2-2.9 percent) (Table 1\nbelow). The prevalence of IgG antibody in the trader group was\nstatistically significantly higher than that of the overall control\npopulation (chi square = 26.1; p<0.01). In contrast, no statistically\nsignificant difference was determined in the prevalence of antibody\ndetected among the 3 control groups (chi square = 0.89; p = 0.64).\nAmong animal traders, the highest prevalence of antibody was found among\nthose who traded primarily masked palm civets (72.7 percent), wild boars\n(57.1 percent), muntjac deer (56.3 percent), hares (46.2 percent), and\npheasant (33.3 percent) (Table 2). The prevalence of traders with IgG\nantibody to SARS-CoV varied by market (6 percent, 11 percent, and 20\npercent, respectively; p<0.001); no correlation was found between SARS-CoV\nantibody and sex, age, or number of years worked in a live animal market.\nNone of the subjects had SARS or atypical pneumonia diagnosed during the\nGuangdong Province outbreak.\nReported by: D Yu, MD, H Li, R Xu, MPH, J He, J Lin, L Li, W Li, H Xu, S\nHuang, J Huang, Guangdong Center for Disease Control, Guangzhou, China.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\nThis study found serologic evidence suggesting that asymptomatic infection\nwith SARS-CoV or an antigenically related virus occurred in Guangdong\nProvince. Seroprevalence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV was substantially\nhigher among traders of live animals than among persons in control groups,\nconsistent with the hypothesis that SARS-CoV crossed the species barrier\nfrom animals to humans. The results are consistent with preliminary\ndeterminations of a joint research team from China's Ministry of\nAgriculture and Guangdong Province, which found that sequences of\ncoronavirus detected by polymerase chain reaction in bats, monkeys, masked\npalm civets, and snakes were identical to or similar to those of human\nSARS-CoV isolates. In addition, a joint study by Shenzhen CDC and Hong Kong\nUniversity determined that the sequence of coronavirus isolated from masked\npalm civets is 99 percent identical to human SARS-CoV (4). These\ndeterminations appear consistent with the hypothesis that an animal\nreservoir exists for SARS-CoV or an antigenically related virus; however,\nthe findings are not sufficient to identify either the natural reservoir\nfor SARS-CoV or the animal(s) responsible for crossover to humans.\nPrimary modes of SARS transmission probably are direct contact or droplet\nspread from a patient symptomatic with SARS; however, other routes of\ntransmission might exist (5). Approximately 63 percent of Guangdong\nProvince patients with clinically defined SARS had no known history of\nexposure to other SARS patients, and the percentage increased after April\n2003 (6). This trend of unknown exposure also was observed in other areas\n(7). Therefore, the possibility of unrecognized sources of infection or\ninfection from asymptomatic carriers of the virus cannot be excluded,\nalthough some patients might also have pneumonia caused by etiologies other\nthan SARS-CoV.\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. 1st,\nalthough subjects were categorized as primarily traders of the animals they\nwere selling at the time of the survey, a substantial portion traded or\nhandled more than one type of animal. 2nd, the small number of subjects\nwith reported exposure to certain types of animals limits the ability to\ndifferentiate risk among specific groups of animal traders. 3rd, although\nthe animal traders worked at 3 markets in Guangzhou, risk might differ\namong traders in other parts of Guangdong Province or elsewhere in China.\nFinally, as with other urgently developed tests, validation of the ELISA\nkit employed has not been completed, and the IgG antibody cannot\ndistinguish recent from remote infection.\nThis report provides indirect support for the hypothesis that SARS-CoV\nmight have originated from an animal source and identifies multiple animals\nfor further study. However, none of the traders in this study had SARS, and\nonly 2 SARS patients in Guangdong Province were identified as animal\ntraders (i.e., a snake seller and a pigeon seller) (6). In contrast,\ncomparative analysis of early Guangdong cases, unlinked to other SARS\ncases, indicated an overrepresentation of food handlers (6). Whether the\nantibody detected in the animal traders in this report might represent\ninfection with a related coronavirus that cross-reacts with SARS-CoV, or\nwhether that antibody provides protection from SARS, is not known. Efforts\nto identify a possible animal reservoir for SARS might benefit from prompt\nattention to collecting detailed histories from any future SARS patients\nregarding animal and other environmental exposures and initiating\ntracebacks to animal supply sources (e.g., markets, farms, and wildlife areas).\nAcknowledgments\nThis report was based on contributions by Guangzhou Municipal Center for\nDisease Control (CDC), Baiyun District CDC; Shijing Township Hospital,\nGuangdong Province; CK Lee, MD, World Health Organization (WHO)--China SARS\nTeam, Beijing, China.

Traders in 3 animal markets in\nGuangzhou, Guangdong Province, were offered participation in the study, and\nsamples were collected on 4 May 2003 from those who gave consent. 3rd, although\nthe animal traders worked at 3 markets in Guangzhou, risk might differ\namong traders in other parts of Guangdong Province or elsewhere in China. 2nd, the small number of subjects\nwith reported exposure to certain types of animals limits the ability to\ndifferentiate risk among specific groups of animal traders. Detection of SARS-like coronavirus has been reported previously in masked\npalm civets (sometimes called civet cats) and a raccoon dog for sale in a\nlive animal market in Shenzhen municipality (4). In contrast, no statistically\nsignificant difference was determined in the prevalence of antibody\ndetected among the 3 control groups (chi square = 0.89; p = 0.64). In addition, a joint study by Shenzhen CDC and Hong Kong\nUniversity determined that the sequence of coronavirus isolated from masked\npalm civets is 99 percent identical to human SARS-CoV (4). This report provides indirect support for the hypothesis that SARS-CoV\nmight have originated from an animal source and identifies multiple animals\nfor further study. Primary animal traded *: No. traders/ testing positive (No./percent) /\nrelative risk/ (95 percent CI)\n The prevalence of IgG antibody in the trader group was\nstatistically significantly higher than that of the overall control\npopulation (chi square = 26.1; p<0.01). Because its sequence data differ from those of known human coronaviruses,\nSARS-CoV is suspected to have crossed the species barrier between an animal\nhost and humans.

This single case is in a 27-year-old postgraduate medical\nstudent who worked in a virology laboratory in Singapore. The patient\ndeveloped fever, was hospitalized and isolated, and his fever has now\nresolved. Contact tracing is continuing, but it has not identified any\nsecondary cases arising from this infection.\nIt is well recognized that most viruses can cause a range of illness from\nmild to severe. The goal of WHO's SARS guidance in the post-outbreak period\nis to rapidly identify threats to global public health. Consequently, WHO's\ncase definitions are designed to provide early warning and give health\nofficials direction for responding to a new outbreak of SARS. The Singapore\ncase is mild, isolated, and has not produced secondary cases, and therefore\nis not regarded as a public health concern.\nWHO continues to applaud Singapore's public health officials for the\nopenness with which they have responded to this event and the rapid\nprecautions taken to contain a possible threat.\nSince there is a suggestion that this case may have resulted from a\nlaboratory accident, WHO will be addressing the issue of laboratory safety\nat its meeting of SARS scientific advisors in October 2003 in Geneva.\nTo conclude, in relation to SARS, Singapore continues to be a safe\ndestination for travellers, and travellers from Singapore pose no risk to\nother countries.\nThis event is not an international public health concern.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The occurrence of this single case in Singapore not only raises a number\nof questions, but it also may be an anecdotal case report providing answers\nto some other questions.\nIf this is a case of a laboratory accident, the questions raised deal with\nsafety issues for those laboratories dealing with the SARS-associated\ncoronavirus (Co-V). According to the information available, the case in\nquestion visited a laboratory that had handled the SARS Co-V 3 days prior\nto his visit. How did this infection occur?

It appears to be a single, isolated case. The patient is currently\nisolated at the Communicable Disease Centre [CDC]. Investigations are\non-going to establish the source of infection. His contacts have largely\nbeen followed up and all of them are well. As a precautionary measure, MOH\nhas served HQOs on his close contacts.\nChronology of event\nThe patient is a 27-year-old Chinese Singaporean post-doctoral student\nworking on West Nile virus at a microbiology laboratory in the National\nUniversity of Singapore (NUS). He also does some work at the Environment\nHealth Institute (EHI) laboratory of the National Environment Agency. He\nlast visited the EHI laboratory on 23 Aug 2003. He has no history of travel\nto previously SARS-affected areas and no known contact with SARS patients.\nOn 26 Aug 2003, he went to work at the NUS lab and was well but he\ndeveloped fever around midnight. On 27 Aug 2003, he consulted a general\npractitioner [GP] and was given a course of antibiotics. The fever\npersisted and he sought treatment at the SGH A&E [Emergency Department] on\n29 Aug 2003. His chest X-ray was normal. He was diagnosed to have a viral\nfever and discharged from the A&E. As he did not feel better, he consulted\na Chinese physician on 1 Sep 2003. Two days later, on 3 Sep 2003, he sought\ntreatment again at the SGH A&E and was admitted.\nFrom the time he became unwell on midnight of 26 Aug 2003 till his\nadmission to SGH on 3 Sep 2003, he remained at home apart from his two\nvisits to SGH A&E, the GP and Chinese physician.\nWhen he was admitted to the SGH, he complained of fever, muscle aches and\njoint pains, but did not have any significant respiratory symptoms. He\ndeveloped a dry cough after admission. Three serial chest X-rays at SGH\nwere all normal. However, on 8 Sep 2003, when his PCR and serology test\nresults were returned positive, the patient was transferred to the CDC for\nfurther management. He remains well.\nDiagnosis\nA repeat of his PCR tests was done in NUH lab today and was confirmed\npositive. In view of his positive PCR and serology results, MOH is treating\nhim as a probable SARS case.\nSource of infection\nInvestigations are underway to identify the patient's source of infection.\nPrecautionary measures at the laboratories\nPending investigation, the 2 laboratories have suspended all their research\nactivities. Meanwhile, the staff members of the laboratories have also been\nasked to stay at home until the all-clear is given. No staff member has\nfever or feels unwell.\nPrecautionary measures at the SGH\nAlthough the patient was isolated throughout his stay in the SGH and the\nstaff who had contact with him were in protective gear, the SGH is not\ntaking any chances and has ramped up its precautionary measures to Orange\nAlert Level. These include restrictions to visitation of the affected wards\nand more intensive temperature surveillance of staff.\nHome Quarantine Order\nGroup Number\nFamily members of case 8\nTCM [Traditional Chinese Medicine Practicioner] Sinseh 2\nSGH A&E outpatients 8\nVisitors 3\nDischarged patients 4\nTotal 25\nConclusion\nMOH has notified the WHO of the incident and the details of the case. WHO\nhas informed us that the case does not fulfill the case definition for SARS\nunder the new WHO guidelines post-SARS.\nMOH's assessment is that this case was a low public health risk as the\npatient was picked up and isolated early.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The above press release from the Singapore Ministry of Health is very\ninformative on the status of the investigation and control measures\nimplemented. The statement that the case does not meet the case definition\nfor SARS under the new WHO guidelines post-SARS refers to the guidelines\nissued by WHO on 14 Aug 2003 (available for review at:\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/postoutbreak/en/>, and covered in ProMED-mail\nposting SARS - worldwide (166): cases 20030817.2061). In this\ndocument there is the statement:\n'In the post-outbreak period, all countries must remain vigilant for the\nrecurrence of SARS and maintain their capacity to detect and respond to the\nre-emergence of SARS should it occur. The WHO case definitions during the\noutbreak period relied heavily on epidemiological criteria to increase the\nspecificity of syndromic clinical criteria for atypical pneumonia or\nrespiratory distress syndrome (RDS). However, epidemiological links to\ncases of SARS and areas reporting recent local transmission are no longer\nof use in helping to define incident cases. Furthermore, the non-specific\nclinical features of SARS, the lack of a current rapid diagnostic test that\ncan reliably detect SARS-CoV (SARS associated coronavirus) in the first few\ndays of illness, and the seasonal occurrence of other respiratory diseases,\nincluding influenza, may confound any surveillance for SARS or demand a\nlevel of quality and intensity which few health care system worldwide can\nsustain. Even with the most sophisticated surveillance systems, the first\ncase of SARS in the post-outbreak period may escape early detection.'\nThe background piece goes on to discuss recommendations for surveillance\nfor re-introduction of SARS, dividing countries into 3 groups -- those\nconsidered a Potential zone of re-emergence of SARS ('Identified as\nsource(s) of the previous outbreak in November 2002 or areas with an\nincreased likelihood of animal to human transmission of SARS-CoV infection'),\nNodal areas ('Sustained local transmission experienced during the previous\noutbreak or entry of large numbers of persons from the potential zone of\nre-emergence of SARS-CoV.') and Low risk areas ('Never reported cases,\nreported only imported cases or experienced only limited local transmission\nduring the previous outbreak.').\nThe WHO document also provides a clinical case definition for a probable\ncase of SARS as:\n'A person with a history of: Fever (= 38\u00b0C) AND One or more symptoms of\nlower respiratory tract illness (cough, difficulty breathing, shortness of\nbreath) AND Radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with\npneumonia or RDS OR autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of\npneumonia or RDS without an identifiable cause. AND No alternative\ndiagnosis can fully explain the illness.' and then provides a laboratory\ncase definition of SARS.\nThat being said, the above case described by the MOH press release does not\nmeet the full clinical case definition as there is no mention of Chest X\nRay abnormalities. Of note is that according to the description given, the\nonset of cough began sometime after admission to hospital on 3 Sep 2003, or\n6 days prior to this press release. The laboratory work presented --\nvalidation of PCR testing by the NUH laboratory and the serology results,\nis consistent with a laboratory diagnosis of infection with the SARS Co-V.\nAs we are very much on the upward slope of the learning curve with respect\nto SARS including it's full spectrum of clinical presentation, the\nepidemiology and transmission of the disease and etiologic agent, and the\nlaboratory diagnostic testing, the approach of the MOH of Singapore in\ntreating this case as a probable case, implementing control measures and\ninvestigations consistent with this being a probable case are commendable\nand highly prudent at this point in time. Singapore would classify as a\n'nodal area' where heightened surveillance is recommended. The source of\ninfection/exposure to the SARS CoV at this time is unknown, albeit the\nbackground information that this case is post-doctoral student working on\nWest Nile virus at a microbiology laboratory in the National University of\nSingapore (NUS) and also does some work at the Environment Health Institute\n(EHI) laboratory of the National Environment Agency, raises the possibility\nthat there may have been an occupational exposure in the laboratory that\nresulted in infection with the SARS CoV.\nWe await further information as it becomes available. - Mod.MPP]\n[ProMED-mail would like to thank Pablo Nart for submitting a newswire on\nthis as well. - Mod.MPP]", "summary": "The source of\ninfection/exposure to the SARS CoV at this time is unknown, albeit the\nbackground information that this case is post-doctoral student working on\nWest Nile virus at a microbiology laboratory in the National University of\nSingapore (NUS) and also does some work at the Environment Health Institute\n(EHI) laboratory of the National Environment Agency, raises the possibility\nthat there may have been an occupational exposure in the laboratory that\nresulted in infection with the SARS CoV.

SCoV-like viruses were isolated from\nHimalayan palm civets found in a live animal market in Guangdong, China.\nEvidence of virus infection was also detected in other animals, including a\nraccoon-dog, and in humans working at the same market. All the animal\nisolates retain a 29-nucleotide sequence, which is not found in most human\nisolates. The detection of SCoV-like viruses in small wild mammals in a\nlive retail market indicates a route of inter-species transmission,\nalthough the natural reservoir is not known.'\nThe following extract from the paper contains most of the important\nconclusions derived from this analysis. 'When the full genome of 2 animal\n[Himalayan palm civet] and 5 human viruses were compared, the most striking\ndifference was that these human viruses have a 29-nucleotide deletion\n(5'-CCTACTGGTTACCAACCTGAATGGAATAT -3', residue 27869 to 27897) at 246\nnucleotides upstream of the start codon of the N gene. Of human SCoV\nsequences currently available in GenBank, there was only one (GZ01) with\nthis additional 29-nucleotide sequence.\n'In addition to that, there were 43 to 57 nucleotide differences observed\nover the rest of the genome. Most of these differences were found in the S\ngene coding region. The existence of the additional 29-nucleotide sequence\nin the animal viruses results in [disruption of] open reading frames (ORFs)\n10 and 11 and merging these 2 ORFs into a new ORF encoding a putative\nprotein of 122 amino acids. This putative peptide has a high homology to\nthe putative proteins encoded by ORF10 and ORF11. Since ORF11 does not have\na typical transcription regulatory sequence for SCoV the putative ORF11\nreported by others may just be the direct result of the deletion of the 29\nnucleotide sequence. BLAST search of this peptide yields no significant\nmatch to any other known peptide. Further investigation is required to\nelucidate the biological significant of this finding.\n'When the S-gene sequences of 4 animal viruses [3 Himalayan palm civet and\none raccoon dog] were compared with 11 human SCoV viruses [HKU65806,\nUrbani, Tor 2, HKU 39849, HKU 66078, CUHK-W1, HKU 36871, GZ50, GZ01, GZ60\nand GZ43], 38 nucleotide polymorphisms were noted, with 26 of them being\nnon-synonymous changes. The S genes among the 4 animal viruses had 8\nnucleotide differences, whereas there were 20 nucleotide differences among\n11 human viruses. Thus the animal viruses, though isolated from [the same]\nmarket, are no less divergent than the human viruses isolated from Hong\nKong, Guangdong, Canada, and Vietnam. However, whereas 14 (70 per cent) of\nthe 20 polymorphisms among the human viruses were non-synonymous mutations,\nonly 2 (25 percent) of the 8 nucleotide substitutions within the animal\nviruses were. An amino acid deletion (nucleotide positions: 21690-21692)\nwas observed in 2 of the human viruses (GZ43 and GZ60). Of the 38\npolymorphisms, there were 11 consistent nucleotide signatures that appeared\nto distinguish animal and human viruses. [Phylogenetic analysis showed\nthat] the human and animal viruses [form distinct clusters], which makes it\nhighly unlikely that the isolation of SCoV-like viruses in these wild\nanimals is due to the transmission of SCoV from human to animals.\n'Our findings suggest that the markets provide a venue for the animal\nSCoV-like viruses to amplify and transmit to new hosts, including humans,\nand this is critically important from the point of view of public health.\nIt is not, however, clear whether any one or more of these animals are the\nnatural reservoir in the wild. It is conceivable that civets, raccoon dogs,\nand ferret badgers were all infected from another as-yet-unknown animal\nsource that is in fact the true reservoir in nature. However, because of\nthe culinary practices of southern China, these market animals may be\nintermediate hosts that increase the opportunity for transmission of\ninfection to humans.\n'Further extensive surveillance on animals will help to better understand\nthe animal reservoir in nature and the inter-species transmission events\nthat led to the origin of the SARS outbreak.'\n*[The full reference for this paper is as follows: Isolation and\ncharacterization of viruses related to the SARS coronavirus from animals in\nsouthern China.

'What is\nsurprising is we got positive results from mammals, from birds and from\nreptiles,' said Francois Moutou, a French expert on epidemic disease. 'This\nis very strange, because usually we don't find viruses ... affecting so many\n[different] animals,' he told a briefing in Beijing.\nAfter a week-long trip to Guangdong, where the atypical pneumonia erupted\nlate in 2002, the search for an animal carrier remains a 'work in progress,'\naccording to health officials.\nOne of the main findings by the expert group was the realization that finding\nthe origin and nature of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) may be a\nmuch more complex task than initially hoped.\n'There may be many animals that are capable of being infected, but they\nmight not be capable of transmitting the virus to people,' Hume E. Field,\nan expert from Australia's Animal Research Institute, told the briefing. The\nresearchers warned that detecting the source of the disease might take years,\nwhich means measures to curb further transmission must be undertaken before\nit is fully understood. 'Obviously we can't wait until we've got the whole\njigsaw together before action is taken,' said Field. 'So really we have to\nlook at the best information we've got at the time in terms of risk and\nrespond according to that.'\nCurbing further threats from SARS could result in restrictions on consumption\nof certain types of wildlife known to be infected, despite inconclusive data\non whether the species is capable of transmitting the sometimes-fatal illness\nto humans, he said.\nAfter SARS emerged in Guangdong province in 2002, it quickly spread to become\na global menace, leaving more than 800 dead from 8000 infections in 32\ncountries. Some 349 of the fatalities and 5327 of the infections were\nrecorded in China. Although China has formally declared victory over SARS\nand the last patients have been discharged from hospital, many in the world's\nmost populous country remain wary that the epidemic could bounce back. And\neven if the world has not seen the reemergence of SARS by New Year 2004, it\ndoes not mean the danger is entirely over, experts warned. 'We need to\nrecognize that if it doesn't return this year, that doesn't mean it will\nnever return,' Field told the briefing.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday it would train thousands\nof medical workers in China, as fears linger that SARS could strike again\nthis year once cold weather sets in. The training program is meant to\nbetter equip health workers to prevent infectious diseases from spreading\nin hospitals, said Alan Schnur, a WHO communicable diseases expert. The\ntraining program will begin in Beijing, where 193 people died from the\nepidemic earlier in 2003, and will gradually be expanded to other parts of\nChina.\nAt the height of the SARS outbreak, many people in China were scared of\ngoing to hospitals because of fears -- in some cases well-founded -- that\nsub-standard facilities made them breeding-grounds for the virus.\nThe WHO could not conclusively rule out a SARS reappearance in late autumn\nas temperatures start plunging, and stressed steps should be taken to\nprevent any potential outbreak. 'Whether or not SARS returns, China must have\na strong surveillance network already in place,' said Henk Bekedam, the WHO's\nChina representative.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 21 Aug 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: WHO SARS website [edited]\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2003/prchina2/en/>\n\nWHO Representative Office in China 21 Aug 2003\nJoint mission on SARS animal reservoir and necessary next steps\n--------------------------------------\nA joint team of specialists from the Chinese government, the World Health\nOrganization, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization\n(FAO), in China to investigate the animal reservoir of the SARS\ncoronavirus, has issued a series of recommendations and actions necessary\nnot only to identify the disease's animal reservoir, but to contain any\nfuture outbreaks.\n'We did not set out this time to find the animal reservoir for SARS, but to\nmethodically piece together the jigsaw puzzle of this disease,' says WHO's\nDr Pierre Formenty, a zoonotic disease specialist and joint leader of the\nmission. 'The fight against SARS is not over. Finding its origin will most\nlikely take years,' says Dr Formenty, 'Right now, the need for information\nis of such urgency that even limited information will be helpful in taking\nthe right control measures.

Curbing further threats from SARS could result in restrictions on consumption\nof certain types of wildlife known to be infected, despite inconclusive data\non whether the species is capable of transmitting the sometimes-fatal illness\nto humans, he said. Finding its origin will most\nlikely take years,' says Dr Formenty, 'Right now, the need for information\nis of such urgency that even limited information will be helpful in taking\nthe right control measures. The\ntraining program will begin in Beijing, where 193 people died from the\nepidemic earlier in 2003, and will gradually be expanded to other parts of\nChina. The\nresearchers warned that detecting the source of the disease might take years,\nwhich means measures to curb further transmission must be undertaken before\n The training program is meant to\nbetter equip health workers to prevent infectious diseases from spreading\nin hospitals, said Alan Schnur, a WHO communicable diseases expert. At the height of the SARS outbreak, many people in China were scared of\ngoing to hospitals because of fears -- in some cases well-founded -- that\nsub-standard facilities made them breeding-grounds for the virus. The 14 United Nations and Chinese experts visited farms and markets in\nGuangdong province in search of a possible animal carrier of the virus, and\nwere astounded to see how many different species were infected. ' After a week-long trip to Guangdong, where the atypical pneumonia erupted\nlate in 2002, the search for an animal carrier remains a 'work in progress,'\naccording to health officials. What is\nsurprising is we got positive results from mammals, from birds and from\nreptiles,' said Francois Moutou, a French expert on epidemic disease. ' We did not set out this time to find the animal reservoir for SARS, but to\nmethodically piece together the jigsaw puzzle of this disease,' says WHO's\n The World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday it would train thousands\nof medical workers in China, as fears linger that SARS could strike again\nthis year once cold weather sets in. A series of training seminars on SARS\ninfection control procedures for health care workers is scheduled for\nSeptember 2003 in Beijing and Changsha. Among the measures recommended by the joint team of specialists include the\nstrengthening of regulations in the farming, trading, and consumption of\nwildlife. We need to\nrecognize that if it doesn't return this year, that doesn't mean it will\nnever return,' Field told the briefing. While it is still unknown whether SARS will return, WHO is continuing to\nwork closely with the Chinese government to design and implement a strategy\nusing hospitals as early detection centers of SARS. The WHO could not conclusively rule out a SARS reappearance in late autumn\nas temperatures start plunging, and stressed steps should be taken to\nprevent any potential outbreak.

This achievement means that all known chains of\nperson-to-person transmission of the SARS virus have now been broken.\n'With the last known chain of transmission interrupted in Taiwan, the\nwhole world can breathe an initial sigh of relief,' said Dr David\nHeymann, the WHO Executive Director for communicable diseases. 'At\nthe same time, public health must not let down its guard, as more\ncases could still surface somewhere in the world. SARS has taught us\nthat a single case is capable of igniting an outbreak.'\n'Taiwan was unlucky. A lapse in infection control in a single\nhospital allowed the outbreak, which had been under good control, to\nescalate. But the authorities reacted quickly and appropriately. In\ndoing so, they have also strengthened capacity to deal with any\nfuture outbreaks.'\nThe last reported probable case in Taiwan, and--for the moment--in\nthe world, was detected and isolated on 15 June. Two consecutive\n10-day incubation periods have now passed with no further cases\ndetected.\nThe achievement comes just slightly more than four months since the\nvirus began moving around the world, in late February, along the\nroutes of international air travel.\nTaiwan's first case of SARS occurred in a 54-year-old businessman\nwith a travel history, in late February, to Guangdong Province,\nChina, where the earliest cases of SARS are now known to have\noccurred. The businessman was hospitalized on 8 March.\nTaiwan eventually had to cope with the third largest outbreak on\nrecord, including 674 cases and 84 deaths. The largest outbreaks\noccurred in mainland China (5327 cases and 348 deaths) and Hong Kong\n(1755 cases and 298 deaths).\nThe outbreak in Taiwan initially grew slowly, with only 23 probable\ncases detected in the first month. Of these, a single health care\nworker, a doctor, became infected when he treated the wife of the\nbusinessman. All of the earliest cases could be directly linked to\nclose contact with a SARS patient, or had a history of recent travel\nto an area where local transmission was known to be occurring. Only 4\nof the early cases resulted from secondary spread within Taiwan.\nThe outbreak began to escalate in mid-April following a lapse in\ninfection control procedures, which allowed the disease to spread\nrapidly within the hospital setting and then into the wider\ncommunity. In dealing with the emergency that followed, health\nauthorities rapidly introduced a series of sweeping measures. The\nsurveillance system was upgraded and began to deliver the kind of\ninformation needed for prompt and targeted action. Hospital\nprocedures for infection control were tightened, and a logistics\nsystem was developed to ensure the efficient delivery of protective\nequipment and other supplies.\nMass education campaigns persuaded the population to check frequently\nfor fever and report promptly at fever clinics, which greatly reduced\nthe time between onset of symptoms and isolation of patients. The\nestablishment of a mechanism for coordinating the response of all\nrelevant sectors was another key to Taiwan's success.\nThe global SARS outbreak developed quickly and dramatically, creating\nchallenging and stressful demands on staff and health authorities at\nevery outbreak site. The containment of SARS required heroic efforts\nand extraordinary measures that are difficult to sustain over time.\n'Interruption of the last known chain of person-to-person\ntransmission has come just in time. Health systems at every major\noutbreak site were strained to the limits of their capacity.' said Dr\nHeymann.\nWHO continues to receive rumours of possible cases, which indicates\nthat surveillance systems are working well. To date, all recently\nreported possible cases have been aggressively investigated and\ndetermined to have other causes.

Rationale for continued vigilance for SARS\nFirst recognized as a global threat in mid-March 2003, severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS) was successfully contained in less than 4\nmonths. On 5 Jul 2003, WHO reported that the last human chain of\ntransmission of SARS had been broken. While much has been learned about\nthis syndrome since March 2003, including its causation by a new\ncoronavirus (SARS-CoV), our knowledge about the epidemiology and ecology of\nSARS coronavirus infection and of this disease remains limited. Resurgence\nof SARS remains a distinct possibility and does not allow for complacency.\nIn the post-outbreak period, all countries must remain vigilant for the\nrecurrence of SARS and maintain their capacity to detect and respond to the\nre-emergence of SARS should it occur. The WHO case definitions during the\noutbreak period relied heavily on epidemiological criteria to increase the\nspecificity of syndromic clinical criteria for atypical pneumonia or\nrespiratory distress syndrome (RDS). However, epidemiological links to\ncases of SARS and areas reporting recent local transmission are no longer\nof use in helping to define incident cases. Furthermore, the non-specific\nclinical features of SARS, the lack of a current rapid diagnostic test that\ncan reliably detect SARS-CoV in the first few days of illness, and the\nseasonal occurrence of other respiratory diseases, including influenza, may\nconfound any surveillance for SARS or demand a level of quality and\nintensity which few health care system worldwide can sustain. Even with the\nmost sophisticated surveillance systems, the first case of SARS in the\npost-outbreak period may escape early detection.\nThis document describes a SARS alert mechanism for the post-outbreak\nperiod. It provides guidance for managing a SARS 'alert' through to\nlaboratory confirmation or exclusion of people under investigation as SARS\ncases. The document does not address complex surveillance issues or case\ncategorization for SARS.\nIt also provides guidance to clinicians on the clinical presentation,\nlaboratory and radiological findings to assist in diagnosis of SARS and in\ndecisions to implement transmission-based infection control.\n2. Risk assessment\nIdeally, each member state should determine the intensity of its\nsurveillance for SARS in the post-outbreak period on the basis of a risk\nassessment. WHO has defined 3 major areas that take into account the\nexperience during the recent outbreak of SARS and the potential for resurgence:\nPotential zone of re-emergence of SARS-CoV\nIdentified as source(s) of the previous outbreak in November 2002 or areas\nwith an increased likelihood of animal to human transmission of SARS-CoV\ninfection.\nNodal areas\nSustained local transmission experienced during the previous outbreak or\nentry of large numbers of people from the potential zone of re-emergence of\nSARS-CoV.\nLow risk areas\nNever reported cases, reported only imported cases or experienced only\nlimited local transmission during the previous outbreak.\nThus, WHO recommends a staged approach to surveillance:\nPotential zone of re-emergence of SARS\n-SARS Alert AND\n-enhanced surveillance for SARS AND\n-special studies for SARS-CoV infections in animal and human populations\nNodal areas\n-SARS Alert AND\n-enhanced surveillance for SARS\nLow risk areas\n-Surveillance for clusters of 'alert' cases among health care workers,\nother hospital staff, patients and visitors in the same health care unit\n(see section 3 \u00ad The SARS Alert)\n3. The SARS Alert\nThe SARS Alert is an operational definition to ensure that appropriate\ninfection control and public health measures are implemented until SARS has\nbeen ruled out as a cause of the atypical pneumonia or RDS.\n3.1 Objectives of the SARS Alert\nProvide early warning of the potential recurrence of SARS to:\n-rapidly implement appropriate infection control measures\n-expedite diagnosis\n-activate the public health response\nRaise a global alert if indicated\nDefinition of a SARS Alert: 2 or more health care workers in the same\nhealth care unit fulfilling the clinical case definition of SARS (see\nsection 3.3) and with onset of illness in the same 10 day period;\nOR\nhospital acquired illness in 3 or more people (health care workers and/or\nother hospital staff and/or patients and/or visitors) in the same health\ncare unit fulfilling the clinical case definition of SARS (see section 3.3)\nand with onset of illness in the same 10 day period.\nA jurisdiction may chose, based on its experience, to increase the minimum\nnumber of 'alert' cases defining a cluster. The definition of the health\ncare unit in which the cluster occurs will depend on the local situation.\nUnit size may range from an entire health care facility if small, to a\nsingle department or ward of a large tertiary hospital.\n3.2 Case description of SARS\nSee Annex 1 Clinical description of SARS. The case description provides\ndetails of the clinical evolution of SARS and radiological and laboratory\nfindings to assist clinicians with its diagnosis. It provides information\non the spectrum of the disease, including atypical presentations.\n3.3 Case Definitions\nClinical case definition of SARS\nThe following clinical case definition has been developed for public health\npurposes.\nA person with a history of:\n- fever (= 38\u00b0C)\n-AND one or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (cough,\ndifficulty breathing, shortness of breath);\n-AND radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or\nRDS OR autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of pneumonia or RDS\nwithout an identifiable cause;\n-AND no alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illness.\nLaboratory case definition of SARS\nA person with symptoms and signs that are clinically suggestive of SARS AND\nwith positive laboratory findings for SARS-CoV based on one or more of the\nfollowing diagnostic criteria:\na) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for SARS-CoV\nPCR positive using a validated method from:\nat least 2 different clinical specimens (for example, nasopharyngeal and\nstool) OR\nthe same clinical specimen collected on 2 or more occasions during the\ncourse of the illness (for example, sequential nasopharyngeal aspirates) OR\n2 different assays or repeat PCR using a new RNA extract from the original\nclinical sample on each occasion of testing.\nb) Seroconversion by ELISA or IFA\nNegative antibody test on acute serum followed by positive antibody test on\nconvalescent phase serum tested in parallel OR\nfourfold or greater rise in antibody titre between acute and convalescent\nphase sera tested in parallel.\nc) Virus isolation\nIsolation in cell culture of SARS-CoV from any specimen AND PCR\nconfirmation using a validated method. Testing should only be undertaken in\na national or regional reference laboratory as per WHO recommendations (Use\nof laboratory methods for SARS diagnosis). WHO will assist resource poor\ncountries to confirm their first cases of SARS through laboratory\ncollaboration.\n3.4 Public health management of a SARS Alert\nWhen a SARS Alert is raised:\n1. Patient(s) should be immediately isolated and transmission-based\nprecautions instituted, if not already in place (see clinical management\nguidelines)\n2. The diagnosis should be expedited (see Annex 2 Guidance regarding the\ndiagnosis of SARS in the post-outbreak period \u00ad A concern for all health\ncare workers). WHO will assist in the investigation of SARS alerts as\nappropriate, including the facilitation of access to laboratory services\n(see Annex 3 WHO Focal Points for SARS).\n3. Contacts of people under investigation for SARS should be traced and\nquarantined until SARS has been ruled out as the cause of the illness.\n3.1 A contact is a person who is at greater risk of developing\nSARS because of exposure to a SARS case. Risky exposures include having\ncared for, lived with, or having had direct contact with the respiratory\nsecretions, body fluids, and/or excretions (such as faeces) of cases of SARS.\n3.2 Individuals with risky exposures to a person or persons in a\nSARS alert cluster should be managed as contacts until SARS has been ruled\nout as the cause of the illness.\n3.3 Contact within the health care setting should be managed in\nthe following way:\nInpatient contacts should be isolated or cohorted away from unexposed\npatients and transmission-based precautions instituted. They should be\nplaced on fever surveillance. Exposed staff should be placed on active\nfever surveillance, and either cohorted to care for exposed patients (as\nabove) or placed on home quarantine depending on local circumstances.\n3.4 Community contacts should be:\n- given information on the clinical picture, transmission, etc. of SARS\n- placed under active surveillance for 10 days and voluntary home\nquarantine recommended\n- visited or telephoned daily by a member of the public health care team\n- temperature recorded daily.\n- if the contact develops disease symptoms, they should be investigated\nlocally at an appropriate health care facility.\n- the most consistent first symptom that is likely to appear is fever.\n3.5 National public health authorities should report every\nlaboratory confirmed case of SARS to WHO (see below).\nInternational reporting of SARS\nA new outbreak of SARS is defined as the occurrence of one or more\nclinically compatible, laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS in any country\nbased on definitive laboratory investigations. The reappearance of SARS in\nthe human population would be considered a global public health emergency.\nFor the purposes of the international reporting of SARS in the\npost-outbreak period, Member States are requested to inform WHO of\nlaboratory-confirmed cases only.\nLaboratory confirmed cases of SARS could be detected through a SARS alert\nverification process but also as sporadic case(s) of acute respiratory\nillness on which SARS-CoV testing was undertaken (that is, fulfil the case\ndefinition described in section 3.3). Reporting to WHO should include both\nof these scenarios but should exclude asymptomatic people with a positive\nlaboratory test or symptomatic people without laboratory confirmation. No\nnil reporting is required.\nWHO requests that member states immediately inform the focal points at\nregional offices or headquarters of every person meeting the\nlaboratory-confirmed case definition of SARS (see Annex 3 WHO Focal Points\nfor SARS).

As suspected since the height of the\noutbreak, a [novel] coronavirus is responsible for the disease. 'The\nsignificance of the paper [published online in the journal 'The Lancet' on\nTue 22 Jul 2003; see below. - Mod.CP] is confirming that this [novel]\ncoronavirus does produce very serious disease,' said Frank Plummer,\nScientific Director at the National Microbiology lab in Winnipeg. The\nresearchers [confirmed the identity of] the virus by looking at clinical\nand post-mortem samples from 436 SARS patients in 6 countries. They also\ninjected the virus into 4 macaques (a species of monkey common in Southeast\nAsia), 3 of which went on to develop SARS-like symptoms.\n'Collectively, these results of laboratory studies of SARS patients and\nexperimental infections of macaques prove that the newly discovered\nSARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the primary causal agent of\nSARS,' said the study's lead author, Prof. Albert Osterhaus of Erasmus\nUniversity, the Netherlands, in a press release.\nPlummer's team at the National Microbiology Centre was able to find\nSARS-CoV in only 60 percent of samples from SARS patients that they\nexamined. He thinks there's something else going on that scientists don't\nyet understand. One possibility is that some people listed as probable\ncases actually had something else that looked like SARS. Microbiologist Dr.\nDonald Low of Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto said that it is vital to have\na definitive diagnosis for SARS. 'That's going to help us, especially if we\nsee clusters of cases where we were able to get a number of different\nsamples and if they come back negative, being able to say this is not\nSARS.' Furthermore, SARS could be a seasonal disease, poised to return\nlater this year along with the usual cases of cold and influenza.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The Lancet paper can be accessed\nonline: <http://image.thelancet.com/extras/03art6318web.pdf>\nThe paper is entitled 'Newly discovered coronavirus as the primary cause of\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome', authored by Thijs Kuiken, Ron A M\nFouchier, Martin Schutten, Guus F Rimmelzwaan, Geert van Amerongen, Debby\nvan Riel, Jon D Laman, Ton de Jong, Gerard van Doornum, Wilina Lim, Ai Ee\nLing, Paul K S Chan, John S Tam, Maria C Zambon, Robin Gopal, Christian\nDrosten, Sylvie van der Werf, Nicolas Escriou, Jean-Claude Manuguerra,\nKlaus St\u00f6hr, J S Malik Peiris, Albert D M E Osterhaus. The Summary of the\npaper reads as follows:\n'The worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is\nassociated with a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus\n(SARS-CoV). We carried out clinical and experimental studies to assess the\nrole of this virus in the causation of SARS. We tested clinical and\npostmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in 6 countries for infection with\nSARS-CoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens. We\ninfected 4 cynomolgus macaques (_Macaca fascicularis_) with SARS-CoV in an\nattempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75 percent) of 436 patients\nfitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in\n41 (12 percent) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only\nsporadically. SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of\nSARS. The 4 SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth,\nand pharynx from 2 days after infection. 3 of 4 macaques developed diffuse\nalveolar damage similar to that in SARS patients and characterised by\nepithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline\nmembranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\nSARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and\nwas localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by\nimmunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. We conclude that\nreplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in\nhuman beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV\ninfection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that\nSARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.'\nThese data establish the principal role of the SARS-associated coronavirus\nin the causation of SARS. However, they do not exclude the participation of\nother co-factors or agents such as Human metapneumovirus, although the role\nof the latter can probably be discounted in view of its high prevalence in\nthe respiratory tract of the general population.

The question is crucial for understanding whether\nthe disease will reemerge, but so far, there's lots of dissent with no\nsolid answers.\n\nAt Dongmen market, almost everything that's vaguely edible is for sale. The\ncavernous 2-story concrete building in Shenzhen, close to the Hong Kong\nborder, houses hundreds of vendors selling live animals and seafood. Geese,\nducks, chickens, pigeons, doves, and wild birds are packed wing to wing in\nmetal cages stacked 2 and 3 high, their minders napping on top as they wait\nfor the next shopper. Nearby, rabbits are squashed in cages, and turtles\nand crabs in huge metal tubs scramble over each other.\n\nBut the market has lost some of its legendary variety. Masked palm civets,\nfor one, are missing. Before the SARS virus erupted out of nowhere in\nGuangdong last fall, eventually sweeping through Hong Kong, Beijing,\nTaiwan, and Toronto and killing more than 800 people, these distinctive\ncatlike creatures were readily available at Dongmen and similar markets\nacross the province. Restaurateurs bought them for meat, said to be tasty\nand fabled to strengthen the body against winter chills. Now, however, the\ncivets, raccoon dogs, and many of the other exotic species that are staples\nof Guangdong's eclectic cuisine are gone. Asking about civets brings either\nan amused chuckle or, occasionally, a glare and a dismissive wave of the hand.\n\nHere at Dongmen, a research team from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and\nthe Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found the\nmost intriguing leads yet about the possible origins of SARS. 2 different\nanimal species on sale here were found to harbor the virus: civets and\nraccoon dogs. Antibodies to the virus were detected in a Chinese ferret\nbadger. The government intervened, and since then, Shenzhen shopping has\nnot been the same.\n\nIf the virus does not have a reservoir or permanent hideout in animals, the\nworld can breathe a little more easily. But virologists suspect there is an\nanimal reservoir, an ecological niche in which the virus evolved and\ncontinues to thrive. 'Until we know what that source is and until steps\nhave been taken to neutralize the source, then clearly the potential [for\nthe virus to re-emerge] exists,' says Meirion Evans, an epidemiologist at\nthe Communicable Disease Surveillance Center in Cardiff, U.K., who has been\nworking with the World Health Organization (WHO) to understand the SARS\noutbreak. Despite the heightened awareness of the disease, 'the experience\nof SARS is that it doesn't take very long to break out of a local area and\ngo cross-border, if not global,' Evans adds.\n\nSo far, however, the hunt for the reservoir is yielding more confusion than\nclarity. Unlike the HKU-Shenzhen CDC investigators, a research team at the\nChina Agriculture University (CAU) in Beijing has been unable to find any\ntrace of the SARS virus in civets or dozens of other species it has\nsampled. The Beijing scientists have questioned the earlier work and\ncriticized the group for not sharing its data; the Hong Kong group has\nresponded in kind. But emerging-disease experts say that both groups could\nbe right, and the apparent discrepancy shows just how tricky the hunt for\nthe reservoir will be.\n\nA large, well-coordinated effort by multiple teams is needed to sort out\nthese questions and identify the reservoir, assert WHO officials, who last\nweek won permission from Chinese authorities to send in four teams of\nexperienced animal-virus hunters from the Netherlands, Australia, the\nUnited States, and Japan. 'Having no answers will not be good enough;\nthat's the clear message we're getting from our member states,' says Henk\nBekedam, who leads WHO's Beijing office.\n\nA WHO fact-finding mission in April 2003 picked up the first clues about\nthe origins of SARS. When the researchers were reviewing data on the\nearliest cases of an unusual form of pneumonia that had appeared in\nGuangdong between November 2002 and February of 2003, team member Evans was\nstruck by the fact that 'a fairly high proportion' of early SARS patients\nwere classified as 'food handlers,' a category that includes everyone from\nanimal wholesalers through the supply chain to cooks. In May, Evans led a\nsecond delegation that reviewed the data with Chinese epidemiologists and\nfound that 9 of 23 early patients worked in the food industry. People\nliving in the vicinity of markets were overrepresented as well. Evans also\nlearned that many restaurants in the province keep live animals on the\npremises and slaughter them as needed, a practice that could expose\nrestaurant workers to virus-laden blood and excrement. Yet, there was no\nevidence that the disease was spread by eating infected animals.\nSpeculation soon centered on Guangdong's palate for exotic fare.\n\nBy that time, several teams had fingered a previously unknown coronavirus\nas the cause of SARS. Its novel RNA sequence suggested that, unlike\ncoronaviruses normally found in pigs, cattle, chickens, or humans, this\nvirus had probably evolved in isolation for a long time before making the\nleap to humans. Realizing that the live animal markets provided fertile\ngrounds for animals and humans to swap infectious agents, Yi Guan, a\nvirologist and member of the HKU team that was among the first to identify\nthe virus, decided to investigate. With colleagues at the Shenzhen CDC, he\ndrove to the Dongmen market, just 15 minutes from the Hong Kong border. The\nteam sampled 25 animals, representing 8 exotic species.\n\nAnalyzing the samples back at their labs in Hong Kong, the researchers\nisolated a coronavirus almost identical to the human SARS virus from all 6\nmasked palm civets and from a single raccoon dog. They also detected\nantibodies to the virus, indicating prior exposure, in a Chinese ferret\nbadger. The 5 other species sampled, also tested by polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR), proved negative. Underscoring the disease link, the\nresearchers found evidence of antibodies to the SARS virus in a number of\nanimal market workers, whereas previous studies had shown that antibodies\nwere not present in the wider population. Only one difference appeared in\nthe viral RNA isolated from the market animals: It was 29 nucleotides\nlonger than RNA isolated from humans. This has fueled speculation that the\nvirus may have become more adept at propagating in humans after losing a\npiece of its genome. But the picture is complicated by the fact that\nresearchers at the Beijing Genomics Institute say they have found at least\n2 humans who were infected with the longer variety. Researchers hope\nfurther studies of each strain's characteristics -- including animal\nexperiments -- may clarify whether the minuscule difference really is\nimportant.\n\nAs had become the norm among researchers working on the SARS frontline, the\nHKU team on 23 May 2003 announced its findings at a press conference before\nsubmitting the results for scientific review. Although the team emphasized\nthat the study simply indicated a link between the virus and the exotic\nanimal trade, press reports implied that civets were spreading the disease,\nif not functioning as the hotly sought reservoir. Chinese authorities\nimmediately, although temporarily, banned hunting, selling, transporting,\nand exporting all wild animals. They also quarantined all farm-raised\ncivets in Guangdong.\n\nThen on 19 Jun 2003, a competing group at CAU held its own press conference\nto announce results from its exhaustive search for the reservoir. The\nresearchers, led by the university's vice president, agronomist Sun Qixin,\nhad cast a wide net, sampling 54 wild and 11 domestic animal species from 6\nprovinces and Beijing. Using the PCR technique, they found not a trace of\nthe SARS virus -- an apparent contradiction to the findings of the\nHKU-Shenzhen CDC team. Intrigued by Guan's report on infected animals, the\nBeijing team had paid extra attention to the masked palm civet, buying 3 of\nthem in Guangdong and another 73 wild and farmed animals elsewhere. All\nsamples were negative. (The researchers claim that they isolated a\ndifferent coronavirus from the civets, but its sequence is only 77 percent\nsimilar to that of the SARS virus.) Although the CAU researchers stop short\nof saying Guan's findings are wrong, they sharply criticize his team\nmembers for refusing to release additional details that might allow others\nto verify their claims.\n\nGuan says he will open access to the sequence data once his team's paper,\nwhich he says is now under review at [the journal] Science, is accepted.\nBut the difficulty lies in interpreting those results. Guan declines to\ndiscuss the details until the paper is published. But he emphasizes, 'We\nnever claimed that civets were the animal reservoir, nor even that civets\nwere the source of the human infection.' Guan says his findings simply\n'open the door for further investigations' to trace the chain of\ntransmission back to the source.\n\nGuan, Field, and Chen all agree that it's unlikely that civets are a\ncrucial part of the natural life cycle of the SARS virus. A more probable\nscenario, they say, is that the civets picked up the virus from another\nmore exotic animal, perhaps in the markets or holding facilities, where\nmany different species are confined in close quarters. Or these particular\ncivets could have been infected in the wild before being brought to market.\nField notes that the Nipah virus, which killed more than 100 in an outbreak\nin Malaysia in 1998 and 1999, was ultimately found to have traveled from\nits reservoir, fruit bats, through pigs to humans. A similarly circuitous\ntransmission route is likely for the SARS virus.\n\n[Byline: Dennis Normile and Martin Enserink, with reporting by Ding Yimin]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "When the researchers were reviewing data on the\nearliest cases of an unusual form of pneumonia that had appeared in\nGuangdong between November 2002 and February of 2003, team member Evans was\nstruck by the fact that 'a fairly high proportion' of early SARS patients\nwere classified as 'food handlers,' a category that includes everyone from\nanimal wholesalers through the supply chain to cooks.

It is thus of\ninterest to identify other viral infections to ensure a better assessment\nof the epidemiological situation and avoid unnecessary isolation and\ncontact tracing.\nPatients considered potential SARS cases in Switzerland were tested\nsystematically for 10 different respiratory viruses. RT-PCR for the\nSARS-associated coronavirus was negative in all cases. In contrast, other\nrespiratory virus infections were identified in 62 percent of cases\n(21/34). Influenza was the most frequent, being recovered in 14 cases (41\npercent); other viruses were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus,\nparainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus. A negative\ncoronavirus RT-PCR, together with a positive result for another respiratory\nvirus and a consistent clinical course, made it possible to avoid\nunnecessary isolations and contact tracing. Our findings are also\nconsistent with the absence of large outbreaks of SARS in Europe during\nthis period.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has provided a case definition for\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) based on travel history (or\ncontact with a known SARS case) and a spectrum of clinical symptoms in\npersons presenting with acute febrile respiratory illness. It is within the\naims of this definition to be highly sensitive and thus allow prompt\nidentification of cases. However, due to its lack of specificity, this\nstrategy has several limitations and may result in an inaccurate\ndescription of the epidemiological situation, particularly in\nlow-prevalence countries. Indeed, many common acute viral respiratory\nillnesses, such as those caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus,\nparainfluenza or human metapneumovirus, share clinical features with SARS.\nFurthermore, the spectrum of the disease following SARS-associated\ncoronavirus infection is not yet fully established, and self-limited\nrespiratory tract illnesses not fulfilling WHO criteria are likely to\noccur. Methods for the detection of SARS-associated coronavirus have only\nbeen partially validated, and RT-PCR specific assays may be negative in the\ncourse of the disease. For these reasons it is important to diagnose other\nviral aetiologies in patients with suspected SARS, to avoid both\nunnecessary investigations and quarantine.\nWe present here the results of virological investigations in potential SARS\npatients in Switzerland. Patients identified as potential SARS cases\naccording to WHO criteria, and those not fulfilling all the criteria but\npresenting with acute respiratory illness and either a recent travel\nhistory in a country or in an affected area or a documented contact with a\nsuspected SARS case, were tested for a wide range of viruses in upper\nrespiratory tract samples (nasopharyngeal swabs). Nasopharyngeal specimens\nwere inoculated for virus culture on 6 different cell lines (human\nfibroblast, A549, MDCK, LLC-MK2, Rita and Vero cells) in tubes and\nincubated at 2 different temperatures (37 deg C and 33 deg C). RNA was\nextracted from 200 ml of each specimen using 400 ml lysis buffer (HCV\nAmplicor Specimen Preparation Kit, Roche Diagnostics Corporation,\nIndianapolis, ID). Retrotranscription was performed using the SuperscriptTM\nII RNase H\u00ad Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Switzerland) and random\nprimers (dN)6 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) for 60 minutes at 42 deg C.\nReal-time TaqmanPCR (ABI Prism 7900 HT, Applied Biosystems, Switzerland)\nwas performed for detection of respiratory viruses using specific primers\nand probes validated in our laboratory.\nScreening for the presence of the following viral RNA genomes was conducted\n(target gene in brackets): influenza A (M gene) and B (haemagglutinin\ngene), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (N gene), parainfluenza 1 and 2\n(haemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene), human metapneumovirus (polymerase\ngene), rhinovirus (5\u0092 non-coding-region) and enterovirus (5\u0092 non-\ncoding-region), and the SARS-associated coronavirus (polymerase gene). The\nfollowing primers and probe were used for SARS-associated coronavirus\ndetection: forward 5\u0092-TCACCGCGAAGAAGCTATT-3\u0092; reverse\nAGTTGCATGACAGCCCTCTACA- 3\u0092; and probe 5\u0092CGTTCGTGCGTGGATTGGCTTTG-3\u0092 based on\navailable sequences of the polymerase gene [7, 8]. In preliminary\nexperiments this assay proved capable of detecting fewer than 10 RNA\ncopies/mL. Positive and negative controls were included in each run.\nIn Switzerland during the first 6 weeks of surveillance following the WHO\nSARS alert, we identified 34 subjects with a median age of 36 years (range\n2 to 81), comprising 20 males and 14 females. On the basis of WHO criteria,\n3 cases were probable SARS, 16 were suspect cases, and in 15 the diagnosis\nof SARS was considered, but the WHO criteria were not met. All patients\nrecovered without suffering severe disease. RT-PCR for detection of the\nSARS-associated coronavirus proved negative in all subjects (median day 4\nof illness, range 1 to 9). In contrast, other respiratory virus infections\nwere identified in 62 percent (21/34). Among the 19 suspected or probable\nSARS cases according to WHO criteria, a virus was identified in 11 (59\npercent). In the overall population influenza viruses were identified in 14\ncases (41 percent), rhinovirus in 3, respiratory syncytial virus in 1,\nparainfluenza 1 in 1, human metapneumovirus in 1 and adenovirus in 1.\nRT-PCR for enterovirus and parainfluenza 3 were all negative. Among the 21\npositive cases, 11 were identified by RT-PCR only, 2 by cell culture only\n(parainfluenza 1 and adenovirus), and the remaining 8 by both methods\nconcomitantly.\nOur study showed that all subjects with suspected SARS in Switzerland\ntested negative for the SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR. However,\nfollowing extensive testing, a viral aetiology was documented in the\nmajority of cases. Although a viral aetiology was likely in most of the\nremaining cases, we failed to identify a virus. This limited sensitivity\nwas related to several reasons including the delay between the onset of\nsymptoms and the time of sampling, and the type of the specimen.\nAs some recent observations suggest that RT-PCR may be negative in the\ncourse of SARS, it is essential to provide an alternative diagnosis to SARS\nif a negative result is obtained. In our series a negative RT-PCR together\nwith a positive result for another respiratory virus and a consistent\nclinical course made it possible to avoid unnecessary isolations,\ninvestigations, and contact tracing. In addition, in some instances\nsuspicion of local secondary transmission of SARS could be ruled out when\ninfluenza was documented in the index case. The epidemiological situation\ncould be better evaluated, since the number of cases remaining suspect for\nSARS was considerably reduced. Influenza virus was the most frequent cause\nof respiratory illness in this population, an observation consistent with\nthe fact that the SARS alert coincided with the peak of the influenza\noutbreak in Switzerland. However, since the majority of cases reported\nrecent travel to Asia, this observation also demonstrates the risk of\nacquiring influenza and other respiratory viruses abroad and their capacity\nfor subsequent transmission locally. Finally, our findings are consistent\nwith the observation that during this period SARS did not cause serious\noutbreaks in Europe.\n[The technical support of Delphine Garcia and Marianne Perroud is\nacknowledged.]\n--\nChris Griot\n<Christian.Griot@ivi.admin.ch>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 9 Sep 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: NY Times 9 Sep 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/09/health/policy/09SARS.html>\n\nOutbreak That Wasn't: A SARS False Alarm\n----------------------------\nIt seemed like the typical viral 'summer cold' as it began spreading\nthrough a nursing home in the Vancouver area in early July. Then in August,\ntest results from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory suggested\nthat the 'cold' might be from a mutated SARS coronavirus.\nJust the hint created deep concerns in a country that had already been\nhobbled by an outbreak in Toronto last spring. British Columbia officials\ntemporarily imposed infection control and quarantine measures that had\ncontained the Toronto outbreak.\nThe disruptive and costly actions turned out to be excessive. British\nColumbia officials have since determined that the SARS coronavirus did not\ncause the outbreak. Rather, they said, its virological cousin, the OC43\ncoronavirus, which commonly causes colds, was the probable culprit.\nDisputes among Canadian officials over the virological findings have\nexposed deep flaws in the systems available to detect and monitor any\npotential outbreak in Canada and elsewhere. Not only did they underscore\nthe need for more uniform laboratory testing, but also prompted health\nofficials to renew calls for reliable tests to detect SARS, or severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome, in its earliest stages of infection.\n'The safety net for detecting the possible return of SARS is pretty\nfragile,' said Dick Thompson, a spokesman for the World Health\nOrganization, the United Nations agency in Geneva with responsibility for\ncontrolling the disease. 'It holds together, but it is spit and luck.'\nExamination of the disputed findings in Canada is also occurring as the\nworld is bracing for the possible resurfacing of SARS. A recent report from\nthe United States National Intelligence Council \u0097 which consists of experts\nfrom the academic and private sectors and which reports to the director of\ncentral intelligence, George J. Tenet \u0097 lays out 3 bleak possible\nsituations for the virus's re-emergence.\nThe 3 situations outlined in the report are disconcerting. One is a\nresurgence in countries with major trade centers as international travelers\nspread SARS the way they did this year. A second is that SARS cases will\noccur sporadically but will be detected before the disease can spread,\ncreating more of a public health nuisance than a crisis. The third unfolds\nin developing countries with weak public health systems.\nAll make early detection a priority. Canadian and United States health\nofficials and SARS experts are expected to discuss what steps may reliably\nbe taken to identify possible new SARS cases, among other topics, at a\n2-day closed meeting in Ottawa that begins tomorrow.\nTo some health officials, the outbreak at the Kinsmen Place Lodge nursing\nhome in Surrey, British Columbia, has not only revealed important gaps that\nneed to be addressed, but it may also provide lessons that can be used in\nthe face of a recurrence of SARS.\n'In a way, it was lucky that this outbreak happened before the influenza\nseason because it is better to learn about the problems now than then,'\nsaid Dr. Katrin Leitmeyer, a W.H.O. epidemiologist and virologist who went\nto the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg to review its findings.\nOne of the most glaring problems uncovered by the nursing home outbreak was\nthe absence of a formal agreement among scientists about precisely what\nsteps and laboratory methods should be used to make a definitive diagnosis\nof SARS.\nFor example, many test results remain in dispute, largely because the\nscientists involved in different laboratories did not use the same methods\nto test each specimen to try to identify the virus and to determine whether\nthe patients' immune systems had produced antibodies against it. And partly\nbecause little is left of the specimens collected from the nursing home\npatients, it will take weeks more to prove that the suspected OC43\ncoronavirus, is the cause.\nThe conflicting laboratory results have led Canadian scientists and\nofficials to clash over the validity and meaning of the tests performed on\nthe lodge residents and staff members.\n'We're at loggerheads with the National Microbiology Laboratory,' said Dr.\nMel Krajden, the chief virologist at the British Columbia Center for\nDisease Control.\nThe center's chief epidemiologist, Dr. David Patrick, said that from 1 Jul\n2003 through 5 Aug 2003, 95 of the 142 lodge residents, or 67 percent,\ndeveloped the summer cold and that 8 deaths were related to the outbreak.\nOf the 160 health workers there, 53, or 33 percent, developed the summer flu.\nInitially, Dr. Krajden's team found no evidence of viruses like influenza,\nparainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus that are common causes of\nupper respiratory illness.\nSARS was low on the candidate list because the death rate among lodge\nresidents was 8 percent, far lower than the rate of 50 percent or more\nfound among people 60 and older in the SARS epidemic last spring.\nBut when a second wave struck the nursing home and the center still could\nnot identify a virus, health officials reconsidered SARS. 'So, having come\nup empty-handed, we said why not send some of the very limited remaining\nmaterials to' the national laboratory, Dr. Krajden said.\nIt was a step that many laboratories less concerned about the threat of\nSARS might not have taken under the same circumstances, health officials said.\nThe surprise came when Dr. Frank Plummer, the director of the National\nMicrobiology Laboratory, said that his team had found tentative evidence of\nwhat might be a mutant SARS virus.\nThen on 22 Aug 2003, provincial officials said the latest findings from the\nBritish Columbia Center for Disease Control and the British Columbia Cancer\nAgency's Genome Sciences Center 'provide conclusive evidence' that the\nvirus responsible for the nursing home outbreak was not the SARS\ncoronavirus, but probably its cousin, OC43.\n'We have clearly found large sequences of the virus that are not present in\nthe SARS coronavirus,' Dr. Patrick said.\nLast week, Dr. Larry J. Anderson, an expert on respiratory diseases at the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta, said his team\nhad completed tests to detect antibodies to the SARS virus in the blood\nspecimens sent by Dr. Plummer. The CDC tests did not confirm the Canadian\nNational Microbiology Laboratory findings that SARS antibodies were present.\nDr. Plummer said he agreed that the virus was not the classic SARS virus,\nbut that his team had found no evidence of OC43.\n'We do not dispute their results, but we also believe our results,' Dr.\nPlummer said. 'Now what produced them is a puzzle.'\nAmong the possible explanations for the conflicting results is that 2 or\nmore viruses were simultaneously affecting the nursing home. Another\npossibility is that the specimens from the lodge were inadvertently\ncontaminated with SARS virus in the Winnipeg laboratory. Dr. Plummer said\nhe considered that unlikely because of the pattern of his test findings.\n'All these diagnostic tests are new and every laboratory has developed its\nown test,' he said.\n'We have a limited understanding of their performance, so comparing what\none laboratory is talking about to another is problematic,' Dr. Plummer\nsaid. 'This is obviously new territory for all of us. We are probably at a\nnormal state of development for a disease that has been around for a few\nmonths, and we will be learning every time one of these things happen.'\nThe Canadian laboratories have not succeeded in growing the nursing home\nvirus and then fully mapping its genome -- 2 findings that would provide\nthe most definitive evidence of the causative agent. But virologists say\nthat growing the coronavirus apparently involved in the nursing home\noutbreak is more difficult than growing the SARS virus in the laboratory.\nThe threat of SARS may prompt several changes in laboratory practices,\nvirologists said. For example, diagnostic laboratories rarely include\ncoronaviruses in screening tests for the cause of outbreaks of respiratory\nillness because they generally cause mild illness and because budgets\npreclude searching for every virus.\n'No one ever cared that much,' said Dr. Kathryn V. Holmes, a professor of\nmicrobiology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver\nwho has studied coronaviruses for 20 years.\nDr. John MacKenzie, an Australian virologist who is temporarily helping WHO\ndeal with the threat of SARS and other emerging diseases, said the nursing\nhome episode pointed out 3 major worries about laboratory testing for SARS\nthat an advisory panel of WHO would need to address in October.\nOne is the lack of quality assurance. The various methods have not been\ntested in different laboratories under different conditions, Dr. MacKenzie\nsaid, and 'this is a big concern.'\nSecond, there is no internationally accepted standardization of the\nbiological materials known as reagents used in testing in different\nlaboratories. Dr. MacKenzie said he was particularly concerned about the\nlack of standardization of the control tests, which play a routine part in\nlaboratory testing.\nThird, Dr. MacKenzie said, 'we need to look very carefully at what we do if\nwe have a positive case.'\n'What's crucial is that a second laboratory, preferably an international\nreference laboratory outside the country that found the positive, confirms\nthe tests,' Dr. MacKenzie said. 'Some countries are not keen on this,' he\nadded, yet 'it is a major issue.'\nAt the October meeting, he said, 'We're going to go into detail about what\nis known, what isn't known, what needs to be done, and then prioritize some\nthings that need to be looked at.'\nBut because the WHO meeting will not be held until late October, it may be\ntoo late to be effective, Mr. Thompson, the agency spokesman,\nacknowledged. By then the Northern Hemisphere may be experiencing the\nusual seasonal outbreaks of influenza and other respiratory illnesses.\nUnder such circumstances, the continuing lack of a reliable diagnostic test\nfor SARS could create chaos from the continuing inability to distinguish\nSARS from other illnesses that, by coincidence, were producing similar\nsymptoms like fever, headache and cough.\n[By: Lawrence K.

A negative\ncoronavirus RT-PCR, together with a positive result for another respiratory\nvirus and a consistent clinical course, made it possible to avoid\nunnecessary isolations and contact tracing. Not only did they underscore\nthe need for more uniform laboratory testing, but also prompted health\nofficials to renew calls for reliable tests to detect SARS, or severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome, in its earliest stages of infection. For example, diagnostic laboratories rarely include\ncoronaviruses in screening tests for the cause of outbreaks of respiratory\nillness because they generally cause mild illness and because budgets\npreclude searching for every virus.

In our series a negative RT-PCR together\nwith a positive result for another respiratory virus and a consistent\nclinical course made it possible to avoid unnecessary isolations,\ninvestigations, and contact tracing. Influenza virus was the most frequent cause\nof respiratory illness in this population, an observation consistent with\nthe fact that the SARS alert coincided with the peak of the influenza\noutbreak in Switzerland.

However, since the majority of cases reported\nrecent travel to Asia, this observation also demonstrates the risk of\nacquiring influenza and other respiratory viruses abroad and their capacity\nfor subsequent transmission locally. Nasopharyngeal specimens\nwere inoculated for virus culture on 6 different cell lines (human\nfibroblast, A549, MDCK, LLC-MK2, Rita and Vero cells) in tubes and\nincubated at 2 different temperatures (37 deg C and 33 deg C).

Most acute viral respiratory illnesses share clinical features with severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and detection of the SARS-associated\ncoronavirus may be negative in the course of the disease. Initially, Dr. Krajden's team found no evidence of viruses like influenza,\nparainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus that are common causes of\nupper respiratory illness. Indeed, many common acute viral respiratory\nillnesses, such as those caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus,\nparainfluenza or human metapneumovirus, share clinical features with SARS. Influenza was the most frequent, being recovered in 14 cases (41\npercent); other viruses were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus,\nparainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus.

Another mystery is why the SARS virus spreads more efficiently in\nsophisticated hospital settings -- another factor that may have\ncontributed to the severity of Toronto's outbreak. \nWHO has today removed Toronto, Canada, from its list of areas with\nrecent local transmission of SARS.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "sars"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2003-04-23 00:00:00", "2003-06-12 00:00:00", "2003-02-21 00:00:00", "2003-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-05-26 00:00:00", "2003-05-14 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Toronto", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "Hong Kong"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Singapore", "country": "Singapore"}, {"location": "Taiwan", "country": "Taiwan"}, {"location": "Guangdong Province", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "Vietnam"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2204056", "headline": "PRO/EDR> SARS - Worldwide (158): cases", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2204056", "date": "2003-06-27 23:50:00", "main_text": "SARS - WORLDWIDE (158): CASES\n*****************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\n**NO NEW REPORTS OF PROBABLE CASES WORLDWIDE**\n\nDate: 27 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: WHO SARS website\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/2003_06_27/en/>\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_27/en/>\n\n[According to the WHO daily summary of reported cases, there were no\nreports of probable cases of SARS worldwide for 27 Jun 2003.

Without such an understanding, predictions of the future evolution\nof the outbreak including its end cannot be made with certainty.\nThe SARS coronavirus was detected within a month by a virtual network of\nlaboratories, working around the clock. The complete sequencing of the\nvirus genome followed almost immediately.\nThese breakthroughs have supported progress in the development of\ndiagnostic tests and greatly facilitated the investigation of unusual\noutbreaks, such as the Amoy Gardens housing cluster that affected more than\n320 persons in late March 2003. They also facilitated initial efforts to\nlink an animal species with the first human cases, which were detected in\nsouthern China in mid-November of last year [2002].\nFurther progress in the scientific understanding of SARS will depend on\ncontinued international collaboration. WHO is establishing an additional\nnetwork to expedite much-needed animal studies.\nWHO also intends to monitor the effects of patents and patent applications\non the speed with which SARS diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines are\ndeveloped and made available for use, and on the manner in which prices are\nset for these technologies.\nAt the moment, it is too early to know all the effects that the patenting\nof SARS-related discoveries will have. However, the filing of patent\napplications does not in itself erect any barriers to continued scientific\ncollaboration on SARS.\nThe defensive use of patents can be a legitimate part of a researcher's\nefforts to make a discovery, and related discoveries in the future, widely\navailable to other researchers, in the best collaborative tradition of\nbiomedical science.\nIn the longer term, the manner in which SARS patent rights are pursued\ncould have a profound effect on the willingness of researchers and public\nhealth officials to collaborate during future outbreaks of new infectious\ndiseases.\nWHO will therefore examine whether the terms of reference for such\ncollaborations need to be modified to ensure that the credit for any\nintellectual property developed is appropriately attributed, that revenues\nderived from licensing such property are devoted to suitable uses, and that\nlegitimate rewards for innovative efforts do not impose undue burdens on\nefforts to make tests, therapies, and preventive measures available to all.\nAs SARS has clearly demonstrated, the appearance of a new disease in a\nhighly mobile, interconnected, and interdependent world can have serious\nrepercussions outside the health sector and far beyond the areas worst hit\nby the outbreak.

In an observational study of 556\npeople screened for SARS in Hong Kong, Timothy Rainer and colleagues found\nthat the best predictor of SARS was radiological evidence of pneumonic\nchange, which often preceded the onset of fever. The main discriminatory\nsymptoms in the early stages of the disease were fever, chills, malaise,\nmyalgia, and rigor -- not respiratory tract symptoms, as stated in the WHO\nguidelines.

However, this is a single study based on\npatients presenting at a single hospital.

The\ngroup will draw on data from all the main outbreak sites.\n'WHO regards an improved diagnostic test as a top priority,' said David\nHeymann, WHO's executive director for communicable diseases. 'The next\ninfluenza season will result in a large number of patients with symptoms\neasily confused with SARS. In addition to a good diagnostic test, a more\nprecise and sensitive case definition is absolutely essential to keep\nhealth services from being overwhelmed. We will be producing this as an\ninternational collaborative effort, based on the best available evidence.'\nDr Heymann estimates that SARS surveillance will need to continue for at\nleast a year. WHO recommendations for surveillance and reporting are also\nbeing revised for this second phase, which moves from an emergency response\nto sustainable vigilance.\nHong Kong close to being removed from list\nOn Sunday 22 June, 20 days will have passed since the last probable case of\nSARS in Hong Kong was placed in isolation on 2 June. If no new cases are\ndetected over the weekend, Hong Kong will be removed from the list of areas\nwith recent local transmission on Monday.\nBoth WHO and health authorities in Hong Kong are taking a cautious approach\nto what would be a very significant achievement in the history of SARS\ncontrol. WHO was given details today about a suspect SARS case who has been\nin isolation since 9 June. The results of 3 PCR tests have been negative.\nSerology tests, conducted 20 days after the onset of symptoms, have also\nbeen negative.\nToday's report on this case confers another layer of assurance that\nsurveillance remains intense and that new cases continue to be quickly\ndetected and isolated. As Hong Kong scientists and laboratories rank among\nthe best in the world, WHO has full confidence that the case in question is\nnot SARS.\nRemoval from the list means that the chain of person to person transmission\nhas been broken, thus eliminating the risk of infection for both local\nresidents and travellers. On 2 April, WHO advised the public to consider\npostponing all but essential travel to Hong Kong. That recommendation was\nremoved more than 7 weeks later, on 23 May. Travel recommendations are\npresently in place only for Beijing, China.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[While the BMJ paper is only one study, the finding of a sensitivity of 26\nper cent would suggest that a more sensitive case definition should be used\nfor screening purposes (for example, to determine which patients should be\nplaced in respiratory isolation and which should receive further testing).\nAs the WHO commentary points out, any such broadening of the case\ndefinition will necessarily reduce the specificity of the definition until\nbetter rapid testing methodologies become available. - Mod.LM]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\nDate:20 Jun 2003\n An article published in this week's British Medical Journal (BMJ) has\nquestioned whether the WHO case definitions for suspected and probable SARS\nare adequate to pick up infected cases at the earliest stage when patients\nare said to be most infectious <http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7403/1354>.\n [While the BMJ paper is only one study, the finding of a sensitivity of 26\nper cent would suggest that a more sensitive case definition should be used\nfor screening purposes (for example, to determine which patients should be\nplaced in respiratory isolation and which should receive further testing).

In an observational study of 556\npeople screened for SARS in Hong Kong, Timothy Rainer and colleagues found\nthat the best predictor of SARS was radiological evidence of pneumonic\nchange, which often preceded the onset of fever.

Only Toronto and Taiwan continue to experience chains\nof local transmission, and these outbreaks are likewise being brought close\nto containment.\nAfter almost 4 months, the global public health emergency caused by the\nsudden appearance and rapid spread of SARS is coming to an end.\nThe SARS virus, a new and unique member of the coronavirus family, first\nemerged in mid-November [2002] in southern China. One of the key questions\nnow is whether SARS \u0096 pushed out of its new human host as chains of\ntransmission are broken \u0096 will return.\nThe question arises because of the behaviour of other comparatively new and\npoorly understood viruses, including those that cause the Ebola and Marburg\nhaemorrhagic fevers. These viruses periodically surface to cause outbreaks,\nusually limited to a defined geographical area, and then fade away to hide\nin some animal or environmental reservoir until conditions again become\nripe for spread to humans.\nThe question of whether SARS will likewise resurface must remain open\npending better understanding of the circumstances that allowed the new\ndisease to emerge. The SARS virus is thought to have jumped to humans from\nsome animal or environmental source.\nMany new viruses that jump from animals to humans, including the Nipah,\nHendra, and hanta viruses, do not spread efficiently from one person to\nanother and thus do not cause large and sustained outbreaks with a\npotential for rapid international spread. The SARS virus, however, spreads\nreadily from person to person. Factors in the hospital environment have\nworked to amplify this efficient transmission considerably. In addition,\nthough SARS has a high case fatality (around 15 percent), it allows enough\nof its victims to survive long enough to spread the disease to others \u0096 an\neffective survival strategy for a new virus.\nThe WHO scientific coordinator for SARS, Dr Klaus Stohr, is presently in\nChina working together with scientists there to develop and prioritize a\nSARS research agenda. Research on the origins of the SARS virus is expected\nto top the agenda.\nIn the meantime, WHO has good reason to believe that, should SARS resurface\nlater this year, the global impact will be milder than experienced during\nthe initial global emergency. 5 reasons support this view.\nFirst, the world\u0092s public health systems have demonstrated their capacity\nto move quickly into a phase of high alert. The prompt detection and\nisolation of imported cases in African and India are good examples of both\nthe level of vigilance and its effectiveness in preventing further spread.\nSome of the former SARS hotspots, including Hong Kong and Singapore, plan\nto maintain a high level of vigilance, supported by measures for screening\nand detection, until at least the end of the year.\nSecond, the world knows what to do. Control measures, though centuries old,\nhave demonstrated their capacity to completely halt outbreaks, as most\nrecently seen in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Beijing.\nThird, the intensive research effort currently under way can be expected to\nimprove scientific understanding of SARS and yield better control tools,\nmost notably a rapid and reliable point-of-care diagnostic test.\nFourth, resolutions adopted during the May World Health Assembly have\nstrengthened WHO\u0092s capacity to respond to outbreaks in important ways. In\neffect, these resolutions allow WHO to move from a passive reliance on\nofficial government notifications to a proactive role in warning the world\nas soon as evidence indicates that an outbreak poses a threat to\ninternational public health.\nFinally and perhaps most importantly, SARS has underscored the importance\nof immediately and fully disclosing cases of any disease with the potential\nfor international spread. In the present climate of opinion, influenced by\nthe lessons learned from SARS, it appears unlikely that any country would\nchoose to conceal cases, should SARS resurface. In addition, SARS is simply\ntoo big a disease to hide for long.\nFor these reasons, WHO is optimistic that, should SARS return, it will not\ndo so with a vengeance.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 26 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/cn-cc/numbers.html>\nThe cumulative number of probable and suspected cases reported by Health\nCanada has not changed from yesterday's posting.

'It's a\nworry. It's an important thing to try to figure out why, (and) what this\nmeans,' said scientific director Dr Frank Plummer.\nThe Winnipeg lab, in conjunction with Ontario officials and public health\nauthorities in the locations where the individuals live, is beginning a\nstudy to track down the people, their doctors, and their contacts to ensure\nthat other SARS cases aren't simmering, undetected, in Toronto and other\nsouthern Ontario communities.\n'Look what happened at North York,' said leading SARS expert Dr Donald Low,\nreferring to North York General Hospital, the epicentre of Toronto's second\nSARS outbreak. 'There was a cluster in a family that wasn't recognized.\nMaybe there's a cluster in Belleville that we just haven't recognized.'\nEven if further study shows that no new clusters are simmering, the\nfindings suggest Ontario must have dodged a few SARS bullets, the experts\nadmit.\nCanada has officially recorded 245 probable and 193 suspect cases of SARS\nsince the disease hit these shores in late February, the vast majority in\nthe Toronto area. One of the puzzling positive test results that Plummer's\nlab has turned up was for a woman from Belleville, which is why Low\nreferred to that city, about 2 hours drive east of Toronto. Another was for\na man from the Grey Bruce area, north of Toronto, who had been listed as a\nsuspect SARS case in March. The man, who had been believed to have\ncontracted SARS in Singapore, was eventually struck from the list when it\nwas found he had influenza B, which could have caused his symptoms. But\nPlummer's lab recently informed his local medical officer of health that\nthe man probably had SARS as well.\nThat case and another like it at North York General suggest it may be time\nto again rewrite the definitions of probable and suspect SARS, Low said. A\npsychiatric patient at North York who appeared to have SARS in April but\nwho was not known to have been in contact with a SARS case was eventually\nruled out when lab tests showed he had mycoplasma, a pathogen that causes\npneumonia. Weeks later blood tests revealed the man also had SARS.\nThe current definitions allow authorities to rule out a case if another\nreasonable diagnosis is discovered. The North York and Grey Bruce cases\nsuggest that that's no longer an option, Low said, noting that 10 to 15 per\ncent of community acquired pneumonias are caused by more than one agent.\n'It's naive to think to think that people only have infection with one\norganism. It's naive to think that because somebody has influenza B that\nthey couldn't have SARS,' he said. Since the SARS outbreak began, the\nWinnipeg lab has been working overtime, processing samples submitted from\nabout 2100 people so far.\nPlummer doesn't have enough information on each individual case to\ndetermine whether these 120 people are false positives, people who were\ninfected but whose symptoms were so mild they didn't meet case definitions\nor actual SARS cases who somehow slipped through public health's nets. He\ndoesn't even know if they all would have been quarantined, though some,\nlike the Grey Bruce man, definitely were. Dr Andrew Simor, chief\nmicrobiologist at Toronto's Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences\nCentre, said testing done by their lab corroborates the Winnipeg lab's\nfindings. 'Of course of most importance is are these people who are\npotentially infectious? And to this point in time, I'm not aware that any\nof these people ... have actually been responsible for transmission of\ndisease. And ultimately that's what's most important.'\nBut public health officials cannot afford to assume that just because they\nhaven't identified that kind of below-the-radar transmission doesn't mean\nit hasn't happened.\n[byline: Helen Branswell]\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\nInstructor in Surgery (Bioengineering)\nHarvard Medical School\n51 Blossom Street, Room 422\nBoston, MA 02114 USA\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[Many details are unavailable from this newswire report: the methodology of\ntesting (presumably serology, IgM, IgG?, threshold for positivity), the\ndenominator (that is, the total number of tests done of which 120 were\npositive), the population from which they were drawn (community-acquired\natypical pneumonia cases?), any contact or clinical data, and so forth.\nWhile the law of parsimony is often cited in clinical medicine, it is true\nthat it is very possible to have multiple simultaneous infections -- indeed\nsome respiratory infections predispose to others.

Update 86 - Hong Kong removed from list of areas with local\ntransmission 23 Jun 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_23/en/>\nWHO has today removed Hong Kong from its list of areas with recent\nlocal transmission of SARS. 20 days, which is twice the maximum\nincubation period, have passed since the last case was isolated on 2\nJun 2003.\nWhen 20 days have passed since removal of the last case from the\ncommunity at large, the chain of human-to-human transmission is\nconsidered broken, thus eliminating the risk of infection for both\nlocal residents and travellers.\n'This is a very significant achievement,' said Dr David Heymann,\nExecutive Director of Communicable Diseases at WHO. 'Hong Kong, with\nits dense population and fluid border with China, had one of the\nhardest outbreaks to control. This success means that the whole world\ncan now feel safer from the SARS threat.'\nSARS was first carried out of southern China into Hong Kong, and then\non to Hanoi, Toronto, and Singapore in late February. Some 16\nvisitors and guests to the ninth floor of a Hong Kong hotel became\ninfected through contact, in ways that remain mysterious, with a\nsymptomatic medical doctor from Guangdong Province, who stayed in the\nhotel's room 911. The index case for Hong Kong's first outbreak, in\nthe Prince of Wales Hospital, visited an acquaintance staying on the\nsame floor during the critical days in February. Additional clusters\nwere also subsequently linked to the hotel.\nSARS had not yet been identified as a dangerous new disease when the\noutbreak hit Hong Kong's hospitals. Doctors and nurses, unaware of\nthe need to isolate patients and protect themselves, became the first\nvictims as they struggled to save lives. In a particularly\nunfortunate incident, the index patient at Prince of Wales, admitted\non 4 Mar 2003, was treated 4 times daily with a jet nebulizer, which\nprobably aerosolized the virus and greatly increased opportunities\nfor spread.\nIn late March [2003], Hong Kong suffered a major setback when a\nlarge cluster, eventually numbering more than 300, of almost\nsimultaneous new cases was traced to a single building in the Amoy\nGardens housing state. That event, which raised the possibility of an\nenvironmental source of infection or even airborne spread of the\nvirus, was investigated by teams of local specialists. The outbreak\nwas attributed to an 'unlucky' convergence of environmental\nconditions that allowed the contamination of vertically-linked\napartments. This conclusion, subsequently confirmed by additional\nstudies, calmed fears that the SARS virus might be airborne.\nFrom the day when the first cluster of cases was recognized, Hong\nKong officials have provided open, honest, and abundant information\nabout SARS to both the public and the media. Hong Kong also benefited\nfrom the contribution of its outstanding scientists, epidemiologists,\nand clinicians, who were at the forefront of efforts to track down\nsource cases in the various clusters, identify the causative agent,\ndevelop diagnostic tests, and work out treatment protocols.\nFaced with the largest outbreak outside mainland China, Hong Kong\nalso pioneered many of the control measures used to successfully\ncontain smaller outbreaks elsewhere. It is gratifying that these\nmeasures have now brought Hong Kong to the point of victory over the\nvirus, although continued vigilance remains vital.\nOn 2 Apr 2003, WHO advised the public to consider postponing all but\nessential travel to Hong Kong. That recommendation was removed more\nthan 7 weeks later, on 23 May 2003.\nC. Update 87 - World Health Organization changes last remaining\ntravel recommendation -- for Beijing, China 24 Jun 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_24/en/>\nEffective today, the World Health Organization (WHO) is removing its\nrecommendation that people should postpone all but essential travel\nto Beijing, China. Beijing was the last area in the world to which\nthis advice still applied.\nThe recommendation to consider postponing all but essential travel to\nBeijing was issued on 23 Apr 2003 in order to minimize the\ninternational spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). WHO\nis changing this recommendation as the situation in the Chinese\ncapital has now improved significantly. The last new case in Beijing\nwas isolated on 29 May 2003, since when a number of suspect cases\nhave been considered but ruled out as SARS. No cases have recently\nbeen exported from Beijing and all recent cases have been traced to\nknown chains of transmission.\n'We are changing the travel advice for Beijing effective Tuesday, 24\nJun 2003,' said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of the\nWHO. 'Beijing is the last area to which WHO recommended that people\nshould postpone all but essential travel. This is very good news and\nshows the great progress the world has made against SARS.'\nBeijing, with a cumulative total of 2521 probable cases and 191\ndeaths, has had the largest outbreak of SARS anywhere in the world,\nfollowed by Hong Kong, with 1755 cumulative cases and 296 deaths, and\nGuangdong Province, China, with 1511 cumulative cases and 57 deaths.\nFor reasons that are not yet fully understood, areas of mainland\nChina have experienced a lower case fatality ratio than seen in most\nother outbreaks.\nChina began daily reporting of SARS cases in early April [2003], when\nBeijing reported 29 cases and 4 deaths. At the peak of the outbreak,\ntowards the end of April, Beijing was reporting more than 100 new\ncases each day. Containment of an outbreak of such dimensions is a\ntribute to the effectiveness of centuries-old control measures,\nincluding isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, supported by\ngovernment commitment at the highest levels.\nRecommendations to postpone travel have been issued following\nconsideration of several factors, including the magnitude of probable\nSARS cases, the pattern of recent local transmission, and the last\ndates of export of cases.\nOn 27 Mar 2003, WHO recommended that all areas with recent local\ntransmission should screen all international departing passengers to\nensure that those who are showing symptoms of SARS or have had recent\ncontact with a SARS patient do not travel. Since then, a number of\nrecommendations have been made that people should postpone all but\nessential travel to areas with large outbreaks of SARS which posed a\npotential threat to travellers.\nMore than 20 days have now passed since the last new case was\nisolated in Beijing. Therefore, Beijing has also been removed from\nthe list of areas with recent local transmission.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 24 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada 23 Jun 2003\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/cn-cc/numbers.html>\n\nCanadian SARS Numbers 23 Jun 2003\n--------------\nThe most recent date for both onset of illness and isolation for\nprobable cases is June 12, 2003.\nProbable Cases (N = 249)\nCase status: Ontario First Cluster/ Ontario Second Cluster / British\nColumbia/ Total\nCumulative Total: 136/ 109/ 4/ 249*\nHospitalized: 5/ 20/ 0/ 25\nDischarged: 107/ 67/ 4/ 178\nUnder investigation: 0/ 0/ 0/ 0\nAt home, recovered: 0/ 9/ 0/ 9\nAt home, never hospitalized: 0/ 0/ 0/ 0\nAt home, ill: 0/ 0/ 0/ 0\nDeaths: 24/ 13/ 0/ 37\nTotal active**: 5/ 20/ 0/ 25\nSuspect Cases (N = 191)\nCase status Ontario First cluster/ Ontario Second Cluster/ British\nColumbia/ Alberta/ New Brunswick/ Prince Edward Island/ Saskatchewan/\nTotal\nCumulative Total: 121/ 11/ 46/ 6/ 2/ 4/ 1/ 191*\nHospitalized: 0/ 3/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 3\nDischarged: 102/ 5/ 10/ 1/ 1/ 4/ 1/ 124\nUnder investigation: 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0\nAt home, recovered: 18/ 2/ 36/ 5/ 1/ 0/ 0/ 62\nAt home, ill: 0/ 1/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 1\nDeaths: 1/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 1\nTotal active**: 0/ 4/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 4\nCanadian SARS cases by Province/Territory\nProvince/Territory: Probables/ Suspects\nBritish Columbia: 4/ 46\nAlberta: 0/ 6\nSaskatchewan: 0/ 1\nOntario: 245/ 132\nNew Brunswick: 0/ 2\nPrince Edward Island: 0/ 4\nTotal: 249/ 191\nChanges from previous report\n----------\nChange: Probables/ Suspects\nAdditions: 3/ 2\nDeletions: 0/ 2\nReclassifications: 0/ 0\nDeaths: 2/ 0\n*No new probable or suspect cases have been reported from other\nprovinces and territories.\n**Active cases include those that are hospitalized, at home and\ncurrently ill, or under investigation.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 24 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\nNo new probable cases have been reported since 15 Jun 2003.

The\nfull table is available at the link above.\n[B] Update 84 - Can SARS be eradicated or eliminated?\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_19/en/>\nThe first global conference on SARS, held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Kuala\nLumpur, Malaysia, was convened by WHO to provide technical guidance for the\nongoing and long term response to SARS.\nAs the number of new cases continues to dwindle, one of the most important\nquestions for the future is whether SARS can be eliminated or eradicated\nfrom its new human host. Experience with many other infectious diseases,\nincluding smallpox and poliomyelitis, has shown that complete eradication\nof an infectious disease is possible only when 3 precise requirements can\nbe met.\nFirstly, an effective intervention capable of interrupting transmission --\nideally, a vaccine -- must be available. Secondly, easy-to-use diagnostic\ntools are needed, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to detect\nlevels of infection that can lead to transmission of the disease. Finally,\ninfection of humans must be essential to the life-cycle of the causative\nagent -- if the chain of human-to-human transmission is broken, the agent\ncannot survive. Existence of an animal reservoir greatly complicates\neradication, but does not preclude it, provided interventions exist to\nbreak the chain of transmission in the animal species as well.\nTo achieve eradication at the global level, the control intervention must\nbe safe, simple, and affordable. Current control measures for SARS,\nincluding case detection and isolation, tracing and follow up of contacts,\nand quarantine, are effective but extremely time-intensive, costly, and\nsocially disruptive. Few if any countries can sustain such efforts over time.\nAs noted during yesterday's conference sessions, an adequate point-of-care\ndiagnostic test is still not available for SARS and remains a top priority.\nSuch a test would likewise need to be sufficiently simple and affordable to\nbe used in countries having a range of different health systems and\nresources for health care.\nResearchers at the conference also confirmed that far too little is\nunderstood about the origins of the SARS virus and the possible role -- if\nany -- that animals play in the transmission cycle. Some studies have\nsuggested that the earliest cases of SARS, in Guangdong Province, China,\nmay have had contact, during slaughter or due to proximity to so-called\n'wet' markets, with certain wild animal species consumed as delicacies in\nsouthern China. In addition, a SARS-like virus has been detected in a few\nof these wild animal species. Additional studies are urgently needed before\nany firm conclusions can be reached. Answers to these questions will also\ngreatly assist predictions of the future evolution of SARS.\nFor the time being, WHO continues to stress the need to break the chain of\nhuman-to-human transmission through use of currently available control\ntools. In many of the most severely affected areas, these measures have\nalready demonstrated their ability to eliminate SARS in a defined\ngeographical area.\nHowever, the long term response to SARS, which includes the prevention of\nimportation or re-importation of cases into SARS-free areas, will clearly\nrequire different strategies for surveillance and response, as current\nmeasures cannot be sustained over time.\nMoreover, scientists cannot, on the basis of the very limited data\navailable, rule out the possibility that SARS will resurface when\nenvironmental conditions or seasons again favour transmission among humans.\nShould this occur, countries will need to be ready with alert surveillance\nsystems and good preparedness strategies.\n******\n[2]\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC.

In the US, a total of 409\nSARS cases have been reported from 42 states and Puerto Rico, with 334 (82\nper cent) cases classified as suspect SARS and 75 (18 per cent) classified\nas probable SARS (more severe illnesses characterized by the presence of\npneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome) (2). Serologic testing\nfor antibody to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection has been\ncompleted for 136 suspect and 45 probable cases. None of the suspect cases\nand 8 (18 per cent) of the probable cases have demonstrated antibodies to\nSARS-CoV, all of which have been described previously (3,4). Of the 8\nlaboratory-confirmed SARS patients in the US, 7 had traveled to areas with\ndocumented or suspected community transmission of SARS within the 10 days\nbefore illness onset.

The\ncase had previously been classified as a suspect case and, according to WHO\nrecommendations, was placed in isolation on 3 Jun 2003.\nThis is the first new case reported in Guangdong since 17 May 2003. The\nlast new case reported anywhere in mainland China was on 11 Jun 2003.\nWHO is stressing that this is a reclassification of a suspect case as a\nprobable case and, as such, should not be taken as an indication that local\ntransmission has occurred. WHO is awaiting further details about the case\nand its relationship to documented chains of transmission that may point to\nthe source of infection and the timing of exposure.\nThe most likely explanation is that the case, with its onset in early June\n2003, will be linked to a chain of transmission that was subsequently broken.\nMeticulous records kept by Hong Kong authorities have revealed that the\nwoman was hospitalized in Hong Kong and treated for other illnesses from 20\nto 21 May 2003. As her room was on the same ward as a SARS patient, she was\nplaced under health surveillance until 1 Jun 2003. No SARS symptoms\ndeveloped during this period, which represents the maximum incubation period.\nHowever, a possible link with the Hong Kong hospital cannot be entirely\nruled out at this time. As became apparent during last week\u0092s global\nconference on SARS, the disease does not always follow a clinically\npredictable course in elderly patients, particularly when they have been\ntreated for co-morbidity with other diseases.\nGuangdong, which saw the first cases of SARS in mid-November of last year\n[2002], was removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission\non 13 Jun 2003. This retrospective reporting of a case newly classified as\na \u0093probable\u0094 case does not constitute a reason for any change in the status\nof Guangdong.\nJapan\nThe Japanese Ministry of Health has today reported a probable case of SARS\ninvolving a 33-year-old man who arrived in Tokyo, for sightseeing, on 21\nJun 2003 and developed symptoms 2 days later. He was immediately\nhospitalized and managed according to WHO recommendations.\nInitial diagnostic tests have ruled out other common causes of severe\nrespiratory disease. Further testing is under way and epidemiological\ninvestigations have been initiated.

Then they began arresting people.

Other symptoms, such as loss of appetite,\nchills and fever could be more accurate, said Rainer. He noted the\ndisparities in incubation periods and wide variations in body temperatures\namong patients. Among people over age 65, only 76 percent showed signs of\nfever above 38C, according to Dr. S.Y. Au of Tuen Mun Hospital. By\ncomparison, 90 per cent of patients below age 65 showed fever.\nThe absence of fever in some elderly patients could complicate efforts by\npublic health authorities to curb the spread of SARS by installing thermal\ndetection devices at airports and border points in Hong Kong and around the\nworld. If body temperature is subject to individual variations, potential\nSARS carriers could slip through the net.\nAu suggested that the absence of high temperature readings could be due to\ncertain medications being taken by elderly patients that mask fevers, and\nsaid doctors should search carefully for atypical symptoms and whether the\nperson had recently been hospitalized. Indeed, one of the best ways for\nelderly people to avoid a SARS infection is to 'avoid hospitalization,' he\nsuggested, drawing a few chuckles from his fellow physicians.\nThe meeting of more than 100 researchers and doctors was a sombre affair,\nhowever, with the group observing a one-minute silence for their colleagues\nand patients who died from the virus. Only a handful of the delegates wore\nsurgical masks, however, with most people removing them when they entered the\nconference centre.\nResearchers quickly agreed yesterday that the original WHO guidelines for\ndiagnosing SARS were outdated and said they'd had to incorporate the latest\nfindings early on in Hong Kong's outbreak last March [2003]. Symptoms shown\nby patients can also vary widely. Indeed, methods of diagnosis may even have\nto change depending on whether physicians are dealing with widespread\noutbreaks or seeing only a trickle of cases, said Dr. Mike Ryan, the WHO's co-\nordinator for global alerts and response. 'In 6 months, the same set of\nclinical symptoms may not be useful,' Ryan observed, after hearing Hong Kong\ndoctors describe the need for updated diagnostic guidelines in times of\ncrisis.\nAnother researcher, Professor Joseph Sung from the University of Hong Kong,\nadded that about 50 percent of the cases seen in Hong Kong were not typical.\nThese patients often had diarrhea and liver problems.\nThe 2-day meeting is laying the groundwork for a consensus document to be\npresented next week at a larger WHO conference in Malaysia with\nrepresentatives from around the world. However, the document is not scheduled\nto be publicly released until Tuesday.\nHong Kong has accumulated significant experience because it has suffered the\n2nd-largest number of cases after mainland China. To date, 1755 people have\nbeen diagnosed with SARS in Hong Kong, of whom 293 have died.\n[Byline: Martin Regg Cohn]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Several factors are at work here. First, as experience with a new entity\naccumulates, the full spectrum of disease becomes clearer. At first, only\nclassic or 'textbook' presentations are recognized and then the less\nclassical presentations, often more common, become apparent. Second, as\nlaboratory diagnostic techniques improve, more subtle or subclinical forms of\nthe illness are noted. Finally, variations in the manifestations of\ninfections among different age groups are the norm for infectious diseases.\nOften, the very young and the elderly fail to mount a fever in response to\ninfection. - Mod.LM]\n*****\n[2]\nDate: Fri, 6 Jun 2003 16:37:47 +0200\nFrom: Michael Koch <michael.koch@k3.mil.se>\n\nThe following paper is available to ProMED readers on request to *the author*\n[do NOT hit your REPLY button!]:\nSARS \u0096 epidemiological considerations about\n(a) the statistical 'background noise' of atypical pneumonias,\n(b) the implications of a symptomatic disease definition in the presence of\nhighly functional global networks for speedy communication and\n(c) the possible role of co-infections for the natural course of the disease\nand its highly variable CFR.\nAuthor: MG Koch, MD\nEpidemiologist\nK3, SE-546\n81 Karlsborg, Sweden\n(A longer version of 5-6 pages in English and/or a more comprehensive article\non SARS in German are available by request to my e-mail address:\n<michael.koch@k3.mil.se>)\n[This is an interesting analysis.

The theory is that the nurse somehow infected a\n96-year-old patient at North York Hospital, and the disease spread rapidly\nfrom there. Investigators are still not sure how the virus would have passed\nto the elderly man since he was not one of her patients.\nThe link was made by a team of researchers that included the Centers for\nDisease Control in Atlanta and Health Canada. 'As pieces come together, this\nlooks very likely,' said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, an associate medical officer of\nhealth at Toronto Public Health.\nThe link between SARS I and SARS II is heartening news for Toronto, which has\nbeen criticized by the World Health Organization for not being able to trace\nsome of the cases. Knowing how everybody with the disease contracted it is\nvital to managing, and eventually stopping, an outbreak.\nThis is what happened to cause the North York outbreak, according to\ninterviews with investigating doctors, medical research papers, and nurses\nand doctors at North York General.\nToronto's first SARS outbreak began on 7 Mar 2003. The son of a woman who had\ncontracted the disease in Hong Kong went to Scarborough Grace Hospital with a\nrespiratory illness.\nThe son's pneumonia-like infection, and those of others in his family, were\ninitially dismissed as tuberculosis by Grace doctors and Toronto Public\nHealth officials. By 14 Mar 2003, they knew it was SARS.\nSARS spread through Grace Hospital over the next few weeks. Among the\nhospital wards affected was the coronary care unit. A female patient there\n(age unknown) got sick, possibly getting SARS from a fellow heart patient, a\nman. That male patient, a so-called super spreader, was then transferred to\nYork Central Hospital on 16 March 2003, causing an outbreak there.\nMeanwhile, the female patient was ill at Grace Hospital. Chest X-rays showed\na SARS-like infection, but she was not diagnosed at the time. She was\ndischarged from hospital on 17 Mar 2003. The woman lived with her daughter, a\nsenior nurse who worked on the eighth floor of North York General Hospital.\nThat floor is now known as the SARS ward, but in March it cared for patients\nrecovering from other problems, such as injuries.\nBlood tests returned to Toronto Public Health last week confirm the elderly\nwoman had the SARS coronavirus. She was suffering from a mild case of the\nvirus when she passed it on to her daughter in late March. On 30 March 2003,\nthe nurse developed a fever and felt lethargic. She went home early from\nwork. She did not know she had SARS.\nAlso on the 8th floor at the time was a 96-year-old man who had fractured his\npelvis. The man went to North York General Hospital emergency unit and was\ntransferred to the nurse's floor.\nResearchers believe the 96-year-old man somehow contracted SARS from the\nnurse, but they say there is 'no obvious link' because she was not caring for\nhim. The nurse also infected 3 fellow nurses, likely in a lunchroom. On 6 Apr\n2003 the nurse was admitted to hospital and her SARS case was reported to\nToronto Public Health.\nThe 96-year-old man first developed his SARS symptoms on 4 Apr 2003, not 19\nApril as researchers initially thought. His first bout in early April was\ncalmed by antibiotics. On 19 Apr 2003 the disease resurfaced. The 4 nurses\nbecame the first patients of a new SARS ward on the 8th floor of North York\nGeneral Hospital. But nobody [caught on] to the fact that the 96-year-old man\nwas developing SARS. To make room for the new SARS unit, the 96-year-old man\nwas transferred down to the 4th-floor orthopedic ward on 2 Apr 2003. He\ninfected almost a dozen nurses on that floor.\nAt the same time, 3 patients (2 women and a man) on the 7th-floor psychiatric\nward contracted the disease in mid-April. Health officials don't know how the\npsychiatric patients got SARS. One theory is the male psychiatric patient may\nhave visited another hospital that had SARS. [It must be hard to get a\nreliable history from a psychiatric patient. - Mod.JW]\nAs April progressed, SARS spread rapidly through North York General Hospital,\nhelped by increasingly lax mask and gown precautions among some doctors and\nnurses. By early May 2003, when the province told hospitals to relax their\nprecautions, many more health-care workers were contracting the disease.\nDespite nurses raising the alarm at the hospital and despite the fact that\n4 members of the 96-year-old man's family were visibly sick with SARS,\nthe disease went unchecked until 23 May 2003.\nIn the tale of 2 hospitals -- York Central and North York -- York Central\nHospital was the one that responded quickly to the transmission from Grace\nHospital, the epicentre of Toronto's original outbreak. The doors at York\nCentral Hospital were closed and tight precautions taken when the hospital\nrealized that it had imported SARS from North York General Hospital.\nThe York Central Hospital outbreak was contained. Out of 16 SARS cases, 2\ndied, including the SARS patient transferred from Scarborough Grace Hospital.\nYork Central started reopening on 19 Apr 2003, when the disease was spreading\nunchecked through North York General Hospital. Hospital president Dr. Richard\nSchabas credited a strict infection control procedure and teamwork as tools\nthat defeated SARS at his hospital.\nSo, how was SARS allowed to fester at North York General Hospital? The cases\nwere dismissed as non-SARS despite what now appears to be overwhelming\nevidence to the contrary. North York General Hospital's chief infectious\ndisease specialist Dr. Barbara Mederski has refused interview requests from\nthe Star. She was involved in the assessment of the SARS patients.\nWhile North York General Hospital has declined to comment, the hospital has\nsent a statement to its doctors and nurses, which reads: 'This is a sensitive\nissue for patients and their family, as well as our staff and physicians. At\nthis time we need to continue to support each other. The hospital will\ncontinue to fully cooperate with the investigation. It is in the interest of\nall us to advance the knowledge and prevention of SARS.'\nA Scarborough Grace Hospital spokesperson said last night the hospital\nwelcomes the investigation.\nThroughout April and into May 2003, the 96-year-old man, his relatives, and\nthe psychiatric patients were assessed by a team of doctors, including public\nhealth officials and Toronto microbiologists. But these patients were\ndismissed as SARS cases because there was no link to a previous SARS case.\nThe 96-year-old man died 1 May 2003. His wife died later in May. The rest\nrecovered.\nWhat is now clear is that the link was in the hospital, a nurse who had\nbeen doing her job and inadvertently contracted the virus from her sick\nmother. This fact was unearthed by CDC and Health Canada investigators who\ndid an audit of patient records and their contacts by computer this week. At\nToronto Public Health, the job has been more difficult. For most of the 2\noutbreaks, they have sifted through paperwork by hand.

Transmission to other persons resulted subsequently in an\noutbreak among 257 persons in several Greater Toronto Area (GTA)\nhospitals. After implementation of provincewide public health\nmeasures that included strict infection-control practices, the number\nof recognized cases of SARS declined substantially, and no cases\nwere detected after 20 Apr 2003. On 30 Apr 2003, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) lifted a travel advisory issued on 22 Apr 2003\nthat had recommended limiting travel to Toronto.\nThis report describes a second wave of SARS cases among\npatients, visitors, and health-care workers (HCWs) that occurred at\na Toronto hospital approximately 4 weeks after SARS transmission\nwas thought to have been interrupted. The findings indicate that\nexposure to hospitalized patients with unrecognized SARS after a\nprovincewide relaxation of strict SARS control measures probably\ncontributed to transmission among HCWs. The investigation\nunderscores the need for monitoring fever and respiratory\nsymptoms in hospitalized patients and visitors, particularly after a\ndecline in the number of reported SARS cases.\nDuring 23 Feb - 7 Jun 2003, the Ontario Ministry of Health and\nLong-Term Care received reports of 361 SARS cases (suspect: 136\n[38 percent]; probable: 225 [62 percent]) [see Figure 1 at weblink\nabove for epidemic curve - Mod.MPP]; as of 7 Jun 2003, a total of\n33 (9 percent) persons had died. Of 74 cases reported during 15\nApr - 9 Jun 2003 to Toronto Public Health, 29 (39 percent) occurred\namong HCWs, 28 (38 percent) occurred as a result of exposure\nduring hospitalization, and 17 (23 percent) occurred among hospital\nvisitors [see Figure 2 at weblink above]. Of the 74 cases, 67\n(90 percent) resulted directly from exposure in hospital A, a 350-bed\nGTA community hospital.\nThe majority of cases were associated with a ward used primarily\nfor orthopedic patients (14 rooms) and gynecology patients (7\nrooms). Nursing staff members used a common nursing station,\nshared a washroom, and ate together in a lounge just outside the\nward. SARS attack rates among nurses assigned routinely to the\northopedic and gynecology sections of the ward were approximately\n40 percent and 25 percent, respectively.\nDuring early and mid-May [2003], as recommended by provincial\nSARS-control directives, hospital A discontinued SARS expanded\nprecautions (i.e. routine contact precautions with use of an N95 or\nequivalent respirator) for non-SARS patients without respiratory\nsymptoms in all hospital areas other than the emergency department\nand the intensive care unit (ICU). In addition, staff no longer were\nrequired to wear masks or respirators routinely throughout the\nhospital or to maintain distance from one another while eating.\nHospital A instituted changes in policy on 8 May 2003; the number\nof persons allowed to visit a patient during a 4-hour period remained\nrestricted to one, but the number of patients who were allowed to\nhave visitors was increased.\nOn 20 May 2003, 5 patients in a rehabilitation hospital in Toronto\nwere reported with febrile illness. One of these 5 patients was\ndetermined to have been hospitalized in the orthopedic ward of\nhospital A during 22-28 Apr 2003, and a second was found on 22\nMay 2003 to have SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by\nnucleic acid amplification test. On investigation, a second patient\nwas determined to have been hospitalized in the orthopedic\nward of hospital A during 22-28 Apr 2003. After the identification of\nthese cases, an investigation of pneumonia cases at hospital A\nidentified 8 cases of previously unrecognized SARS among patients.\nThe first patient linked to the second phase of the Ontario outbreak\nwas a man aged 96 years who was admitted to hospital A on 22 Mar\n2003 with a fractured pelvis. On 2 Apr 2003, he was transferred to\nthe orthopedic ward, where he had fever and an infiltrate on chest\nradiograph. Although he appeared initially to respond to\nantimicrobial therapy, on 19 Apr 2003, he again had respiratory\nsymptoms, fever, and diarrhea. He had no apparent\ncontact with a patient or an HCW with SARS, and aspiration\npneumonia and _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea appeared\nto be probable explanations for his symptoms. In the subsequent\noutbreak investigation, other patients in close proximity to this patient\nand several visitors and HCWs linked to these patients were\ndetermined to have SARS. At least one visitor became ill before the\nonset of illness of a hospitalized family member, and another visitor\nwas determined to have SARS although his hospitalized wife did not.\nOn 23 May 2003, hospital A was closed to all new admissions other\nthan patients with newly identified SARS. Soon after, new provincial\ndirectives were issued, requiring an increased level of infection-\ncontrol precautions in hospitals located in several GTA regions.\nHCWs at hospital A were placed under a 10-day work quarantine\nand instructed to avoid public places outside work, avoid close\ncontact with friends and family, and to wear a mask whenever public\ncontact was unavoidable. As of 9 Jun 2003, of 79 new cases of\nSARS that resulted from exposure at hospital A, 78 appear to\nhave resulted from exposures that occurred before 23 May 2003.\nReported by: see original on web.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nOn 14 May 2003, WHO removed Toronto from the list of areas with\nrecent local SARS transmission because 20 days (i.e., twice the\nmaximum incubation period) had elapsed since the most recent\ncase of locally acquired SARS was isolated or a SARS patient had\ndied, suggesting that the chain of transmission had terminated.\nBefore recognition of the second phase of the outbreak, the most\nrecent case of locally acquired SARS in Toronto was reported\nbefore 20 Apr 2003. However, unrecognized transmission, limited\ninitially to patient-to-patient and patient-to-visitor transmission,\napparently was continuing in hospital A. After directives for\nincreased hospitalwide infection-control precautions were lifted, an\nincrease in the number of cases was observed, particularly among\nHCWs.\nThe findings from this investigation underscore the importance of\ncontrolling health-care--associated SARS transmission and highlight\nthe difficulty in determining when expanded precautions for SARS\nno longer are necessary. Investigations in Canada and other\ncountries have identified HCWs to be at increased risk for SARS,\nand methods for performing surveillance among HCWs have been\nrecommended (2). The Toronto investigation suggests that\nunrecognized patient-to-patient and patient-to-visitor transmission of\nSARS might have been occurring with no associated cases of HCW\nillness until after a provincewide lifting of the expanded precautions\nfor SARS. Transient carriage of pathogens on the hands of HCWs\nis the most common form of transmission for several nosocomial\ninfections, and both direct contact and droplet spread appear to be\nmajor modes for transmitting SARS-CoV (3). HCWs should be\ndirected to use gloves appropriately (e.g., change gloves\nafter every patient contact and avoid their use outside a patient's\nroom) and to pay scrupulous attention to hand hygiene before\nputting on and after removing gloves.\nIn addition to active and passive sureillance for fever and respiratory\nsymptoms among HCWs, early detection of SARS cases among\npersons in health-care facilities in SARS-affected areas is critical,\nparticularly in facilities that provide care to SARS patients.\nIdentifying hospitalized patients with SARS is difficult, especially\nwhen no epidemiologic link has been recognized and the\npresentation of symptoms is nonspecific. Patients with SARS might\ndevelop symptoms common to hospitalized patients (e.g., fever\nor prodromal symptoms of headache, malaise, and myalgias), and\ndiagnostic testing to detect cases is limited. Available nucleic acid\namplification assays for SARS-CoV have reported sensitivities as\nlow as 50 percent (4). Although serologic testing for SARS-CoV\nantibody is available, definitive interpretation of an initial negative\ntest requires a convalescent specimen to be obtained greater than\n21 days after onset of symptoms (5).\nSeveral potential approaches for monitoring patients might improve\nrecognition of SARS in hospitalized patients. A standardized\nassessment for SARS (e.g., clinical, radiographic, and laboratory\ncriteria) might be used among all hospitalized patients with new-\nonset fever, especially for units or wards in which clusters of febrile\npatients are identified. In addition, some hospital computer\ninformation systems might allow review of administrative and\nphysician order data to monitor selected observations that might\nserve as triggers for further investigation.\nThe Toronto investigation found early transmission of SARS to both\npatients and visitors in hospital A. In areas affected recently by\nSARS, clusters of pneumonia occurring in either visitors to health-\ncare facilities or HCWs should be evaluated fully to determine if they\nrepresent transmission of SARS. To facilitate detection and\nreporting, clinicians in these areas should be encouraged to obtain\na history from pneumonia patients of whether they visited or worked\nat a health-care facility and whether family members or close\ncontacts also are ill. Targeted surveillance for community-acquired\npneumonia in areas recently affected by SARS might provide\nanother means for early detection of these cases.\nThe findings from the Toronto investigation indicate that continued\ntransmission of SARS can occur among patients and visitors during\na period of apparent HCW adherence to expanded infection-control\nprecautions for SARS. Maintaining a high level of suspicion for\nSARS on the part of health-care providers and infection-control staff\nis critical, particularly after a decline in reported SARS cases. The\nprevention of health-care-associated SARS infections must involve\nHCWs, patients, visitors, and the community.\nReferences\n---------\n1. Poutanen SM, Low DE, Henry B, et al.

Of the 70\nprobable patients, 68 (97 percent) had traveled to areas with\ndocumented or suspected community transmission of SARS\nwithin the 10 days before illness onset; the remaining 2 (3 percent)\npatients were a health-care worker who provided care to a SARS\npatient and a household contact of a SARS patient (3). Of the 68\nprobable SARS cases attributed to travel, 35 (51 percent) patients\nreported travel to mainland China; 17 (25 percent) to Hong Kong\nSAR, China; 5 (7 percent) to Singapore; one (1 percent) to Hanoi,\nVietnam; 14 (21 percent) to Toronto, Canada; and 5 (7 percent) to\nTaiwan; of these, 7 (10 percent) reported travel to more than one of\nthese areas.\nSerologic testing for antibody to SARS-CoV has been completed for\n134 suspect and 41 probable cases.

[How\nconfident are they that these are not false positive results? -\nMod.JW]\nSince receiving these positive laboratory results, local investigations\nhave been undertaken to check that these people had recovered\nand that none of their close contacts have suffered any clinical\nsymptoms of SARS-like illness in recent weeks. Local health\nprotection teams are satisfied that there has been no ongoing public\nhealth risk.\nThe development is a significant step in building knowledge about\nthe behaviour of the SARS coronavirus. A great deal of further\nresearch needs to be carried out before any conclusions can be\nreached, but the finding suggests that there is a spectrum of SARS\nillness, with a few people only experiencing a very mild illness before\ncomplete recovery.\nDr Maria Zambon of the HPA\u0092s Central Public Health Laboratory\nsaid \u0093Since early March [2003], we have been carrying out\ncontinuous testing on patients who were classified as probable and\nsuspected cases of SARS and of the 4 probable cases currently\nlisted, one was recently reported as testing positive. In addition to\nthis, we have also received samples from patients with milder\nsymptoms who had all travelled to areas where SARS cases have\nbeen reported, but are thought to have had limited opportunity for\nexposure to the virus. This testing has been undertaken as part of\nour precautionary approach to SARS, because so little was known\nabout the extent to which infection with the SARS coronavirus\nmight be associated with mild symptoms.\u0094\n\u00932 such people have tested positive for SARS corona virus through\nshowing an antibody response to the virus. This shows that these\nindividuals have almost certainly been exposed to the virus, and\nhave had a mild illness but have now fully recovered.\u0094\nOne further case who required hospitalisation has also tested\npositive for antibodies to SARS coronavirus and has since\nrecovered. Although these people have almost certainly been\nexposed to the SARS coronavirus, they have not been classified as\nprobable cases of SARS as they don\u0092t meet the case definition in\nterms of either severity of symptoms or travel history\u0094\nDr Zambon concluded \u0093It is still early days in terms of testing for\nSARS coronavirus, and these results show that there is a great deal\nwe still don\u0092t understand about the spectrum of illness caused by\ninfection with this virus. The majority of people tested so far have\nbeen very sick in hospital and these latest results may represent\ncases at the more mild end of the spectrum. Further testing and\nresearch is needed worldwide before we find out if there are more\npeople who may have suffered a similar mild illness. We are likely to\nfind this out in areas where there has been local transmission of\nSARS and more people have come into contact with the infection.\nWe will be sharing our data with WHO\u0092s international laboratory\ncollaboration to see if other countries have had similar cases.\u0094\nNotes to Editors\n-----------\nThe HPA has also received 2 further positive antibody results on UK\ncitizens, who were ill whilst outside the UK and were tested on their\nreturn. These people are now recovered and they have been\nreported to the countries where they were ill and will not be reported\nas UK probable cases. [see report of 2 cases in the Philippines in\nyesterday's update (144) [1][A] footnote (1) - Mod.MPP]\nWhile 3 probable SARS cases have tested negative for SARS\ncorona virus (see second paragraph), WHO advise that they should\nremain in the probable category, as we have no other laboratory\nexplanation for their illness.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[The report on the ongoing outbreak of SARS in Toronto is a\nsobering reminder of the difficulties in detection of cases in the\nabsence of an immediately apparent epidemiologic link to other\ncases. It begs the question at what point in time following\npresumed/apparent interruption of transmission in an area that had\nhad local transmission (greater than or equal to 20 days, using the\nstandard '2 incubation periods' for the definition) an area can\npresume that atypical pneumonias are most probably\nnot due to SARS and therefore SARS level infection control\nprocedures can be dropped. Not an easy question to answer given\nthe observed recurrence of active transmission in Ontario.\nThe finding of 2 cases of mild respiratory illness in the UK with\npositive serology for recent SARS associated coronavirus infection\nis not surprising. Most diseases have a wide spectrum of clinical\npresentation from the asymptomatic and or mild presentations to the\nvery severe and fatal presentations. The absence of documented\ntransmission of the virus to others from these mild cases is\nreassuring, albeit it is a small number of patients (2) so caution is\nnecessary in interpreting this observation.

[The report on the ongoing outbreak of SARS in Toronto is a\nsobering reminder of the difficulties in detection of cases in the\nabsence of an immediately apparent epidemiologic link to other\ncases. 52(23);550\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5223a5.htm>\n\nUpdate: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome --- United States,\nJune 11, 2003\n The findings indicate that\nexposure to hospitalized patients with unrecognized SARS after a\nprovincewide relaxation of strict SARS control measures probably\ncontributed to transmission among HCWs. Since receiving these positive laboratory results, local investigations\nhave been undertaken to check that these people had recovered\nand that none of their close contacts have suffered any clinical\nsymptoms of SARS-like illness in recent weeks. The findings from this investigation underscore the importance of\ncontrolling health-care--associated SARS transmission and highlight\nthe difficulty in determining when expanded precautions for SARS\n HCWs at hospital A were placed under a 10-day work quarantine\nand instructed to avoid public places outside work, avoid close\ncontact with friends and family, and to wear a mask whenever public\ncontact was unavoidable. Dr Zambon concluded \u0093It is still early days in terms of testing for\nSARS coronavirus, and these results show that there is a great deal\nwe still don\u0092t understand about the spectrum of illness caused by\ninfection with this virus. In areas affected recently by\nSARS, clusters of pneumonia occurring in either visitors to health-\ncare facilities or HCWs should be evaluated fully to determine if they\nrepresent transmission of SARS. He had no apparent\ncontact with a patient or an HCW with SARS, and aspiration\npneumonia and _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea appeared\nto be probable explanations for his symptoms. SARS attack rates among nurses assigned routinely to the\northopedic and gynecology sections of the ward were approximately\n40 percent and 25 percent, respectively.\n Although serologic testing for SARS-CoV\nantibody is available, definitive interpretation of an initial negative\ntest requires a convalescent specimen to be obtained greater than\n21 days after onset of symptoms (5). At least one visitor became ill before the\nonset of illness of a hospitalized family member, and another visitor\nwas determined to have SARS although his hospitalized wife did not.\n Transient carriage of pathogens on the hands of HCWs\nis the most common form of transmission for several nosocomial\ninfections, and both direct contact and droplet spread appear to be\nmajor modes for transmitting SARS-CoV (3). In addition, some hospital computer\ninformation systems might allow review of administrative and\nphysician order data to monitor selected observations that might\nserve as triggers for further investigation. This shows that these\nindividuals have almost certainly been exposed to the virus, and\nhave had a mild illness but have now fully recovered.\u0094\n Investigations in Canada and other\ncountries have identified HCWs to be at increased risk for SARS,\nand methods for performing surveillance among HCWs have been\nrecommended (2). We will be sharing our data with WHO\u0092s international laboratory\ncollaboration to see if other countries have had similar cases.\u0094\nNotes to Editors\n [3]\nUK\n--\n After the identification of\nthese cases, an investigation of pneumonia cases at hospital A\nidentified 8 cases of previously unrecognized SARS among patients. As of 9 Jun 2003, of 79 new cases of\nSARS that resulted from exposure at hospital A, 78 appear to\nhave resulted from exposures that occurred before 23 May 2003. None of the suspect cases and\n8 (20 percent) of the probable cases have demonstrated antibodies\nto SARS-CoV, 7 of which have been described previously (3). The finding of 2 cases of mild respiratory illness in the UK with\npositive serology for recent SARS associated coronavirus infection\nis not surprising. The majority of cases were associated with a ward used primarily\nfor orthopedic patients (14 rooms) and gynecology patients (7\nrooms). On investigation, a second patient\nwas determined to have been hospitalized in the orthopedic\nward of hospital A during 22-28 Apr 2003. During 23 Feb - 7 Jun 2003, the Ontario Ministry of Health and\nLong-Term Care received reports of 361 SARS cases (suspect: 136\n Of the 74 cases, 67\n(90 percent) resulted directly from exposure in hospital A, a 350-bed\nGTA community hospital. On 30 Apr 2003, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) lifted a travel advisory issued on 22 Apr 2003\nthat had recommended limiting travel to Toronto. Maintaining a high level of suspicion for\nSARS on the part of health-care providers and infection-control staff\nis critical, particularly after a decline in reported SARS cases.

WHO is\nchanging this recommendation as the situation in these areas has now improved\nsignificantly. Information about the decline of the outbreaks in Hebei, Inner\nMongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin has been carefully reviewed by WHO and suggests\nthat SARS is no longer a potential threat to international travellers to\nthese regions.\nRecommendations to postpone travel are issued following consideration of\nseveral factors, including the magnitude of current SARS cases, the pattern\nof recent local transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.\nIn addition, WHO is removing Guangdong, Hebei, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Jilin,\nJiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Tianjin from the list of areas with recent local\ntransmission. This follows confirmation that there have been no new cases\nisolated in any of these areas for more than twice the maximum incubation\nperiod, in other words more than 20 days.\nOn 27 March 2003, WHO recommended that areas with recent local transmission\nshould screen all international departing passengers to ensure that those who\nare sick with SARS or are contacts of SARS cases do not travel. This\nrecommendation is still valid for Beijing, Hong Kong and Taiwan in China, and\nToronto, Canada. For a summary of travel recommendations, see the table below.\nDuring a recent trip to Beijing, Dr David Heymann, WHO's Executive Director\nfor Communicable Diseases, commented on the measures now in place in China to\ncontain the spread of SARS. 'We've seen that there has been a massive effort\nto mobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,\nencouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS\ncases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.'\n'China has made huge strides in its effort to contain the outbreak of SARS,'\nsaid Dr Heymann. 'The key thing now is to maintain vigilance and build up\nChina's disease surveillance system. Public health authorities in China and\naround the world must continue to watch out for new cases of SARS to ensure\nthat it does not emerge again elsewhere.'\nSituation in Toronto\n-------------\nThe category of pattern of SARS transmission for the city of Toronto\nhas been changed from 'B' to 'C'. This is because a probable case\nwith laboratory confirmation of SARS coronavirus exported from\nToronto had not been previously identified as a contact and put into\nvoluntary home isolation.\n'Pattern B' transmission is defined as an area having more than one\ngeneration of local probable SARS cases, but only among persons who have been\npreviously identified and followed-up as known contacts of probable SARS\ncases.\n'Pattern C'\ntransmission is defined as an area having local probable cases occurring\namong persons who have not been previously identified as known contacts of\nprobable SARS cases.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 14 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\nNo. new probable cases reported: 1\nCumulative no. cases: 694\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 693)\nCumulative no.

In preliminary tests, both showed no signs of\nhaving SARS, but more thorough examinations were pending, health officials\nsaid.\nThe SARS patient and the dead man, had overlapping work hours on 3 successive\ndays last month in the same building at the University of North Carolina at\nChapel Hill.\nThe SARS patient showed no symptoms at the time, and state health director\nLeah Devlin said there are no reported cases anywhere in the world in which a\nco-worker outside a medical setting passed the disease to a colleague.\nThe man who died had suffered a chronic cough for weeks and his condition\nsuddenly deteriorated Monday, the News & Observer reported Friday. State\nepidemiologist Dr. Jeffrey Engel would only say Friday that they were still\ninvestigating the background of his condition.\nThe 2nd pneumonia patient was being monitored at home after being treated\nat Duke University Medical Center.\n'Follow-up testing is being conducted to see if we can completely rule out the\npossibility of SARS in both cases,' Devlin said.\n['Very peliminary' tests from CDC] showed both men negative for SARS; the\nsame kind of test, involving swabs from the nose or the back of the throat,\nconfirmed the diagnosis of SARS in the first man.\n'Right now we're calling it definitely heading down the right track,' Engel\nsaid. 'But you cannot rule out a case of SARS until several days after the\ninitial onset of illness.'\nBlood test results from the CDC on the 2 pneumonia patients could be back as\nearly as Monday. Engel said the most conclusive test can only be done 21 to 28\ndays after onset of symptoms.\nThe SARS patient and the dead man had overlapping work times May 21-23 in the\nGiles F. Horney Building, which houses facilities services offices off the\nuniversity's main campus. A spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and\nHuman Services, Carol Schriber, said she did not know how long the men were in\nthe same building. 'The disease investigation so far has not shown close\npersonal contact between the two people,' Schriber said.\nThe university has offered health screenings to 500 employees who worked in\nthe building or for the energy services department, as well as their immediate\nfamily members. As of Friday afternoon, 35 people had been examined and none\nshowed symptoms related to SARS.\nThe SARS patient, an Orange County resident, could be released from isolation\nat home on Saturday -- 10 days after his last symptom disappeared, state\nhealth officials said.\nTest results from the CDC confirmed the Orange County man's diagnosis Monday,\nmaking him the 8th confirmed case of SARS in the United States. He\napparently contracted SARS after encountering an infected person during a\nvisit to a Toronto geriatric rehabilitation center. None of his family has\nshown any symptoms. State health officials quarantined 12 people at an Orange\nCounty doctor's office, 3 from a UNC-CH hospital and 2 family members of the\nSARS patient. The quarantine was to end Saturday.\nAlso, 9 members of the staff at Duke University Medical Center and 2 at\nWestern Wake Medical Center were being monitored for symptoms. 4 health\ncare workers at Western Wake were on furlough because they had close exposure\nto the man who died, though they did not show any symptoms of SARS.\n[Byline: Jay Cohen]\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\nInstructor in Surgery (Bioengineering)\nHarvard Medical School\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[As of yesterday, the number of SARS cases worldwide stood at 8454, with only\n10 new cases from around the world.

The additional 29 nucleotides in the\nGZ01 and the civet cat sequences bring open reading frame (ORF) 10 in\nframe with ORF 11 and may generate a protein with 122 amino acids and\na transmembrane domain. This protein (if real) would be missing in 17\nout of 18 SARS coronavirus infections. Dr. Niman has sent the\nfollowing additional comments. - Mod.CP]\nThe updated sequences of GZ01 (including the sequence of the\n122-amino-acid protein created by the 29-nucleotide insert), BJ02,\nBJ03, BJ04 have just been made available at GenBank.\nThe completed genomes of BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, and GZ01 allow for a full\ndata set for the 5 Metropole Hotel Mutations. Not surprisingly, none\nare found in GZ01, BJ02, or BJ03. However, 2 are found in BJ04\n(C9404T and A21721G).\nBJ04 is the first reported isolate that has only some of the 5\nMetropole Hotel Mutations. All 5 mutations are found in Tor2,\nUrbani, HKU39849, SIN2500, SIN2677, SIN2679, SIN2740, SIN2774,\nCUHK-Su10, TW1, and ZJ01. None of the 5 mutations are found in GZ01,\nBJ01, BJ02, BJ03, or CUHK-W1.\nDetails on the BJ04 patient are not widely known, but since the BJ04\nisolate was the most recent submission to GenBank by the Beijing\nGenomics Institute and since, at the time of initial submission it\nwas the least completed sequence, it seems possible that the isolate\nwas from a patient who developed SARS later than patients from whom\nGZ01, BJ01, BJ02, and BJ03 were isolated by the Beijing Genomics\nInstitute.\nTherefore, it seems that evolution of the viruses isolated from\nvisitors to the Metropole Hotel may have gone through the following\nsequence of mutations.\n(1) A 29-nucleotide deletion -- found in all human isolates except\nGZ01 (and 2 civet cats);\n(2) 2 Metropole Hotel Mutations (C9404T, A21721G) -- found in BJ04;\n(3) 3 additional Metropole Hotel Mutations (G17564T, C22222T,\nC27827T) -- all 5 Metropole Hotel mutations found in the 11 isolates\nlisted above.\nFurther examination of the revised sequences suggest that there are 7\nMetropole Hotel specific mutations, in addition to the 29-nucleotide\ndeletion. 2 of the mutations which were initially just found in\nBeijing isolates have now also been found in GZ01. Thus, it seems\nthat the sequence of mutations is as follows:\n(1) The 29 nucleotide deletion (found in all isolates except GZ01);\n(2) Two mutations (A19838G and C27243T) in CUHK-W1;\n(3) Two mutations (C9404T and A21721G) in BJ04.\nCombining the 4 mutations above with G17565T, C22222T, and C27827T\nproduces the 11 isolates with all 7 mutations plus the 29-nucleotide\ndeletion.\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\nInstructor in Surgery (Bioengineering)\nHarvard Medical School\n51 Blossom Street, Room 422\nBoston, MA 02114 USA\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[ProMED-mail is not an appropriate forum for further discussion of\nfine sequence analysis of this type.

Possible cases are\nimmediately isolated. All contacts are being traced and, when warranted,\nplaced in home quarantine. Infection control measures are being followed in\nall affected facilities. WHO welcomes these precautionary measures.\nCanadian authorities have most recently reported a possible cluster of SARS\npatients in a hospital east of Toronto. Although no clear epidemiological\nlink has been established that could explain this new cluster, officials\nhave adopted a cautious approach. Over the last 3 days, 15 dialysis\npatients at the Lakeridge Health Centre in Whitby exhibited respiratory and\nfebrile illnesses. After clinical review and laboratory investigations to\ndetect other causative agents, around half of these patients have now been\nexcluded from consideration as possible SARS cases. The remaining patients\nare being closely monitored.\nThere are other investigations ongoing, and many questions remain to be\nanswered before firm conclusions can be reached.\nWHO is also awaiting further information on cases in other countries that\nmay have been exported from Toronto. WHO is not yet convinced that such\ncases have been conclusively documented.\nOne of the most dangerous stages in the evolution of any outbreak, and most\nespecially one caused by a new and poorly understood disease, occurs when\ncases begin to decline and previous levels of high alert and precautionary\nmeasures likewise begin to level off. Much about the clinical behaviour of\nSARS and its mode of transmission requires further research. Until\nknowledge improves, precautionary measures such as those being followed in\nToronto are the best approach from a public health perspective.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 10 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\nNo. new probable cases reported: 1\nCumulative no. cases: 687\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 686)\nExplanation: 1 previously reported susp. case reclassified as prob. case; 1\npreviously reported prob. case exluded by reporting MDs.\nCumulative no.

The move\nfollows vast improvements in case detection, infection control, and the\ntracing and follow up of contacts that led to a steep drop in the daily\nnumber of new cases.\n\n'The SARS crisis in Taiwan has been taken very seriously at all levels,'\nsaid Dr Cathy Roth, a WHO virologist who was in Taiwan in May to assess the\nneed for a strengthened response. 'SARS stimulated vast and very rapid\nimprovements in the health infrastructure, especially in the areas of\nhospital infection control procedures, systems for data collection and\nreporting, mobilization of the public, and coordination of all agencies\ncontributing to the outbreak response. We hope these improvements are\npermanent.'\n\nWHO recommends that all areas which have experienced local transmission of\nSARS maintain a high level of vigilance, as a single imported case or lapse\nin infection control can re-ignite an outbreak.\n\nThe decision to lift a travel advisory notice is based on consideration of\nseveral criteria, including the number of active cases, the number of new\ncases being reported daily, patterns of local transmission, and evidence\nthat cases are no longer being exported elsewhere. The adequacy of\nsurveillance measures, including screening for new cases and tracing and\nfollow up of contacts, is also considered. Together, these factors help\ndetermine whether travellers, as well as local residents, are at risk of\nacquiring infection outside confined settings, such as the health care\nenvironment.\n\nTaiwan, which has experienced the third largest outbreak on record,\ninitially had only a few imported cases, all clearly linked together in\nchains of person to person transmission. Following lapses in infection\ncontrol practices in a hospital, the outbreak escalated dramatically, with\nas many as 70 new cases per day being reported in mid-May. The large number\nof new cases reported daily was also partly due to a large backlog of cases\npending investigation.\n\nWHO continues to recommend that people planning to travel to Beijing, China\nconsider postponing all but essential travel. No other travel-related\nrecommendations are in place.\n\n[D]\nWHO global conference on SARS 17/18 June 2003, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\nThis conference has just concluded. Complete texts of many of the talks can\nbe found at <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/conference/june_2003/materials/en/>.\nDr Gro Harlem Brundtland, director general of WHO, closed the meeting with\nthe following remarks: 'It is only with hindsight that we can more clearly\nsee what has happened. That is certainly the case with SARS. When many of\nus were caught up in the frantic day-to-day business of managing a growing\nepidemic, few had time either to stop or think. Today and yesterday, for\nthe first time for some of us, we have all had an opportunity to reflect on\nwhat we have achieved and on the lessons we can learn. We now know so much\nabout SARS and yet we also know how much knowledge is still lacking. We\nhave also learnt vital lessons to be better prepared for the next emerging\ndisease - and we know there will be one. Our capacity to respond and to\ncooperate should be more advanced and better tested.'\n\n[E]\nUpdate 83 \u00ad One hundred days into the outbreak\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_18/en/> June 18 [edited]\nTomorrow will mark the 100th day since WHO first alerted the world, on 12\nMarch, to the SARS threat. From the 55 cases recognized on that day,\nalarmingly concentrated in hospitals in Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore,\nthe outbreak exploded within a month to cause some 3000 cases and more than\n100 deaths in 20 countries on all continents. By that time, too, the public\nface of SARS had come to be symbolized by a mask \u00ad- an appropriate image\nfor a disease still shrouded in mystery. Although the causative agent was\nconclusively identified on 17 April, the disease had no vaccine, no\neffective treatment, an overall case fatality of 15 per cent, and many\nunexplained features. As the coming weeks would reveal, SARS was also full\nof surprises.\n\nSARS was carried out of southern China, where the first cases are now known\nto have occurred in late November 2002, by an infected medical doctor who\nspent a single night on the 9th floor of a Hong Kong hotel in late\nFebruary. He infected at least 16 other persons staying on or visiting the\nsame floor. From this single event, which is still not fully understood in\nterms of the dynamics of transmission, SARS spread internationally.\n\nThe number of cases passed 4000 on 23 April and then rapidly soared to 5000\non 28 April, 6000 on 2 May, and 7000 on 8 May, when cases were reported\nfrom 30 countries. During the peak of the global outbreak, near the start\nof May, more than 200 new cases were being reported each day. Detection of\nnew infections subsequently slowed, passing 8000 on 22 May. During June,\nthe number of new cases has gradually dwindled to the present daily\nhandful. WHO is confident that all countries that have experienced\noutbreaks are disclosing cases fully and promptly \u00ad- SARS is too big a\ndisease to hide for long. The global outbreak, at least in this initial\nphase, is clearly coming under control.\n\nThe reduced number of cases is not a 'natural phenomenon' that can be\nattributed to a change in the virulence or infectivity of the SARS virus,\nas often happens with new diseases that quickly 'burn out'. Instead, the\ndramatic reduction in the number of SARS cases is the result of monumental\nefforts on the part of governments and health care staff, supported by a\nwell-informed and cooperative public.\n\nSARS is the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to strike a\nglobalized society. As such, its history to date illustrates the favorable\nconditions, both for the devastating spread of a new disease and solidarity\nin its containment, that have come to characterize a closely\ninterconnected, interdependent, and highly mobile world. On the negative\nside, the volume of international air travel allowed SARS to spread quickly\naround the world, the close interdependence of economies and markets\namplified the economic impact of SARS considerably, and instantaneous\nelectronic communications elevated public concern \u00ad- often to the point of\npanic -\u00ad and further added to the social and economic disruption caused by\nSARS.\n\nJust as Ebola came to symbolize the fear inspired by a new disease, SARS\nhas vividly depicted a truism of the infectious disease situation in a\nglobalized world: an outbreak anywhere places every country at risk. The\ncontainment of SARS \u00ad or any other epidemic-prone disease \u00ad requires\nunprecedented solidarity and makes such an effort a matter of self-interest\nfor every nation.\n\nOn the positive side, the power of electronic communications allowed the\nestablishment of 'virtual' networks of researchers, epidemiologists, and\nclinicians, who set aside competition and collaborated around the clock to\nidentify the SARS causative agent, sequence its genome, define clinical\nfeatures, and investigate modes of transmission in record time. The world\u0092s\nelectronic interconnectedness also contributed to the effectiveness of the\nfirst global alerts to SARS. The initial 12 March alert, followed three\ndays later by a stronger and more specific warning, provided a clear line\nof demarcation in the early history of SARS. Areas with cases prior to the\nalert experienced the most devastating outbreaks. These occurred in Hong\nKong, Hanoi, Singapore, Toronto, and China. Prior to 12 March, in all these\ncases, hospital staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and was\nspreading in health care settings, took no precautions to protect\nthemselves as they fought to save the lives of patients. SARS spread\nrapidly in these hospitals, and then spilled over into the wider community,\nresulting in the exportation of cases elsewhere.\n\nWith the notable exception of Taiwan, all other areas experiencing imported\ncases after the alerts were able to prevent further transmission altogether\nor hold the number of additional cases to a very small number. Most\nobservers attribute this success to the high level of awareness and\npreparedness that followed the alerts, greatly aided by responsible\nreporting in the media.\n\nKey weapon: the thermometer\nOne of the most important lessons learned to date is the decisive power of\nhigh-level political commitment to contain an outbreak even when\nsophisticated control tools are lacking. SARS has been brought close to\ndefeat by the diligent and unrelenting application \u00ad- on a monumental scale\n\u00ad- of centuries-old control measures: isolation, contact tracing and follow\nup, quarantine, and travel restrictions. Other successful measures include\nthe designation of SARS-dedicated hospitals to minimize the risk of spread\nto other hospitals, mass media campaigns to educate the public and\nencourage prompt reporting of symptoms, and the establishment of fever\nclinics to relieve pressure on emergency rooms, which have also been the\nsetting for many new infections. Screening at airports and other border\npoints and, through fever checks, throughout selected population groups has\nalso been effective.\n\nViet Nam broke the chain of transmission on 28 April, as did the\nPhilippines on 20 May, and Singapore on 31 May. Recommendations to postpone\nall but essential travel have been removed for all areas except Beijing, China.\n\nIn reaching these landmarks in the containment of SARS, the most severely\naffected countries and areas have identified and rapidly corrected\nlong-standing weaknesses in their health systems in ways that will mean\npermanent improvements for the management of all diseases. In addition,\nsystems of data collection and reporting, and new patterns of openly and\nfrankly communicating information to the public will hold the world in good\nstead when the next new disease emerges and the next influenza pandemic\nbreaks out.\n\nContinued surveillance and vigilance needed for a year\nSARS has repeatedly demonstrated its resilience, most recently with the\nresurgence of cases in Toronto. As underscored by researchers at this\nweek\u0092s meeting in Kuala Lumpur\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/conference/june_2003/materials/en/>, SARS has\nfeatures that can thwart even the best preparedness plans and slip past\neven the highest levels of awareness and suspicion. Under the right\nconditions, which remain poorly understood, single highly infectious people\nhave been known to set off trains of transmission that have led, in the\nworst cases, to almost 100 additional infections. In Singapore, 5 patients\naccounted for 103 of the total 206 cases in the outbreak.\n\nAnother significant problem occurs when SARS symptoms are masked by other\ndiseases. Many surprising clusters of cases have been fanned by such\npatients, as they do not arouse suspicion, are not isolated or managed\naccording to strict procedures of infection control, have no restrictions\non visitors, and are frequently transferred to other hospitals for further\ntreatment or tests.\n\nAlthough SARS is clearly coming under control, the need for continued\nvigilance is now greater than ever. The world still has a chance to\ninterrupt the chain of person to person transmission everywhere. However,\nbecause of the many unanswered scientific questions, particularly\nconcerning the origins of the virus and the contribution of environmental\ncontamination to overall transmission, WHO sees a need for at least a full\nyear of surveillance to determine whether the disease has established\nendemicity and to ensure that no cases have spread, undetected, to\ncountries with poor surveillance and reporting systems. If the disease has\nnot become endemic, the next big hurdles will concern the questions of a\npossible animal reservoir and possible seasonal recurrence. Scientists\ncannot rule out the possibility that the SARS virus hides somewhere in\nnature, as the Ebola virus does, only to return when conditions are once\nagain ripe for the efficient spread of infection to its new human host.\n\nFinally, as underscored in today\u0092s conference sessions, the development of\na reliable point-of-care diagnostic test must be given high priority.\nPending the availability of such a test, and for a while yet to come, every\ncase of atypical pneumonia has the potential to arouse suspicion and spark\na panic. Any hospital-based cluster of febrile patients with respiratory\nsymptoms will need extensive investigation. And any person with a fever or\ncough could be barred from international travel.\n\nAs long as a single case of SARS exists or is suspected anywhere in the\nworld, and as long as fundamental questions about the origins of the virus\nremain unanswered, all countries need to remain on guard.\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 18 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: WHO SARS website/ Beijing Government SARS website\n<http://www.who.int/entity/csr/sars/en/china2003_06_18.pdf>\n<http://www.beijing.gov.cn/english/englishsars/beijingen/detail.asp?ResourceID=63257>\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that no new probable cases were reported in the past 24 hours\nAs of 18 Jun 2003 a cumulative total of 5326 probable cases with 347 deaths\nhave been reported.

The decision to lift a travel advisory notice is based on consideration of\nseveral criteria, including the number of active cases, the number of new\ncases being reported daily, patterns of local transmission, and evidence\nthat cases are no longer being exported elsewhere. From the 55 cases recognized on that day,\nalarmingly concentrated in hospitals in Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore,\nthe outbreak exploded within a month to cause some 3000 cases and more than\n100 deaths in 20 countries on all continents. The move\nfollows vast improvements in case detection, infection control, and the\ntracing and follow up of contacts that led to a steep drop in the daily\nnumber of new cases.

Also in\nattendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of\nDisease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO\nRepresentative to China.\n\nThe briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking\nChinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began. The briefing\nfollowed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed\ndata and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and\nreceived frank and detailed answers.\n\nDr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the\nMinistry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and\nprevent SARS as \u0093excellent\u0094. He cited the high level of commitment and\ndetermination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for\nthe dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland\nChina.\n\nOne purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in\nbringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to\nshare their experiences with the rest of the world. Indications of the\neffectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very\nshort time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection\nand isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing.\nSuch measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an\ninfected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring\ncontrol efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person\ntransmission can be broken.\n\nOther effective measures include systems for both passive and active\nsurveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports,\na nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a\nvery large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may\nhave symptoms. \u0093We\u0092ve seen that there has been a massive effort to\nmobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,\nencouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS\ncases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\u0094\n\nSpecific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a\nsustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first\nhints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for\nfurther information, and wide variations in application of the national\ncase definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems\nrelated to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from\ninstitutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the\ninformation flow from provinces to the central level.\n\nAnother major concern is the large number of cases that have no known\nsource of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of\ntransmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a\nSARS patient has recently increased from 50 percent to more than 70 percent.\n\nIn the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO\nofficials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top\npriority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if\nhighly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.\n\n\u0093With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to\nstrengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,\u0094 said Dr\nBekedam. \u0093The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has\nto be strengthened for the long run.\u0094 He expressed doubt that the present\nsystem would be strong enough \u0093to hold back the tide\u0094 when confronted with\na resurgence of the disease.\n\nIn his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also\nstressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. \u0093We still\ndon\u0092t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the\nhuman population. We don\u0092t know if this disease is seasonal and will\ndecrease this year but come back next year.\u0094 Until proper research into\nthe origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict\nwhen the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a\nsuspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.\n\nWHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late\nApril [2003] following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious\nconcern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and\ncriticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a\npublic health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its\ncontrol. Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied\nthat these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to\nSARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese\nMinistry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS,\nits symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever\nchecks.\n\nChina is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was\nhome to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year [2002], and\npresently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide.\nThe WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in\nthis vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases\nand, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to\ndetect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure\nthat the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the\nlargest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.\n\nThe SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease\nsurveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is\nneglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any\nepidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation\u0092s economy. In\nthe view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more\nflexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any\nnew infectious disease threat.\n\nDuring the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the\ncountry\u0092s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a\nbackground of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly\ncomplicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also\nincreasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.\n\nThe containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is\nnot contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of\natypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients\nwith respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of\nSARS and spark widespread panic.\n\nIn an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following\nconclusion: \u0093If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be\nno chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of\nSARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as\nChina. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any\nstrategy to do this.\u0094\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nNo. new probable cases reported: 2\nCumulative no. cases: 688\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 687)\nExplanation: 1 previously reported prob. case excluded by reporting MD.\n\nCumulative no.

Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if\nhighly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.\n\n\u0093With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to\nstrengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,\u0094 said Dr\nBekedam. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any\nstrategy to do this.\u0094\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n< Indications of the\neffectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very\nshort time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection\nand isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese\nMinistry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS,\nits symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever\nchecks. Such measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an\ninfected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring\ncontrol efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person\ntransmission can be broken. \u0093The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has\nto be strengthened for the long run.\u0094 He expressed doubt that the present\nsystem would be strong enough \u0093to hold back the tide\u0094 when confronted with\na resurgence of the disease. In\nthe view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more\nflexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any\nnew infectious disease threat. The briefing\nfollowed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed\ndata and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and\nreceived frank and detailed answers. Some problems\nrelated to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from\ninstitutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the\ninformation flow from provinces to the central level.

The presence of influenza could greatly\ncomplicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also\nincreasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.

These cases are part of the 66 cases under treatment in\nhospitals. 34 are recovering patients in convalescence and in preparation\nfor discharge.\n\nOne patient died, bringing the total number of deaths attributable to SARS\nto 288. The deceased was a 34-year-old male.\n\nMeanwhile, temperature checks for all passengers at the airport, ports, and\nborder points continue to be implemented to watch for travellers displaying\nsymptoms of SARS. In addition, all incoming travellers are required to\ncomplete a health declaration. 5 passengers were screened out at these\npoints yesterday. After undergoing further medical checks, 3 were cleared\nof SARS symptoms and continued their journey, and 2 others were referred to\nhospitals for observation.\n\nAll household contacts of confirmed or suspected SARS patients are required\nto undergo home confinement for monitoring and treatment up to a maximum of\n10 days.

In addition, 'there\nhave been some staff reports of illness today which we are looking into,'\nsaid Dr. Donna Reynolds, from the Durham Region public health\ndepartment. The ages of those who are sick range from 28 into their 80s.\n\n'We will not know whether they are SARS or not until we have seen them go\nthrough this clinical course over the next 10 days,' said Dr. David Ross,\nLakeridge's SARS consultant and chief respirologist. 'They are all in\nisolation.' The first person became sick 1 Jun 2003. By Thursday [5 Jun\n2003], as more patients fell ill, management of the facility ordered staff\nto don full gown and glove protection. On Friday [6 Jun 2003], the local\npublic health authorities were called. By Saturday [7 Jun 2003], officials\nrealized they had 'around 10' people who were ill.\n\nDr. Don Atkinson, the chief of staff, said the first person to come down\nwith a respiratory illness had received dialysis at one of the hospital's\n27 satellite sites, so it wasn't immediately apparent there might be a\nproblem. Atkinson added that they cannot, at this point, link the first\npatient to the other 14.\n\nYoung, who only learned of the possible cluster on Saturday, said doctors\nare performing tests to see whether there might be another cause for the\nillnesses. But in the meantime, all are being treated like SARS cases. They\nare in respiratory isolation; public health is tracing their contacts and\nordering them into quarantine.\n\nThe hospital has been effectively moved to a Level 3 designation,\nindicating the highest level of SARS contamination. That designation puts\nall sorts of restrictions on admissions and transfers of patients as well\nas the ability of staff to work at other facilities.\n\nLakeridge officials told an afternoon news conference that 2 brothers --\nnot linked to the Whitby cluster -- arrived at their Oshawa site 9 days ago\nand were being treated for SARS. They're in critical and deteriorating\ncondition. The pair had visited their ailing mother at North York General\nHospital during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome at that\nfacility. But there is no known link between those 2 cases and the\nunexplained illnesses in Whitby.\n\nEfforts are under way to determine how the patients could have contracted\nSARS, if indeed they have the disease. No epidemiologic or 'epi' link to\nknown SARS cases has yet been identified for the group. An epi link is\nneeded to officially diagnose a probable or suspect case of SARS. But the\nexperience in Toronto's second SARS outbreak showed officials the early\nlack of an epi link is no guarantee a case isn't SARS. The current\noutbreak was sparked after officials at North York General Hospital, who\nwere alerted to suspicious pneumonias by worried nurses, decided the\npatients couldn't be suffering from SARS because they couldn't discover a\nlink to prior cases. As a consequence, the disease festered among patients\nin the orthopedic ward for weeks before eventually infecting staff.\nInfected patients transferred from the facility took the disease to several\nother hospitals in Toronto.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of 9 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8421 probable cases\nof SARS with 784 deaths reported from 29 countries. Since the last WHO\nupdate there have been 21 new cases of SARS reported. Canada has reported\n11 new cases, Taiwan 4 new cases, Hong Kong 3 new cases, and one each from\nChina, Thailand, and the United States.\n\nIn the above newswire, there is a discussion on a new cluster of febrile\nrespiratory illness in a health care facility. At present it is a\nsuspected outbreak of SARS and has led to implementation of infection\ncontrol procedures that assume this outbreak is due to SARS.

But the\nexperience in Toronto's second SARS outbreak showed officials the early\nlack of an epi link is no guarantee a case isn't SARS. After undergoing further medical checks, 3 were cleared\nof SARS symptoms and continued their journey, and 2 others were referred to\nhospitals for observation. The details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario is reporting 225 probable (66 active) and 136 suspect (9 active)\ncases. The pair had visited their ailing mother at North York General\nHospital during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome at that\nfacility. Together with local health\nauthorities, WHO epidemiologists are investigating the cause of this latest\nhospital cluster. That designation puts\nall sorts of restrictions on admissions and transfers of patients as well\nas the ability of staff to work at other facilities. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific\ncommunity settings. They\nare in respiratory isolation; public health is tracing their contacts and\nordering them into quarantine. At present it is a\nsuspected outbreak of SARS and has led to implementation of infection\ncontrol procedures that assume this outbreak is due to SARS. The number of new cases since last WHO update includes new cases reported\nfor 7, 8, and 9 Jun 2003, when these reports have been received. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of 9 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8421 probable cases\nof SARS with 784 deaths reported from 29 countries.

Other members of the\nteam include Dr Guenael Rodier, Director of Communicable Disease\nSurveillance and Response, and Dr Thomas Grein, who coordinates global\nresponse operations for SARS.\nThe purpose of the visit is to take stock of the current SARS situation in\nChina and exchange views on the next steps forward. In particular, WHO\nwould like to develop, in collaboration with the Chinese government, a\nresearch agenda that fully exploits the many intriguing lines of evidence\nuniquely associated with the SARS experience in China. WHO officials also\nwant to assess areas where Chinese authorities may require more support to\nensure that the disease is securely contained and to protect against a\nfuture recrudescence of cases.\n'SARS is a serious disease with many puzzling features,' said Dr Heymann.\n'Long-term containment depends on finding answers to a long list of\nscientific questions. China has much to offer the rest of the world.'\nSome immediate issues for discussion concern case definitions, procedures\nfor contact tracing, and the extent of local transmission in specific\nareas. The WHO team further seeks reassurance that hospital equipment and\nsupplies for infection control are adequate, especially in the poorer\nprovinces.\nMeasures may need to be found for sustaining China's present monumental\neffort to contain SARS, particularly as programmes for responding to other\npriority diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and TB, may suffer in the long run.\nWeaknesses in the health infrastructure, notably inadequate surveillance,\nreporting, and hospital facilities in some of China\u0092s poorer provinces,\nhave been of concern since the first report of a WHO assessment team was\nissued in early April [2003]. Both WHO and the Chinese Ministry of Health\nregard the emergency response to SARS as an excellent opportunity to\nstrengthen, throughout the mainland, systems for detecting and responding\nto all emerging and epidemic-prone infectious diseases. Such long-term and\ncomprehensive improvements will also strengthen China\u0092s capacity to respond\nto the next influenza pandemic, which many experts now regard as imminent.\nWHO officials are also hoping to learn which measures taken by China have\nso rapidly brought the country\u0092s SARS outbreak -\u00ad- the largest in the world\n-\u00ad- under control.\nThe first cases of SARS were detected in Guangdong Province, China, in\nmid-November of last year [2002]. That outbreak has since been brought\nunder control. Initial studies suggest a lower case fatality ratio than\nseen elsewhere, and high cure rates. In addition, a report on the\nepidemiology of the outbreak, issued in mid-May [2003] by the Chinese\nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention, provides evidence suggesting\nthat close contact with wild game animals is linked to the first sporadic\ncases, supporting a hypothesis that the SARS virus may have jumped to\nhumans from an animal reservoir. In addition, the outbreak in Guangdong\nProvince shows some features, in terms of incubation period and groups at\nhighest risk, that differ from the clinical picture seen in outbreaks\nelsewhere.\nAnswers to these and other questions will help build a solid scientific\nbasis for understanding SARS, predicting its future evolution, and knowing\nhow to respond should cases surface in new areas or resurface in areas\nwhere the disease has been contained.\nUnlike many new diseases that have emerged in the past 2 decades, SARS\nshows no sign of burning out on its own. If the disease is pushed back out\nof its new human host, this will result from the persistent application of\nsimple yet highly effective control tools: prompt detection and isolation\nof cases, strict infection control in hospitals, and tracing and\nappropriate follow-up of all contacts.\nBoth Viet Nam and Singapore have successfully broken the chain of\ntransmission and have since remained free of SARS. However, the risk of\nimportation of cases remains as long as cases are occurring anywhere in the\nworld.\nThe visit to China is one in a series in which WHO officials, including the\ncurrent Director-General, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, and the Director-General\nelect, Dr J.W. Lee, confer with health authorities at SARS outbreak sites\nhaving the greatest experience to date. Dr. Brundtland will be visiting Hong\nKong SAR later this month.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 10 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\nNo. new probable cases reported: 4\nCumulative no. cases: 686\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 680)\nExplanation: 2 previously reported suspected cases reclassified as probable\ncases by reporting MDs.\nCumulative no.

The man visited a Toronto\nhospital patient sharing a room with people who later came down with SARS,\nofficials said. His diagnosis raised the possibility of SARS spreading from\npeople carrying the virus but not showing any symptoms.

Those barriers\nwere put up Thursday [5 Jun 2003] after it became clear a problem might be\ndeveloping, he said. 5 staff are being monitored for possible infection,\nhe said.\n2 other cases in Oshawa General Hospital, however, are being investigated\nas potential SARS deaths. Whitby and Oshawa are located east of Toronto\noutside the GTA. Those 2 individuals were in intensive care. 'We review all\ndeaths in the intensive care unit,' Atkinson said, but the timing and\nsymptoms of those 2 cases were of special concern.

WHO officials also\nwant to assess areas where Chinese authorities may require more support to\nensure that the disease is securely contained and to protect against a\nfuture recrudescence of cases. Weaknesses in the health infrastructure, notably inadequate surveillance,\nreporting, and hospital facilities in some of China\u0092s poorer provinces,\nhave been of concern since the first report of a WHO assessment team was\nissued in early April [2003]. The visit to China is one in a series in which WHO officials, including the\ncurrent Director-General, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, and the Director-General\nelect, Dr J.W. Lee, confer with health authorities at SARS outbreak sites\nhaving the greatest experience to date. \n2 patients with underlying diseases died, bringing the total of deaths\nattributable to SARS to 290.\n Atkinson said because the facility\nwasn't an acute-care hospital, which is where institutional SARS outbreaks\nhave taken place in the Greater Toronto Area, it wasn't required to put up\nprotective barriers, although it did do the same screening. After undergoing further medical checks, 4 were cleared\nof SARS symptoms and continued their journey and the other was referred to\nhospital for observation.\n Both WHO and the Chinese Ministry of Health\nregard the emergency response to SARS as an excellent opportunity to\nstrengthen, throughout the mainland, systems for detecting and responding\nto all emerging and epidemic-prone infectious diseases.

The cluster under investigation in Ontario is still being reported in the\nnewswires but does not appear on either the Health Canada or Ministry of\n WHO officials are also hoping to learn which measures taken by China have\nso rapidly brought the country\u0092s SARS outbreak -\u00ad- the largest in the world\n-\u00ad- under control. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific\ncommunity settings. The WHO team further seeks reassurance that hospital equipment and\nsupplies for infection control are adequate, especially in the poorer\nprovinces. Until now, health\nauthorities have worked under the assumption that only symptomatic patients\nspread the illness. Measures may need to be found for sustaining China's present monumental\neffort to contain SARS, particularly as programmes for responding to other\npriority diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and TB, may suffer in the long run.

At the same time,\nexperiences elsewhere demonstrate the need for maintaining a vigilant\nand cautious approach to SARS, particularly in a country as large and\ndiverse as China.\nThe resurgence of cases in Toronto demonstrates how difficult it can\nbe to maintain control over a new disease characterized by many\npuzzling epidemiological and clinical features. The continued\nalertness of Singapore, which has most recently broken the chain of\nSARS transmission, demonstrates the importance of staying on guard,\nwith a high level of vigilance and preparedness, to ensure that a\nsingle imported case does not reignite an outbreak.\nBased on recent experiences and the many uncertainties about the\nbehaviour of SARS, WHO sees a need for caution in interpreting the\ndownward trend in the number of reported new cases in China.\n'SARS is still present in China, and WHO continues to regard China as\nthe epicentre of SARS,' said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for\nCommunicable Diseases at WHO. 'It is our job, together with Chinese\nauthorities, to try to prevent this disease from becoming permanently\nestablished in such a vast country.'\nThe next few months will prove crucial in the attempt to contain SARS\nworldwide, which now greatly depends on whether the disease can be\ncontrolled in China. Otherwise, cases in China -- with its long\nporous borders and large migrant populations -- could seed outbreaks\nelsewhere and would thus make SARS a continuing threat for the rest\nof the world.\nDr Heymann believes that the international community has much to\nlearn from Chinese experiences in controlling SARS, initially in\nGuangdong Province and increasingly in other parts of China. 'It is\nalso our job to work with the government to determine the factors\nthat have led to such a rapid fall in SARS cases compared to other\nsites where outbreaks have occurred.'\nWHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland has stressed the\nimportance, for the security of all populations, of fully\nunderstanding the situation within any country experiencing an\noutbreak of a disease that can threaten neighbouring countries or be\nspread internationally by the travelling public. 'This allows, within\na country, for WHO to do what needs to be done to help the rest of\nthe world,' she said, speaking on a SARS-related issue during last\nweek\u0092s World Health Assembly.\nAlthough great improvements in surveillance, reporting, infection\ncontrol, and public awareness have occurred in China in recent weeks,\nWHO remains concerned about the sensitivity of case detection in some\nprovinces, and about the capacity of the health infrastructure to\ncope with a challenge on the scale of SARS. A particular problem is\nthe large number of new cases reported (approximately half) without\ninformation on the source or setting of exposure. The absence of this\ninformation makes it difficult for WHO to assess the extent of local\ntransmission.\nLocal transmission of SARS, especially when it occurs outside a\nconfined setting, such as the health care environment, is one measure\nof the risk of infection for both residents and international\ntravellers. The pattern of local transmission is also an important\nconsideration when WHO issues travel advice designed to prevent\nfurther international spread of SARS.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 3 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Taiwan CDC [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nDate: 2 Jun 2003\nNo. new probable cases reported: 1\nCumulative no. cases: 679\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 684)\nExplanation: 6 probable cases have been cancelled by reporting physician\nCumulative no.

Update on Situation in Singapore 6 Jun 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_06/en/>\n[ProMED-mail would like to thank Marianne Hopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com>\nfor continued monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\nAs cases of SARS continue to decline, areas that have brought the\ndisease under control, often at great cost, are now seeking ways to\nprotect these hard-won gains against the hazards of imported cases.\nBecause even a single new case could spark another outbreak, it is\nimportant for national authorities to remain vigilant even as current\nnumbers of probable cases are diminishing.\nOfficials from Singapore and Malaysia met today at Woodlands, a\nSingapore border checkpoint, to strengthen cross-border efforts aimed\nat containing the spread of SARS. Officials from both countries\nagreed that travellers detected with fever at the land checkpoint\nwould be isolated and subsequently sent back to their point of\nembarkation. The Singaporean and Malaysian delegations agreed to\nupdate each other on health screening measures introduced at land,\nair, and sea checkpoints. Singapore has also announced that it will\ncontinue all current pre-departure screening measures until the\nregional SARS situation improves.\nIn addition, since the start of the SARS outbreak, when it became\napparent that travel could spread the disease globally, WHO has\ncollaborated with non-governmental organizations such as the\nInternational Air Transport Association and the International Civil\nAviation Organization to promote the adoption of measures aimed at\npreventing the spread of SARS via air travel.\nSingapore's Changi International Airport will soon become the world's\nfirst airport to implement new measures to guard against the spread\nof SARS, in accordance with procedures set out by the International\nCivil Aviation Organization. Changi was chosen as the test case\npartly due to Singapore's rapid response to SARS; it was the first\nairport to introduce thermal scanners to screen passengers for\nfevers. Since then, Singapore has also provided such scanners on loan\nto Toronto for use in that city's airport exit screening.\nIf Changi is determined to take all the necessary steps in accordance\nwith the International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines, which\nare in turn based on WHO recommendations, the airport will receive a\ncertificate. The global aviation body is readying a scheme to\nevaluate how well airports enforce anti-SARS measures, which include\nspecific procedures for screening passengers and airport workers. The\nmeasures also include distributing SARS information to passengers and\nguidance on handling suspected cases already on board aircraft and at\ntheir destinations.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 6 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nNo. new probable cases reported: 0\nCumulative no. cases: 676\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 677)\nExplanation: 2 probable cases have been cancelled by reporting\nphysician; 1 previously reported [suspected] case has been\nreclassified as a probable case by reporting physician\nCumulative no.

As a scientist who had been\ninvolved since the beginning of the SARS outbreak in Singapore and\nwho is still part of the current investigation, I wish to comment on\n2 points that were brought up in ProMED-mail dated Fri 30 May 2003,\nentitled 'SARS-worldwide (126).'\n(1) Singapore used its military forces to assist in contact tracing\nand enforcement of home quarantine. In addition to the above,\nSingapore also used military-related Research Institutes to assist in\nthe investigation of the SARS epidemic and to provide diagnostic\ntesting for SARS clinical samples. In mid-March 2003, the Defense\nMedical Research Institute (DMRI) commenced the SARS investigation\ntogether with the Virology Unit from the Singapore General Hospital.\nAnother military-related Research Institute which came on later in\nthe outbreak investigation was the DSO National Laboratories\n[information on the DSO laboratories can be found at the following\nURL <http://www.dso.org.sg/>. It is a not-for-profit research and\ndevelopment organization that works with the military in Singapore].\n(2) Management of the outbreak benefited from support from\nhigh-quality laboratory services. The Virology Unit of the Singapore\nGeneral Hospital [SGH] is our front-line national laboratory,\nproviding virological testing for a wide range of pathogens. However,\nin the situation of the SARS outbreak in Singapore, a number of other\nlaboratories formed these 'high-quality laboratory services'\nmentioned in point 2.\nIn mid-March 2003, right from the beginning, and before the\netiological finding that the unusual atypical pneumonia was caused by\nSARS, DMRI was already working alongside the Virology Unit of SGH.\nAlthough DMRI was not an official member of the WHO laboratory\nnetwork, information was released by WHO through the Virology Unit of\nSGH. The results from DMRI were fed back to the WHO in the same\nmanner. On 24 Mar 2003, WHO released the CDC primers for [the\nSARS-associated] coronavirus, and 3 days later we used the primers to\nobtain a positive PCR reaction from a primary contact of the first\nindex case. DNA sequencing revealed 100 percent match with the\nnucleotide sequence from the Bangkok index case. By then, positive\nPCR reactions and Coronavirus-like sequences using the Germany\nprimers BNIoutS2 and BNIoutAs were also obtained. Up to this point in\nthe SARS investigations, we had a lot of assistance and advice from\nChristian Drosten, Germany, and Leo Poon, HongKong, on the various\naspects of PCR reactions.\nThe findings were presented in the WHO meeting on SARS Etiology and\nDiagnosis: Current Status and Future Development, on 16 Apr 2003 in\nGeneva. The Virology unit in SGH also attempted to isolate the SARS\nvirus in a range of cell lines including Vero cells provided by DMRI\nwhile waiting for the shipment of Vero E6 to arrive from CDC,\nAtlanta. These were the isolates that were used for sequencing of the\ncomplete virus genomes (The Lancet, published online May 2003).\nLike all other scientists involved in the SARS investigation, DMRI\nalso explored the possibility of co-infection with a metapneumovirus\nand found no evidence whatsoever for it. By then the SARS epidemic\nhad become a crisis not only in Singapore, but worldwide. Colleagues\nfrom the Infectious Disease group in DMRI stopped all research work\nimmediately. Initial attempts to sequence the virus from infected\nVero cell cultures were also put aside as the group reorganised\nitself into a full-scale diagnostic laboratory to fulfill our\nnation's needs.\nOn 26 Apr 2003, the Singapore SARS Clinical Consortium was officially\nformed. The first objective of the consortium was to ensure that\nhealthcare and research laboratories in Singapore could undertake\ndiagnostic testing of the SARS clinical samples. By then, the volume\nof clinical samples submitted for SARS testing had exceeded the\ncapacity of the laboratories then involved. Various laboratories in\nSingapore were drawn into the consortium; these were from the 3\nhospitals -- National University Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital,\nand of course, Virology Unit in SGH; and from 5 Research Institutes,\nDMRI, DSO National Laboratories (who also reorganised into a\ndiagnostic laboratory), Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (who\nassisted the diagnostic setup in Tan Tock Seng Hospital), Singapore\nGenomic Institute (who took over the sequencing of virus genomes),\nand the National Environment Agency (who prepared the virus antigens\nfor serological testing).\nHowever, we must not forget the contribution from non-members of the\nSARS consortium. They include the clinicians and nurses who risk\ninfection to collect the best clinical specimens; our special courier\nservice involved in the logistics of sample distribution; and lastly\nour colleagues from the National University of Singapore, who\nassisted during the early days of the investigation with Electron\nMicroscopy (Electron Microscopy unit), and optimisation of the PCR\nprimers for diagnostic testing (Department of Microbiology).

A\nChinese government team has since released results showing that 66\nout of 508 animal handlers tested at markets in Guangdong had\nantibodies against the SARS virus.\nMicrobiologist Kwok-yung Yuen, who led the Hong Kong team, notes that\nin the general population, the level of antibodies against the SARS\nvirus is much lower. 'This suggests that the virus is jumping from\nwild animals to humans,' he says.\nBecause the animal virus is similar to the SARS virus, but different\nfrom other coronaviruses, it is now a prime suspect in the hunt for\nthe origins of SARS. The likelihood that the virus is moving the\nother way -- from humans to animals -- is diminished by ongoing work\non genetic sequences of the 2 viruses. These analyses suggest that\nthe animal version has an extra stretch of 29 nucleotide bases.\n'Viruses tend not to gain stretches of nucleotides when they jump\nacross species,' says Klaus Stoehr, a SARS expert at the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) in Geneva.\nBut uncertainties remain over the exact source of the virus. Only 6\ncivets were present in the market, and the fact that they all had the\nvirus suggests that they were infected recently. 'They could have\ngotten it from another animal during transport to the markets,' says\nZhang-liang Chen, a molecular biologist and president of the China\nAgricultural University in Beijing. Chen's group did not find the\nSARS virus in samples from 8 civets taken from other markets and in\nthe wild in Guangdong.\n[Byline: David Cyranoski and Alison Abbott]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[See ProMED-mail's moderator's comment in posting 20030525.1290.\nAuthentic, detailed, first-hand data on the findings from the cited\ninvestigators will improve our ability to evaluate the role of\nanimals as a source of SARS in China.

This represents an\nincrease of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.\n\nThe new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were\nreported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).\n\nHealth authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe\noutbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of\ncases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to\nmaintain current screening procedures at all border points for at\nleast one year.\n\nThe measures, which began at the end of March [2003], include use of\ninfrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health\ndeclarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred\nsince these measures were introduced.\n\nHong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases.\nApproximately 6 percent of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now\nthought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced\n1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second most severely hit\narea, with mainland China at the top.\n\nHong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease\nwas first brought to Hong Kong in late February [2003], when an\ninfected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at\nleast 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel\nwhere he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they\nreturned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore,\nand Toronto as well as Hong Kong.\n\nIn these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital\nsettings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and\nfighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the\ninfectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial\noutbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary\ntransmission outside the health care setting.\n\nAt present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in\nToronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported\ncases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit\nadditional cases to very small numbers.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 5 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nDate: 4 Jun 2003\nNo. new probable cases reported: 0\nCumulative no. cases: 677\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 678)\nExplanation: 2 probable cases have been cancelled by reporting\nphysician; 1 previously reported [suspected] case has been\nreclassified as probable cases by reporting physician\n\nCumulative no.

Mod.MPP]\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8402 probable SARS cases with 772\ndeaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an\nincrease of 10 new cases compared with yesterday. The new cases were\nreported in Canada (5), Hong Kong (1), Taiwan (2), Germany (1), and\nthe USA (1).\nNo new deaths were reported today. This marks the first day with no\nnew SARS deaths since 28 Mar 2003, when the cumulative totals stood\nat 1485 cases and 53 deaths.\nThe peak numbers of deaths occurred during the second week of March\n2003, when as many as 20 new deaths were being reported on some days.\nWith outbreaks at all the initial 'hot zones' either contained or\ncoming under control, SARS is clearly in decline, indicating that\nrecommended control measures are effective when combined with\npolitical commitment and determination.\nThe fact that the chain of transmission has been broken in Viet Nam\nand Singapore underscores the WHO position that SARS can be\ncontained, despite the absence of a vaccine, robust diagnostic test,\nand specific treatment. Control currently depends on prompt detection\nand isolation of cases, good infection control in hospitals, and the\ntracing and quarantine of contacts.\nViet Nam has remained free of new SARS cases since 8 Apr 2003. In\nSingapore, the last locally acquired probable case was isolated on 11\nMay 2003. No new cases have since been detected in either country\ndespite a high level of alert and aggressive investigation of all\nrumoured cases.\nThe experience in Toronto, where more than 70 new cases have been\nreported since 26 May 2003, underscores the risk of a resurgence of\ncases and the constant need for vigilance. A single imported case can\nreignite an outbreak or bring cases to a new area, if preparedness\nmeasures are weak.\nThe new case reported today in Germany, in a man recently returned\nfrom Taiwan, has resulted in the quarantine of around 50 contacts.\nThe man has been hospitalized in isolation.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 4 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Taiwan CDC [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nDate: 3 Jun 2003\nNo. new probable cases reported: 0\nCumulative no. cases: 678\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 679)\nExplanation: 3 probable cases have been cancelled by reporting\nphysician; 2 previously reported [suspected] cases have been\nreclassified as probable cases by reporting physician\nCumulative no.

Part of the problem\narises from certain unusual features of SARS that make this disease\nan especially difficult scientific challenge.\nFor many viral diseases, the greatest quantities of the causative\nagent are excreted during the initial phase of illness, usually in\nthe first few days following the onset of symptoms. This is often the\nperiod during which patients pose the greatest risk of infecting\nothers.\nSARS, however, follows a different pattern. During the initial phase\nof illness, virus shedding is comparatively low. Virus shedding peaks\nin respiratory specimens and in stools at around 10 days after onset\nof clinical illness. In effect, this unusual behaviour creates the\nneed for tests with a particularly high sensitivity.\nSuch tests do not yet exist. Because small quantities of the virus\nare initially shed, available tests, though developed with impressive\nspeed, are unable to detect SARS virus or its genetic material\nreliably during the earliest days of illness. The low sensitivity of\ncurrent virus detection tests is a particular challenge for SARS\ncontrol, as patients are capable of infecting others during the\ninitial phase and therefore need to be reliably detected and quickly\nisolated.\nIn SARS patients, detectable immune responses do not begin until day\n5 or 6. Reliable antibody tests can detect virus only by around day\n10 following the onset of symptoms.\nWHO continues to recommend use of its case definitions, based on\nclinical presentation, distinct chest X-rays, and history of possible\ncontact with SARS patients, to detect suspect and probable cases and\nmake management decisions.\nTo expedite the development of better diagnostic tests, laboratories\nin the WHO collaborating network have made critical biological\nmaterials and reagents available to any laboratory having a sustained\ninterest in the development of diagnostic tests, including the\ncommercial sector. A comprehensive bank of clinical specimens,\nincluding respiratory specimens and samples of blood, urine, and\nfaeces from SARS patients, has been established. The bank holds\nspecimens representing all stages of the disease, ranging from the\nonset of symptoms to recovery.\nDuring the development of diagnostic tests, such specimens are needed\nto assess how well a test will perform with real patients' specimens,\nas opposed to under the artificial conditions of a laboratory.\nSpecimens from the bank, which was set up by the Hong Kong Department\nof Health and the Hospital Authority, are being supplied by a\ncollaborating laboratory, at no charge, to developers of diagnostic\ntests. As a sample from a single specimen can be subdivided into 6 to\n8 identical sub-samples, laboratories can work in parallel on\nidentical specimens, which will further facilitate the assessment of\ncomparative performance. Identical samples also support\nstandardization of diagnostic tests to ensure consistent accuracy.\nLaboratories in the WHO network have also made available\nstandardizing reagents for virus and antibody tests. These reagents,\nwhich include samples of the inactivated virus and blood from\npatients in both acute and convalescent stages of illness, will allow\nuniform assessment of diagnostic results around the world against a\n'gold standard.'\nSera have been made available by collaborating laboratories in the\nUnited Kingdom and Hong Kong. Inactivated virus was prepared by the\nBernard-Nocht Institute in Germany. Distribution of these reagents\nwill be the responsibility of the Robert-Koch Institute, also in\nGermany. In return for the supply of these exclusive materials,\nrecipients of WHO support have agreed to offer test kits, once\navailable, at preferential prices to developing countries.\nTraining course in China\nWHO is currently coordinating a series of training courses in Beijing\naimed at establishing an efficient laboratory infrastructure for SARS\ndiagnosis in all provinces throughout China. Work of the WHO\nlaboratory network has made it possible to support the training\ncourses with test materials and reagents.\nTraining in the use of currently available tests is being provided by\nrepresentatives of the labs where they were developed, thus ensuring\nthat Chinese professionals benefit from the best first-hand\nexperience the world can offer. Trainers come from laboratories in\nthe USA, the UK, and Hong Kong.\nChina has already developed a highly promising ELISA diagnostic test.\nFor early detection of SARS virus, the PCR molecular test offers the\ngreatest potential under average hospital conditions. The Singapore\nGenomic Institute has made its PCR test available, at no cost, to\nsupport SARS diagnosis in China.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 2 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS website [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/lab/eia/index.htm>\n\nCoronavirus Antibody Testing at State Public Health Laboratories 30 May 2003\nCDC has made reagents for SARS coronavirus antibody testing available\nto state public health laboratories.

But such development 'has progressed more slowly\nthan initially hoped' because people produce only small amounts of\nthe SARS virus in the first few days of illness, unlike most other\nviral diseases, the World Health Organization said yesterday. This\nunusual feature of SARS will require highly sensitive tests, and it\nwill probably be several months before doctors will be able to use a\nsingle test to determine whether a person must be isolated because he\nor she has SARS.\nBefore a test can be relied upon, it must be run on specimens known\nto contain the virus to make sure it is accurate. And it has been\ndifficult, scientists said, to procure enough specimens from patients\nat different stages of the disease to do this. An accurate test is\nvital for public health because the consequences of a wrong diagnosis\ncan be severe. If SARS is missed, the disease can spread. And a false\ndiagnosis can mean unnecessary isolation, quarantines, and economic\nhavoc.\nA diagnosis of probable SARS is now based on a checklist of symptoms,\nchest X-rays, and information about whether a person has been exposed\nto someone with the disease or has traveled to a region where SARS is\nwidespread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has\ndeveloped a test that detects antibodies to the SARS virus in blood.\nBut it usually takes 21 days for a person to make enough antibodies\nto be detected. So the usefulness of such tests is generally limited\nto epidemiological studies. Most efforts to develop quicker tests\nrely on a technique called PCR (polymerase chain reaction). This\ntechnique can detect tiny amounts of a virus's genetic material.\nScientists have to initiate the test [by adding oligonucleotide\nprimers to anneal specifically to the target genome]. The CDC has\ndeveloped a PCR test, and a number of companies have developed their\nown [versions].\nOne of the first was developed by Artus in Germany, which is already\nproviding its test to labs around the world. Abbott Laboratories, one\nof the largest companies in diagnostic testing, [is licensed] to sell\nthe Artus test in the United States, Canada, and other countries.\nRoche, another leader in diagnostics, said it hoped to have a test\ndeveloped in a few weeks. Others developing tests include EraGen\nBioSciences of Madison, Wisconsin, and Prodesse of Waukesha,\nWisconsin. Polymerase tests can theoretically produce results in 2 to\n6 hours, though in actual practice results may not be ready for a day\nor 2, especially if the samples have to be sent somewhere for testing.\nDr. Heymann of the WHO said some of the early SARS tests produced\n'many false negatives,' meaning that they [did not detect] the virus\n[when it was present]. The CDC says PCR tests also tend to produce\nfalse positives, so that any positive finding should be confirmed by\nrepeating the test or having the specimen tested by another\nlaboratory.\nOne of the biggest problems now is that scientists do not yet know\nhow and when to take samples to have the best chance of finding the\nvirus. It can be found at different times in nasal and lung fluids,\nstool, and blood. Less SARS virus seem to be present in the first 5\ndays of illness than later, presenting a major challenge in\ndeveloping diagnostic tests, said Dr. Malik Peiris of the University\nof Hong Kong.\nPatients for testing have been hard to come by. That is a common\nquandary for companies, said Dr. Peter Heseltine, medical director\nfor infectious diseases at Quest Diagnostics, the nation's largest\nclinical laboratory company, which is developing its own SARS test.\nPart of the problem, especially for American companies, is that most\nSARS cases are in Asia. Doctors there are often too busy coping with\nthe immediate crisis to send samples to researchers developing tests.\nAlso some package delivery services had refused to carry SARS\nspecimens. The authorities say, however, that there has been no known\ncase of SARS infection from shipment of samples.\nTommy G. Thompson, US Secretary of Health and Human Services, and\nsenior officials of the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration met\nwith 9 diagnostic companies in Washington on Thursday. The officials\nurged the companies to develop SARS tests and promised to work with\nthe companies. 'We are trying to work with the Chinese government to\nimprove our access to samples from patients in China,' Dr. Mark B.\nMcClellan, the commissioner of the FDA, said in an interview. Dr.\nKlaus Stoehr, who directs the WHO's scientific investigation of SARS,\nsaid his agency had developed a specimen bank in Hong Kong that\nscientists could tap at no charge. 'We ask in return that if\ncompanies develop a licensed test they donate or sell it at a low\nprice' to poor countries, Dr. Stoehr said.\nSo far no company has applied for approval of a SARS diagnostic test.\nTests that are offered as a service by clinical laboratories or used\nfor research do not require FDA approval, so some test developers are\ndistributing tests without approval. But if a test is to be widely\nsold and used to guide treatment, the FDA expects the developers to\nseek approval, agency officials said. Several scientists said that\nbecause of the severe consequences of a missed diagnosis, a SARS test\nshould have rates of false negatives and false positives of less than\n5 percent, and preferably much smaller. Some first-generation tests\ncan detect the SARS virus but not the amount present.\nSuch quantitative information could be useful in determining who\nmight spread the virus or in monitoring a treatment. The tests also\nare not likely to provide results fast enough to be used, for\nexample, for airport screening. Participants at Friday's meeting in\nBethesda urged development of a type of test that looks for viral\nproteins that might be able to [meet such needs].\n[Byline: Andrew Pollack and Lawrence K.

In contrast, the isolates\nlinked to the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong (Urabani, Tor2, YKY, and\npossibly HKU-39849) all have a D [Asp] at that position.\nA review of [corresponding] sequences of [other virus species in the\nfamily _Coronaviridae_ ] indicates that this position is well\nconserved [with 4 strains of bovine coronavirus (LUN, ENT, Quebec,\nMebus)] and human coronavirus (229E), all having an E at that\nposition, like the mainland isolates [of the SARS coronavirus].\nHowever, 5 strains of murine hepatitis virus (A59, 2, ML-10, ML-11,\nPenn 97-1, JHM) all have a D at that position.\nThus, this position is well conserved within species, and the fact\nthat 2 sets of human isolates have distinct amino acids at this\nposition is likely to be significant and may explain the virulent\nnature of the isolates that established SARS in Hanoi, Toronto,\nSingapore, and possibly Hong Kong.\nThe position is also species-specific [in coronavirus isolates from]\npigs (Purdue, PUR-46-MAD, CV777) and chickens (Beaudette, LX4), all\nof which have a P [Pro] at that position.\nOf interest is a similar situation at position 244 in E2 [a putative\nglycoprotein]. This region is not well conserved in isolates other\nthan SARS, but of the 10 SARS isolates, the 6 mainland isolates have\na T [Thr], whereas the other 4 have an I [Ile], suggesting this is\nanother hot-spot.\nThe above data strongly suggest that the amino acids found at\nposition 5768 are not due to sequencing errors and that the position\nchange may have biological and clinical consequences.\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[Dr. Niman has observed a regularity in amino acid substitution at\nposition 5768 in several isolates of SARS virus and in isolates of\nsome other species in the family _Coronaviridae_, which perhaps has\nsome biological significance.

For research purposes, to enhance\nunderstanding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) disease\nprocess, WHO recommends that clinicians collect and store sequential\nsamples from patients with SARS for testing when diagnostic tests\nbecome readily available. This is particularly important for the\nfirst case(s) recognized in countries that have not previously\nreported SARS. Data on clinical and contact history should be\ncorrelated with laboratory findings to better understand the shedding\npattern of the virus and the period of transmissibility.\nSummary of sampling possibilities:\n---------------------------------\nFor practical reasons, and based on evidence provided by WHO\nlaboratory network, upper respiratory specimens are most suitable for\nvirus detection (isolation and RNA detection).

However, until standardized reagents for detection of\nvirus and antibodies are available and methods have been adequately\nfield-tested, SARS diagnosis remains based on the clinical and\nepidemiological findings: acute febrile illness with respiratory\nsymptoms not attributed to another cause and a history of exposure to\na suspect or probable case of SARS or their respiratory secretions\nand other bodily fluids.\nThose requirements are reflected in the current WHO case definitions\nfor suspect or probable SARS\n(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/casedefinition/en/>). However, in\nseveral countries (Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Italy,\nJapan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United\nStates of America) samples from suspected and probable SARS cases are\nbeing tested for SARS-CoV.\nLaboratory test result criteria for confirming or rejecting the\ndiagnosis of SARS remain to be defined.\n1. Molecular tests (PCR)\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) can detect genetic material of the\nSARS-CoV in various specimens (blood, stool, respiratory secretions\nor body tissues [see: Sampling for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\n(SARS) diagnostic tests at\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/sampling/en/>]). Primers, which are the\nkey pieces for a PCR test, have been made publicly available by WHO\nnetwork laboratories on the WHO web site. A ready-to-use PCR test kit\ncontaining primers and positive and negative controls has been\ndeveloped. Testing of the kit by network members is expected to\nquickly yield the data needed to assess the tests performance, in\ncomparison with primers developed by other WHO network laboratories\nand in correlation with clinical and epidemiological data.\nPrincipally, existing PCR tests are very specific but lack\nsensitivity. This means that negative tests cannot rule out the\npresence of the SARS virus in patients. Furthermore, contamination of\nsamples in laboratories in the absence of laboratory quality control\ncan lead to false positive results.\nPositive PCR results, with the necessary quality control procedures\nin place are very specific and mean that there is genetic material\n(RNA) of the SARS-CoV in the sample. This does not mean that there is\nlive virus present, or that it is present in a quantity large enough\nto infect another person. (see: Recommendations for laboratories\ntesting for SARS-coronavirus at:\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/coronarecommendations/en/>)\nNegative PCR results do not exclude SARS. SARS-CoV PCR can be\nnegative for the following reasons:\n- The patient is not infected with the SARS coronavirus; the illness\nis due to another infectious agent (virus, bacterium, fungus) or a\nnon-infectious cause.\n- The test results are incorrect ('false-negative'). Current tests\nneed to be further developed to improve sensitivity.\n- Specimens were not collected at a time when the virus or its\ngenetic material was present. The virus and its genetic material may\nbe present for a brief period only, depending on the type of specimen\ntested.\n2. Antibody tests\nThese tests detect antibodies produced in response to the SARS\ncoronavirus infection. Different types of antibodies (IgM and IgG)\nappear and change in level during the course of infection. They can\nbe undetectable at the early stage of infection. IgG usually remains\ndetectable after resolution of the illness.\nThe following test formats are being developed, but are not\ncommercially available yet:\n- ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay): a test detecting a\nmixture of IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum of SARS patients\nyields positive results reliably at around day 21 after the onset of\nillness.\n- IFA (Immunofluorescence Assay): a test detecting IgM antibodies in\nserum of SARS patients yields positive results after about day 10 of\nillness. This test format is also used to test for IgG. This is a\nreliable test requiring the use of fixed SARS virus on an\nimmunofluorescence microscope.\nPositive antibody test results indicate a previous infection with\nSARS-CoV. Seroconversion from negative to positive or a 4-fold rise\nin antibody titre from acute to convalescent serum indicates recent\ninfection.\nNegative antibody test results: No detection of antibody after 21\ndays from onset of illness seems to indicate that no infection with\nSARS-CoV took place.\n3. Cell culture\nVirus in specimens (such as respiratory secretions, blood, or stool)\nfrom SARS patients can also be detected by inoculating cell cultures\nand growing the virus. Once isolated, the virus must be identified as\nthe SARS virus with further tests. Cell culture is a very demanding\ntest, but currently (with the exception of animal trials) is intended\nonly to show the existence of a live virus.\nPositive cell culture results indicate the presence of live SARS-CoV\nin the sample tested.\nNegative cell culture results do not exclude SARS (see negative PCR\ntest result).\n******\n[3]\nDate: Tue 29 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: WHO SARS website, Tue 29 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/coronarecommendations/en/>\n\nRecommendations for Laboratories Testing by PCR for Presence of SARS\nCoronavirus RNA; As of 29 Apr 2003\n-------------------------------------------------\nWHO encourages each country to designate a reference laboratory for\ninvestigation and/or referral of specimens from possible SARS\npatients.

One death attributed to Hong Kong SAR occurred in a case medically\ntransferred from Viet Nam.\n[B] The list of affected areas can be accessed at:\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsareas/2003_04_29/en/> and is unchanged\nsince yesterday's report.\n[C] Update 42 - Travel advice for Toronto, situation in China 29 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_29/en/>\nWHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland announced this evening\nthat the travel advisory for Toronto will be lifted, effective\ntomorrow. Travel advisories for Beijing, Hong Kong SAR, and\nGuangdong and Shanxi provinces, China, remain in effect. Travel\nadvisories are issued following consideration of several factors,\nincluding the magnitude of probable SARS cases, the last dates of\ncases of community transmission, and the last dates of export of\ncases.\nDr Brundtland cited 3 changes in Toronto over the last week. The\nmagnitude of probable SARS cases has decreased. 20 days have passed\nsince the last cases of community transmission occurred. No new\nconfirmed exportation of cases has occurred. WHO has also been\nassured by Canadian authorities that proactive screening measures at\nairports will be implemented, as recommended by WHO.\nThere is no change in Toronto's status as an 'affected area.' Viet\nNam, which is the first country to have contained its SARS outbreak,\nwas removed from the list of affected areas yesterday. SARS is the\nfirst major new infectious disease of the 21st century and is taking\nfull advantage of the opportunities for rapid international spread\nafforded by a closely interconnected and highly mobile society. The\npurpose of travel advisories is to reduce opportunities for further\ninternational spread of what is a new, severe, and poorly understood\ninfectious disease.\nTravel advisories are reviewed daily. Advice is issued on the basis\nof a set of epidemiological criteria. The risk to international\npublic health, which is the principal concern for WHO, occurs when\nthe magnitude and dynamics of an outbreak allow an infected person to\nslip past control measures and undertake international travel,\npossibly seeding an outbreak elsewhere.\nSituation in China\nA total of 202 new probable SARS cases were reported across China\ntoday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 3303. 9\ndeaths were also reported today.\nProbable SARS cases have now been reported from 21 of China's 31\nprovinces. An additional 4 provinces have reported suspected cases.\nBeijing continues to report a high number of SARS cases, with 152 new\nprobable cases and 9 deaths reported today. China's capital city now\nhas a cumulative total of 1347 probable cases and 59 deaths.\nChina's largest number of cumulative cases remains concentrated in\nGuangdong Province, where the SARS outbreak began in mid-November\n[2002]. Only 10 percent of these cases are current. As 1201 patients\nhave been discharged and 51 have died, there are less than 150 SARS\ncases remaining in Guangdong's health care system.\nIn contrast, the rapidly growing number of new cases in Beijing\nimposes a heavy burden on the health care system and particularly its\nhospital capacity. In Beijing, 86 percent of cases (1198 cases) are\ncurrent.\nThe situation in western China continues to be of concern. New\nprobable cases in Shanxi (23) and Inner Mongolia (7) increase the\ncumulative totals to 266 and 120, respectively.\nWHO is working with local health authorities in Beijing to review and\nimprove the data needed to better monitor the SARS situation and\nassess the success of current control strategies. The WHO team of\nexperts also visited hospitals which will soon be opened as SARS\nreferral hospitals to assess their level of preparedness.\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 5462 probable cases with 353\ndeaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an\nincrease of 226 new cases and 24 deaths when compared with yesterday.\nOf the 226 new cases, 202 were reported today from China, of which\n152 occurred in Beijing. Due to difficulties of information\ntechnology, figures received from Chinese authorities yesterday were\nnot included in yesterday's cumulative update. The 24 deaths\noccurred in Canada (2), China (9), Hong Kong SAR (12), and Singapore\n(1).\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 29 Apr 2003\nFrom: Jack Soo <jack.soo@kyip.net>\nSource: China - Ministry of Health [trans. by JS] [edited]\n<http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/yqfb/1200304290090.htm>\n\nChinese mainland atypical pneumonia epidemic situation statistical data\n(Up to April 29th 10 o'clock)\n[HW = health worker]\nArea: new probable cases/ total probable cases // new HW cases/ total\nHW cases // new suspected cases/ total suspected cases // new deaths/\ntotal deaths// new discharged cases/ total discharged cases\nBeijing: 152* / 1347** // 50 / 255 // 149 / 1358 // 7 / 66 // 5 / 83\nTianjin: 1 / 44 // 0 / 23 // 8 / 75 // 0 / 2 // 0 / 0\nHebei: 9 / 39 // 1 / 7 // 12 / 57 // 1 / 4 // 0 / 0\nShanxi : 23 / 266 // 4 / 62 // 49 / 156 // 0 / 9 // 1 / 21\nInner Mongolia: 7 / 120*** // 2 / 16 // 30 / 208 // 1 / 8 // 0 / 0\nLiaoning: 0 / 1 // 0 / 0 // 2 / 4 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nJilin: 0 / 7 // 0 / 2 // 0 / 3 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nHeilongjiang: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nShanghai: 0 / 2 // 0 / 0 // 1 / 7 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nJiangsu: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 1 / 4 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nZhejiang: 0 / 3 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 6 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nAnhui: 1 / 5 // 0 / 0 // 1 / 3 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nFujian: 0 / 3 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 1\nJiangxi: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nShandong: 0 / 1 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 1 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nHenan: 1 / 12 // 0 / 1 // 3 / 13 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nHubei: 0 / 3 // 0 / 1 // 2 / 15 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nHunan: 0 / 6 // 0 / 0 // 1 / 4 // 0 / 1 // 0 / 5\nGuangdong: 4 / 1399 // 0 / 342 // 54 / 277 // 0 / 51 // 10 / 1201\nGuangxi: 1 / 17 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 4 // 0 / 3 // 0 / 8\nChongqing: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 2 / 6 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nSichuan: 0 / 12 // 0 / 0 // 4 / 21 // 0 / 2 // 0 / 3\nShaanxi: 3 / 8 // 0 / 0 // 1 / 26 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nGansu: 0 / 3 // 0 / 0 // 1 / 3 // 0 / 1 // 0 / 0\nNingxia: 0 / 5 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 3 // 0 / 1 // 0 / 0\nXinjiang: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 1 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 0\nTotal: 202 / 3303 // 57 / 709 // 321 / 2259 // 9 / 148 // 16 / 1322\n* Beijing added 152 cases of which 103 are new 49 cases was\ndiagnosed from suspected cases.\n** Beijing originally diagnoses the case of illness removes 4\nexamples (contains 1 health worker case).\n*** Inner Mongolia over-reported 1 case yesterday.\n[Change 'Members of medical profession' to 'health workers' earlier template]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 29 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 29 Apr 2003\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 1 PM 29 Apr 2003, there are an additional 15 patients confirmed\nto have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals\nearlier.

The 293 cell line was inoculated with materials derived from\nthe lungs to isolate causative agent(s). The agents in the organs and cell\ncultures were revealed by immunoassay.\nResults: Both chlamydia-like and coronavirus-like particles were found in\nelectron micrographs. Inclusion bodies containing elementary bodies,\nreticulate antibodies, and intermediate bodies of a chlamydia-like agent\nwere visualized in multiple organs from the 7 dead cases, including lungs\n(7 cases), spleen (2 cases), liver (2 cases), kidney (3 cases), and lymph\nnodes (1 case), by ultrathin section electron microscopy. In some sections,\ncoronavirus-like particles were seen concurrently. A coronavirus RNA\npolymerase segment (440 bp) was amplified from the lung tissues of 2 cases\nof SARS. After inoculation with materials from the lung samples, the 293\ncell cultures were also found to have chlamydia-like particles. Since the\nchlamydia-like agents visualized in both organs and cell cultures did not\nreact with genus-specific antibodies against chlamydia or monoclonal\nantibodies against _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ and _C. psittaci_, the results\nmight well be suggestive of a novel chlamydia-like agent.\n--\nJack Soo\n<jack.soo@kyip.net>\n[The detection of a chlamydia-like agent in all 7 cases and a\ncoronavirus-like agent in 2 cases may reflect merely the relative\nsensitivities of the detection methods employed rather than differential\npresence of the 2 organisms. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "Inclusion bodies containing elementary bodies,\nreticulate antibodies, and intermediate bodies of a chlamydia-like agent\nwere visualized in multiple organs from the 7 dead cases, including lungs\n(7 cases), spleen (2 cases), liver (2 cases), kidney (3 cases), and lymph\nnodes (1 case), by ultrathin section electron microscopy.

China now\naccounts for more probable cases than the rest of the world combined.\nBeijing reported the highest number of new cases (101) and deaths\n(9), for a cumulative total of 1440 probable cases and 75 deaths. Of\nthese new cases, 31 were previously reported as suspect cases while\n70 were reported for the first time.\n9 hospitals in the Chinese capital now deal exclusively with SARS\npatients. Just outside Beijing, a 1000-bed complex has been built to\naccommodate incoming patients. Health authorities have expressed\nconcern that the SARS outbreak could overwhelm Beijing's already\ncrowded hospitals.\nXiong Ke Chest Hospital will open a new wing with 100 more beds for\nSARS patients tomorrow, hospital officials told a WHO expert during a\nvisit to the hospital today. With 235 beds all occupied by SARS\npatients, the hospital already has the largest number of SARS\npatients in the country.\nDr James Maguire, from the WHO team of experts, said that despite\nextremely difficult working conditions, hospital staff had risen to\nthe occasion. 'Their esprit de corps is excellent. They are taking\ngreat pride in what they are doing and working very hard,' he said,\nadding that some staff work 45 days without seeing their families.\nThe rigorous infection control procedures included heavy and hot\nprotective clothing.\nDr Maguire, an epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, said there was a need for more\nspecialized equipment such as masks, gloves, ventilatory equipment,\nlayer protective gear, and ambulances to transport patients between\nhospitals. WHO staff are aware that other hospitals in the city may\nneed more or better supplies.\nThe disease continued to make its mark elsewhere in the country.\nJiangsu Province, which borders Shanghai, reported its first case\ntoday. More cases were reported in western China, with 34 more\nprobable cases from Shanxi and 7 more from Inner Mongolia, giving a\ntotal of 299 and 127 probable cases respectively. One fifth of the\ncases (65) in Shanxi Province are among health workers.\nHebei also continued to report more cases, with 9 more probable\ncases, giving a total of 48. Tianjin reported 5 more probable cases\nfor a total of 49 cases, while Guangdong reported 6, for a total of\n1405.\nUpdate on countries and cases\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 5663 probable cases with 372\ndeaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an\nincrease of 211 new cases and 19 deaths when compared with yesterday.\nThe new deaths were reported in China (11), Hong Kong SAR (7), and\nChina, Taiwan (1). This was the first death in Taiwan, where the\nnumber of probable SARS cases has more than doubled, from 37 to 78,\nover the past week. China, Macao SAR reported its first probable case\ntoday.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 30 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong Department of Health 30 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 30 Apr 2003\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 1 PM 30 Apr 2003, there are an additional 17 patients confirmed\nto have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals\nearlier.

In addition, clinical criteria have been revised to reflect\nthe possible spectrum of respiratory illness associated with\nSARS-CoV. Epidemiologic criteria have been retained. The majority of\nU.S. cases of SARS continue to be associated with travel*, with only\nlimited secondary spread to household members or health-care\nproviders (1).\nSARS has been associated etiologically with a novel coronavirus,\nSARS-CoV (2,3). Evidence of SARS-CoV infection has been identified in\npatients with SARS in several countries, including the United States.\nSeveral new laboratory tests can be used to detect SARS-CoV.\nSerologic testing for coronavirus antibody can be performed by using\nindirect fluorescent antibody or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays\nthat are specific for antibody produced after infection. Although\nsome patients have detectable coronavirus antibody during the acute\nphase (i.e., within 14 days of illness onset), definitive\ninterpretation of negative coronavirus antibody tests is possible\nonly for specimens obtained >21 days after onset of symptoms. A\nreverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test\nspecific for viral RNA has been positive within the first 10 days\nafter onset of fever in specimens from some SARS patients, but the\nduration of detectable viremia or viral shedding is unknown. RT-PCR\ntesting can detect SARS-CoV in clinical specimens, including serum,\nstool, and nasal secretions. Finally, viral culture and isolation\nhave both been used to detect SARS-CoV. Absence of SARS-CoV antibody\nin serum obtained <21 days after illness onset, a negative PCR test,\nor a negative viral culture does not exclude coronavirus infection.\nReported U.S. cases of SARS still will be classified as suspect or\nprobable; however, these cases can be further classified as\nlaboratory-confirmed or -negative if laboratory data are available\nand complete, or as laboratory-indeterminate if specimens are not\navailable or testing is incomplete. Obtaining convalescent serum\nsamples to make a final determination about infection with SARS-CoV\nis critical.\nNo instances of SARS-CoV infection have been detected in persons who\nare asymptomatic. However, data are insufficient to exclude the\npossibility of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV and the\npossibility that such persons can transmit the virus. Investigations\nof close contacts and health-care workers exposed to SARS patients\nmight provide information about the occurrence of asymptomatic\ninfected persons. Similarly, the clinical manifestations of SARS\nmight extend beyond respiratory illness. As more is learned about\nSARS-CoV infection, clinical and laboratory criteria will provide a\nframework for classifying the full spectrum of infection [see Figure\nat website link provided above -- the figure divides cases by\nclinical and laboratory criteria -- clinical criteria being mild\nrespiratory illness/asymptomatic, moderate respiratory illness\n(suspected case)/, and severe respiratory illness (probable case);\nthe possible laboratory criteria are laboratory confirmed/\nundetermined/ negative - Mod.MPP].\nThis surveillance case definition should be used for reporting and\nclassification purposes only. It should not be used for clinical\nmanagement or as the only criterion for identifying or testing\npatients who might have SARS or for instituting infection-control\nprecautions (4,5). This definition will be updated as new data become\navailable or if changes in the epidemiology of SARS occur in the\nUnited States.\nReferences\n1. CDC.

SB203580 also has\npotent anti-inflammatory activity: (see: Ermert M, et al.\nCyclooxygenase-2-dependent and thromboxane-dependent vascular and bronchial\nresponses are regulated via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in control\nand endotoxin-primed rat lungs.

Viet Nam reported a total of 63 SARS cases and\n5 deaths prior to 8 Apr 2003.\n\nThe absence of any new cases for a continuous 20-day (as of 28 Apr\n2003) period is an encouraging indicator that appropriate detection\nand protection measures, as recommended by the WHO, are able to\ncontain outbreaks and prevent their further spread. Viet Nam is one\nof several countries affected by local transmission of SARS that have\nconscientiously implemented detection and protection measures\nincluding:\n\n-prompt identification of persons with SARS, their movements and contacts;\n-effective isolation of SARS patients in hospitals;\n-appropriate protection of medical staff treating these patients;\n-comprehensive identification and isolation of suspected SARS cases;\n-exit screening of international travelers;\n-timely and accurate reporting and sharing of information with other\nauthorities and/or governments.\n\n'Viet Nam has effectively worked in partnership with other\ngovernments, WHO, and WHO's partners to stop its outbreak of SARS,'\nsays David Heymann, the Executive Director of the WHO's Communicable\nDiseases Cluster, adding, 'we are pleased that other countries in the\nregion with local transmission of SARS are also following appropriate\ndetection and protection measures, and cooperating with each other to\ndo so.'\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: 28 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 28 Apr 2003\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 1PM 28 Apr 2003, there are an additional 14 patients confirmed\nto have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals\nearlier.

After reviewing the existing\nanecdotal clinical experience with ribavirin, negative results from\nin vitro testing with ribavirin against the SARS-related coronavirus,\nand knowledge of reports of serious and unexpected adverse drug\nreactions, the working group reached a consensus that there is no\ndata to support the continued use of ribavirin outside of clinical\ntrials at this time. On 27 Apr 2003, Health Canada notified\nphysicians that the continued access to the drug is contingent upon\nthe submission and review of data in the possession of physicians\nwith respect to the use, safety, and efficacy of ribavirin for the\ntreatment of SARS.

This report covers cases reported\ninternationally in Australia, Germany, United States, and the\nPhilippines. Health Canada was notified 24 Apr 2003 of a reported\nBulgarian case of SARS; this is being investigated and information\nwill be provided when available.\n\nAustralia:\nA family of five (2 adults, 3 children) residing in the Greater\nToronto Area departed Toronto on 28 Mar 2003 and arrived in Australia\non 29 Mar 2003. Child A had onset of influenza-like illness symptoms\non 31 Mar 2003 and was hospitalized on 3 Apr 2003 with high fever and\nrespiratory distress; a chest x-ray revealed infiltrates. Child A was\ndiagnosed as a SARS case according to the WHO case definition, which\ndiffers from the Canadian SARS case definition by including Toronto\nas an 'affected area'. Child B had onset of cough on 25 Mar 2003.\nChild C had onset of cough 1 Apr 2003. Both Child B and Child C were\nsubsequently reported as probable SARS cases according to the WHO\ncase definition. All 3 children have since recovered. Both adults\nremained well. No clear epidemiologic link to any known SARS cases in\nCanada could be established. No secondary transmission was observed.\n\nIn Canada, none of the children would have met the case definition\nfor a probable or suspect case of SARS. Child A would have been\nclassified as GEO-linked, that is, a person with fever and symptoms\nconsistent with severe atypical pneumonia who has been in an area\nwith local chains of transmission of at least 3 generations, who does\nnot have an epidemiologic link. Children B and C would have been\nclassified as Persons Under Investigation (PUI).\n\nGermany:\nA 26-year-old woman was temporarily residing in Toronto. On 31 Mar\n2003 she flew from Toronto to Germany. She was asymptomatic until 3\nApr 2003, when she developed headache, nausea, and vomiting. She\nsubsequently developed fever (maximum 37.8 C) and cough. She was\nadmitted to hospital on 7 Apr 2003 and diagnosed with pneumonia.\nChest x-ray revealed infiltrates. No clear epidemiologic link to any\nknown SARS cases in Canada could be established. No secondary\ntransmission was observed.\n\nIn Canada, this woman would not have met the case definition for\nprobable or suspect SARS. Rather, because of her sub-38 C temperature\nand lack of epidemiologic link, she would have been classified as a\nPerson Under Investigation.\n\nUnited States:\nA 52-year-old man residing in Pennsylvania travelled alone by car to\nToronto on 28 Mar 2003. He drove back to Pennsylvania alone on 1 Apr\n2003. On 3 Apr 2003 he became symptomatic with chills, fatigue,\nmyalgia, headache, and diaphoresis (excessive sweating). On 6 Apr\n2003 a fever of 38.2 C was documented, and on 7 Apr 2003 he developed\nrespiratory symptoms and was hospitalized on 14 Apr 2003 with\npneumonia. Chest x-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates, and serum\nwas positive for coronavirus antibodies. He was diagnosed with\nsuspect SARS and would have been diagnosed as such in Canada. This\nman was discharged from hospital on 21 Apr 2003. The suspected\nexposure was thought to have occurred at a religious meeting he\nattended in Toronto on 28-29 Mar 2003, where a symptomatic SARS case\nwas also present. Pennsylvania health authorities have reported that\na family member had symptoms consistent with the suspect SARS case\ndefinition, but the onset of symptoms in the family member occurred\nbefore having had contact with the 52-year-old man. Therefore, this\nfamily member cannot be considered a transmission of any sort from\nthe case.\n\nPhilippines:\nA 46-year-old woman residing in the Greater Toronto Area departed\nToronto on 3 Apr 2003 and arrived in Manila, Philippines on 4 Apr\n2003 via Narita Airport in Japan. This case had onset of fever on 6\nApr 2003. On 11 Apr 2003 she developed diarrhea and cough; on 12 Apr\n2003 she was admitted to a local hospital, at which time a chest\nx-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates. She continued to deteriorate.\nOn 13 Apr 2003 5 family members drove her to a speciality hospital in\nManila where she was admitted and diagnosed with probable SARS. She\ncontinued to deteriorate and died the following day. The suspected\nexposure was thought to have occurred in Toronto on 1 and 2 Apr 2003,\nwhen on each occasion, she spent a short period of time in the home\nof a symptomatic probable SARS case. She did not have direct contact\nwith this SARS case; it is hypothesized she may have had contact with\nfomites in the home of the case. The Philippines authorities have\nreported secondary transmission to a health care worker, who has been\ndiagnosed as a probable SARS case. In addition, the father of the\nwoman, who was ill with cancer, died and is now being reported by the\nPhilippine Department of Health as a probable case of SARS. There is\ninsufficient information at this point to judge whether these 2 cases\nof transmission would have been classified as such in Canada, but the\nwoman would have been classified as a probable case of SARS in Canada.\n\nSummary\nOf the 6 persons originating from Canada who were diagnosed abroad as\ncases of SARS, 4 would not have met the case definition for probable\nor suspect SARS in Canada. Only the case reported in Pennsylvania and\nthe case reported in the Philippines would have met the SARS case\ndefinition in Canada.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Of additional note is a newswire report of a suspected case of SARS\nin Italy with travel history to Toronto, having visited her father,\nwho was recovering from surgery in a Toronto hospital.\n<http://www.kataweb.it/news/detail.jsp?idCategory=707&idContent=370613>\n- Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[6]\nDate: 28 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: News briefs [edited]\n\n[A] India from Reuters UK 28 Apr 2003 13:25:25 GMT\n<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/DEL14232.htm>\n\nIndia reported 2 new SARS cases on Monday, bringing the total number\nof people hit by the virus to 9 since doctors detected the country's\nfirst case in mid-April [2003].\n\nAnother 46 people are being tested for SARS, India's director general\nof health services, Dr. S.

Until those tests have been\nadequately field tested and shown to be reliable, however, SARS diagnosis\ndepends on the clinical findings of an atypical pneumonia not attributed to\nanother cause and a history of exposure to a suspect or probable case of\nSARS or their respiratory secretions and other bodily fluids. This\nrequirement is reflected in the current WHO case definitions for suspect or\nprobable SARS. Several countries (Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR\n[China], Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the\nUnited States of America) are, nonetheless, testing samples for suspected\nand probable SARS cases in research settings.\nInterpretation of test results\n------------------------------\nPositive test results: Positive test results indicate that SARS patients\nare, or recently were, infected with the SARS virus. Specificity of the\ndifferent tests still needs to be established.\nNegative test results: A negative SARS virus test does not mean that the\npatient does not have SARS. The reasons for negative test results in a\npatient with SARS include the following:\n(1) The patient is not infected with the SARS virus; the illness is caused\nby another infectious agent (virus, bacterium, fungus) or non-infective cause;\n(2) Test results are incorrect ('false-negative'). Current tests need to be\nfurther developed to improve sensitivity;\n(3) Specimens were not collected at a time when the virus or its genetic\nmaterial was present (pertains to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cell\nculture). The virus and its genetic material may be present for a brief\nperiod only, depending on the type of specimen tested; and\n(4) Specimens were collected early in the course of the illness and before\nantibodies had been produced (pertains to enzyme linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) and immunofluorescence assays).\nSampling for research: To enhance the future understanding of the SARS\ndisease process, WHO recommends that clinicians collect and store\nsequential samples from patients with SARS for testing when diagnostic\ntests become readily available. This is particularly important for the\nfirst case(s) recognized in countries that have not previously reported\nSARS. Guidelines on sample handling of suspected or probable SARS patients\ncan be found at the web site of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC), United States of America.\nStatus of laboratory tests currently under development\n------------------------------------------------------\n(1) Antibody tests:\n-- ELISA detects antibodies in the serum of SARS patients reliably as from\nday 21 after the onset of clinical symptoms and signs.\n-- immunofluorescence assays detect antibodies in serum of SARS patients\nafter about day 10 of illness onset. This is a reliable test requiring the\nuse of fixed SARS virus, an immunofluorescence microscope, and an\nexperienced microscopist. Positive antibody tests indicate that the patient\nwas infected with the SARS virus.\n(2) molecular tests (PCR):\nPCR can detect genetic material of the SARS virus in various specimens\n(blood, stool, respiratory secretions, or body tissue). Primers, which are\nthe key pieces for a PCR test, have been made publicly available by WHO\nnetwork laboratories on the WHO website. The primers have since been used\nby numerous countries around the world. A ready-to-use PCR test kit\ncontaining primers and a positive and negative control has been developed.\nTesting of the kit by network members is expected to quickly yield the data\nneeded to assess the test's performance in comparison with primers\ndeveloped by other WHO network laboratories.\nExisting PCR tests are very specific but lack sensitivity. That means that\nnegative tests can't rule out the presence of the SARS virus in patients.\nVarious WHO network laboratories are working on their PCR protocols and\nprimers to improve their reliability.\nLaboratories performing SARS-specific PCR tests should adopt quality\ncontrol procedures and identify a partner laboratory in their country or\namong the WHO collaborating research laboratories to cross-check their\npositive findings.\nLaboratories performing SARS-specific PCR tests should adopt strict\ncriteria for confirmation of positive results, especially in low-prevalence\nareas, where the positive predictive value might be lower. The PCR\nprocedure should include appropriate negative and positive controls in each\nrun, which should yield the expected results:\n(a) a negative control for the extraction procedure and a water control for\nthe PCR run;\n(b) a positive control for extraction and PCR;\n(c) an inhibition control -- the patient sample spiked with a weak positive\ncontrol to detect PCR inhibitory substances.\nIf a positive PCR result has been obtained, it should be confirmed by:\n(a) Repeating the PCR starting from the original sample; OR\n(b) Having the same sample tested in a second laboratory.\nAmplifying a second genome region could further increase test specificity.\n(3) Cell culture:\nVirus in specimens (such as respiratory secretions, blood, or stool) from\nSARS patients can also be detected by infecting cell cultures and growing\nthe virus. Once isolated, the virus must be identified as the SARS virus\nwith further tests. Cell culture is a very demanding test but is the only\nmeans to show the existence of a live virus.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[As noted previously (SARS - worldwide (64): etiology 20030423.0996),\ndiagnostic results reported from the Canadian National Microbiology\nLaboratory in Winnipeg contradict those reported earlier from Hong Kong.\nThe Hong Kong team found that 90 per cent of probable SARS cases harbored\nthe SARS-associated coronavirus, and found no trace of it in healthy\ncontrols.

Since these\nmutations were well conserved among mainland isolates, but not found in\nother isolates linked to the Metropole Hotel, I thought that the data\nsupported a Metropole source containing a mixture of variants. Although\nCUHK-W1 was isolated from a patient from the Prince of Wales Hospital, I\nhave been informed by Dennis Lo and Stephen Tsui, who were involved in the\nsequencing of this isolate, that the patient was not one of the 138\npatients linked to the visitor of the Metropole Hotel. This patient had\ntraveled to Thailand and mainland China shortly before developing SARS\nsymptoms, suggesting an origin outside of Hong Kong, consistent with the\nshared mutations found with mainland China isolates.\nIn addition to the D-to-E mutation at position 5768 in orf1ab, which is\nfound in CUHK-W1, GZ01, BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, there is another mutation\nof a T changing to I at position 244 in E2. This amino acid is found in all\n6 isolates. Thus, these 2 sets of shared mutations define 2 hot spots where\n6 of the sequenced isolates have one amino acid while the other 4 have\nanother. This distribution raises the possibility that the true mutations\nare the amino acids shared by the Tor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849\nisolates. I have not yet been able to obtain the history of the HKU-39849\nisolate. However, there is another shared mutation at position 577 of E2 in\nwhich S replaces A. This mutation is found in KYK, which is from a tourist\nwho stayed at the Metropole Hotel. However, the mutation is shared with,\nBJ01 and GZ01, isolates from the mainland. This mutation is not seen in\nTor2 or Urbani, 2 isolates closely linked to the Metropole Hotel. Thus, the\ndistribution of this mutation supports the notion that the infections at\nthe Metropole Hotel involved a number of variants. As noted above, however,\nTor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849 share amino acids found at position 5769\nin orf1ab and position 244 in E2, which supports a more closely related\nsource of the infections at the Metropole Hotel.\nThese shared mutations, especially the 2 loci that are shared by the 5\nmainland isolates and CUHK-W1, support an etiological role for SARS\ncoronavirus in SARS.\nHere is the list of shared mutations:\n(1) orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene]:\n3047 V to A [Val to Ala] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, CUHK-W1\n3072 V to A [Val to Ala] in CUHK-W1*\n3196 A to V [Ala to Val} in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03\n5768 D to E [Asp to Glu] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1\n(2) E2 [putative glycoprotein gene]:\n77 G to D [Gly toAsp] in BJ03, CUHK-W1\n244 T to I [Thr to Ile] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1\n577 A to S [Ala to Ser] in KYK, BJ01, GZ01\n(3) N [putative nucleoprotein gene]\n387 N to P [Asn to Pro] in GZ01, BJ02\n* This change is only in CUHK-W1, not BJ01, BJ02, BJ03 as reported\nyesterday [see: SARS - worldwide (63): etiology 20030423.0994] - the 3\nBeijing isolates have a shared mutation at position 3196, which is A to V,\nas well as V to A change at position 3047.\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\nDepartment of Bioengineering\nShriners' Burn Center\n51 Blossom Street, Room 422\nBoston, MA 02114 USA\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[For the benefit of readers, the key to the virus isolates identified above\nis the following:\nTor2 (Toronto)\nCUHK-W1 (Hong Kong)\nUrbani (Hanoi/Bangkok)\nKYK (Singapore)\nHKU-39849 (Hong Kong)\nGZ01 (Guangzhou)\nBJ01 (Beijing)\nBJ02 (Beijing)\nBJ03 (Beijing)\nBJ04 (Beijing)\n- Mod.CP]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 24 Apr 2003\nFrom: Henry L Niman, PhD <henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n\n2 distinct SARS virus variants from the same patient\n----------------------------------------------------\nThis issue of SARS mutations will likely be viewed with increased interest.\nMore information is now available on the 5 isolates from mainland China\n<http://www.genomics.org.cn:8080/bgi/news/zhongxin/news030416-2_fasta.htm>.\nOne area of interest is a comparisons of mutations in 2 isolates (BJ01 and\nBJ03) from the same individual. The partial data have been submitted to\nGenebank, and it is possible that there are some sequencing errors, but the\ndata are quite strong for multiple variants in the same individual.\nThere are 4 mutations shared between BJ01 and BJ03. 2 of them are found in\nall 5 mainland china isolates as well as CUHK-W1, and the 4 other isolates\nmay be the true mutations. The 2 widely shared alterations are at position\n5768 in orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene] (D changing to E) and I\nchanging to T at position 244 in E2 [putative glycoprotein gene].

This change is found in BJ02 and CUHK-W1\nat position 3047 in orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene]. The fourth\nchange shared between BJ01 and BJ03 is also found in BJ02 (A changing to V\nat position 3196 in orf1ab).\nHowever, in addition to the 4 mutations shared between BJ01 and BJ03, each\nisolate has mutations not shared. BJ01 has 3 additional mutations not\nshared with the 9 other isolates. All 3 changes are in orf1ab at positions\n1718 (L to W), 2230 (A to V), and 2770 (V to I). Since these changes have\nnot been seen elsewhere, sequencing errors remain a possibility (although\nnot likely).\nIn contrast, BJ03 also has 3 mutations not found in BJ01, but 2 of these\nmutations have been found in other isolates, reducing the likelihood that\nthey are due to sequencing errors. The mutation unique to BJ03 is also in\norf1ab at position 3426 (V to I). Of interest are the 2 other mutations in\nE2.

The finding of this A to S mutation in isolates from 2 other geographically\ndistinct regions, but not in another isolate from the same patient, raises\nissues of multiple variants within the same patient as well as tissue\ntropism linked to specific amino acid changes.

Besides this, there are no other new cases. 3 more patients have been\ndischarged, bringing the total number of patients who have recovered from\nSARS to 131; 47 SARS patients remain hospitalised, of whom 17 are in\nintensive care.\n'No visitor' rule\nStarting from 29 Apr 2003, all public hospitals will implement a no visitor\nrule for their patients. Of the 199 SARS cases reported so far, about 38\nper cent of them were visitors to hospitals. The no visitor rule is an\nadded precautionary measure to cut down the chances of visitors being\ninfected while in the hospital. It will also help prevent infection from\nbeing brought out of the hospitals into the community at large The no\nvisitor rule will not apply for departments or hospitals treating children\nor providing obstetric care, where the 1-visitor-per-patient-per-day policy\nwill continue.\nPostmortem results of the physician fatality\n[A] consultant vascular surgeon with the Department of General Surgery,\nSingapore General Hospital (SGH), passed away on 22 Apr 2003.

Her family\ncontacts, after developing symptoms compatible with SARS, were treated at a\nhospital within the GTA and subsequently transmitted the illness to\nhospital workers and other patients at that hospital. Over 100 hospital\nworkers at 3 GTA hospitals have since become ill. Initial descriptive\nepidemiology suggests that transmission occurred in association with the\ncare of patients who were not diagnosed with SARS and were not in isolation\nprecautions, as well as ill family members visiting in hospital.\nDisease control strategies included implementation of strict infection\ncontrol precautions in institutional settings, isolation of cases and\nsymptomatic contacts, and quarantining asymptomatic close contacts.\nInitially, SARS cases were isolated in hospital in negative pressure rooms.\nBy early April 2003, however, there was a critical shortage of standard\nairborne isolation beds within the GTA. In response, SARS negative pressure\nunits were created within some GTA hospitals to increase capacity to care\nfor SARS patients in controlled circumstances.\nSince these control strategies were implemented, transmission of SARS to\nhospital workers has decreased substantially. Nevertheless, transmission\nhas continued to occur in both high and low risk hospital settings within\nthe GTA despite these measures. High risk procedures have been identified\nand include intubation, suction, nebulized aerosol therapy, and positive\npressure non-invasive ventilation. Transmission of SARS to hospital staff\nduring difficult intubations of SARS patients has occurred in 3 different\nhospitals. In 2, undiagnosed patients were identified as the source of\ntransmission for 7 hospital staff. Although infection control precautions\nwere in place, compliance may not have been complete. In the third, a SARS\npatient was identified as the source of infection for 7 hospital staff; an\nadditional 6 remain under investigation. Although staff were reportedly\ncompliant with infection control precautions, one break in technique in one\ncaregiver was identified (a face shield was accidentally dislodged).\nTransmission of SARS to 10 to 11 hospital staff has also been identified in\nlower risk settings. Affected staff include physicians, nurses, and service\nassistants (such as porter/housekeeper) working in 4 different low risk\nSARS units and one community hospital. Initial investigation suggests that\ntransmission occurred while staff were wearing required personal protective\nequipment and following all recommended infection control precautions.\nIn response to the continued transmission of SARS to hospital workers,\nHealth Canada is leading an urgent investigation in collaboration with the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Province of Ontario,\nand Toronto Public Health. The investigation will include descriptive\nepidemiology, case control studies, air ventilation studies, and surface\ncontamination studies. In addition, an infection control directive\nspecifically for SARS Units is being developed.\n[C] Epidemiology update: interim report on the SARS outbreak in the Greater\nToronto Area, Ontario, Canada 24 Apr 2003\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/pef-dep/gta-20030424_e.html>\n1. Background\nSARS, a new atypical pneumonia, originated in Guangdong Province, China in\nNovember 2002. This syndrome appears to have some association with\ninfection with a novel coronavirus. While isolated travel-related cases\nhave been reported in Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and other parts of Canada,\nprogression to a large outbreak occurred in Toronto in March 2003\noriginating from a single traveler who returned from Hong Kong in late\nFebruary.\nThe outbreak now involves more than 250 people in the province of Ontario.\nHealth Canada is currently working with international partners in\ninvestigating reports of SARS cases exposed in Canada and diagnosed\nelsewhere. Countries include Australia, Philippines, United States,\nGermany, and Bulgaria. A summary of the international investigations\nassociated with travel to Canada will be reported separately. This interim\nreport describes the current results of the epidemiological investigation\nof the SARS outbreak in the GTA.\nThe outbreak in the GTA has proceeded through 5 major stages, listed below:\n- spread of SARS infection within the family of the index case;\n- amplification of the SARS outbreak through hospital-based spread;\n- transmission within immediate household members of the health care\nworkers, patients, and visitors to these hospitals;\n- isolated sporadic cases due to limited transmission in the workplace;\n- transmission in an extended family and associated religious group.\nThe following provides an overview of the epidemiology of the outbreak in\nthe GTA as of 19 Apr 2003.\n2. Spread of SARS infection within the family of the index case\nThe index case of SARS in Canada (case A) was a 78 year old woman who was\ninfected during a stay at a hotel in Kowloon district of Hong Kong between\n17 and 21 Feb 2003. She returned to Toronto on 23 Feb 2003; there was no\ntransmission of SARS to other passengers on her return flight. The\ninfection spread to her family members, 3 of whom visited their family\nphysician, who also became ill. 6 of the 11 members of this family\ndeveloped develop SARS and 2 died. Poutanen SM and colleagues have\ndescribed these cases in the New England Journal of Medicine\n<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/NEJM.oa030634v3.pdf>. These events\noccurred before 12 Mar 2003, at which time the World Health Organization\n(WHO) issued an alert about SARS and initiated global surveillance.\n3. Transmission in hospitals\n3.1. Hospital A\nThe son (case B) of the index case presented with respiratory symptoms at\nthe emergency room (ER) of hospital A on 7 Mar 2003. He was managed in a\ngeneral observation area of the ER and received a bronchodilator via a\nnebulizer. During this time, SARS was transmitted to 2 other patients who\nwere also in the ER general observation area (cases C and D).\nCase C began to exhibit symptoms of SARS 3 days later. He was brought to\nhospital A on 16 Mar 2003. Case C was admitted to the intensive care unit\n(ICU and placed in isolation. On the same day, his wife also became ill.\nSARS was transmitted to 2 paramedics and a firefighter by case C and to 4\nER staff, one housekeeper and 7 visitors who were in the ER at the same\ntime. The infection was also spread to 3 other members of the family. The 7\nER visitors transmitted the infection to 5 household members and other\nfamily contacts. In the ICU, case C was intubated by a physician who wore a\nface shield, mask, gown, and gloves when performing the procedure. He did\nnot use precautions when he was in contact with case C's wife. He\nsubsequently developed SARS and transmitted the infection to one member of\nhis family. In total, case C infected 15 other people.\nCase D became ill on 13 Mar 2003 and was admitted to hospital A. He\npresented with a myocardial infarction, SARS was not recognized, so\ninfection control precautions were not used. After 3 days in the Cardiac\nCare Unit (CCU), he was transferred to hospital B. Case D transmitted the\ninfection to 11 people in hospital A, including a paramedic, ER staff, CCU\nstaff, and a CCU patient.\nDue to the ongoing spread of infection in the hospital setting and concerns\nthat this potential for spread would result in more cases in hospital A,\nhospital A was closed to new patients and active surveillance for SARS was\nestablished. The crude attack rates in the ER were 13 per cent, the ICU 14\nper cent, and the CCU 50 per cent.\n3.2. Hospital B\nCase D was transferred to the ICU of hospital B and was not placed in\nisolation. Case D's wife was subsequently admitted to the surgical unit on\n21 Mar 2003. The couple was assumed to be the source of the hospital\noutbreak. Following the identification of 5 staff members ill with SARS,\nstrict infection control policies were applied. One staff member was a\ndialysis nurse who worked one shift while symptomatic. Follow-up with\ndialysis patients has failed to reveal any further transmission among this\ngroup. A total of 9 staff and one patient were infected by case D and his wife.\n4. Transmission in households\nTransmission of SARS in the household settings has resulted in 33 cases.\nFrom the analysis of the hospital A cluster of 129 cases, about 85\nhouseholds were involved. Transmission to family members occurred in 21 of\nthose households (25 per cent).\n5. Sporadic cases in workplaces\nThere have been 3 episodes in which occupational transmission of SARS has\nbeen suspected in settings other than health care facilities. In one\nworksite, a worker broke quarantine, became symptomatic, and worked with\none other person in a small room while symptomatic. This close contact\nbecame a probable case of SARS. Possible exposures have occurred in 2 other\nworksites, but at the time of writing this report, neither has evidence of\ntransmission of SARS.\n6. Transmission in an extended family and religious group\nThe elderly grandfather of a large family was taken to the ER of hospital A\non the evening of 16 Mar 2003, at the same time that case C and his wife\nwere there. 3 members of this family developed SARS. The infection\nsubsequently spread to their extended family. The grandfather died on 1 Apr\n2003. Visitation for this deceased person occurred on 3 Apr 2003 and ill\nfamily members were in attendance.\nMembers of this family are also part of a religious group that engaged in\nfrequent worship and social activities. This group held 2 large church\nevents on 28 and 29 Mar 2003 attended by 500 and 250 people, respectively.\nThe attendees at the second event were a subset of those who attended the\nfirst event. This family is also part of an extensive social network that\nincludes many extended families.\nTo date, a total of 31 probable and suspect cases of SARS have been\nidentified in this cluster. This number includes 14 members of the index\nfamily, 3 health care workers, and 14 other members of the religious group.\nActive surveillance and quarantine measures are being used to control the\nspread of SARS outside of this group.\n7. Epidemiological description of the outbreak as a whole\nThis section provides the descriptive epidemiology of the overall outbreak.\nThese data are presented as of 19 Apr 2003. At this time, there were 249\nreported cases of SARS, of which 129 (52 per cent) were listed as probable.\n7.1. Geographic location of residence\nCases of SARS have been reported by 4 of the 5 health units in GTA. The\ncity of Toronto and York region account for 84 per cent of all suspect and\nprobable cases.\n7.2. Distribution by age and sex\nOf the 249 reported cases, 155 (62 per cent) were female. This percentage\nis the same for both suspect and probable cases and probably reflects the\ndemographics of workers in the health care system. The distribution by age\nindicates a peak among people aged 36 to 64 years. This peak again reflects\nthe population who work in health care settings, which is one of the\nlargest risk groups for this outbreak. The mean and median ages are 44.6\nand 42.0 years, respectively. There have been 12 reported cases of SARS\namong children aged 16 and under.\n7.3. Distribution over time\nFigure 2 [see website link above] shows the distribution over time by\nsource of infection. There was early transmission in the family, followed\nby a large increase in cases due to transmission at hospitals A and B. With\nthe introduction of infection control procedures and public health\nmeasures, however, the number of new cases has decreased.\n7.4. Incubation period\nBased on the cases associated with hospital A, the incubation period ranges\nfrom 2 to 10 days, with a mean of 5 days and median of 4. This incubation\nperiod was calculated using 42 cases that had a single known contact with a\nSARS case.\n7.5. Period of communicability\nThere has been no observed transmission before the onset of symptoms.\n7.6. Mortality\nAs of 19 Apr 2003, there have been 14 deaths associated with SARS. The age\nof those who died ranged from 43 to 99 years of age (mean 74 years). Of\nthose with known medical histories, all deaths have been in those with an\nassociated medical condition. Further investigation is under way to\ndetermine the factors that are associated with an increased risk of death.\n7.7. Disposition of patients\nAs of 19 Apr 2003, 120 people with SARS (48 per cent) have been discharged\nhome following their illness. A further 4 have never been admitted to\nhospital and 14 have died. The remaining people are in hospital being\ntreated or monitored. Data on the average length of stay and the percentage\nof patients requiring ventilation are being collected for analysis.\nSource: Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, Ontario SARS\nScientific Advisory Committee and Health Canada.\n******\n[4]\nDate: 27 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Taiwan CDC [edited]\n\n[A] Taiwan SARS update 27 Apr 2003\n<http://203.65.72.83/En/dpc/ShowPublication.ASP?RecNo=871>\nAs of 9:00 AM on 27 Apr 2003, there were 250 possible SARS cases reported\n[my addition, and comparison with 26 Apr report suggests 288. - Mod.SH]: 55\nprobable, 72 suspected, 91 excluded, and 70 pending cases.

I do not think this judgement is correct.\nMany -- and probably most -- infectious diseases cause a wide range of\ndisease severity, from asymptomatic through mild symptoms to severe and at\ntimes lethal illness (just a few examples include Japanese B encephalitis,\nWest Nile fever, hepatitis A, etc.). Few would argue that someone with a\npositive IgM test to hepatitis A associated with mild non-icteric illness\ndoes not have hepatitis A infection simply because they are not jaundiced.\nSyndromic diagnosis has low sensitivity and specificity compared to\nlaboratory diagnosis. Syndromes usually only represent the more severe tip\nof the iceberg in any infectious disease.\nBecause the current definition of SARS is syndromic, many cases of\ninfection with the SARS agent are likely to be missed, because the severity\nof the illness is not great enough to be classified as SARS. Also there are\nother pathogens (some of which are difficult to identify in the laboratory\nor may be currently unknown) that will cause a similar clinical picture in\nsevere cases and still be correctly classified as SARS -- even though not\ndue to the SARS agent. The Canadian results, far from casting doubt on the\nsensitivity and specificity of current SARS-related coronavirus tests, are\nconsistent with what we should expect, especially away from the main focus\nof the epidemic.\nA lot of the confusion in the reporting of the SARS epidemic is caused by\npeople forgetting the difference between a clinical syndrome and an\ninfectious disease caused by a particular pathogen. I further suggest this\nconfusion may also be delaying a proper epidemiological investigation, as\nno such investigation can be complete unless the underwater part of the\niceberg (non-SARS infections with the SARS agent) is fully investigated.\n--\nPaul R Hunter MD FRCPath MFPHM\nProfessor of Health Protection\nEuropean Editor - Journal of Water and Health\nSchool of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice\nUniversity of East Anglia\nNorwich NR4 7TJ England\n<paul.hunter@uea.ac.uk>\n[Professor Hunter's comments have merit. The point we were trying to\nemphasize is that there is no substitute for experimental data and that an\nobvious control has not been included in the recommended diagnostic\nprotocol to date. We agree that syndromic surveillance alone does have a\nlow sensitivity and specificity when compared with laboratory diagnosis of\nan infection. In the case of the ongoing SARS epidemic, and in the quest to\nidentify an etiologic agent and appropriate laboratory diagnostic tools to\nconfirm the infection, there remains cause for concern if, in the middle of\nan outbreak of an unusual pneumonia, only 40 per cent of the 'probable\ncases' are positive using the currently available laboratory diagnostic\ntools. It would be highly unusual to have so many epidemiologically linked\ncases with an 'atypical pneumonia' that would not be caused by the same\netiology.

The index case of SARS in Canada (case A) was a 78 year old woman who was\ninfected during a stay at a hotel in Kowloon district of Hong Kong between\n17 and 21 Feb 2003. The\ninfection spread to her family members, 3 of whom visited their family\nphysician, who also became ill. Active contact tracing was initiated immediately\nto trace all people who might have come into close contact with the 3 SARS\ncases. In the third, a SARS\npatient was identified as the source of infection for 7 hospital staff; an\nadditional 6 remain under investigation. Because the current definition of SARS is syndromic, many cases of\ninfection with the SARS agent are likely to be missed, because the severity\nof the illness is not great enough to be classified as SARS. The\ncity of Toronto and York region account for 84 per cent of all suspect and\nprobable cases. Initial investigation suggests that\ntransmission occurred while staff were wearing required personal protective\nequipment and following all recommended infection control precautions. This incubation\nperiod was calculated using 42 cases that had a single known contact with a\nSARS case. Apr 2003 were identified as possible contacts, and they comprised 935\ntenants and stall holders, 553 employees and workers, and 337 regular\ncustomers.

The team was invited by\nShanghai authorities to assess the SARS situation in China's second largest\ncity.\nAmong its activities, the team examined the SARS surveillance and reporting\nsystem, investigated rumours that the case burden might be higher than\nofficially reported, and visited 10 health facilities, 3 district Centres\nfor Disease Control, and the municipal Centre for Disease Control. The team\nwas given free access to all requested data, patient registries, and\nfacilities, which were visited at very short notice.\nThe team found no evidence of systematic underreporting of cases, and\nconcluded that the level of preparedness and response was good. Reporting\nof cases appeared to be open, frank, and accurate. Over the past 3 to 4\nweeks, authorities designated 2 hospitals as dedicated to the treatment of\nSARS patients and set up cough and fever clinics. The team also found a\nvery high level of government commitment to tackle the SARS problem.\nMany questions remain about why Shanghai has been spared a SARS outbreak on\nthe scale of that seen in Beijing. Had a larger number of cases occurred,\nit is not certain whether the systems presently in place would have been\nable to cope.\nSituation in Hong Kong\nHealth authorities announced 17 new cases, including 3 in health care\nworkers, and 6 deaths, including the youngest SARS fatality in Hong Kong to\ndate. This was a previously healthy 28 year old man from the Amoy Gardens\nhousing estate cluster. The other deaths occurred in men aged 38, 40, 61,\nand 70 years, and a 45 year old woman. Only one of these patients, the 70\nyear old man, had a history of chronic disease. Of the 6 deaths announced\nyesterday, 3 were from the Amoy Gardens cluster.\nAuthorities are continuing to investigate a small cluster of cases in the\nTung Tau housing estate, where 6 cases have occurred in vertically linked\nflats. Presently available epidemiological evidence gives no reason to\nanticipate an outbreak at the estate on the scale of Amoy Gardens cluster,\nwhich involved more than 320 residents of a single building.\nA WHO team of environmental and 'sick building' experts arrived in Hong\nKong to assist local experts in the investigation of possible environmental\nsources of the virus.\nNo new cases in Viet Nam for 18 days\nThe SARS situation in Viet Nam has remained stable, at 63 cases and 5\ndeaths, for 18 consecutive days. Active investigation of numerous rumours\nhas failed to detect a new case of SARS throughout this period. If the\ntrend continues, the country will be removed from the list of affected\nareas on Monday, making Viet Nam the first country to contain its SARS\noutbreak. WHO officials in Viet Nam cautioned against a lapse in the\npresent high state of alert, as the risk persists that a single imported\ncase could seed an outbreak, as happened in February [2003]. However, the\ngovernment showed strong commitment at the highest level from the beginning\nof the outbreak. Task forces and provincial teams were established and have\nworked well. Good procedures of infection control were rapidly established\nand eventually proved effective in preventing further spread among hospital\nstaff.\nShould the country experience an imported case, this newly established\ninfrastructure would most likely be effective in preventing another large\noutbreak.\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today [26 Apr 2003], a cumulative total of 4836 cases with 293 deaths\nhave occurred in 26 countries. This represents an increase of 190 new cases\nand 19 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in Canada\n(3), China (7), Hong Kong SAR (6), the Philippines (1), and Singapore (2).\n******\n[2]\nDate: 26 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 26 Apr 2003\n--------------------------------------------------\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 1 PM 26 Apr 2003, there are an additional 17 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 3 health care workers (one from Caritas Medical Centre, one\nfrom Tai Po Hospital, and one from Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital).\nThe remaining 14 are other patients and contacts of patients with atypical\npneumonia.\nA total of 632 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have\nbeen discharged from public hospitals.

' Should the country experience an imported case, this newly established\ninfrastructure would most likely be effective in preventing another large\noutbreak. In today's update:\n[1] Worldwide - WHO\n The source said one of the patients suspected of suffering from SARS\nhad been working in China and returned to Azerbaijan last week, travelling\nthrough Turkey. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals and specific\ncommunity settings. The reports on the testing conducted in the various countries\ninclude results of PCR testing and antibody tests, but we do not have the\nspecifics of the data in Canada. Presently available epidemiological evidence gives no reason to\nanticipate an outbreak at the estate on the scale of Amoy Gardens cluster,\nwhich involved more than 320 residents of a single building.

There\nhave been 16 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific\ncommunity settings. This update is based on the information available to\nHealth Canada at this time.\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows: Ontario is reporting 136\nprobable and 131 suspect cases. British Columbia is reporting 4 probable\nand 47 suspect cases. New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.\nSaskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case. Alberta is reporting 5 suspect\ncases. Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases. So far, 127\npeople have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These people were\ntreated as suspect cases or as probable cases. These numbers are accurate\nas of 1:00 PM EDST 23 Apr 2003.\nHealth Canada Reaction to WHO Travel Advice\nOn 23 Apr 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) extended its\nrecommendation to postpone non-essential travel to include Toronto. Health\nCanada does not support the WHO's position; it is safe to travel to\nToronto. We have a clear understanding of the specific settings in which\nthis virus has been transmitted in Canada and confidence in the steps being\ntaken to manage infection control.\nA travel alert from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nprovides a more accurate assessment of the situation in Canada. It states\nthat: 'Currently, all cases in Toronto are linked to Toronto's original\nindex case and spread has been through person-to-person contact. SARS\ntransmission in Toronto has been limited to a small number of hospitals,\nhouseholds, and specific community settings.'\nHealth Canada will be formally challenging the WHO's assertion that Toronto\nis an unsafe place to visit through a letter to be sent today to the WHO.\nHealth Canada Investigation with Officials from CDC:\nOn 20 Apr 2003, Health Canada invited officials from CDC to come to Canada\nto lend their expertise to a Health Canada-led investigation. They will be\nassisting Health Canada officials as they spend time in hospitals in\nToronto, gathering information in order to compare the circumstances\nsurrounding those who were infected to those not infected. Health Canada\nand the CDC will report as soon as possible, outlining the probable cause\nof the transmission among health-care workers and recommendations for\nadditional measures that may be taken to prevent further spread.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 24 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmaill.org>\nSource: NY Times, 23 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/24/science/24CANA.html>\n\nWHO added Toronto today to its list of places that travelers should avoid\nbecause of an outbreak of a contagious respiratory disease, shattering this\ncity's image as a safe place to live and visit. The decision stunned local\nleaders and highlighted the impact of an illness that mysteriously emerged\nfrom the Chinese countryside only a few months ago. Toronto is the first\nlocality outside China to be designated as a threat to international health\nbecause of the respiratory disease. The group also added Beijing and Shanxi\nProvince in China to its list, joining Hong Kong and Guangdong Province as\nthe hot spots for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.\nOnly 2 weeks ago, health care officials here expressed optimism that the\ndisease could be stopped. Efforts to trace every case and isolate everyone\nwho came in close, unprotected contact with every patient appeared to be\nworking because of what seemed to be efficient public health efforts and a\nlargely obedient public's accepting of volunteer quarantine. The\nmetropolitan Toronto area had 136 probable cases Tuesday, a more than 40\nper cent rise in the last 2 weeks, although no new cases were reported today.\nEven before WHO urged travelers to go to Toronto only if necessary -- a\nmessage with enormous potential economic consequences -- the local hotel\nindustry had been devastated by almost daily cancellations of conventions.\nChinese malls and restaurants, the source of thousands of jobs in the large\nAsian immigrant community, are almost empty. A forecast by JP Securities\nCanada on Tuesday estimated that the epidemic in Toronto, Canada's largest\ncity and financial center, would cost the country $30 million a day. The\nfirm reduced its forecast for a 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent national\neconomic growth rate in the current quarter to 1 per cent.\nCity officials were livid about the WHO advice today, saying it was an\nover-reaction that would worsen the economic impact of the disease. 'I have\nnever been so angry in my whole life,' Toronto's mayor, Mel Lastman, said.\n'If it's safe to live in Toronto, it's safe to come to Toronto. This isn't\na city in the grips of fear and panic.'\nSeveral health officials acknowledged this week that they were confounded\nby the challenge of keeping SARS from racing through hospital wards, among\nfamily members of the sick, and then gradually spilling into the population\nat large. Many are beginning to conclude that no quarantine system can be\nfoolproof for a disease that is hard to detect and easily confused with\nother ailments in its initial phases.\nAbout two thirds of the 330 probable and suspected cases in Canada have\nbeen reported in Toronto. Perhaps more worrisome still is a report that a\nwoman who died a few days ago in the Philippines has now been determined to\nhave been infected with SARS in Toronto -- the first known death abroad\nlinked to the Canadian outbreak. WHO officials said that they took their\naction against Toronto, in part, because of evidence that the disease had\nbeen exported from the city.\nA WHO official said the international spread included the death of the\nPhilippine woman, a nurse, and 3 probable cases in Australia linked to\ntrips to Toronto.\nA US CDC team, invited by Canadian officials, arrived on Tuesday night to\nmonitor infection controls in Toronto hospitals. By the end of the week,\nCDC will issue health warning cards to travelers entering the United States\nfrom Toronto, urging them to see a doctor if they feel ill.\nThe daily number of new cases of SARS, brought here 2 months ago by an\nelderly Chinese immigrant, was coming down. The vast majority of more than\n7000 people put in quarantine had been released. 3 schools that had been\nclosed reopened. And most people infected were getting better. But the mood\namong doctors has changed drastically in recent days.\nThe Mistakes: a chain of missteps adds to the risks\n'SARS Rides the Rails,' blared a front-page headline in The Toronto Sun\nthis week, echoing the first hints of a mood change in this otherwise\nthoroughly stoical city.\nA nurse who was not yet aware she was infected with the mysterious\nrespiratory disease had taken 2 commuter trains at rush hour. When news got\nout, hundreds of panicky passengers called health hotlines to see whether\nthey might be in danger. 4 people have been found to have SARS in one north\nToronto condominium, and experts have been unable to tie one of them to any\npreviously known cluster. Some of the leaks are due to their own mistakes,\nhealth officials acknowledge. In one early miscalculation, an infected\npatient was transferred from one hospital to another, producing an entire\nnew pathway for the disease.\nLast week, an infected doctor, who has said he was unaware of his disease,\nwent to a well-attended funeral only 2 days before going into the hospital.\nAnd over the last weekend new reports indicated that the apparent breakdown\nin isolation techniques caused a new cluster of cases among up to 15\nemployees at a major city hospital. Officials hypothesize that the workers\nmay have been prematurely taken off protective gear while in contaminated\nrooms, with the virus apparently surviving on surfaces for as long as 24 hours.\nThe biggest potential leak surfaced 2 weeks ago, when health care officials\nbelatedly notified and isolated a church group of 500 people that had been\nexposed at a 3 Apr 2003 funeral and subsequent prayer meetings. Many\nmembers of the group were not notified until well after the incubation\nperiod of the disease, usually around 10 days, meaning they could already\nhave exposed others outside the group. One infected man from this group was\nturned away from as many as 3 hospitals before he received medical\nattention for SARS, as officials misdiagnosed his mild symptoms. 29 people\namong the church group, made up mostly of Philippine immigrants, have\nbecome sick, with probable or suspected cases. Several are in critical\ncondition. 2 traveled to Pennsylvania and Montreal before they were\nquarantined, fueling fears of further spread.\nHit hardest are the city's hospitals, where the forced quarantine of\nhundreds of health workers and the closing of several emergency rooms and\nother clinics has stretched manpower and resources to the limit. The\ninfection rate has grown so high in hospitals that this week workers were\nordered to wear 2 gloves and shields covering their entire faces when\ntreating patients. The use of full-body biohazard suits is being considered.\n[byline: Clifford Krauss]\n******\n[3]\nDate: 23 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Gulf-Daily News [edited]\n<http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Articles.asp?Article=49880&Sn=BNEW>\n\nThere are fears that the disease had reached the Philippines, especially\nfollowing the death of the Philippines' first 'probable' SARS [case] last\nweek.

By the end of the week,\nCDC will issue health warning cards to travelers entering the United States\nfrom Toronto, urging them to see a doctor if they feel ill. SARS\ntransmission in Toronto has been limited to a small number of hospitals,\nhouseholds, and specific community settings.' Many are beginning to conclude that no quarantine system can be\nfoolproof for a disease that is hard to detect and easily confused with\nother ailments in its initial phases. The issuing of\ntravel advice is a very difficult decision, as the economic consequences\nmay be significant. We have a clear understanding of the specific settings in which\nthis virus has been transmitted in Canada and confidence in the steps being\ntaken to manage infection control.

The new figures\nbring the cumulative number of reported probable cases in China to 2422. 21\nprovinces have now reported probable cases, with another 5 provinces\nreporting suspected cases.\nOf the 125 new cases, 24 occurred among health workers, including 17 in\nBeijing. Altogether, China has reported 541 cases in health workers during\nthe course of its SARS outbreak, which began in mid-November 2002.\nBeijing has reported the highest number of new cases (89), followed by\nGuangdong (15), and Inner Mongolia (11). Beijing reported 4 new deaths,\nbringing the cumulative number of SARS deaths in China to 110.\nWith a cumulative total of 1359 cases, Guangdong has the highest total\nnumber of probable cases, followed by Beijing, with 774 probable cases.\nThe number of reported cases in Beijing is increasing on a daily basis, and\nWHO is following the situation there closely. Data provided to date do not\nallow determination of whether newly reported cases are old SARS cases only\nnow coming to light, or newly detected cases. Better interpretation of\nreports and a more complete assessment of the underlying situation require\ninformation on date of onset and location of cases. WHO has proposed to\nBeijing city government officials a meeting (scheduled for 25 Apr 2003) of\nWHO technical staff with Beijing disease experts in order to review\nreporting procedures.\nYesterday Beijing authorities closed elementary and middle schools early as\nan extension of the already planned national May Day holidays. Schools have\nbeen asked to inform parents, teachers, and visitors about the symptoms of\nSARS. People with symptoms have been asked not to visit schools. School\nauthorities have been asked to conduct close monitoring and to send home\nany students, teachers, other staff, and visitors showing symptoms\nsuggestive of SARS.\nIn Shanghai, the WHO team of experts continued visits to hospitals and the\nShanghai Centre for Disease Control. The team has also examined procedures\nfor contact tracing. The team will present its findings tomorrow and return\nto Beijing on Saturday [26 Apr 2003].\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 4439 cases with 263 deaths have been\nreported from 26 countries. This represents an increase of 158 new cases\nand 12 deaths compared with yesterday. The deaths occurred in Canada (2),\nChina (4), Hong Kong SAR (4), and Singapore (2).

In the US\nas of 23 Apr 2003, a total of 245 SARS cases were reported to CDC from 37\nstates. Of these, 39 (16 per cent) had illnesses characterized by the\npresence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome consistent\nwith the interim US surveillance case definition for probable SARS (2). The\nremaining 206 (84 per cent) had fever and respiratory symptoms. Of the 39\nprobable SARS patients, 37 (94 per cent) had traveled to mainland China,\nHong Kong, Singapore, Hanoi, or Toronto; one (3 per cent) was a health care\nworker (HCW) who provided care to a SARS patient, and one (3 per cent) was\na household contact of a SARS patient. 27 (69 per cent) of the probable\nSARS patients were hospitalized, and one (3 per cent) required mechanical\nventilation.\nAs of 23 Apr 2003, of the 245 reported SARS cases, 45 (18 per cent) have\ndiagnostic SARS-CoV laboratory findings (positive findings based on\ndetection of antibody to SARS-CoV in serum; evidence of virus in\nrespiratory specimens by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction\nanalysis; or negative findings based on absence of antibody to SARS-CoV in\nconvalescent serum obtained >21 days after symptom onset). 39 reported\ncases (32 suspect and 7 probable based on SARS case definition) tested\nnegative for SARS-CoV; 6 have been identified with laboratory-confirmed\nSARS-CoV infection, all of which were classified as probable cases. 5 of\nthese 6 patients were described previously (3). Clinical information for\nthe one additional patient and the related public health investigation and\nactions are summarized below.\nPennsylvania\nOn 3 Apr 2003, a man aged 52 years developed symptoms including fatigue,\nmyalgia, headache, chills, and sweating. The patient had diarrhea on 5 Apr\n2003 and sought care at the emergency department (ED) of hospital A on 6\nApr 2003. A temperature of 100.7 F (38.2 C) was recorded, but diagnostic\ntesting was not performed, and he was discharged with a diagnosis of acute\nviral syndrome. By 10 Apr 2003, despite initiation of oral amoxicillin, his\nsymptoms progressed to include a dry cough, prompting him to visit his\nprimary-care provider. He had no fever or abnormal findings on physical\nexamination. A chest radiograph was normal. On 14 Apr 2003, the patient\nwent to the ED of hospital B with dehydration, cough, and severe shortness\nof breath. Bilateral interstitial infiltrates were present on chest\nradiograph. In the ED, he was identified as a suspect SARS patient about\n2.5 hours after arrival. He was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis\nof atypical pneumonia and possible SARS, and was placed in an isolation\nroom with negative pressure. Serum samples collected on 15 Apr 2003 (day 12\nof illness) demonstrated SARS-CoV antibodies. The patient received\nsupportive care and antibiotic treatment (levofloxacin for pneumonia and\nmetronidazole for diarrhea associated with laboratory-confirmed\n_Clostridium difficile_). By 17 Apr 2003, the patient's shortness of breath\nimproved considerably, and he was discharged on 21 Apr 2003.\nThe patient had traveled to Toronto, Canada, for a religious retreat during\n29--30 Mar 2003; the event has been linked to subsequent SARS cases among\nthe attendees (4). On 17 Apr 2003, a CDC team traveled to Pennsylvania to\nassist the Pennsylvania Department of Health in its investigation of this\npatient and his contacts. 23 HCWs (from hospitals A and B, the physician's\noffice, and the outpatient laboratory) who had contact with the patient\nbefore he was isolated in the hospital were evaluated for their types and\ndurations of contact with the patient, their use of personal protective\nequipment, and their subsequent health. 6 HCWs with unprotected, close\ncontact were furloughed for 10 days after exposure and advised to monitor\ntheir temperatures twice daily and to report fever and respiratory symptoms\nto the hospital's occupational health clinic. The 6 furloughed HCWs\nincluded 3 people from hospital B exposed on 10 Apr 2003 and 3 people from\nhospital B exposed on 14 Apr 2003. While furloughed, 2 HCWs had mild\nsymptoms (sore throat, rhinorrhea, mild cough, or headache), which resolved\nwithout treatment. 2 additional HCWs (one each from hospital B and the\noutpatient laboratory) who had mild respiratory symptoms subsequently were\nfurloughed from work, although neither had fever >100.4 F (>38.0 C) or\nevidence of SARS on clinical evaluation. After the man was identified as a\npotential SARS patient, HCWs in hospital B used fit-tested N95 respirators\nand wore gowns and gloves but did not wear eye protection.\nThe patient had close contact with 4 family members before SARS was\ndiagnosed. Beginning 9 Apr 2003, the patient and his family members\nreported intermittently wearing surgical masks during close contact. One\nfamily member reported illness consistent with the case definition for\nsuspect SARS, but the symptoms began before contact with the index patient;\nthis family member's illness has resolved and people who had contact with\nthis family member are being monitored. Among 6 additional non-family\ncontacts, one reported new respiratory symptoms since exposure, but\ncontinues to be without fever or other symptoms of SARS. The investigation\nis ongoing and SARS-CoV testing of specimens from all contacts is under way.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\nThe majority of suspect and probable cases of SARS in the United States\ncontinue to be travel-associated, with only limited secondary spread to\ncontacts such as family members and HCWs. Toronto has been added to the\nlist of areas with suspected or documented community transmission of SARS\nincluded in the interim US SARS case definition (2). SARS transmission in\nToronto has been limited to a small number of hospitals, households, and\nspecific community settings. In particular, cases of SARS have been\ndocumented among some members of a religious community who attended a large\ngathering in Toronto in late March [2003]; some of these people infected\nmembers of their households and other close contacts (4). In response to\nthese reports, CDC recommended that US travelers to Toronto observe\nprecautions to safeguard their health, including avoidance of places in\nwhich SARS is most likely to be transmitted (such as Toronto health care\nfacilities) (5). The Pennsylvania resident who attended this religious\nmeeting is the only reported US patient with SARS associated with travel to\nToronto. The availability of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV is critical to\nthe more precise characterization of the epidemiology and clinical spectrum\nof the SARS epidemic, both worldwide and in the US. Many US patients,\nparticularly those with milder clinical illness, have tested negative for\nSARS-CoV, reflecting the low specificity of the current case definition,\nwhich captures people with respiratory infections caused by other\ninfectious agents, and underscoring the importance of obtaining\nconvalescent serum samples to make a final determination about infection\nwith SARS-CoV. CDC is planning to update its interim surveillance case\ndefinition for SARS to include laboratory criteria in addition to the\nclinical and epidemiologic criteria.\nCareful attention to infection control precautions, both in home and health\ncare settings, remains critical to containment of SARS. Symptomatic people\nshould use infection control precautions to minimize the potential for\ntransmission and should seek health care evaluation (6). Patients should\ninform health care providers about the symptoms in advance so arrangements\ncan be made, if necessary, to prevent potential transmission to others in\nthe health care setting. Patients in ambulatory settings should be screened\npromptly for fever, respiratory symptoms, recent travel, and close contact\nwith SARS patients (7). The investigations summarized in this report\nsuggest that, although both patients and health care providers are aware of\nappropriate infection control precautions, additional efforts are needed to\nensure that recommended precautions are instituted immediately when SARS is\nsuspected and that such precautions are used consistently and correctly\nthereafter.\nReferences\n1.

In today's update [1][C] there\nis more information about the outbreak in China, including the fact that\nprobable cases of SARS have now been reported from 21 provinces, with\nsuspected cases reported from an additional 5 provinces. From available\ndata, a cumulative total of 2422 probable cases of SARS have been reported\nby China, of which 541 cases (22 per cent) were in health care workers.\nWorldwide, cases have been reported in 26 countries. We look forward to\nseeing more detailed epidemiological data on the outbreak in China, by\nprovince, when these data become available.\nThe information provided in CDC's MMWR article [4][B] with results of\ncurrent laboratory testing is curious. According to this article, of the\n245 reported combined suspected and probable cases, 45 (18 per cent) had\npositive laboratory tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus; 39 of the\n245 (15.9 per cent) had negative results, 32 suspected and 7 probable cases\n(7 out of 37 probable cases or 19 per cent) were negative for the SARS\nassociated coronavirus), and 6 of the probable cases (16 per cent) were\nreported to have positive tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus. While\nthese are small numbers, one wonders whether the discussion that 'CDC is\nplanning to update its interim surveillance case definition for SARS to\ninclude laboratory criteria in addition to the clinical and epidemiologic\ncriteria' might not be premature. Of note, Dr Frank Plummer of the Canadian\nNational Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg is quoted in a NY Times\narticle today: 'Dr Plummer's team in Winnipeg has tested about 3000\nspecimens from 95 probable and 90 suspect cases in Canada and Asia. His\nteam identified the SARS virus in about 40 per cent of the probable cases\nand 35 per cent of the suspect cases. He said he was surprised to find the\nvirus in about 20 per cent of an additional 250 people who were not\nsuspected of having SARS but who were tested because they had come to\nCanada from affected areas in Asia or who had mild symptoms not thought to\nbe SARS. Although the 250 were not randomly chosen as scientific controls,\nDr Plummer said he was still surprised at the number who tested positive.'\nIt appears the verdict is not yet in on the sensitivity and specificity of\ncurrently available tests, or whether the SARS-associated coronavirus is\nthe 'full answer'. <http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/24/science/24INFE.html>.\nWe await further information on this issue. - Mod.MPP]", "summary": "Many US patients,\nparticularly those with milder clinical illness, have tested negative for\nSARS-CoV, reflecting the low specificity of the current case definition,\nwhich captures people with respiratory infections caused by other\ninfectious agents, and underscoring the importance of obtaining\nconvalescent serum samples to make a final determination about infection\nwith SARS-CoV.

While\nthese are small numbers, one wonders whether the discussion that 'CDC is\nplanning to update its interim surveillance case definition for SARS to\ninclude laboratory criteria in addition to the clinical and epidemiologic\ncriteria' might not be premature.

No new cases of\nSARS have been detected in Viet Nam for 17 days in a row, despite a high\nlevel of awareness and good surveillance. Although numerous rumors have\nbeen reported, all have been investigated by WHO and government officials,\nand all suspect cases have been determined to have other causes.\nThe most recent probable case was detected on 8 Apr 2003, bringing the\ncumulative total in Viet Nam to 63 cases. Detection of that case initially\nbrought disappointment, as it occurred after no new cases had been reported\nover an 8 day period. Since the outbreak was first recognized in Hanoi in\nlate February [2003], 5 deaths have occurred. As of today, 5 patients\nremain in hospital.\nViet Nam was the second country to experience a SARS outbreak. The first\nwas China, where an outbreak began in Guangdong Province in mid-November\n[2002].\nIf no new cases are detected by 30 Apr 2003 (a date which marks the end of\n2 incubation periods), Viet Nam could become the first country to be taken\noff the list of SARS-affected countries. This achievement would also make\nViet Nam the first country to successfully contain its SARS outbreak.\nSARS was first identified by Dr Carlo Urbani, a WHO infectious disease\nspecialist. Dr Urbani alerted the world to SARS when cases of an unusual\nand severe respiratory disease began appearing among health staff treating\na Chinese-American businessman at the French Hospital in Hanoi. The\npatient, a 48 year old resident of Hong Kong, was admitted to hospital on\n26 Feb 2003 with fever and respiratory symptoms. His recent travel history\nincluded trips to Guangdong Province, Shanghai, and Macao SAR. By 20 Mar\n2003, at least 22 staff at the Hanoi hospital were ill with influenza-like\nsymptoms. 20 had signs of pneumonia, and 2 were in serious condition. The\nChinese-American businessman died of SARS in Hong Kong on 13 Mar 2003. Dr\nUrbani died of SARS in Thailand on 29 Mar 2003. WHO country staff attribute\nViet Nam's success in combating SARS to the quick manner in which the\ncountry initially reacted. 'After Carlo identified the disease, we were\nable to influence the hospital to take the right infection control measures\nvery quickly,' said Pascale Brudon, the WHO representative in Viet Nam.\nThe commitment of the Vietnamese government came soon thereafter, including\nhigh-level support for a WHO coordinated response in Hanoi. 'The first\npriority was to contain the disease and monitor each case,' said Brudon.\nInternational collaboration to combat SARS came quickly via the Japanese\ngovernment and Medecins sans Frontieres, who both worked under the umbrella\nof the WHO initiative in Viet Nam.\nViet Nam was fortunate in that the country had only a single index case,\nwho spent less than 3 days in Hanoi prior to hospitalization. This short\ntime in the community effectively limited opportunities to transmit the\nSARS virus to a contained hospital environment.\nViet Nam's northern Quang Ninh province recently began barring Chinese\ntourists at its overland border with China in an effort to prevent\nimportation of SARS. This move comes ahead of any decision by the\nVietnamese national government to seal its border with China indefinitely,\nas has been recommended by the country's ministry of health.\nWHO is currently working with 4 major laboratories to develop a clinically\nvalidated diagnostic test for SARS. Standard test reagents are being\nestablished to assess the quality of the test and ensure its reliability.\nWhen the test has been developed and clinically validated, it can be used\nreliably to confirm cases of SARS. However, test development and validation\nare expected to take at least another 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, laboratories in a growing number of countries have\ndeveloped SARS diagnostic tests, often based on information made available\nat the WHO web site. It is extremely important for national authorities and\nmedical and hospital staff to understand the limitations of currently\navailable tests. Their use as the basis for treatment decisions may give a\nfalse sense of security that can allow persons carrying the SARS virus, and\ntherefore capable of infecting others, to escape detection.\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 4649 cases with 274 deaths have been\nreported from 26 countries. This represents an additional 210 cases and 11\ndeaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in China\n(5) and Hong Kong SAR (6).\nIn China, the Ministry of Health has today informed WHO of 180 newly\nreported probable cases. The breakdown by location is Beijing (103), Inner\nMongolia (23), Guangdong (15), Tianjin (13), Hebei (12), Shanxi (11), and\none case each in Henan, Guangxi, and Sichuan. These latest figures bring\nthe cumulative number of probable cases reported in China to 2601. Among\nhealth workers, a total of 38 new probable cases were reported from Beijing\n(17), Tianjin (9), Hebei (5), Inner Mongolia (5), Shanxi (1), and Guangdong\n(1).\nBeijing reported 3 deaths, Shanxi 1, and Guangdong 1, bringing the\ncumulative number of deaths in China to 115. The fact that cases continue\nto occur in health workers underscores the need for better infection\ncontrol in hospitals. In Beijing, WHO is still awaiting data giving dates\nof onset and the location of cases in order to fully assess the situation.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 25 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health 25 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 25 Apr 2003\n--------------------------------------------------\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 1 PM 25 Apr 2003, there are an additional 22 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 4 health care workers (one from Caritas Medical Centre, one\nfrom Union Hospital, one from Tseung Kwan O Hospital, and one from Tuen Mun\nHospital).

This morning,\nsenior Health Canada and Ontario Ministry of Health officials met with WHO\nofficials by teleconference.

To date, 8 probable and 14 suspect SARS cases have been linked to\nthe market.\nThe first case in the cluster, a 64 year old worker at the market, died on\n12 Apr 2003. His illness has been linked to a 31 Mar 2003 visit to a\nrelative in hospital at Singapore General Hospital. Other probable cases in\nthis cluster include 2 other workers at the market, a taxi driver who\ncarried the first patient from his home to the market, and 4 relatives,\nincluding 3 grandchildren of market workers.\nRigorous contact tracing has linked all 14 suspected SARS cases, associated\nwith the market, to workers, visitors, and family members.\nIn an effort to contain the outbreak, health authorities have issued some\n1200 home quarantine orders. Visitors to the market during the period of 5\nto 19 Apr 2003 have been urged to watch for symptoms and call a hotline for\nimmediate medical assistance should symptoms arise.\nData available to WHO indicate that early diagnosis and prompt supportive\ncare improve clinical prognosis. As of today, Singapore has reported 186\nprobable SARS cases, with 16 deaths. Tracing and follow up of contacts and\nisolation of patients in designated wards of a single SARS hospital have\nbeen key features of the government's response to SARS.\nChina\nChinese authorities have now reported a cumulative total of 2001 SARS\ncases, with 92 deaths. Of the 482 cases reported in Beijing, 78 are said to\nbe health care workers. In the first reports of atypical pneumonia in China\nsubmitted in mid-February [2003], about 30 per cent of cases were said to\nbe among health care workers.\nRecent reports indicate that SARS has now spread to some of China's poorest\nprovinces, including western Guangxi, northern Gansu, and Inner Mongolia.\nChinese authorities have announced plans to send SARS prevention teams to\nShanxi, Inner Mongolia, Henan, and Ningxia, where cases have also been\nrecently reported, as well as to Guangdong.\nA WHO team is in Shanghai investigating the extent of the SARS outbreak in\nthe country's largest city. Officials from Beijing, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and\nMacau will meet tomorrow in Beijing to coordinate policies for responding\nto SARS. The meeting underscores the international dimensions of the SARS\noutbreak, which is increasingly being viewed as a problem beyond the\ncontrol of any single government acting alone.\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 3947 probable cases with 228 deaths have\nbeen reported to WHO from 25 countries. The 11 new deaths were reported in\nChina (6) and Hong Kong SAR (5).\n[Our thanks to Marianne Hopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for continuous monitoring\nof WHO update reports. - Mod.MPP]\n******\n[2]\nDate: 22 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health 22 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 22 Apr 2003 (issued jointly by the\nDepartment of Health and the Hospital Authority)\nAs of 1 PM 22 Apr 2003, there are an additional 32 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 10 health care workers (3 from United Christian Hospital, 2\nfrom Prince of Wales Hospital, 2 from Tai Po Hospital, one from Princess\nMargaret Hospital, one from Yan Chai Hospital, and one from Tuen Mun\nHospital). The remaining 22 are other patients and contacts of patients\nwith atypical pneumonia.\nA total of 461 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have\nbeen discharged from public hospitals.

Among the family\nmembers are 2 children, aged 18 months and 10 years, respectively. So far,\n1204 home quarantine orders have been issued.\nKandang Kerbau Hospital Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH): a 16 month\nold toddler admitted to KKH for severe asthma died on Tuesday, 15 Apr 2003.\nThe child died from severe asthma and lung infection, leading to acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Postmortem findings confirm that this\nchild died from ARDS. To date, tests for coronavirus are negative. A\nspecimen taken from the child's airway showed the presence of adenovirus.\nSiblings of the toddler were admitted to TTSH for observation. A child who\nshared a cubicle with toddler at KKH was admitted to TTSH for observation\nof pneumonia. All 3 children have been discharged well from TTSH. The older\nsibling of the toddler was also found to have adenovirus.\nAdenovirus is not a new virus, but neither is it a common respiratory\nvirus. It is one of several causes of community-acquired pneumonia. People\ninfected with adenovirus usually have symptoms such as cough, high fever,\nand red eyes. ARDS is also not new. KKH sees about 6 cases a year. The\nusual causes of ARDS include viral infection, severe pneumonia, near\ndrowning, and aspiration pneumonia (choking). The mortality rate for ARDS\nis up to 80 per cent.\nSummary of SARS cases\nDischarged: 110\nHospitalised: 60 (including 19 in intensive care)\nDeaths: 14 + 2 (pending postmortem findings)\nTotal: 186\nSuspected: 87 (including 5 children under 18 years)\nUnder home quarantine: 1798\n[The identification of adenovirus infection in the infant death related to\nARDS serves as a reminder that other causes of ARDS continue to occur\nduring the current outbreak of SARS. This also serves as a reminder that\nSARS is still a diagnosis of exclusion, after other etiologies have been\nruled out.

The number of confirmed cases in Beijing as of 8 PM on\nMonday rose to 588, including 28 deaths, according to the New China News\nAgency in a dispatch on Monday afternoon.\nThe sudden increase in official figures did not reflect a major surge in\nillness, but the confirmation of suspected cases 'after further\nexamination,' the agency reported. [There were reports of 402 suspected\ncases in the first report from China, with increased case numbers from\nBeijing -- see ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (60): cases\n20030420.0972 - Mod.MPP] The number of patients in the city labeled as\nsuspect cases, meanwhile, rose to more than 600 due to 'improved\nsurveillance and reporting efforts,' the news agency said.\nThe national total of diagnosed SARS cases -- as of 9:20 PM on Monday,\naccording to another report by the official news agency -- was 2158, with\nanother 918 suspect cases. 97 patients had died. Apart from Guangdong and\nBeijing, a few cases have now been reported in each of 14 other provinces\nor municipalities.\n[B] India from the International Herald Tribune 22 Apr 2003\n<http://www.iht.com/articles/94037.html>\nIn India, a bride infected with SARS, who insisted on celebrating her\nwedding against the advice of doctors, may have infected guests along with\nthe groom and the priest, health officials in the state of Maharashtra\nsaid. That the Indian wedding took place with a SARS infected bride showed\nhow ill-prepared the country remains for combatting the disease, said\nSanjeev Malik, secretary-general of the Indian Medical Association.\nFollowing the ceremony at a Methodist Church in Pune, about 160 kilometers\n(100 miles) southeast of Bombay, the bride was immediately sent to join her\nmother and brother in a hospital isolation unit while health officials\nquarantined 25 members of the wedding party. The bride and her mother had\ntested positive for the disease after coming in contact with the bride's\nbrother, the second confirmed case of SARS in India. He had traveled for\nthe wedding from Jakarta via Singapore, health officials said.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's worldwide update from WHO gives a cumulative total of 3947\nprobable cases with 228 deaths, reported from 25 countries. Noteworthy is\nthe mention/discussion of multilateral meetings between health officials\nfrom Beijing, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau scheduled for 23 Apr 2003 in\nBeijing to coordinate policies for responding to SARS. Taking into account\nprior political impediments, such a meeting is a sign of the seriousness of\nthe countries in the region towards developing a coordinated effort for\ndisease control measures.\nThe lay press have been covering the apparent increases in case fatality\nrates observed during the course of this outbreak. Some have commented on\nhow unusual this is, as the usual situation is a decrease in the case\nfatality rate as increasing numbers of cases are reported, including milder\nclinical presentations. The Health Canada data presented in [5] above are\nworth a comment. With 14 deaths reported, the case fatality rate is 4.4 per\ncent if one uses all suspected and probable cases reported as the\ndenominator (316); but is 10.1 per cent if one uses only probable cases\nreported (129) as the denominator. A key distinction between a suspected\ncase and a probable case is the presence of pneumonia on chest radiograph\nin the definition of a probable case. This factor alone makes the\ndenominator of probable cases likely to be those with a more serious\nclinical presentation, and eliminates potential milder clinical\npresentations from the 'pool of cases' used as the denominator for the\ncalculation of the case fatality rate.\nKeeping this in mind, until we are able to confirm cases of SARS with\ncertainty -- and until we are able to confirm milder clinical presentations\nas due to the same etiologic agent as the one responsible for the more\nsevere cases of pneumonia that meet the clinical and epidemiological\ncriteria for probable case of SARS -- we may continue to show apparently\nhigher case fatality rates. Another point to keep in mind is that at\npresent, the denominators in use are 'all cases', not just cases whose\nfinal outcomes are known; hence the denominator contains many cases whose\nfinal outcomes are unknown.

This temporary advice, which is an extension of travel\nadvice previously issued for Guangdong Province and Hong Kong SAR, China\nwill be reassessed in 3 weeks.\nSubsequent information from the Chinese government about the magnitude of\nthe SARS outbreaks in Beijing and Shanxi Province has been reviewed by WHO.\nThis assessment has considered the size of the outbreak, including both the\nnumber of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases, the extent of\nlocal chains of transmission, and evidence that travellers are becoming\ninfected while in one area and then subsequently exporting the disease\nelsewhere. On the basis of this assessment, WHO is extending its 2 Apr 2003\ntravel advice to include Beijing and Shanxi Province.\nUsing the same criteria, WHO has assessed the SARS situation in Toronto,\nCanada. The outbreak in this area has continued to grow and has affected\ngroups outside the initial risk groups of hospital workers, families,\nvisitors, and other close person to person contacts. In addition, a few\npeople with SARS, now in other countries in the world, appear to have\nacquired the infection while in Toronto. On the basis of this information,\nWHO is also including Toronto in the extension of its SARS-related travel\nadvice.\nThis advice will be re-examined in 3 weeks time, which is twice the maximum\nincubation period of SARS. The WHO travel advice is issued in order to\nprotect public health and reduce opportunities for further international\nspread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February [2003],\nthat has spread along the routes of international air travel. As of 22 Apr\n2003, a cumulative total of 3947 cases had been reported from 25 countries\non 5 continents. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS\nand contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage.\nThe SARS situation is assessed daily to determine whether other areas need\nto be included in the travel advice and if additional precautionary\nmeasures are required.\n[ProMED-mail thanks Marianne Hopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for monitoring WHO\nreports. - Mod.MPP]\n******\n[2]\nDate: 23 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 23 Apr 2003\n--------------------------------------------------\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 1 PM 23 Apr 2003, there are an additional 24 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 4 healthcare workers (2 from Princess Margaret Hospital, one\nfrom Prince of Wales Hospital, and one from Caritas Medical Centre).

There are 3\nadditional SARS cases reported today. One case of SARS died today -- a 74\nyear old male inpatient of Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Ward 58.\nThe 3 additional cases are:\n- a 28 year old female staff nurse from National University Hospital (NUH),\nwho was a contact of the NUH SARS patient admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003,\ntransferred to [Tan Tock Seng Hospital] TTSH on 9 Apr 2003, and who died on\n12 Apr 2003;\n- a 60 year old woman who is a friend of a probable SARS case; and\n- a 68 year old woman; investigations are still underway to determine her\nsource of infection.\nUpdate on Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market (PPWM)\nThere are no new probable cases linked to the Pasir Panjang Wholesale\nMarket. There are 14 suspected SARS cases linked to the market who have\nbeen admitted, comprising 8 people with direct links to the market (1\nworker and 7 visitors) and 6 of their family members. Among the family\nmembers are 2 children, aged 18 months and 10 years.\nUpdate on Jurong Shipyard workers\nA 47 year old Malaysian who lived and worked in Singapore was admitted to\nAlexandra Hospital on 12 Apr 2003 for pneumonia and later transferred to\nintensive care at TTSH, where he died on 13 Apr 2003. He had travelled to\nPontian, Johore from 24 to 30 Mar 2003 to attend his father's funeral and\nreturned to Singapore on 31 Mar 2003. He was a welder in Jurong Shipyard.\nLaboratory investigations have revealed that he had a pneumococcal blood\ninfection and postmortem samples of the lung, spleen, intestine, and lymph\nnodes were negative for coronavirus. His death has been determined to be\nnon-SARS related.\nIt was reported that another Malaysian Jurong Shipyard worker, who lived in\nJohore, was classified by the Malaysian health authorities as an imported\nSARS case from Singapore. His last day in Singapore was on 25 Mar 2003, and\nhe became ill on 11 Apr 2003. It is therefore unlikely that he was infected\nin Singapore, as this would give an incubation period of 17 days.\nInvestigations have revealed that the 2 cases are not linked to each other.\nUpdate on the admissions and discharges (SGH cluster)\nThe SGH cluster of infection in Wards 57 and 58 could be traced to the\nChinese man in his 60s who was previously discharged from TTSH and\nre-admitted to SGH Ward 57 on 24 Mar 2003 and subsequently to Ward 58 on 29\nMar 2003. On 5 Apr 2003, a cohort of staff from Wards 57 and 58 were noted\nto have low-grade fever. As part of the isolate-and-contain strategy, the\ndecision was made to transfer all inpatients from Wards 57 and 58 to TTSH.\nAt the same time, a team consisting of doctors from the Department of\nGeneral Surgery, nurses, and Allied Health workers moved over to TTSH to\ncontinue the care for these patients.\nOn 14 Apr 2003, it was noted that 3 patients in a cubicle in Ward 74 had\nfever. As a precautionary measure, the decision was made to transfer all\npatients from Ward 74 to TTSH. Again doctors and nurses accompanied the\npatients in the move. So far, none of the patients have become probable\ncases and the staff remained well. Since the transfer, no new cases have\ndeveloped in SGH thus far.\nA total of 166 health care workers, patients, visitors, and contacts were\nadmitted to TTSH as a result of the SGH cluster of infections. Of these, 52\nare probable, 65 are suspect, and 45 are under observation. 4 patients are\nnon-SARS. 88 of this cohort have been discharged, leaving 70 still in\nhospital. There were 8 deaths, of whom 5 had multiple medical illnesses.\nA summary of the SARS cases to date:\nDischarged: 114\nHospitalised: 58 (including 18 in intensive care)\nDeaths: 15 + 2 (pending further post mortem test results)\nTotal: 189\nSuspected: 95 (including 5 children below 18)\nUnder home quarantine orders: 2467\n******\n[4]\nDate: 23 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Taiwan - CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://203.65.72.83/En/dpc/ShowPublication.ASP?RecNo=867>\n\nTaiwan SARS Update 23 Apr 2003\n------------------------------\nAs of 3:00 PM on 23 Apr 2003, there were 205 possible SARS cases reported:\n38 probable, 50 suspected, 88 excluded, and 29 pending cases. Compared with\nthe previous day, this represents an increase of 9 probable cases,\nconsidered to be a small cluster that occurred in a hospital. Since most\npatients were considered to be infected on B8 and A7 wards, Taiwan CDC\nimmediately asked the hospital to follow the Hospital Infection Control\nGuidance for SARS and to take all precautionary measures, including\nrequiring health care workers to wear masks, disinfecting the hospital,\nstopping medical service for new patients, treating SARS suspected cases in\nthe negative pressure rooms, isolating people who were in close contact\nwith SARS patients, implementing handwashing and health education, etc. In\nan effort to contain the outbreak, Taiwan CDC has issued home quarantine\norders for 12 family members and 61 health care workers. Visitors to the\nHoping Hospital during the last 3 weeks are urged to watch for symptoms and\ncall the toll-free hotline (0800-024582) for immediate medical assistance\nshould symptoms arise.\nIn accordance with WHO guidelines, 21 of the 38 probable cases and 31 of\nthe 50 suspected cases have been discharged to home quarantine, while the\nremaining 17 probable cases and 12 suspected cases are still being cared\nfor in negative pressure rooms. A total of 110 possible SARS cases have\nbeen discharged from hospitals.\nTaiwan CDC announces that an Amoy Garden (Hong Kong) resident came to\nTaiwan and was identified as a probable SARS case. She was discharged from\nhospital without fever for 3 consecutive days and took flight BR857 at 6:27\npm on 22 Apr 2003 back to Hong Kong. Since she has not completed 14 days\nhome quarantine (ordered in accordance with the guideline for patients\ndischarged), Taiwan CDC urges passengers who were on the same flight to\nwatch for symptoms and seek immediate medical assistance should symptoms arise.\nAs of 2:00 PM on 23 Apr 2003, a total of 1980 close contacts of probable\nSARS cases had been given home quarantine notifications; 1639 of them have\ncompleted their quarantines.\n******\n[5]\nDate: 23 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/eu-ae/sars20030422_e.html>\n\nSummary of SARS cases, Canada 22 Apr 2003\n-----------------------------------------\nSince 21 Apr 2003, one additional probable case of SARS has been reported\nin Canada (as of 22 Apr 2003). A total of 140 individuals who meet the\nprobable case definition and 184 who meet the suspect case definition of\nSARS have been reported, including 14 deaths. In addition to British\nColumbia and Ontario, which are reporting probable cases, Alberta,\nSaskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island are also reporting\nsuspect cases of SARS (Table 1).\nAt the present time, the case fatality rate in Canada is estimated at about\n4.3 per cent of probable or suspect cases (14 of 324 probable or suspect\ncases). Most of the case fatalities have occurred in patients with\nunderlying illness, and nearly all were elderly patients over the age of 70\nyears.\nTable 1: Cumulative number of SARS cases reported in Canada: 22 Apr 2003\nProvince/Territory: probable cases (1) / suspected cases (1) / deaths\nBritish Columbia: 4 / 47 / 0\nAlberta: 0 / 5 / 0\nSaskatchewan: 0 / 1 / 0\nOntario: 136 / 125 / 14 (2)\nNew Brunswick: 0 / 2 / 0\nPrince Edward Island: 0 / 4 / 0\nTotal: 140 / 184 / 14\n(1)These people may be excluded the probable or suspect case list if\nanother cause is identified to fully explain their illness\n(2) 13 of 14 deaths were probable cases, while 1 was a suspect case.\nAnother death, not included in this total count, was a 46 year old woman\nwho died in the Philippines on 13 Apr 2003. It is believed she may have\ncontracted SARS while in Toronto.\nA summary of the current status of probable cases of SARS in Canada as of\n22 Apr 2003 is presented in Table 2. 65 individuals have been discharged\n(46.8 per cent) and of the 59 individuals currently in hospital, 49 (83.1\nper cent) are improving or in a stable condition. In addition, nearly all\nof the suspect cases reported in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta,\nSaskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island have either recovered\nor are presently recovering.\nTable 2: Currently known reported status of probable cases of SARS in\nCanada: 22 Apr 2003\n(n=139, excludes 1 whose status is unknown)\nCurrent Status: Number (per cent) Probable Cases\nHospitalised: 59/139 (42.4 per cent)\nImproving: 14/59 (23.7 per cent)\nStable: 35/59 (59.3 per cent)\nCritical/Deteriorating: 5/59 (8.5 per cent)\nUnknown: 5/59 (8.5 per cent)\nDischarged (1): 65/139 (46.8 per cent)\nAt Home (2): 2/139 (1.4 per cent)\nDeaths: 13/139 (9.4 per cent)\nTotal number of probable cases whose current status is known: 139 (100 per\ncent)\n(1) Includes cases who have either recovered or are recovering\n(2) Refers to individuals who have never previously been hospitalised.\nThe current evidence suggests that respiratory droplet transmission,\nrequiring close contact with a case of SARS, is the predominant mode of\ntransmission. The mean incubation period is 5 days (median 4 days, range 2\nto 10). This estimate is based on data available from 42 probable or\nsuspect cases with a single known contact with a SARS case.\nIn the province of Ontario the majority of cases have been associated with\nspecific transmission settings, such as household, hospital, and specific\ncommunity groups or settings. As of 18 Apr 2003, a total of 20 probable and\n11 suspect cases of SARS have been identified in a religious community\ncluster. 4 members of the index family who are members of the religious\ngroup had contact with a SARS case in the emergency room of a Toronto\nhospital on 16 Mar 2003. 3 of them developed SARS after the exposure, and\nthe infection subsequently spread through their extended family. Key\ntransmission settings include a mass held on 28 Mar 2003, attended by about\n500 members; a seminar on 29 Mar 2003, where 250 members were registered; a\nfuneral visitation for the index case held on 3 Apr 2003; as well as other\nsocial gatherings during and after these dates. Currently, 14 members of\nthe index family, 3 health care workers, and 14 other religious group\nmembers are affected. As of 12 Apr 2003, all members of the religious group\nwere quarantined, in an effort to contain any further spread within this\nsocial network. Case finding and contact tracing efforts in the group are\ncontinuing.\nTravellers who have returned from an affected area in Asia and their close\ncontacts account for the remaining cases in Ontario and the other\nprovinces.

Most of the case fatalities have occurred in patients with\nunderlying illness, and nearly all were elderly patients over the age of 70\nyears. 65 individuals have been discharged\n(46.8 per cent) and of the 59 individuals currently in hospital, 49 (83.1\nper cent) are improving or in a stable condition. This temporary advice, which is an extension of travel\nadvice previously issued for Guangdong Province and Hong Kong SAR, China\nwill be reassessed in 3 weeks. SARS - WORLDWIDE (65): CASES\n**************************\n The\nremaining 20 are other patients and contacts of patients with atypical\npneumonia. At the same time, a team consisting of doctors from the Department of\nGeneral Surgery, nurses, and Allied Health workers moved over to TTSH to\ncontinue the care for these patients. The current evidence suggests that respiratory droplet transmission,\nrequiring close contact with a case of SARS, is the predominant mode of\ntransmission. :\n[1] Worldwide - WHO\n The outbreak in this area has continued to grow and has affected\ngroups outside the initial risk groups of hospital workers, families,\nvisitors, and other close person to person contacts. The WHO travel advice is issued in order to\nprotect public health and reduce opportunities for further international\nspread. On the basis of this information,\nWHO is also including Toronto in the extension of its SARS-related travel\nadvice. The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n One death attributed to Hong Kong SAR of China occurred in a case\nmedically transferred from Viet Nam.\n Laboratory investigations have revealed that he had a pneumococcal blood\ninfection and postmortem samples of the lung, spleen, intestine, and lymph\nnodes were negative for coronavirus. In addition, a few\npeople with SARS, now in other countries in the world, appear to have\nacquired the infection while in Toronto.

Epidemiological\ninvestigation has focused on the role of a 33-year-old man who\ndeveloped symptoms of SARS on 14 Mar 2003 and visited a relative in\nBlock E, Amoy Gardens on 14 and 19 Mar 2003. His symptoms at that\ntime included diarrhea.\nBased on the epidemiology of the outbreak, officials believe that\nthis patient, who is linked to the infection of 2 relatives and 2\nnurses, was the source of the outbreak. Subsequent rapid spread to\nother residents (321 cases of as 15 Apr 2003) is thought to have\ninvolved defective U-traps in bathrooms, an amplifying effect of\nbathroom exhaust fans, a cracked sewer vent pipe serving Block E, and\nan aerodynamic effect in a lightwell to which bathroom windows opened.\nLaboratory investigations confirmed the presence of the SARS virus in\na swab from the toilet bowl in the bathroom of a SARS patient, but\nnot in numerous other environmental samples.\n'This is a plausible hypothesis,' says David Heymann, Executive\nDirector of communicable diseases at WHO. 'This is the kind of study\nthat is needed to find what it is in the environment that is\ntransmitting this disease.' Further work will be needed to reach\nfirm conclusions about the source of the outbreak and the unusual way\nin which infection has spread.\nThe study found no epidemiological or laboratory evidence that the\nSARS virus was transmitted by air, water, or infected dust aerosols.\n'It is reassuring that speculations about a possible airborne\ntransmission have not been borne out by the evidence available to\ndate,' says Heymann. The transmission of SARS within the Amoy\nGardens estate is the first known instance involving a possible\nenvironmental spread of the virus. Thorough multi-disciplinary\ninvestigation of this unusual outbreak, as is now under way, is fully\nwarranted. Once the outbreak is fully understood, the next important\nstep will be to develop measures that can prevent other instances of\nenvironmental spread occurring under similar circumstances.\nChina advises officials on SARS\nChina's top leaders cautioned officials this morning not to cover up\nthe spread of SARS. Yesterday, during an urgent meeting of China's\nhighest ruling body, presided over by President Hu Jintao, Beijing\nexplicitly warned against the covering up of SARS cases and demanded\nthe 'accurate, timely, and honest reporting of the SARS situation,'\naccording to Xinhua, the country's official news agency. China's\nleaders called SARS a serious threat to the nation's reform,\ndevelopment and stability, adding that party and government leaders\nwould be held accountable for the situations in their respective\njurisdictions.\nEarlier this week, the WHO Beijing team estimated that Beijing may\nhave as many as 200 cases of SARS, rather than the 37 officially\nreported. The team recommended that Beijing improve its reporting\nsystem, possibly using as a model procedures followed in Guangdong\nProvince, where the daily SARS reports are considered reliable and\ntransparent. WHO experts also recommended that Beijing revise its\ndefinition of what constitutes a 'suspect' SARS case.\nAt present, many patients reported by Beijing as 'suspect' would be\nclassified as 'probable' according to the case definition set out by\nWHO and used in official notifications of cases to WHO. As WHO\nreports only probable cases in its daily cumulative totals, such a\nchange on the part of Beijing would result in a large increase in the\nnumber of cases notified to WHO.\nFirst SARS case reported in India\nIndia reported its first case of SARS yesterday. The National\nInstitute of Virology in the western coastal state of Goa confirmed\nthe presence of the new coronavirus which causes SARS, in samples\nfrom the patient. He is said to have recovered and is still being\nkept in isolation after visiting Singapore, Hong Kong, and briefly\nstopping over in Mumbai.\nThere have been fears that if the SARS virus reached India, it could\nspread rapidly in the subcontinent's crowded cities and health\nfacilities. WHO officials believe it is good news that the one case\nhas been detected and reported, as this indicates that the\nsurveillance system is on high alert and working well. As has been\ndemonstrated in many countries, prompt detection of new cases, proper\nmanagement, and efficient contact tracing can prevent isolated cases\nfrom infecting others.\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 3461 cases with 170 deaths have\nbeen reported from 25 countries on 5 continents. This represents an\nincrease of 72 new cases and 5 deaths since the last WHO update.

Struggling to stop the spread of the disease, officials canceled a\nmajor week-long holiday in May, when tens of millions of people usually go\ntraveling.\nThe demotion of Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing Mayor Meng\nXuenong came shortly after officials held a 2-hour news conference to\nannounce the sharp increases in SARS cases. Zhang lost his post as\nsecretary of the leading party members' group of the Ministry of Health.\nMeng was removed as the deputy secretary of the party's Beijing Municipal\nCommittee.\nThe government said Sunday the flu-like illness has killed 12 more people\nand that the number of infections in Beijing has soared from 37 to\n346. The new figures raised China's total number of deaths to 79 and its\ncases to 1814, Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister, said at a news\nconference. 'With such a situation, with more than 300 patients in\nBeijing, the situation is already very serious,' Gao said. He added there\nwere 402 more suspected cases in the capital.\nGao also made a rare admission that his ministry was not properly prepared\nfor the outbreak. The ministry 'has not given out clear instructions or\neffective guidance,' he said. But Gao denied reports that SARS cases were\nintentionally hidden from investigators. 'We have not discovered any\nlocality or place that has intentionally hidden these statistics,' he said.\nIn recent weeks, several nations have urged their citizens to avoid\nunnecessary travel to China. However, the Chinese government continued to\nencourage the public to stick with plans to go on vacations during the\nweek-long May Day holiday, which was to start 1 May 2003. Marking a major\nshift in how China is viewing the SARS danger, Gao said that officials were\ncanceling the vacation period, which has been extended in recent years to\nboost the travel industry and encourage consumer spending. 'The purpose of\nsuch an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible\nspread of the disease,' Gao said. He acknowledged that the advisory could\ndeal a big blow to China's economy. 'I'm sure this measure will mean\nmassive losses in tourism revenue, but people's lives and health had to be\nput above everything else,' Gao said.\nSo far, officials have not detected the spread of SARS in large rural\nareas, he said. He noted that farmers have lower incomes and less access to\nmedical care. If the outbreak hit the countryside, 'the consequences would\nbe grim,' he said.\n[B] China Admits Much Higher Number of SARS Cases\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/international/asia/20CND-CHIN.html>\nWith bureaucratic shuffling and an apologetic, 2-hour news conference, a\nsenior health official, .... admitted to the existence of a large number of\npreviously undisclosed SARS patients in military hospitals and revealed\nwhat he called the first aggressive survey of cases in some 70 scattered\nhospitals. 'Accurate figures have not been reported to high authorities in\na timely manner,' he added, though he later argued that incompetence rather\nthan deliberate deceit was the main problem. In an unusual move for such\nsensitive and embarrassing news, the news conference was broadcast live on\na national television channel.\nThe unveiling of markedly higher disease figures as well as the firings\n(perhaps the first of many) capped a tense week in which China's efforts to\nplay down SARS, especially in Beijing, were assailed by experts from the\nWorld Health Organization and questioned by medical whistleblowers here and\nby Beijing residents, who through word of mouth began hearing about far\nmore patients than officials had acknowledged.\nToday, Mr. Gao of the Health Ministry repeatedly tried to heap blame on the\nministry's shortcomings, and to the disarray in Beijing where several\npolitical jurisdictions, including municipal, national, military, and\nothers, overlap but have not coordinated disease-control efforts. As of\ntoday, Beijing city health officials will oversee all anti-SARS measures\nthroughout the urban area, including at military hospitals, Mr. Gao\nannounced. Mr. Gao also expressed concern about the spreading reports of\nSARS in several inland provinces, while some outside experts said the case\nreports from some distant provinces seemed too low. A major source of\nerror in previous Beijing reports was the exclusion of patients in several\nmajor hospitals that are run by the military, but which also hold civilian\npatients. The angry public assertion by a retired military surgeon that\nmore than 100 SARS patients were in the military system and being omitted\nfrom public reports was a major blow to the government's credibility and\ntoday, Mr. Gao revealed that the discrepancy was still greater. Of 353 SARS\npatients still in the hospital on Friday [18 Apr 2003], he said, 235 of\nthem were in military hospitals, a high proportion that no one has explained.\nOver the last week, Mr. Gao said, hundreds of officials were dispatched to\nall of Beijing's hospitals to check for possible SARS patients and to\nverify whether they had been reported to the city or national authorities.\nThey came up with totals that well surpassed the rough estimate of a World\nHealth Organization team, which on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003] caused\nconsternation here by declaring that Beijing had undercounted and that the\ntotal might be in the range of 100 to 200. Mr. Gao urged the public to\nunderstand that the sudden multiplication of cases did not imply a sudden\nnew surge in disease, but rather that the official numbers were catching up\nto reality. 'In days to come, more of the `suspect' cases will be\nconfirmed,' he added. With more complete SARS data only now compiled, Mr.\nGao said, the trend in the epidemic is unclear, and he could not say\nwhether new cases each day are now rising or falling.\n[Byline: Erik Eckholm]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 20 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: News briefs [edited]\n[A] Mongolia from VOA news 20 Apr 2003, 11:47 UTC\n<http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=13E3640F-F168-41B2-ABB5C590DD5A9905&title=Mongolia%20Adopts%20Tough%20Anti%2DSARS%20Measures&catOID=45C9C78B-88AD-11D4-A57200A0CC5EE46C&categoryname=Asia%20Pacific>\nChina's neighbor, Mongolia, has introduced tough measures to cut the risk\nof infection after 5 people were suspected, but not confirmed, to have the\nvirus.

As of yesterday, 4 staff members, including\nat least one doctor, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist, were in\nhospital. Another 8 hospital staff members were sent into home quarantine\nas potential SARS cases.\nOfficials said they believe the [above] infections occurred during\ndifficult intubations, including one [on 13 Apr 2003] that took 4 hours.\nIntubation involves placing a tube down a patient's throat to facilitate\nbreathing. Some staff started feeling symptoms associated with SARS on [16\nand 17 Apr 2003]. The hospital's head of infection, prevention and\ncontrol, said one worker's eye shield slipped during the Sunday intubation\nprocedure, but there is no other known breach of the staff's 'full-droplet'\nprotection. That includes gowns, gloves, eye shields, and N-95 masks. 'We\nwere using what both Health Canada and the (Atlanta-based) Centers for\nDisease Control consider to be maximal precautions for these patients,' she\nsaid, adding 'it's possible some potentially infected staff members were\nnot present at the intubations. We're examining everything we do and we're\nlooking at a number of different options in terms of making that particular\nprocedure safer for the health care workers,' she said. One option is\nanesthetizing patients for intubation to reduce saliva spread.\nThe hospital's head of microbiology, in a conference call with Health\nCanada and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a CDC\nexpert surprised the others by revealing that the virus can remain potent\non objects much longer than previously thought. '....in their studies, they\nfound that you could still culture viable virus from surfaces after as much\nas 24 hours, which is longer than we normally expect viruses to be able to\nsurvive in the environment.'\n[C] Canada, Ontario from CBC Canada 20 Apr 2003 16:29 EDST\n<http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/04/20/sars_train030420>\nA woman thought to be infected with [the virus that causes] severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome was aboard a commuter train travelling west of Toronto\nlast week, public health officials said [today 20 Apr 2003]. She took the\ntrain on 2 separate occasions. Both times she was in a 4-passenger 'pod'\nwith 3 other people who should watch themselves for symptoms, said the\nmedical officer of health for Halton Region. The woman had symptoms of the\nillness when she took the GO Train on 14 Apr 2003, leaving Union Station at\n4:30 PM, heading to Appleby station in Burlington, said [a] Toronto public\nhealth spokesperson. The next morning, the woman took the train again at\n7:32 AM to go to work as a nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital. She had a fever\nand was 'feeling unwell,' but was not coughing. The woman was admitted to\nMount Sinai for treatment of SARS later on [15 Apr 2003].\n[D] China, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Jilin and Liaoning from the Times of India 20\nApr 2003 10:18 PM\n<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?msid=43993118>\nSARS has spread to 3 more provinces, while 2 more deaths were reported in\nnorth China's Shanxi province, taking the national toll to 81.

The patients'\nfamilies and others who were exposed to the patients have been placed in\nisolation for monitoring and observation. The SARS experts in Jilin said\nthat they have 3 confirmed [probable] cases and 2 suspected cases.\nMeanwhile, a report from Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi province,\nreported that [as of 19 Apr 2003] 9 people had died of SARS in the province\nand there were 112 registered SARS cases in the province. 11 of these have\nrecovered and been discharged from hospitals.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's update reports an additional 22 cases and 7 deaths reported in the\nprevious 24 hours by Hong Kong.

' The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public\nhospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:\nCumulative no. Over the last week, Mr. Gao said, hundreds of officials were dispatched to\nall of Beijing's hospitals to check for possible SARS patients and to\nverify whether they had been reported to the city or national authorities.

The government said Sunday the flu-like illness has killed 12 more people\nand that the number of infections in Beijing has soared from 37 to\n346. Mr. Gao also expressed concern about the spreading reports of\nSARS in several inland provinces, while some outside experts said the case\nreports from some distant provinces seemed too low.

This\nrequirement is reflected in the current WHO case definitions for\nsuspect or probable SARS. However several countries (Canada, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, United\nKingdom, and the United States of America) are testing samples for\nsuspected and probable SARS cases in research settings.\nInterpretation of test results\nPositive test results: A positive test result indicates that a SARS\npatient is, or recently was, infected with the SARS virus. The\nspecificity of the different tests still needs to be established.\nNegative test results: A negative SARS virus test does not mean that\nthe patient does not have SARS. The reasons for negative test results\nin a patient with SARS include the following: (1) The patient is not\ninfected with the SARS virus; (2) the illness is caused by another\ninfectious agent (virus, bacterium, fungus) or non-infective cause;\n(3) the test results are incorrect ('false-negative') -- current\ntests need to be further developed to improve sensitivity; (4)\nspecimens were not collected at a time when the virus or its genetic\nmaterial was present (pertains to PCR and cell culture) -- the virus\nand its genetic material may be present for a brief period only,\ndepending on the type of specimen tested; (5) specimens were\ncollected early in the course of the illness and before antibodies\nhad been produced (pertains to ELISA and immunofluorescence assays).\nSampling for research\nTo enhance the future understanding of the SARS disease process, WHO\nrecommends that clinicians collect and store sequential samples from\npatients with SARS for testing when diagnostic tests become readily\navailable. This is particularly important for the first case(s)\nrecognised in countries that have not previously reported SARS.\nGuidelines on sample handling of suspected or probable SARS patients\ncan be found at the website of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC), United States of America.\nStatus of laboratory tests currently under development\n(1) Antibody tests:\n-- ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) detects antibodies in\nthe serum of SARS patients reliably as of day 21 after the onset of\nclinical symptoms and signs.\n-- Immunofluorescence Assays detect antibodies in serum of SARS\npatients after about day 10 of illness onset. This is a reliable test\nrequiring the use of fixed SARS-virus, an immunofluorescence\nmicroscope, and an experienced microscopist. Positive antibody tests\nindicate that the patient was infected with the SARS virus.\n(2) Molecular tests (PCR):\nPolymerase chain reaction( PCR) tests can detect genetic material of\nthe SARS-virus in various specimens (blood, stool, respiratory\nsecretions, or body tissue). [The sequences for oligonucleotide]\nprimers, which are the key components for a PCR test, have been made\npublicly available by WHO network laboratories on the WHO web site.\nThe primers have since been used by numerous countries around the\nworld. A ready-to-use PCR test kit containing primers and positive\nand negative control has been developed. Testing of the kit by\nnetwork members is expected to quickly yield the data needed to\nassess the test's performance, in comparison with primers developed\nby other WHO network laboratories. Existing PCR tests are very\nspecific but lack sensitivity. That means that negative tests cannot\nrule out the presence of the SARS virus in patients. Various WHO\nnetwork laboratories are working on their PCR protocols and primers\nto improve their reliability.\n(3) Cell culture:\nVirus in specimens (such as respiratory secretions, blood, or stool)\nfrom SARS patients can also be detected by infecting cell cultures\nand propagating the virus. Once isolated, the virus must be\nidentified as the SARS virus with further tests. Cell culture is a\nvery demanding test, but the only means to show the existence of a\nlive virus.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 19 Apr 2003\nFrom: Ngiam Shih Tung <stngiam@pobox.com>\nSource: Straits Times Interactive, Sat 19 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg>\n\nTesting for the SARS Virus: Hopes - and Realities\n-------------------------------------------------\nThe SARS virus has struck Singapore and Asia with a vengeance. Since\nit was first described in February 2003, more than 3200 individuals\nworldwide have been afflicted with the severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome (SARS), and over 150 have [died]. The international medical\nand research communities responded with unprecedented speed so that,\nwithin 2 months, they unequivocally identified the causative agent as\na new coronavirus, now called the SARS virus, and confirmed its mode\nof infection. Just this week, scientists from Canada, Hong Kong,\nSingapore, and Atlanta in the United States each simultaneously\nreported the entire sequence of the SARS virus genetic code. This\nknowledge paves the way for the development of sensitive diagnostics\nand even therapeutics.\nIt was no wonder then that when a DNA-based test to detect the SARS\nvirus was announced, hopes rose. Is there now a single test that can\ndefinitively identify those infected with the virus before the\nsymptoms appear? The answer, however, is more complex than a simple\nyes or no. Although we can now construct an extremely sensitive test,\nfactors beyond human control, such as the natural course of the\ndisease, the timing of viral shedding, and statistical realities,\nwill decide the ultimate usefulness of such a test. In truth, the\nperfect diagnostic test -- which can tell with certainty, with just\none examination, whether someone has a disease or not -- simply does\nnot exist.\nWhat makes a good diagnostic test? First, there is a need to [ensure]\nbiochemical specificity. This means that the chemicals used must\nreact only with the targets in the virus. In the case of the DNA\ndiagnostic test for the SARS viral genes, there is no doubt that\nspecificity is there. Second, there needs to be sensitivity. Again,\nusing current DNA diagnostic approaches (such as polymerase chain\nreaction, or PCR) we can detect down to 500 to 1000 particles per\nmillilitre. Biochemical specificity and sensitivity are real and can\nbe provided now. The difficulty lies, however, in the behavior of the\nvirus. The amount of virus actually shed can vary 10 000-fold in any\none patient, and one million-fold between patients. When and where\nthe virus is shed is also unclear, but we know that there is only a\nwindow of time that the virus can be detected from various body\nfluids -- first in the sputum, then in the blood, and lastly in the\nstool.\nUnlike [influenza] virus, which has been studied for decades, SARS is\nso new that little is known about its infectious course. So, as the\nfirst SARS diagnostic tests are used, we will also be learning how to\nuse them wisely. For example, while a positive SARS-PCR result from\nthe sputum of a sick patient very likely means he has SARS, a\nnegative result may simply mean that we missed a window of viral\nshedding. Therefore, a single negative test does not mean that the\nperson is disease-free. Does a positive test mean that someone is\ninfectious? We simply do not know. Our PCR tests detect viral nucleic\nacids and cannot tell us whether the infectious particle is still\nintact. So if a recovered SARS patient still excretes viral nucleic\nacids in his stool, does this mean he is still infectious? And if so,\nhow infectious? We will need to continue the study of these\nindividuals as we treat them.\nDo we stick with one test 'kit' or use others? As our understanding\nof the SARS virus is still changing day by day, it would be a grave\nerror to believe in one test and not explore others. A simple reality\nis that there are more than 29 000 [nucleotides] in the SARS virus\ngenome. Our current PCR diagnostics only test for 200 to 500 of these\n[nucleotides]. It remains to be determined which genomic segment\n[region; coronaviruses are not segmented genome viruses - Mod.CP]\nwould be the best target for the diagnostic reagent, so changes in\nthe diagnostic tests should be expected. The medical community must\ndevelop a strategy that will quickly operationalise the best test at\nany one time, and have systems to switch when a better one emerges.\nCan we detect people who carry and excrete the virus but who have no\nsymptoms -- that is, asymptomatic carriers? Again, we do not know\nright now, but we need to study this problem immediately. Here,\nhowever, the use of a SARS-PCR test for asymptomatic carriers will be\ndifferent from its use on clinically active and sick patients. The\ndifference is due to statistical and technical realities.\nStatistically, the less likely that the SARS virus is present in a\ntested population (individuals without symptoms), the higher the\nfalse positive rates (that is, the test results indicating that the\nindividual has SARS when he/she does not), lowering the usefulness of\nthe test.\nCost is also a consideration. Testing 100 patients hospitalised for\nSARS symptoms at $200 a test (using a commercial diagnostic test) is\nwell within the means of the health-care system, even if multiple\ntests need to be drawn. But the cost of following 1000 asymptomatic\nindividuals over a single quarantine duration, testing them every day\nfor 10 days, would be astronomical. The cost of the tests alone would\nbe $2 million, and this does not include funding for more laboratory\nworkers, space, and specialised equipment. Within the context of the\npublic health-care system, therefore, the use of commercial\ndiagnostic kits is not financially wise. For this reason, common\nreagents dedicated for public health screening are often used instead\nof commercial kits.\nWith recent diagnostics developments, we have much to hope for in the\nbattle against SARS. The key has been the identification of the virus\nand the sequencing of its genome. These have enabled Singapore and\nothers to develop sensitive diagnostic tests. Who has the best test\nnow is irrelevant because, no matter what, the tests will improve\nover time. Our challenge now is to use these tests to better\nunderstand the course of SARS, and the nature of the infection. Here\nis where the most important message must be taken to heart. We have a\ngood test, but we do not have a clinically 'hardened' test - that is,\na diagnostic that has been battle-tested for a long period of time.\n[Byline: Edison Liu and Ling Ai Ee]\n[Dr Edison Liu is director of the Genome Institute of Singapore; Dr\nLing Ai Ee is a virologist with the Singapore General Hospital and a\nprincipal investigator in the Singapore SARS team.]\n--\nNgiam Shih Tung\n<stngiam@pobox.com>\n[Some of these considerations in the application and interpretation\nof SARS diagnostic tests were discussed in the preceding post (SARS -\nworldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952) by moderator MPP in relation to\na SARS case reported from India with confirmation by PCR.

The\nSARS virus is a new coronavirus unlike any other known human or\nanimal virus in the Coronavirus family. Because the virus is new,\nmuch about its behaviour is poorly understood. Key questions, which\nare undergoing intense study, include stages in the course of\ninfection when virus shedding may be highest, and the various\nconcentrations of virus in different body fluids. Scientists are also\nworking to determine the amount of time the virus can survive in the\nenvironment on both dry surfaces and in suspension, including in\nfaecal matter.\nThe vast majority of countries reporting probable SARS cases are\ndealing with a small number of imported cases. Experience has shown\nthat when these cases are promptly detected, isolated, and managed\naccording to strict procedures of infection control, further spread\nto hospital staff and family members either does not occur at all or\nresults in a very small number of secondary infections. These\nexperiences confirm abundant early evidence that the SARS virus\nspreads, in the vast majority of cases, through exposure to\nrespiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact.\nHowever, information now emerging from outbreaks in Hong Kong and\nCanada is raising some important new questions about SARS. In Hong\nKong, a large and sudden cluster of almost simultaneous cases (321)\nseen in residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate has raised the\npossibility of transmission from an environmental source.\nIn addition, reports from Hong Kong health authorities indicate that\npatients in this cluster depart in some ways from the previously\nestablished clinical picture. The disease appears to be more severe\nboth in Amoy residents and in related cases among hospital staff.\nAround 20 percent of Amoy-related cases require intensive care,\ncompared with 10 percent seen in non-Amoy cases. Some deaths are now\noccurring in younger, previously healthy persons as well as in the\nelderly and persons with underlying disease. Around 66 percent of\nAmoy Gardens patients present with diarrhoea as a symptom, compared\nwith 2 to 7 percent of cases in other outbreaks.\nSpeculation centres on whether these cases represent infection with\nhigh virus loads, as might occur following exposure to a concentrated\nenvironmental source, or whether the virus may have mutated into a\nmore virulent form. Viruses in the Coronavirus family are known to\nmutate frequently.\nIn Canada, concern has centred around a cluster of 31 suspect and\nprobable cases in members of a charismatic religious group, the\nhealth care workers who have treated them, and close family and\nsocial contacts. The outbreak is particularly disturbing because of\nits potential to move into the wider community. Large meetings of the\nreligious group at 2 events, on 28 and 29 Mar 2003, may have led to\nmultiple additional exposures, especially among the members of this\nclose-knit religious group.\nIntense contact tracing, home quarantine, and close follow-up by\nhealth officials may work to prevent further spread of cases in the\ngeneral community. The index case in this cluster has been traced to\ncontact, in a hospital emergency room, with a subsequently fatal SARS\ncase. The outbreak is regarded as a test case of whether rigorous\ncontact tracing and other stringent public health measures can\ncontain further spread even when very large numbers of persons may\nhave been exposed.\nThis index case has also been linked to 3 of 4 SARS cases\nconcentrated in the same block of a 247-unit condominium in Toronto.\nAs the fourth case could not be linked to direct contact with a SARS\npatient, some speculation arose concerning possible environmental\ncontamination within the building as the source of the fourth\ninfection. However, all 4 cases occurred in early April, with 4 Apr\n2003 being the date of onset of the fourth case. The incubation\nperiod has now passed with no further cases detected. There appears\nto be little risk that the case arose from an environmental source.\nViet Nam\nA week has passed since Viet Nam officials reported a new probable\ncase of SARS. No new deaths have occurred during this period. The\nsituation in Hanoi seems to have stabilized. Following the\nintroduction of infection control measures in the French Hospital,\nthe transmission of SARS appears to have been contained. 10 patients\nare now listed as recovering from SARS, none of whom is listed as in\ncritical condition.\nThe Vietnamese government is considering closing its land border with\nChina in an attempt to prevent the importation of SARS cases. In a\nproposal submitted to the Prime Minister by the Ministry of Health,\nthe 1130 kilometre border with China would be sealed indefinitely to\noverland visitors.\nWHO officials in Viet Nam said earlier this week that while Viet Nam\nappears to have controlled the SARS outbreak within its borders, it\nstill faces the threat of massive importation of the disease from\nChina.\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 3547 cases with 182 deaths have\nbeen reported from 25 countries. Compared with yesterday, 12 new\ndeaths, all in Hong Kong SAR, have been reported.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 19 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 19 Apr 2003\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 1 PM 19 Apr 2003, there are an additional 31 patients confirmed\nto have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals\nearlier.

There was an additional newswire not included of a suspected case in\nJordan meeting the clinical criteria, but not meeting the travel or\ncontact with traveller from SARS affected area or known SARS case. Around 66 percent of\nAmoy Gardens patients present with diarrhoea as a symptom, compared\nwith 2 to 7 percent of cases in other outbreaks. An 'affected area' is an area in which local chain(s) of transmission\nof SARS is/are occurring as reported by the national public health\nauthorities. Not all countries with known cases have\nreported updates in the past 24 hours so numbers may vary greatly\nwhen the updates are received. The index case in this cluster has been traced to\ncontact, in a hospital emergency room, with a subsequently fatal SARS\ncase. In\naddition, there is mention of 2 suspected cases where transmission\nroute has not been determined. Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsareas/2003_04_19/en/>\n Al-Eqtissadiah newspaper\nsaid on Saturday that the flight crew reported the Filipino's case to\nairport authorities after he was seen coughing abnormally. In addition, reports from Hong Kong health authorities indicate that\npatients in this cluster depart in some ways from the previously\nestablished clinical picture.

There are 6\nadditional SARS cases reported today. One is a 63 year old man who was\nadmitted to the National University Hospital (NUH) on 8 Apr 2003 for\nuncontrolled high blood pressure and was a contact of a SARS patient who\nwas admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, transferred to [Tan Tock Seng Hospital]\nTTSH on 9 Apr 2003, and died on 12 Apr 2003.\nThe second case, a 45 year old man, works in Pasir Panjang Wholesale\nCentre. The third case is a 22 year old domestic worker of a patient who\nwas in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Ward 58. She had attended to her\nemployer while she was in hospital at SGH. The 61 year old employer herself\nwas diagnosed with SARS on 16 Apr 2003.\nThe 3 remaining cases are the grandchildren of a 72 year old man who was\nadmitted as a suspect SARS case on 19 Apr 2003 and works in the Pasir\nPanjang Wholesale Centre. The children are aged 4, 8, and 9 years. One is\nin kindergarten and the other 2 are in primary school. They had not\nattended school since the closure of all national schools and pre school\ncentres on 27 Mar 2003.\nPrecautionary measures in private hospitals\nTo minimise the risk of cross infection between private hospitals, [from]\nTuesday, 22 Apr 2003, all doctors who are employed or working in private\nsector hospitals are required to register to work in only one hospital.\nThis also applies to nurses who are self-employed or from private nursing\nagencies and locum doctors.\nSimilarly, with immediate effect, inter-hospital transfer of inpatients has\nbeen stopped. However, any patients who require specialised care that is\nnot being provided by the hospital in which they have been warded can be\ntransferred to the appropriate public sector hospital for management. For\nemergency medical situations, however, hospitals may call upon the services\nof the specialists required, even if they are not on the registered list\nfor the hospital. Similarly, should the patient require urgent transfer to\nanother medical facility, public or private, for emergency treatment, this\ncan proceed. Similar to current practice in public hospitals, patients\nrequiring re-admission within 21 days of their discharge from a private\nhospital will be re-admitted to the same hospital. The only exception is\nwhere they prefer to be admitted to a public sector hospital, which will be\nallowed due to financial considerations.\nContact tracing for Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre\nAs of this afternoon, 728 tenants of the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre\nhave been contacted.

Like other\nrespiratory viruses with lipid envelopes coronaviruses are susceptible to\ninactivation by heat, desiccation, lipid solvents, oxidising agents,\nnonionic detergents, and ultraviolet irradiation. Some coronaviruses\nexhibit unexpected (pH (3.0) stability. Survival times will depend on virus\ngenotype (for example, human coronavirus 229E is more thermolabile than\nhuman coronavirus OC43), composition of the carrier and substrate (Susan\nCompton has given an example for rat coronavirus), and specific\ncircumstances (for example, bovine coronavirus can remain infectious in\nmilk for many days). In general respiratory viruses transmitted in aerosols\nor in droplets would be expected to have a limited range and duration of\ninfectivity, whereas viruses transmitted in a more protective medium, such\nas feces, might be expected to contaminate the environment for longer\nperiods.

In addition, the United States has\nnow begun reporting only probable cases of SARS, so today's report from the\nUS reflects a decrease in the number of cases reported in the previous\nupdate when suspected and probable cases were reported daily. As of 21 Apr\n2003, 1873 SARS cases have been reported as having recovered, giving a\nreported recovery rate of 48.5 per cent. As an aside, it would be helpful\nto see an official Chinese analysis, either daily or weekly, by province to\nhelp monitor the outbreak, rather than to rely upon newswires and speculation.\nThe newswire report from India [6][B] is a bit disturbing. As mentioned in\nprior ProMED-mail postings, the current case definition for probable cases\nof SARS is based on clinical and epidemiological criteria and NOT on\nlaboratory diagnostic testing, as the sensitivity and specificity of the\ncurrent diagnostic tests is unknown and under investigation. It appears\nthat the Indian cases had traveled to Indonesia, where local transmission\nhas not been documented as yet. The cases traveled 3 weeks before the onset\nof this illness, whereas the current estimate of the incubation period for\nSARS is 2 to 10 days. The newswire does not provide the clinical symptoms\nof this supposed family cluster, but the epidemiological information\nprovided seems incompatible with SARS, unless there is local transmission\nin Indonesia previously undetected, the incubation period can be as long as\n3 weeks, or there is local transmission ongoing in India that has not been\ndetected as yet.

In addition, the United States has\nnow begun reporting only probable cases of SARS, so today's report from the\nUS reflects a decrease in the number of cases reported in the previous\nupdate when suspected and probable cases were reported daily.

Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of chronic\ndiseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late stage\nof infection. Similarly, should the patient require urgent transfer to\nanother medical facility, public or private, for emergency treatment, this\ncan proceed.

She is the wife of a\nprobable SARS case who had been previously admitted to [Tan Tock Seng\nHospital] TTSH as a suspect case. Her husband had visited the\nRadiology Department at [Singapore General Hospital] SGH on 1 Apr\n2003 and later developed clinical signs consistent with SARS.\n\nSituation Update at SGH\nSo far, 62 persons are linked to the SGH cluster, comprising 25 SGH\nstaff, 20 inpatients, and 17 contacts. 48 are probable cases.\n\nPrecautionary measures for SGH Ward 74\nSGH had moved all patients who had been through Wards 57 & 58 to TTSH\non 6-7 Apr 2003. A patient who was previously in Ward 57 between 26\nand 28 Mar 2003, and subsequently transferred to Ward 74 between 28\nMar 2003 and 6 Apr 2003 for neurological management, was later\ntransferred to TTSH on 7 Apr 2003. In view of this, Ward 74 was\nplaced on close surveillance. On 9 and 10 Apr 2003, 3 nurses from\nWard 74 B2 station (Neurology ward) were noted to have low-grade\nfever (37.6 degrees C). They were given medical leave. 2 of them were\nadmitted to our Isolation Ward for observation. All 3 of them became\nafebrile after 1 day and were sent home with further medical leave.\n\nOn 14 Apr 2003, one of the medical officers in the Neurology unit\nalso reported sick with a low-grade fever for a day. He was put on\nmedical leave. On 14 Apr 2003, SGH noted that there were 3 patients\nin one cubicle in Ward 74 who had fever. However, these were patients\nwho had had fever intermittently for some time, in part due to the\nnature of their underlying illnesses. As a precaution, we transferred\nall 6 patients in that cubicle to our Isolation Ward on the same day\n(14 Apr 2003). One of these 3 patients was admitted on 27 Mar 2003\nwith a fever. He was diagnosed with pneumonia on 29 Mar 2003, treated\nwith antibiotics and improved. However, on 17 Apr 2003, he became\nchesty and breathless. On 17 Apr 2003 evening, as a further\nprecaution, a decision was made to transfer all 3 patients to TTSH.\nThey have been classified as suspect cases.\n\nAs a further precaution, the 3 Ward 74 nurses have also been recalled\nto be re-evaluated in TTSH today. SGH will also move all 55 patients\nof Ward 74 to TTSH starting tonight (17 Apr 2003). The neurologists\nat TTSH, who are part of the [National Neuroscience Institute] NNI,\nwill look after these patients. The clinical management of these\npatients will not be disrupted. 2 neurologists have been assigned to\nhandle communication issues with the patients' relatives. One will be\nstationed at SGH and the other at TTSH to update patients' relatives\non the transfer of patients and the management of their medical\ncondition at TTSH. This is to ensure a smooth transfer of patients to\nTTSH.\n\nSGH's clinical departments started working on a modular system on 10\nApr 2003. Each team is mapped to a fixed location (such as a part of\na ward or an outpatient clinic). With this mapping of persons to\nplace, the risk of exposure is reduced. As such, SGH's neurology\noutpatient service can still continue to function while the inpatient\nneurology doctors are put on Hospital Enforced Quarantine. 2 of the\nneurologists from the outpatient service team will now be deployed to\ncover the inpatient area.\n\nAs a precaution, some 100 staff from this latest development in Ward\n74 will be put on Hospital Enforced Quarantine. Active contact\ntracing of patients, visitors, and staff of Ward 74 is in progress.\nVisitors to Ward 74 after 26 Mar 2003 to date should monitor their\ntemperature.\n\nThese strong precautionary measures are in line with SGH's intention\nto do everything possible to deal with the SARS outbreak.\n\nAdded Precautions in Public Hospitals\nStarting today, all public hospitals will restrict visitors to one\nper patient per day. This is an added precaution to reduce the risk\nof the virus spread.\n\nA summary of the SARS cases to date:\nThere was one additional death today, bringing the total deaths to 16\n(of which 2 are pending further post mortem test results).

A total of 132 individuals who meet the probable\ncase definition and 172 who meet the suspect case definition of SARS\nhave been reported, including 13 deaths. In addition to British\nColumbia and Ontario, which are reporting probable cases, Alberta,\nSaskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island are also\nreporting suspect cases of SARS (Table 1).\n\nAt the present time, the case fatality rate in Canada is estimated at\napproximately 4.3 percent of probable or suspect cases (13 of 304\nprobable or suspect cases). Most of the case fatalities occurred in\npatients with underlying illness, and nearly all were elderly\npatients over the age of 70 years.\n\nTable 1: Cumulative Number of SARS Cases Reported in Canada: 18 Apr 2003\n\nProvince/Territory: Individuals meeting the criteria for probable\ncase (1)/ suspected case (1)/ deaths\n\nBritish Columbia: 4/ 41/ 0\nAlberta: 0/ 5/ 0\nSaskatchewan: 0/ 1/ 0\nOntario: 128/ 119/ 13 (2)\nNew Brunswick: 0/ 2/ 0\nPrince Edward Island: 0/ 4/ 0\n\nTotal: 132/ 172/ 13\n(1)These persons may be excluded the probable or suspect case list if\nanother cause is identified to fully explain their illness\n(2) 12 of 13 deaths were in probable cases, and one of the 13 deaths\nwas recently re-classified as a suspect case.\n\nA summary of the current status of probable cases of SARS in Canada\nas of 18 Apr 2003 is presented in Table 2. 54 individuals have been\ndischarged (41.5 percent) and of the 64 individuals currently\nhospitalised, 41 (64.1 percent) are improving or in stable condition.\nIn addition, nearly all of the suspect cases reported in Ontario,\nBritish Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Prince\nEdward Island have either recovered or are presently recovering.\n\nTable 2: Currently known reported status of probable cases of SARS in\nCanada: 18 Apr 2003\n(N=130, excludes 2 for whom status is unknown)\n\nCurrent Status: Number/ probable cases (percent)\nHospitalised: 64/130 (49.2 percent)\nImproving 14/64 (21.9 percent)\nStable 27/64 (42.2 percent)\nCritical/Deteriorating 13/64 (20.3 percent)\nUnknown 10/64 (15.6 percent)\nDischarged(1) 54/130 (41.5 percent)\nDeceased 122/130 (9.2 percent)\nTotal no. probable cases for whom current status is known: 130 (100 percent)\n\n(1) includes cases who have either recovered or are recovering\n(2) 1 death not accounted for in this table, has recently been\nre-classified as a suspect case\n\nThe current evidence suggests that respiratory droplet transmission,\nrequiring close contact with a case of SARS, is the predominant mode\nof transmission. In the province of Ontario, the majority of cases\nhave been associated with specific transmission settings, such as\nhousehold, hospital, and specific community groups or settings. There\nare currently 30 cases reported amongst approximately 500 members of\na religious group in Toronto. The index case of this community\ncluster is linked to the first hospital cluster. The disease spread\nto a total of 14 members of the index case's extended family as well\nas to other members of the religious group. The key transmission\nsettings include a gathering held on 28--29 Mar 2003, the funeral\nvisitation for the index case held on 3 Apr 2003, and other social\ngatherings during and after these dates. Local health authorities\nhave implemented isolation of all contacts of suspect and probable\ncases, including all 500 members of the religious group, in an effort\nto contain any further spread within and outside of this social\nnetwork. Case finding and contact tracing efforts in the group are\ncontinuing.\n\nTravellers who have returned from an affected area in Asia and their\nclose contacts account for the remaining cases in Ontario and the\nother provinces.

Ningxia, a poor province in the\nremote western part of the country, announced its first case today.\nBeijing reported no new cases and no new deaths. Today's figures do\nnot include cases in Beijing's military hospitals. The military\nhospitals, which are not obliged by Chinese law to report cases to\nhealth authorities, have been the focus of considerable rumours over\nthe past several days. A WHO team began visits to Beijing's military\nhospitals yesterday. The recent decision of military hospitals in\nGuangdong Province to report SARS cases to the authorities may set an\nimportant precedent. WHO staff in China have been further encouraged\nby the presence of national surveillance and reporting teams in\nprovinces that are now reporting cases. The presence of national SARS\nteams actively searching for cases is a welcome sign that the\nseverity of the SARS threat is being taken seriously by the\ngovernment.\nAn additional WHO team will be travelling to Shanghai next week.\nHong Kong: investigation of the Amoy Gardens cluster\nThe Hong Kong Department of Health, together with the Department of\nEnvironment, Transport and Works, has today released the results of\nan extensive investigation into the possible cause of a large cluster\nof SARS cases among residents in the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The\nreport draws on findings from numerous studies designed to determine\nwhether an environmental source of the SARS virus might explain the\nlarge and unusual cluster of SARS cases.\nAs of 15 Apr 2003, health authorities had reported a total of 321\nindividuals affected by SARS who are residents in Amoy Gardens. A\nlarge proportion of cases are concentrated in vertically linked flats\nin a single building, Block E.\nAttention has focused on possible transmission via the sewage system.\nAmong several unusual features, the Amoy cluster includes a high\nproportion of cases presenting with diarrhoea, estimated at about 60\npercent. In most other clusters of cases, diarrhoea has typically\nbeen seen in only 2 to 7 percent of cases. WHO epidemiologists are\nnow studying the report, which was submitted to WHO earlier today by\nHong Kong's Department of Health.\nStatus of diagnostic tests\nScientists in the WHO network of collaborating laboratories met in\nGeneva yesterday to map out research priorities for the coming month.\nThe network also announced conclusive proof, from animal trials, that\na new coronavirus, discovered by the group last month, is the agent\nthat causes SARS.\nWith the cause of SARS now proven, network scientists are giving top\npriority to the development of better diagnostic tests. The first\nstep is the development of a data bank of specimens from a range of\nSARS patients in different countries. The scientists are also\nbuilding a bank of specimens taken from individual patients at\ndifferent stages of disease, including recovery.\nSuch a time-series of specimens will be vital in developing a test\nthat is capable of detecting virus at the first stage when people\nbecome capable of infecting others. It will also help identify the\nstage in the course of the illness when recovered patients can safely\nreturn to their jobs and families with no risk of infecting others.\nOther plans for the coming weeks include the development of a genetic\nlibrary of specimens from SARS patients from different parts of the\nworld. It is not yet known whether genetic differences in the\ncoronavirus, which has now been fully sequenced by several network\nlaboratories, will have significance for work on drug and vaccine\nresearch and development.\nExisting PCR diagnostic tests are insufficiently powerful to rule\nout, with confidence, the presence of the virus in suspect or\nprobable SARS cases early in the course of the disease.\nWHO has been concerned that use of the current PCR test kit, which is\nbeing made available by a German biotechnology company initially at\nno cost, may produce test results that give a false sense of\nsecurity, allowing persons carrying the virus to slip past undetected.\nWithout a more reliable diagnostic tool, hospital staff confronted\nwith a suspect SARS case have no option other than to isolate\npatients and manage them according to strict infection control\npractices as precautionary measures. Such measures are stressful for\npatients and place a considerable strain on health services.\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 3389 cases with 165 deaths have\nbeen reported from 25 countries. Countries reporting their first\nprobable cases on today's list include Australia (3) and Mongolia\n(3). A large number of suspect SARS cases turn out, on further\ninvestigation, to have other, common causes.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 17 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 17 Apr 2003\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 1 PM 17 Apr 2003, there are an additional 29 patients confirmed\nto have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals\nearlier. They include 9 healthcare workers (3 from Alice Ho Miu Ling\nNethersole Hospital, 3 from Prince of Wales Hospital, one from\nPrincess Margaret Hospital, one from United Christian Hospital, and\none from Shatin Hospital). The remaining 20 were other patients and\ncontacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\nA total of 272 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and\nhave been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 15 were\ndischarged today. 118 patients are receiving treatment in intensive\ncare unit.\n4 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 65 the total number of\ndeaths related to atypical pneumonia. A female and a male, both aged\n69 and with a history of chronic disease, died in Tuen Mun Hospital.\nA 39-year-old female died in United Christian Hospital.

One of them\nis an inpatient of Ward 57 who had been transferred to [Tan Tock Seng\nHospital] TTSH for observation on 7 Apr 2003, while the other is a\nvisitor. The third case is a patient who was in the same ward as a\nSARS patient in [National University Hospital] NUH before this\npatient was diagnosed as SARS on 9 Apr 2003. As a precaution the 6\nother patients who were warded in the same cubicle as the SARS\npatient were transferred to isolation rooms in NUH for observation on\n9 Apr 2003 The third case reported today is one of them. He developed\nfever on 14 Apr 2003 and was transferred to TTSH on the same day. As\nof today, the other 5 patients remain well.\nThe fourth case is a 53-year-old Chinese man who developed fever,\nbody aches, and diarrhoea on the evening of 9 Apr 2003 when he was\nhome. He works as a taxi driver. On 10 Apr 2003, he consulted a\n[General Practitioner] GP after working from 6 AM to 9 AM. He\nremained at home for the rest of that day and the next. On 12 Apr\n2003, he consulted a GP again. As he was still unwell, he was\nadmitted to TTSH that afternoon. Apart from the 3 hours on 10 Apr\n2003, he did not work on 11 and 12 Apr 2003. On 14 Apr 2003, his\nchest x-ray showed changes and he was diagnosed as atypical\npneumonia. He was not classified as SARS as there was no history of\ncontact. However, as a precaution, home quarantine orders where\nissued to 10 of his close contacts. So far they are all well except\nfor his 54-year-old wife, who was admitted on 15 Apr 2003 for fever.\nToday, laboratory samples taken from the patient were positive for\ncoronavirus. In view of this finding, he has been classified as a\nprobable SARS case and his wife as a suspect SARS case. They are both\nin stable condition. He gives a history of ferrying passengers to\nhospitals. He does not ply the airport route. Investigations to\ndetermine the source of infection are still on going.\nUpdate on Jurong Shipyard\nA 47-year-old Malaysian who lived and worked in Singapore travelled\nto Pontian, Johore [Malaysia] from 24 to 30 Mar 2003 to attend his\nfather's funeral. He returned to Singapore on 31 Mar 2003. He was a\nwelder in Jurong Shipyard and returned to work from 1 to 7 Apr 2003,\nexcluding 2 Apr 2003, as it was his day off. On 8 Apr 2003 he stayed\nat home and did not work as he was feeling unwell. He consulted a GP\non 9 Apr 2003 for fever, cough and breathlessness. He did not return\nto work from 8 to 12 Apr 2003. He was admitted to Alexandra Hospital\non 12 Apr 2003. On admission his chext x-ray showed evidence of\npneumonia. As his condition was serious, he was intubated and later\ntransferred on the same day to TTSH Intensive Care. He died on 13 Apr\n2003. As a precautionary measure, home quarantine orders were served\nto 13 of his contacts. Laboratory investigations have revealed that\nhe had an infection of the blood caused by a bacterium,\n_Streptococcus pneumoniae_. So far, post-mortem samples of the lung,\nspleen, intestine, and lymph nodes are negative for coronavirus.\nFurther post-mortem test results are still pending.\nDeceased child\nSo far, the preliminary laboratory investigations for the child who\ndied of acute respiratory distress syndrome at KKH on 15 Apr 2003 are\nnegative for coronavirus.

From:\nWorld Health Organization; Dr David Heymann, Executive Director,\nCommunicable Diseases Dr Mark Salter, Clinical Management\nCoordinator; Dr Klaus Stohr, SARS Etiology Coordinator; Project\nLeader, WHO Global Influenza Programme; Mr Dick Thompson,\nCommunications Officer. From the SARS laboratory network: Dr\nChristian Drosten, Institut fur Medizinische Virologie im Klinikum\nder Johann Wolfgang, Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt am Main (in\ncollaboration with the Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg,\nUniversity of Marburg); Dr Robin Gopal, Central Public Health\nLaboratory, United Kingdom; Dr James Le Duc, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, National Centers for Infectious Diseases,\nUnited States; Dr Aiee Ling, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore;\nDr Albert Osterhaus, Erasmus Universiteit, National Influenza Centre,\nthe Netherlands; Dr Masato Tashiro, National Institute of Infectious\nDiseases, Tokyo, Japan; Dr Sylvie van der Werf, Institut Pasteur,\nNational Influenza Centre, France]\n...Three questions from the floor: 'The first concerns the PCR test\nthat WHO put on the web site. Can this test detect asymptomatic\npatients of SARS? The second concerns medication. In Hong Kong, they\nuse ribavirin and steroids. We have seen that they have a lot of\nside-effects in babies and pregnant women. I wonder what are those\nmedications your countries use and what would be your recommendation.\nAlso, the possibility of a combination of Chinese medicine and\nwestern medicine. The third question concerns the situation of Amoy\nGardens. Not only is atypical in terms of the means of transmission,\nalso it seems that patients in Amoy Gardens do not respond well to\nribavirin and steroids. They have other symptoms such as diarrhoea.\nAlso, unlike in most SARS cases where patients who die and became\nseriously ill are aged over 40, in Hong Kong we have cases aged 30 or\n40 with no chronic diseases in the past, but they also die of SARS\nand they are all from Amoy Gardens. What are your views on this?\nThank you.'\nReply by Dr Stohr: 'Thank you for the question. I would like to give\nthe floor to Dr Drosten to talk about the PCR test. What I would like\nto emphasize is that with the identification of the coronavirus as\nthe causative agent, now we can develop more specific diagnostic\ntests for this pathogen. It is also now possible to fully focus on\none pathogen and not be forced perhaps to develop other diagnostic\ntests for other possible agents.'\nReply by Dr Christian Drosten: 'We were of course not the only\nlaboratory within the network that did this, so for the time being\nthere are some molecular diagnostic tests which in principle all work\nthe same and should in principle all have the same performance\ncharacteristics. We have done some evaluation of this. What I can\ntell is that we can analytically find about 500 viruses per\nmillilitre of respiratory material. But what epidemiology has now to\nconfirm is how useful this will be in clinical terms, for clinicians.\nThere are of course some hints from beforehand that I can tell from\nnow. This is that, most probably, through most of the symptomatic\nperiod that the patients show, we can see the virus in these tests,\nbut we cannot for the time being say this will have any consequence\nto real clinical acting. For this we need more patients and more\nepidemiology and more evaluating of these tests.'\nComment by Dr Stohr: 'We would like to better understand what the\nperformance criteria are of these tests. With PCR you can only detect\ngenetic material. You cannot detect, you are not sure whether what\nyou are seeing is a live virus or is only an immature virus that\ncannot cause disease. So from that perspective, even finding of\ncoronavirus traces, in possibly non-clinically ill patients, is not\nvery indicative. I would briefly like to go with the ribavirin\nquestions. Ribavirin has been tested in Hong Kong for a relatively\nlong period of time. It is no more than two weeks that the Department\nof Health has been recommending ribavirin treatment in combination\nwith high doses of corticosteroids. They are\nreporting a significant improvement of the clinical course of the disease.\nRibavirin is known for very many years. It has side-effects. They are\nnot unusual, they are not unexpected. On the other hand, in vitro\ntesting, the testing outside the human body, of ribavirin with\ncoronavirus has shown that coronaviruses are resistant. So all this\nhas to be verified. These tests are\nongoing. There is a battery of other antiviral drugs that are currently\nbeing tested. This is the reason why we believe the finding of this\ncoronavirus as the causative agent after we have now fulfilled the\nKoch postulates is so important. Now the research can be focusing on\nthis virus. This virus will help us, or let us say that the research\nwill help us to develop new drugs. Now we can focus on one pathogen,\nwhich has now been sequenced, which provides additional information\nfor the development of\ntests. Now one can also think perhaps about vaccine, if there is a need be.\nWe are still I think optimistic that we can control the disease with\nthe measures that have been implemented and the understanding of the\ngenetic\ncomposition of the virus will certainly also help to implement global\nsurveillance.'\nComment by Dr Heymann: 'Re Amoy Gardens, as Klaus just said, they\nhave found that the virus particles at least are in faeces and in\nurine. It is normal that if it is in faeces that it may be causing\ndiarrhoea, and actually 10% of patients do have diarrhoea worldwide.\nSo diarrhoea is a symptom. In fact, I went through Paris airport and\non their alert for SARS they do list diarrhoea as one of the\nsymptoms. It is a common symptom. That is some of the intrigue of\nknowing why people in Amoy Gardnes might be different than other\nplaces. It may be the way in which they are getting infected. There\nare all kinds of theories that you could use in saying why they get\ndiarrhoea. Maybe that they are getting infected by the mouth, that it\nis only to be determined as time goes on and as the studies are\ndone.'...\n...Question from Fuji from Kyoto News Japan. 'Previously there was\nsome speculation that paramyxovirus and/or chlamydia could have been\nplaying a role in causing SARS. Now today that you have identified\nthe causative agent as coronavirus, can we now safely say that it is\ncaused solely by coronavirus and that paramyxovirus and chlamydia\ndoes not play any role in this? Secondly, there has also been some\nspeculation and concern that the SARS virus may still be evolving,\ncould change its composition or shape. Can you comment on this issue\nas well?'\nReply by Dr Albert Osterhaus: 'As to the cause of the disease, I think that\nif you look, what happens is that first of all this paramyxovirus _Human\nmetapnuemovirus_ (HPV)' was found. HMPV is a virus that we discovered about\ntwo years ago as the cause of serious respiratory infections in children,\nthe elderly and also immuno-compromised individuals. But we were quite\nastonished that this virus as such should be the cause of this new disease;\nnow that would not make sense. Then we were very happy to learn that\noriginally in Malik Pierce's work in Hong Kong, identified the virus\nthat we have all followed up. So we ended up with two different\nviruses: the coronavirus and HMPV. There is also discussion about\nthis chlamydia agent. This led us to postulate that it would not be\nimpossible that we would perhaps have a double etiology, so one virus\ncoming first and the other one coming later and then aggravating the\nsituation. This is the reason why in discussions with the network, we\ndiscussed that in our telephone conferences. Then we decided to do an\nexperiment in monkeys. This experiment was set up in such a way that\nwe infected monkeys either with the coronavirus that was cultured or\nwith HMPV. A third group we infected first with coronavirus and then\nwith HMPV. The interesting thing we found, and that goes back to the\nKoch's postulates that were formulated more than 100 years ago, that\nthe animals infected with the coronavirus alone developed full-blown\ndisease. They developed SARS, they developed clinical symptoms, and\nthey also developed the pathological lesions that are identical to\nwhat we have seen in people who have died from SARS. The animals with\nHMPV, the first virus that was found, developed only a very mild\nrhinitis, they had very mild symptoms, and definitely not the typical\nSARS pattern. The third group of animals, first infected with the\ncoronavirus and then super-infected with HMPV, did not develop more\nserious disease.\n***Koch's postulates are firstly that the agent should be present in basically\nall the individuals that are suffering from the disease. That holds true\npredominantly for the coronavirus and not for HMPV because it is less than\n50% of the people infected or having SARS that were infected with HMPV me.\nThe second postulate is that you should be able to cultivate the virus. That\nholds true for the two viruses. The third postulate is that you should be\nable to reproduce the disease in the host or a related host. That is what we\nhave done for the coronavirus, and coronavirus only. The last postulate then\nis that you should reisolate the virus back from the animals that you have\ninfected with that virus. Those four things have been fulfilled for\ncoronavirus and only three of those for HMPV.***\nThe conclusion today, the people in the network agreed, that the coronavirus\nalone is capable of causing the typical symptoms. We cannot formally exclude\nthat other agents, such as HMPV, and the chlamydia that has been found in\nChina, or a number of other viruses after you have this primary infection\nwith the coronavirus, would eventually aggravate the situation. We cannot\nexclude this, but the data especially from Hong Kong, suggest that where we\nhave coronavirus alone, also in humans, those data together with the monkey\ndata I think quite strongly show that the coronavirus is the primary cause\nof this disease the new coronavirus that was identified a couple of weeks\nago.'...\n...Question from Stefan Tile, Newsweek: 'I have two questions. One\nis, can you give us an update on countries where first cases were\nrecently reported, like Brazil or South Africa, how they are dealing\nwith the situation, what measures governments there are undertaking?\nAnd the second question is, now that the virus has been pin-pointed\nand the genome has been sequenced, can you tell us what that means\nfor a) the diagnostics, b) the development of antiviral therapy and\nc) the search for a vaccine? And to what extent any of this research\nis either under way or specifically planned. Thank you.'\nReply by Dr Aiee Ling: 'With regard to the sequencing of the virus,\nit of course gives us tremendous ability to develop more specific\nprimers. Because, as has been stated before, this virus is quite\ndistinct in its grouping. Which means that the previous primers that\nwe were using were not as specific and therefore not as sensitive. So\nthat, of course, the specific primers that we should be able now to\ndevelop will go a long way to improving the sensitivity of test.\nThat's with regard to diagnostics. With regard to vaccines, again of\ncourse the sequencing will have a direct ability for us to form\nclones, to produce the necessary requirements for vaccine.\nComment by Dr Sylvie van der Werf: 'So, about other developments that\none can expect from the availability of the sequence. Apart from\ndeveloping other primer sets for molecular diagnostics, also this\nshould prove extremely useful for serological diagnostics, producing\nantigens by molecular techniques that can be made readily available.\nAnd there are a number of laboratories in the network working on\nthis. Different vaccine strategies can also be explored using\nrecombinant vaccine approaches. Again, based on the possibility to\nexpress various proteins through molecular cloning techniques from\nusing the genes from this virus. And finally, this will also allow to\nset up, probably, maybe some [in vitro] tests for testing of\nantivirals that might be of use against this virus. So, really using\nmolecular techniques based on the sequence information, it will be\npossible to develop methodologies that will not have to rely anymore\non infectious virus, which will also allow to work at a different\ncontainment level and make things easier...\n...Two questions from the floor: 'One is, do you have any new\nfindings on the way of transmission? And the second is, how many\npeople do you have right now in China and are you planning to send\nmore people? Thank you.'\nReply by Dr Stohr: 'This morning the network members presented overviews on\nthe excretion patterns of this coronavirus and the people you are\nseeing here, and those you unfortunately cannot see because they are\nlinked by video conference, are those who know most about how this\nvirus is being excreted, for how long, by which means. But still the\nmatrix of excretion which we have drawn is still incomplete. We are\nstill not fully aware how much virus is being excreted, by which\n[route] and for how long. Is virus excreted before the clinical signs\nwould occur? Would virus continue to be excreted when persons are\nalready discharged? All this has to be looked into. And its ongoing...\n...Question from Warren Giles, Bloomberg News: 'A couple of things. I\nwonder, is there any evidence that the mortality rate of this virus\nis increasing just because of the evolution we see in cases and\ndeaths in Hong Kong? And secondly, I wonder at what point a virus\nthat's not contained becomes an epidemic? Is there any kind of model\nthat suggests theres a critical point of infections at which point\ninfections become exponential in some way? Thanks.'\nReply by Dr Salter: 'The first question was: has the case mortality\nrate increased? No, it hasn't but what we have seen across the globe\nis that there are variable case fatalities rates with the different\ncountries. And that probably reflects to some degree the level of\nfacilities available in those countries and the rapidity with which\nthose individual countries have\nbeen able to implement their infection control measures........\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[A article published in the New York Times on Wed 16 Apr 2003\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/16/science/sciencespecial/16INFE.html?ex=105\n1495315&ei=1&en=c86134d71cbb7821>, forwarded by Rashid Chotani\n<rchotani@jhsph.edu>, gives an alternate account of the\nthe WHO Press Briefing.]\n[The most significant information communicated during this press briefing\nwas the account by Dr. Osterhaus of the primate experiments undertaken in\nRotterdam, and the conclusion that Koch's postulates have been confirmed\nexperimentally in the case of the SARS-associated coronavirus, and not in\nthe case of the human metapneumovirus isolated from SARS patients. - Mod.CP]\n[There's an excellent description of the discussion of the\nfulfillment of Koch's postulates in the body of the press release\nhighlighted by ***. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: David Cowhig <david.cowhig@verizon.net>\nSource: Beijing Genomics web-site, Wed 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.gpbjournal.org/sars2.jsp>\n\nGenomes of Four Mainland China SARS Viral Samples Sequenced\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nThis afternoon scientists at collaborating research institutes in\nmainland China, the Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology of the\nAcademy of Military Medical Sciences and the Beijing Genomics\nInstitute of Chinese Academy of Sciences, obtained draft genome\nsequences from four samples containing the SARS-associated\ncoronavirus from SARS patients.\nAll four samples of the SARS-associated coronavirus were isolated\nfrom patients in Beijing and Guangdong Province, where the first case\nof SARS was treated. Two of the isolates were from autopsies of the\nlung tissue of deceased patients, one from Beijing and the other from\nGuangdong. The third one was from a mixed autopsy sample of the liver\nand lymph nodes isolated from the same Beijing patient from whom the\nlung tissue was taken. The fourth sample was from nasal/throat swabs\nof several patients with SARS in Beijing.\nThe DNA sequences reverse-transcribed from the RNA virus isolated\nfrom the mainland Chinese samples were compared to genome sequences\npreviously reported by Canadian and US scientists. A few nucleotide\ndifferences among individual genomes were detected as the virus is\nexpected to mutate very fast and easily.\nThe SARS-associated coronavirus is believed to be a member of the\n_Coronaviridae_ family. RNA viruses, such as the human\nimmunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV) and Influenza virus, are known to change their genetic\nmakeup readily in different tissues during their rapid propagation\n(genome replication and viron assembly) in living cells over a short\nperiod of time. For effective diagnosis and treatment of these viral\ninfections, it is essential to study the mutation spectra of the\nvirus. The detailed comparative analyses from different viral\nisolates both at the genome sequence and protein levels will be an\nimportant contribution to SARS research efforts currently underway in\nthe\ninternational biomedical research community and help scientists\nworldwide to develop accurate diagnostic tests, effective disease\ntreatments and vaccines to prevent further spread of the virus.\nComplete genome sequences will be updated and released to public\ndatabases as soon as they become available. Efforts to identify viral\nproteins with proteomic tools are underway, and findings are expected\ntomorrow.\nBackground Information [from the web-site]:\nA coronavirus is believed to be the causative agent of severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses belong to a viral family,\n_Coronaviridae_ (from Latin, corona or 'crown-like'), infect\nvertebrates especially the warm-blooded vertebrates, including\nseveral mammalian species (e.g. human, cattle, cat, pig, and rat),\nand a few avian species (e.g. turkey and chicken). Virions of\ncoronavirus contain a single stranded RNA molecule in a linear\npositive-sense form, ranging between 29,000 and 31,000 nucleotides in\nlength.\nScientists from several countries, Canada, United States and China\nincluding Hong Kong, have carried out heroic sequencing efforts,\nattempting to decipher the genetic code of the unknown human\ncoronavirus believed to be responsible for the global epidemic of\nSARS.\nThe sequencing result first came on 12 Apr 2003 from the Canadian group at\nCanada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Center of the British Columbia Cancer\nAgency, in collaboration with the British Columbia Center for Disease\nControl and the National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg. A draft assembly\nof the SARS-associated Coronavirus (TOR2) genome (Release 1) is 29 736\nnucleotides in length. It was deposited in the NCBI Genbank database under\naccession AY274119. On 14 Apr 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) announced that it has sequenced the genome of the\ncoronavirus. The CDC sequence is nearly identical to that determined\nby a Canadian group. The significant difference is that the\nCDC-determined sequence has 15 additional nucleotides, which provides\nthe important beginning of the sequence. The virus from a throat\nculture taken from one of the SARS patients was grown in Vero cells\n(African green monkey kidney cells) to reproduce enough RNA for\nsequencing experiments. The new sequence has 29 727 nucleotides,\nwhich places it well within the typical RNA boundaries for\ncoronaviruses. Both the CDC group and the UBC group have published\ntheir sequences, which differ by about 10 bases.\nAuthor List:\nAt the Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military\nMedical Sciences: E'de Qin, Qingyu Zhu, Man Yu, Baochang Fan, Guohui Chang,\nBingyin Si, Bao'an Yang, Wenming Peng, Tao Jiang, Bohua Liu, Yongqiang Deng,\nHong Liu, Yu Zhang, Cui'e Wang, Yuquan Li, Yonghua Gan, Xiaoyu Li, Fushuang\nLv, Gang Tan, Ruifu Yang, Wuchun Cao\nAt the Beijing Genomics Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences: Jian Wang,\nWei Dong, Wei Lin, Wei Li, Jun Wang, Ting Cao, Weijun Chen, Lijuan Cong,\nYajun Deng, Yujun Han, Wei Hu, Meng Lei, Changfeng Li, Guoqing Li, Shengting\nLi, Shuangli Li, Wenjie Li, Juan Liu, Zhen Liu, Hong Lv, Peixiang Ni, Qiuhui\nQi, Yongqiao Sun, Ling Tang, Zongzhong Tong, Xiaoling Wang, Qingfa Wu, Yan\nXi, Zuyuan Xu, Lihong Yang, Chen Ye, Bo Zhang, Feng Zhang, Jianguo Zhang,\nXiaowei Zhang, Jun Zhou, Huanming Yang\n--\nDavid Cowhig\n<david.cowhig@verizon.net>\n[The finding that the sequences of the genomes of four SARS-associated\ncoronaviruses isolated in mainland China differ only by a few nucleotides\nfrom the sequences determined for the Canadian and Hanoi (sequenced at CDC)\nisolates reinforces an earlier conclusion from partial genome sequencing\n(polymerase gene fragments) that there may be a point source for the SARS\nepidemic. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "Dr Robin Gopal, Central Public Health\nLaboratory, United Kingdom; Dr James Le Duc, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, National Centers for Infectious Diseases,\nUnited States; Dr Aiee Ling, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore;\nDr Albert Osterhaus, Erasmus Universiteit, National Influenza Centre,\nthe Netherlands; Dr Masato Tashiro, National Institute of Infectious\nDiseases, Tokyo, Japan; Dr Sylvie van der Werf, Institut Pasteur,\nNational Influenza Centre, France]\n...

I\nwonder, is there any evidence that the mortality rate of this virus\nis increasing just because of the evolution we see in cases and\ndeaths in Hong Kong? The sequencing result first came on 12 Apr 2003 from the Canadian group at\nCanada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Center of the British Columbia Cancer\nAgency, in collaboration with the British Columbia Center for Disease\nControl and the National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg. Virions of\ncoronavirus contain a single stranded RNA molecule in a linear\npositive-sense form, ranging between 29,000 and 31,000 nucleotides in\nlength. Also, unlike in most SARS cases where patients who die and became\nseriously ill are aged over 40, in Hong Kong we have cases aged 30 or\n40 with no chronic diseases in the past, but they also die of SARS\nand they are all from Amoy Gardens. Apart from\ndeveloping other primer sets for molecular diagnostics, also this\nshould prove extremely useful for serological diagnostics, producing\nantigens by molecular techniques that can be made readily available. Now we can focus on one pathogen,\nwhich has now been sequenced, which provides additional information\nfor the development of\ntests.

The last postulate then\nis that you should reisolate the virus back from the animals that you have\ninfected with that virus. The DNA sequences reverse-transcribed from the RNA virus isolated\nfrom the mainland Chinese samples were compared to genome sequences\npreviously reported by Canadian and US scientists. Koch's postulates that were formulated more than 100 years ago, that\nthe animals infected with the coronavirus alone developed full-blown\ndisease. Reply by Dr Aiee Ling: 'With regard to the sequencing of the virus,\nit of course gives us tremendous ability to develop more specific\nprimers. On 14 Apr 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) announced that it has sequenced the genome of the\ncoronavirus. This is that, most probably, through most of the symptomatic\nperiod that the patients show, we can see the virus in these tests,\n And finally, this will also allow to\nset up, probably, maybe some [in vitro] tests for testing of\nantivirals that might be of use against this virus. That holds true\npredominantly for the coronavirus and not for HMPV because it is less than\n50% of the people infected or having SARS that were infected with HMPV me. All four samples of the SARS-associated coronavirus were isolated\nfrom patients in Beijing and Guangdong Province, where the first case\nof SARS was treated. A draft assembly\nof the SARS-associated Coronavirus (TOR2) genome (Release 1) is 29 736\nnucleotides in length. HMPV is a virus that we discovered about\ntwo years ago as the cause of serious respiratory infections in children,\nthe elderly and also immuno-compromised individuals. But we were quite\nastonished that this virus as such should be the cause of this new disease;\nnow that would not make sense. On the other hand, in vitro\ntesting, the testing outside the human body, of ribavirin with\ncoronavirus has shown that coronaviruses are resistant. So from that perspective, even finding of\ncoronavirus traces, in possibly non-clinically ill patients, is not\nvery indicative. This experiment was set up in such a way that\nwe infected monkeys either with the coronavirus that was cultured or\nwith HMPV. Again, based on the possibility to\nexpress various proteins through molecular cloning techniques from\nusing the genes from this virus. For effective diagnosis and treatment of these viral\ninfections, it is essential to study the mutation spectra of the\nvirus. This is the reason why we believe the finding of this\ncoronavirus as the causative agent after we have now fulfilled the\n A few nucleotide\ndifferences among individual genomes were detected as the virus is\nexpected to mutate very fast and easily. Comment by Dr Heymann: 'Re Amoy Gardens, as Klaus just said, they\nhave found that the virus particles at least are in faeces and in\nurine. Secondly, there has also been some\nspeculation and concern that the SARS virus may still be evolving,\ncould change its composition or shape. Then we were very happy to learn that\noriginally in Malik Pierce's work in Hong Kong, identified the virus\nthat we have all followed up. We are\nstill not fully aware how much virus is being excreted, by which\n So\nthat, of course, the specific primers that we should be able now to\ndevelop will go a long way to improving the sensitivity of test. They developed SARS, they developed clinical symptoms, and\nthey also developed the pathological lesions that are identical to\nwhat we have seen in people who have died from SARS. It is also now possible to fully focus on\none pathogen and not be forced perhaps to develop other diagnostic\ntests for other possible agents.'

Of these, 35 (17\npercent) had illness consistent with the WHO case definition for\nprobable SARS which requires the presence of pneumonia or acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (3), and the remaining 173 ( 83\npercent) had fever and milder respiratory symptoms. Of the 35\nprobable patients, 33 (94 percent) had traveled to mainland China,\nHong Kong, Singapore, or Hanoi; one (3 percent) was a health-care\nworker (HCW) who provided care to a SARS patient, and one (3 percent)\nwas a household contact of a SARS patient. As previously reported, 5\nof these 33 patients, all of whom were travelers, had laboratory\nevidence of recent infection with a novel coronavirus (4). Although\nno additional coronavirus infections have been documented among other\nU.S. suspected SARS cases, collection and testing of convalescent\nsera (i.e., sera obtained greater than 21 days after illness onset)\nfor coronavirus infection is ongoing.

Of the 16\nindex patients, one (6 percent) tested positive for coronavirus\ninfection, 3 (19 percent) have had a negative serologic test on a\nconvalescent specimen; results from 12 (75 percent) are pending. 2\n(11 percent) index patients had illness consistent with the WHO\ndefinition of a probable SARS case; the 2 instances of local\ntransmission in the United States involving these patients are\nsummarized [and can be found in the full text at the given link].\nMMWR Editorial Note:\nThe primary focus of SARS surveillance activities in the United\nStates is early identification and isolation of patients who have\nsuspected SARS. Many suspected SARS patients in the United States\nhave had relatively mild illness and have not required\nhospitalization or chest radiographs. The majority of these reported\npatients are not likely to have the novel coronavirus infection, as\nrespiratory illness is common in travelers (5,6). A small number of\npersons reported with SARS in the United States had more severe\nillness that was consistent with the WHO case definition of probable\nSARS. Cases reported to WHO from other countries are probable SARS\ncases, whereas the United States has reported all of its suspected\ncases (7).\nIn the United States, local transmission of suspected SARS has been\nlimited to HCWs and close contacts of suspected SARS patients who\nwere travelers. Identifying persons who might be at risk for SARS on\narrival to a medical facility or office is difficult and requires\nchanges in the way medical evaluations are conducted. Revised interim\nguidelines for triage recommend that all patients in ambulatory-care\nsettings be screened promptly for fever, respiratory symptoms, recent\ntravel, and close contact with a suspected SARS patient (8). CDC has\nprovided guidance to state and local health departments for\nconducting surveillance of HCWs following exposure to a SARS patient.\nTo prevent secondary transmission, close contacts of SARS patients\nshould be vigilant for fever or respiratory symptoms. If such\nsymptoms develop, exposed persons should avoid contact with others,\nseek immediate medical attention, and practice infection-control\nprecautions recommended for SARS patients (9). Household members and\nother close contacts of SARS patients should be actively monitored by\nthe local health department for illness.\nCDC continues to develop and refine laboratory testing for the novel\ncoronavirus that has been implicated as the cause of SARS and has\nrecently published the nucleic acid sequence of the genome (10).\nIncorporating laboratory evidence of coronavirus infection into the\ncase definition will be important to characterize the clinical\nmanifestations of coronavirus infection and understand the relation\nbetween infection with this novel coronavirus and SARS.\nReferences\n1.

As of [15 Apr 2003] 7 people had\ndied.\nLocals say that at most, hospitals have 2 or 3 patients a day. It is\nbelieved that there have been at least 30 suspected SARS cases and 3\ndeaths in Qingxu. The earliest case of SARS in Qingxu county is said\nto be [an individual] of Mayu town, who was infected while in\nGuangdong province in February 2003 on official business. Then in\nMarch 2003 an official from the local political consultative\nconference went to visit SARS patients in Beijing, during which he\nwas infected with SARS.\nIn fact, in early March the World Health Organization (WHO) had\nalready listed Shanxi as an affected area, with 4 SARS cases. As of\n[15 Apr 2003] the number had reached 82 cases. According to a doctor\nat Taiyuan Medical University Hospital, his university-affiliated\nhospital alone has already treated more than 40 SARS patients, and it\nis not even a hospital specializing in SARS. At the Taiyuan Municipal\nInfection Hospital it is even more serious.\nThe earliest case of SARS in Taiyuan was a woman. In March 2003 she\nwent to Guangdong on official business, and in Taiyuan her diagnosis\nwas inconclusive.

A small number of\npersons reported with SARS in the United States had more severe\nillness that was consistent with the WHO case definition of probable\nSARS. Then in\nMarch 2003 an official from the local political consultative\nconference went to visit SARS patients in Beijing, during which he\nwas infected with SARS. If such\nsymptoms develop, exposed persons should avoid contact with others,\nseek immediate medical attention, and practice infection-control\nprecautions recommended for SARS patients (9). State: Suspected cases under investigation\nAlabama: 1\nCalifornia: 42\n There was also a series of\nnewswires mentioning a suspected case in a contact of a traveller to\nChina, occurring in Bulgaria, which has been publicly denied by the\nBulgarian Ministry of Health. According to a doctor\nat Taiyuan Medical University Hospital, his university-affiliated\nhospital alone has already treated more than 40 SARS patients, and it\nis not even a hospital specializing in SARS. The Chinese Government is taking all measures to contain the spread\nof atypical pneumonia, and thanks to these measures, the epidemic is\nunder effective control,' China's Embassy said in the press release.\n We\nhave received a sample from Goa and it is positive for the corona\nvirus that is responsible for SARS,' said Dr A.C. Mishra, director of\nthe institute in the western city of Pune.

As of 17 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 306 probable\nor suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in\nCanada. Among the 19 close contacts, 2 had illness consistent\nwith the WHO case definition for a probable case, 4 required\nhospitalization, and none is currently hospitalized. Interim guidance on infection control precautions for\npatients with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and\nclose contacts in households. It also is significant that probable cases\nare now shown separately from suspected cases, so that reports from\nthe USA will now be comparable to those from other countries. The Bulgarian Health Ministry [on 16 Apr 2003] denied the reports of\na case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Bulgaria.\n Figure 1 is an updated\nepidemic curve by type of exposure and date of onset of case, with\nthe most recent date of onset recorded as 12 Apr 2003 - Mod. All cases\nhave occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact\nwith SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. As previously reported, 5\nof these 33 patients, all of whom were travelers, had laboratory\nevidence of recent infection with a novel coronavirus (4). In the United States, local transmission of suspected SARS has been\nlimited to HCWs and close contacts of suspected SARS patients who\nwere travelers. In the province of Ontario the majority of cases have been associated\nwith specific transmission settings, such as household, hospital, and\nspecific community groups or settings. The current evidence suggests that respiratory droplet transmission,\nrequiring close contact with a case of SARS, is the predominant mode\nof transmission. The earliest case of SARS in Qingxu county is said\nto be [an individual] of Mayu town, who was infected while in\nGuangdong province in February 2003 on official business. [Ningxia Hue Autonomous Region shares its western border with Inner\nMongolia, where there have been reports of 10 probable cases; see WHO\nWeekly Epidemiologic Record 17 On [15 Apr\n2003] the province announced that it had 82 infected patients, 20\ntimes the infection rate in March.

Updated interim domestic guidelines for triage and\ndisposition of patients who may have severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome (SARS). It is\nbelieved that there have been at least 30 suspected SARS cases and 3\ndeaths in Qingxu. Household members and\nother close contacts of SARS patients should be actively monitored by\nthe local health department for illness. There are currently 30 cases\nreported amongst approximately 500 members of a religious group in\nToronto. There was more evidence that not all cases in China were being\nreported to the WHO, and a fresh report that the disease is\nspreading. To date, transmission\nhas been limited to specific transmission settings such as\nhouseholds, hospitals, and specific community settings. [The dates given in the second newswire are a bit confusing and make\nit hard to distinguish which case is being referred to, but the\ntravel dates and the dates of illness are inconsistent. Many suspected SARS patients in the United States\nhave had relatively mild illness and have not required\nhospitalization or chest radiographs.

The speed at which this virus was identified is the result\nof the close international collaboration of 13 laboratories from 10\ncountries. While many lines of evidence have found strong associations\nbetween this virus and the disease over the last weeks, final confirmation\ncame today. 'The pace of SARS research has been astounding,'said Dr. David\nHeymann, Executive Director, WHO Communicable Diseases programmes. 'Because\nof an extraordinary collaboration among laboratories from countries around\nthe world, we now know with certainty what causes SARS. The successful\nidentification of the coronavirus means that scientists can now confidently\nturn to other SARS challenges. For example, various laboratories continue\nto work to unravel the genetic information of the SARS virus and compare\nthe sequences obtained from viruses in different parts of the world.\nExperts are gathering at WHO this week to map future work on SARS.'\n'Today, the collaboration continues as top laboratory researchers have come\nto WHO to design the next steps, a strategy for transforming these basic\nresearch discoveries into diagnostic tools which will help us to\nsuccessfully control this disease,' said Heymann. 'Now we can move away\nfrom methods like isolation and quarantines and move aggressively towards\nmodern intervention strategies including specific treatments and eventually\nvaccination. With the establishment of the causative agent, we are a\ncrucial step closer.' This collaboration has brought together leading\nscientific expertise, and was established after WHO issued a global alert\non SARS on 12 March 2003. The priority has been to find the cause and to\ndevelop diagnostic tests. Two laboratories in China recently joined this\nnetwork of laboratories from Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong Special\nAdministrative Region of China, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the\nUnited Kingdom, and the United States of America.\n'Today, the first part of the mission of our network has been fulfilled, as\nresearchers have both detected a hitherto unknown virus and established it\nas the cause of SARS. The new coronavirus has been named by WHO and member\nlaboratories as SARS virus, 'said Dr Albert Osterhaus, the Director of\nVirology at Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam. The Erasmus Medical Centre\ncompleted the work to definitely prove that the new coronavirus causes SARS\n[see following report].\nOver the past three weeks, due to the urgency surrounding the worldwide\nthreat to health of SARS and early indications this was a new member of the\nfamily _Coronaviridae_, research has proceeded under the assumption that\nSARS was caused by a new coronavirus. The 13 laboratories have been working\non meeting Koch's postulates, necessary to prove disease causation. These\npostulates stipulate that to be the causal agent, a pathogen must meet four\nconditions: it must be found in all cases of the disease, it must be\nisolated from the host and grown in pure culture, it must reproduce the\noriginal disease when introduced into a susceptible host, and it must be\nfound in the experimental host so infected. Credit for the coronavirus\nfindings, which definitively pinpoints the cause of SARS, is attributed to\nthe 13 laboratories, working in conjunction with WHO.\n'The people in this network have put aside profit and prestige to work\ntogether to find the cause of this new disease and to find way new ways of\nfighting it,'said Dr Klaus St\u00f6hr, WHO virologist and the coordinator of the\ncollaborative research network. 'In this globalized world, such\ncollaboration is the only way forward in tackling emerging diseases.'\nWHO and the network of laboratories dedicate their detection and\ncharacterization of the SARS virus to Dr Carlo Urbani, the WHO scientist\nwho first alerted the world to the existence of SARS in Hanoi, Vietnam, and\nwho died from the disease in Bangkok on 29 March 2003.\nFor more information contact: Dick Thompson, Communication Officer, WHO,\nGeneva <thompsond@who.int>.\n[A more informative version of the WHO statement is given below. - Mod.CP]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: BBC News online, Wed 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2953285.stm>\n\nScientific Confirmation that a Novel Coronavirus is the Etiologic Agent of SARS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe World Health Organization said tests prove severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome (SARS) is a [novel] coronavirus,. These latest tests were carried\nout by scientists at the Erasmus Medical Centre, University of Rotterdam,\nthe Netherlands. This laboratory is one of 13 laboratories from 10\ncountries working with the WHO to combat the virus. The scientists infected\nmonkeys with the strain of coronavirus suspected of causing SARS. They\nfound that the animals developed the same symptoms of the disease as\nhumans. The test was a crucial step in verifying the cause of the disease.\nAlthough experts have thought that a new [species] of coronavirus was the\nmain cause of SARS, it had remained unclear whether infection with a second\n[unrelated] type of virus, Human metapneumovirus, makes the illness worse.\nTheir tests were made possible by studies published last week, which\nsuggested SARS was a new virus [see: SARS - worldwide (48): etiology\n20030414.0909, and the following report]. Scientists from eight countries,\nincluding Germany and the United States, found it was not consistent with\nany other known virus. They also carried out genetic tests on the virus,\nwhich found it was 'only distantly related' to known coronaviruses.\nDr David Heymann, executive director of WHO communicable diseases\nprogrammes, hailed scientists' efforts to identify the virus. 'The pace of\nSARS research has been astounding,' he said. 'Because of an extraordinary\ncollaboration among laboratories from countries around the world, we now\nknow with certainty what causes SARS.' Dr Heymann said the discovery would\nnow enable scientists to concentrate on developing diagnoses kits and\ntreatments. 'Now we can move away from methods like isolation and\nquarantines and move aggressively towards modern intervention strategies\nincluding specific treatments and eventually vaccination. 'With the\nestablishment of the causative agent, we are a crucial step closer,' he\nsaid. The discovery will also help scientists trace the evolution of SARS\nand could help them determine whether it jumped from animals to humans.\nTests are ongoing in pigs and poultry to see how susceptible those animals\nare to [the SARS coronavirus].\nResearchers at the University of Hong Kong said a new genetic sequencing of\nthe SARS virus proves conclusively that it came from animals. [This\nconflicts with the interpretation of the British Columbia Cancer Centre\nscientists, who have obtained the the complete sequence of the SARS virus\ngenome: see below. - Mod.CP]. Malik Peiris, a microbiologist at the\nuniversity, described SARS as 'something that is new to science'. He also\ndismissed claims that it could have been spread by terrorists. 'That whole\ngenome is essentially new,' he said. 'Nature has been the terrorist\nthrowing up this virus.'\nOn Tuesday, a German biotechnology company said it was distributing a new\nhigh-speed test for SARS. Their test identifies this strain of the\ncoronavirus which has now been confirmed as causing SARS. The firm Artus is\nconfident the test can confirm the presence of the lethal respiratory\ndisease in two hours, whereas traditional tests for antibodies take more\nthan 10 days [see also: SARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901].\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Tue 15 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Genome.web, Tue 15 Apr 2003 [edited]\n\nSARS Coronavirus Genome Has 11 Novel Open Reading Frames\n--------------------------------------------------------\nNEW YORK: The sequenced coronavirus believed to cause Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndrome (SARS) has 11 open reading frames (ORF), and these\npredicted coding regions lack homology to sequence in existing gene\ndatabases, Steven Jones, Director of Bioinformatics at the British Columbia\nCancer Center, said today. 'People were thinking that [the SARS virus] was\nsome kind of hybrid virus between a fairly well studied human virus,\nrecombined with a non-human virus,' he said. 'A lot of those Asian flus\nhave been associated with avian viruses.' But the ORFs that Jones' group is\nfinding all have consistent phylogeny. 'They all look like they have been\nin the same organism for a long period of time,' he said. And they are\n'only modestly similar to [ORFs in] other coronaviruses.'\nJones led an all-night effort last Friday night to assemble the sequence of\nthis viral pathogen, after the raw reads began coming off of the center's\nten ABI 3700s and 3730 sequencers at 9:30 PM. 'We were continuously doing\nassemblies through the night as more and more virus accrued,' he said. As a\nresult, the small team beat the US Centers for Disease Control to the\nfinish line for the draft sequence (although nobody says there was a race).\nThe process began six days earlier, when the group received a microgram\nsample of virus from the Canadian National Microbiology lab in Winnipeg,\nManitoba --- a small sample to work with. They spent the first four days\nmaking the cDNA library out of the RNA virus, Jones said. 'On Thursday we\nwere able to pick enough colonies to start doing DNA prep on the clones,\nand by Friday virtually the entire genome's worth of sequence was loaded\nup. 'There were no real bumps in the road once the sequencing machines got\ngoing. The shotgun sequencing was at a 20-30-fold level of redundancy,\nJones said, 'because we didn't want to do any iterative finishing steps.'\nThe only problem with sequencing this deep was that the group began finding\nsingle-base mutations in different copies of the viral genome. Though\nmutations in the virus are of potential research interest, Jones said the\nlevel of mutation found was not unsurprising given the rapid rate at which\nviruses mutate, and the fact that the group had grown the virus in primate\ncells to produce more sample. Still, they have to further analyse the\nsequence for mutation sites. Now Jones' team is redesigning PCR primers to\nconfirm the sequence, and is doing further sequence analysis, including\ncomparing its draft to that released yesterday by the US Centers for\nDiseaseControl, Jones said.\nThe BC Cancer Center team is also in touch with the Canadian Centers for\nDisease Control, which is involved in efforts to establish reliable tests\nfor SARS, along with the US CDC and other bodies around the world.\nSeparately, the Singapore News reported Tuesday that the Genome Institute\nof Singapore has also sequenced the SARS coronavirus, and has prepared a\ntest kit for SARS which it plans to make available to local laboratories\nand hospitals this week.\n(By Marian Moser Jones)\n\n*****\n[4]\nDate: Tue 15 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: WHO SARS website, Tue 15 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_15/en/>\n\nWHO Update 30 - Status of Diagnostic Test\n-----------------------------------------\nScientists participating in the WHO collaborative network of laboratories\nhave developed several diagnostic tests for SARS. These include a so-called\n'PCR' test, which allows detection of the distinctive genetic information\nof a virus. Primers, which are the key pieces for a PCR test, were made\npublicly available by network laboratories on the open WHO web site\n(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/primers/en/>) on 4 Apr 2003. The primers have\nsince been used by numerous countries around the world.\nWHO scientists are now increasingly optimistic that the current PCR\ndiagnostic test for SARS can rapidly be fine-tuned to a stage ready for\nroll out. Fine-tuning is needed because of important limitations in the\nability of the current test to rule out the presence of\n[non-SARS-associated] coronavirus in SARS cases. Yesterday, the\nBernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany informed\nWHO that primers developed there are being made available, in the form of a\nready-to-use kit, by a Hamburg-based biotechnology firm. Apart from ease of\nuse, the test kit has the advantage of built-in quality control. WHO was\nfurther informed by the Hamburg Institute that the test will be offered at\nno cost to laboratories participating in the WHO collaborative network [see\nalso: SARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901].\nInitial testing of the kit by network members is expected to quickly yield\nthe data needed to assess the test's performance, in comparison with\nprimers developed by other WHO network laboratories. The ability to detect\npersons infected with the SARS virus at an early stage is a key measure of\nperformance. WHO has been concerned that weaknesses in earlier experimental\ntests for SARS would allow too many virus carriers to slip past undetected.\nExisting PCR tests are very specific but may not detect all patients who\nare excreting coronavirus. Early and reliable detection of the SARS virus\nin samples will be of great assistance in helping health care staff\ndetermine which persons presenting with fever and other suspicion-arousing\nsymptoms should be immediately isolated and managed according to strict\nprocedures of infection control.

The largest\nnumber of cases occurred in Shanxi Province, where 47 new cases were\nreported. In addition, 2 provinces reported SARS cases for the first time;\n10 in Inner Mongolia and 3 in Fujian. [confirming both reports in the\nnewswire briefs in ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (45): cases\n20030412.0890]\nThe reports indicate that the nationwide surveillance system recently\nintroduced by Chinese authorities is working to detect and report cases.\nHowever, questions remain about the capacity of some provinces to cope with\nthe challenge of SARS.\nLast week, the interim report of the WHO investigative team concluded that\nthe health system in Guangdong Province, where the first recognized cases\nof SARS occurred in mid-November [2002], had responded well to the\noutbreak. However, the report noted many concerns about the ability of\nother provinces, which lack Guangdong's strong health system, to respond\npromptly and effectively to SARS.\nWhile Beijing authorities appear to have contained transmission in some\nhospitals, they have not yet granted WHO experts permission to visit\nmilitary hospitals, which have been the focus of numerous rumours. WHO\nstaff in Beijing have expressed particular concern about the official\nresponse to rumours and the apparent absence of rigorous contact tracing.\nWHO is currently exploring ways to strengthen its support to China.\nShanghai has requested a visit from a WHO team. Teams to meet this request\nand follow up on other needs in China are now being assembled by WHO and\nwill soon travel to China.\nStatus of scientific knowledge\nCanadian scientists working around the clock have completed full sequencing\nof the genome of the SARS virus. This is a major step forward that will\nboost the development of better diagnostic tests and underpin work on a\nvaccine.\nThe rapid sequencing of the SARS virus genome was facilitated by\ncollaboration with numerous other scientists, also working non-stop, at\nlaboratories in a WHO network set up in mid-March [2003].\nA PCR test, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nhas been shown to be 10 times more sensitive than previous PCR tests for\nSARS. WHO experts hope that the test will be ready for roll-out by the end\nof this week.\nStatus of clinical knowledge\nData available to WHO indicate that 96 percent of persons developing SARS\nrecover spontaneously. The focus now is on the roughly 4 percent who are\ndying. WHO will hold a clinical teleconference on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003]\nto gather international experiences in the management of SARS patients and\npool data on the results of various therapeutic regimens.\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 3169 cases of SARS, with 144 deaths,\nhave been reported to WHO from 21 countries. This represents an increase of\n213 cases and 25 deaths since the last update on Saturday.\nIndonesia, the Philippines, and Sweden report their first probable cases (1\nin each country) today. Japan, which had previously reported 4 probable\ncases, was removed from the list as these cases were determined to have\nother causes.\nChina, with 1418 cases and 64 deaths, remains the most seriously affected\narea. Hong Kong SAR, with 1190 cases and 47 deaths, is the second most\nseriously affected area. 3 of the deaths in Hong Kong over the weekend\noccurred in persons under the age of 50, marking a departure from a\npreviously pattern in which SARS caused deaths primarily in the elderly or\nin persons with pre-existing disease.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 14 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 14 Apr 2003\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 3 PM 14 Apr 2003, an additional 40 patients with symptoms of atypical\npneumonia were admitted to public hospitals.

A person infected with SARS was known to have\nvisited a local funeral home, and people who had visited that funeral home\nwere asked to be on the lookout for symptoms of SARS. Those cases were\napparently misdiagnosed when they originally turned up in family medical\npractices and emergency rooms, rather than being screened through the SARS\nclinics that had been set up in the past 2 weeks.

Hence,\nbefore one is alarmed by an apparent major increase in daily case reports,\none needs to keep this in mind. What further highlights this is the daily\nupdates from Hong Kong and Singapore, (both of which issued reports\nyesterday) where the increase in cases reported since yesterday is 40 and 7\nrespectively, in contrast with the 82 and 11 respectively presented in the\nWHO Global update table in [1][A].

A further reminder of\nthe challenges in relying on reports of a disease that is currently purely\nbased using a case definition with clinical and epidemiologic criteria\nrather than a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. Hopefully, with the addition\nof the more senstive PCR testing due to be released later this week, we may\nbe coming closer to a conclusion that the newly identified unique\ncoronavirus is in fact the etiologic agent of SARS, and that we will have\nsensitive laboratory diagnostic testing that will allow for the additional\ncase reporting category of 'laboratory-confirmed' cases.\nOther questions that are raised in today's report is the mention of 3\ndeaths in younger, healthy individuals reported in Hong Kong, and the\nquestion of what might predispose to more severe illness in this age\ngroup. One wonders what other factors may have contributed here. A\nreminder is the 'historical' information that paramyxoviruses were isolated\nfrom some of the earlier patients in Canada, Germany, and Hong Kong, and in\none of the specimens processed in the USA (there was no mention as to the\norigins of the specimen). Were these isolates coincidental? Or, is it\npossible that coinfection leads to a more severe progressive respiratory\ndisease and compromise as well as potentially leading to the observed\nphenomenon of 'super spreaders.' In the case of coinfection with human\nimmunodifficiency virus (a member of the Retroviridae) and hepatitis C\nvirus (a member of the Flaviviridae), a more rapid progression of liver\ndisease to severe liver damage is observed, hence there is a precedent for\na potentiation of disease with active coinfection of 2 different viral\norganisms.\nThe late-breaking news from Canada on the possibility of community-based\nspread outside of the previously defined groups is disconcerting. As this\nnews just hit the newswires, and we are about to go to press, there are\nmany questions on this report that may be addressed in information due from\nhealth officials later on. The story as presented in the above news brief\n[7][B] suggests that there had been misdiagnosed cases that were seen by\nhealth professionals and were not subjected to infection control measures\nto try to limit the spread to additional cases.

One of them, a new employee, started work on 1 Apr 2003 and became\nsymptomatic on 4 Apr 2003. The other was her supervisor and she became ill\non 7 Apr 2003. The other 2 urology staff are staff nurses. The visitor to\nthe Radiology Department was at the department when the 'index' case was\nthere for a procedure. He became ill on 9 Apr 2003.\nAdditional Precautionary Measures from 12 Apr 2003\nActive contact tracing of 110 staff who work in the urology and the\nradiology barium investigation corridor was started immediately and has\nbeen completed. Contact tracing of patients who may have been exposed is in\nprogress. The Urology Outpatient Centre has been closed and will remain so\nuntil 18 Apr 2003. As an added precaution, the Urology ward (Ward 55B), has\nbeen isolated. 12 patients who were in the ward at the time have been\nisolated in 12 rooms. A 'No Visitors' rule has been enforced on the ward.\nThe Radiology Barium investigation corridor affected has also been closed.\nIn addition, the Radiology archives are closed.\nAltogether 120 staff have been put on hospital-enforced quarantine. This\nincludes doctors from the Department of Urology. All inpatients will now\nhave their movement and contact history logged. All visitors to the\nHospital will be registered at each visit location.\nCluster around the resident of Orange Valley Nursing Home\nA 90-year-old Chinese woman was discharged from Tan Tock Seng Hospital\n(TTSH) to the Orange Valley Nursing Home on 23 Mar 2003. She had been\nadmitted to TTSH since 8 Mar 2003 for non-SARS related condition. When the\npatient was in TTSH, she was in the same ward for a day as a patient who\nwas later diagnosed as a SARS case. On 25 Mar 2003, she became unwell, was\nadmitted to the Changi General Hospital (CGH) Ward 18, and died of\npneumonia on 30 Mar 2003.\nThe 24-year-old Fillipino nurse from the nursing home who had been\nattending to this lady was admitted to CGH on 4 Apr 2003 for pneumonia and\ntransferred to TTSH on 6 Apr 2003 for probable SARS. A 57-year-old CGH\nhealth attendant who had attended to the 90-year-old woman was admitted to\nCGH on 10 Apr 2003 and transferred to TTSH on 11 Apr 2003 as a probable\nSARS case. They are both currently in intensive care.\nThe deceased lady's daughter-in-law, who had visited her several times at\nthe nursing home and CGH, was admitted to TTSH on 7 Apr 2003 for SARS. She\nis also in intensive care. A relative of hers and her son, a secondary\nstudent at Zhonghua Secondary, were also admitted to TTSH on 8 and 9 Apr\n2003, respectively. They are both in stable condition.\nIn view of the epidemiological evidence that persons who had close contact\nwith the older woman have been diagnosed with SARS, the cause of her death\nhas been changed to SARS.\nSituation Update at CGH\nBesides the 57-year-old CGH healthcare attendant who was exposed to the\n90-year-old Chinese lady when she was in CGH, there have been no other\ncases reported in CGH. The hospital is now contacting 35 patients who could\npossibly be exposed to the healthcare worker at Ward 18.\nThe 2 nurses who were exposed to a patient who has not been diagnosed as a\nSARs patient then were transferred to TTSH on 5 and 6 Apr 2003. They are in\nstable condition. The hospital has contacted 53 out of 59 patients who were\npossibly exposed to them. These are patients warded at Ward 15 on 29 and 30\nMar 2003 and Ward 28 on 3 Apr 2003. They are well. CGH is still trying to\nget in touch with 6 patients who remain uncontactable.\nUpdate on Super Star Virgo\nCruise ship Superstar Virgo arrived in Singapore on 9 Apr 2003 at 1900 hrs\nwith 625 passengers and 1354 crew onboard. An Indian crewmember was\nexamined by the vessel doctor and found to have high fever. The MPA and\nPort Health Office were later notified. ICA activated the ambulance to send\nthe unwell crewmember to TTSH at 2015 hrs. After examination, he was\nadmitted as a SARS suspect at TTSH.\nNurses were deployed to do visual screening of all passengers and crew who\ndisembarked from the vessel, and none were found to be unwell. All were\nrequired to fill out Health Declaration Cards (HDC), which were collected\nby the ICA officers.\nThe ship left Singapore for Port Klang on 9 Apr 2003 at 2330 hrs. The\nvessel had 188 transit passengers from the previous sailing, 677 new\npassengers, and 1353 crewmembers when it left.\nIn view of the SARS suspect case, it was decided that additional\nprecautions were to be taken when the ship returned to Singapore on 11 Apr\n2003. The ship's doctor was to take the temperature of the 125 transit\npassengers (63 of the 188 transit passengers had disembarked at Port Klang)\nand declare their temperature readings before passengers were allowed to\ndisembark in Singapore. Star Cruises would also suspend crew shore leave\nand disallow its crew to disembark.\nSuperstar Virgo returned to Singapore on 11 Apr 2003 at 1345 hrs. Based on\nthe temperature readings submitted by the ship's doctor, none of the 125\ntransit passengers had a fever. All the transit passengers and new\npassengers were thus allowed to disembark and underwent visual screening by\nnurses when they did so. No one was found to be unwell. All filled out\nhealth declaration cards and these were submitted to ICA Officers. The\nIndian crewmember, who was warded to TTSH as a SARS suspect case, is\nexpected to be discharged tomorrow, as he is no longer feverish.\nSuperstar Virgo is scheduled to depart Singapore at 2230 hrs on 13 Apr\n2003. In preparation for its next sailing, the vessel left its anchorage\nat 0700 hrs on 13 Apr 03 and arrived at the Singapore Cruise Centre (SCC)\nat 0800 hrs. About 309 crew are to be repatriated, subject to temperature\nchecks and confirmation that they are well. Star Cruises has a medical\ndoctor onboard the vessel to conduct the necessary medical checks. Once\ncleared, these crew members are to be taken straight to the airport for\ntheir flight home. As of 1700 hrs, a total of 82 crew members have been\nrepatriated after they were confirmed to be well and fit for travel. The\nrepatriation of the crew members is expected to be complete at 0115 hrs, 14\nApr 2003.\nHealth screening for incoming air passengers\nBetween 4 PM 12 Apr 2003 and 4 PM 13 Apr 2003, 35 passengers from affected\nareas required further screening by the nurses at the airport. None were\nsent to TTSH for further assessment.\nBelow is the summary of the SARS cases to date:\nDischarged: 81\nHospitalised: 58\nIntensive care: 16\nDeaths: 10 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)\nTotal: 151\nSuspected: 87 (including 2 children)\nUnder home quarantine orders: 608\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 13 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n\n[A] Update: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 13 Apr 2003 4:00 PM\nLatest Canadian Numbers on SARS\nAs of 13 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 283 probable or\nsuspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada.

At that time, when\nSARS was just becoming known as a severe new disease, many patients were\nthought to be suffering from atypical pneumonia having another cause, and\nwere therefore not treated as special cases requiring special precautions\nof isolation and infection control.\nAs a result, stringent infection control measures were not in place. In the\nabsence of protective measures, many health care workers, relatives, and\nhospital visitors were exposed to the SARS virus and subsequently developed\nSARS.\nSince infection control measures have been put in place, the number of new\ncases of SARS arising from a single SARS source case has been significantly\nreduced.\nWhen investigating current chains of continuing transmission, it is\nimportant to look for points in the history of case detection and patient\nmanagement when procedures for infection control may have broken down.\nChina\nThe WHO team of experts in Beijing was today granted permission to visit\nmilitary hospitals. The situation of SARS cases in certain military\nhospitals has been the source of numerous rumours concerning the magnitude\nof the SARS outbreak. The WHO team has so far visited one such hospital but\nhopes to visit others soon.\nThe decision by Beijing authorities is a welcome indication of China's\nwillingness to come to terms with the SARS outbreak on the mainland.\nYesterday, China's president Hu Jintao said on state television that he was\n'very worried' by SARS.\nThe WHO Beijing team is expected to finish its preliminary investigation on\nthe status of SARS in China tomorrow. Additional WHO teams will travel soon\nto other parts of China.\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 3235 cases of SARS, with 154 deaths,\nhave been reported from 22 countries. This represents an increase of 66 new\ncases and 10 deaths compared with the previous day. 9 of the 10 deaths\noccurred in Hong Kong SAR.

Then as it spreads out from those workers into other\npopulations, the ages change, so it's very important to understand the\ndynamics of this disease.\n\nAs far as Beijing goes, last evening they visited the military hospital.\nThey estimated that there are at least 50 patients in this hospital with\nSARS from what they've seen. They also estimate that there are between\n100-200 probable cases in Beijing, more than has been reported, and they\nfeel that there might even be up to 1000 people who are under observation\nright now at various stages of infection; some probably are not SARS, in\nfact many are probably not SARS, but they are taking precautions in\nobserving these. It's our impression that China needs to get clear on how\nit reports these diseases and they are working very closely with the\nChinese to get better reporting. It's also the team's feeling that Beijing\nhas many resources that they can put to work on this disease and that SARS\nwill not be a problem in Beijing if they get these resources working. Their\nconcern is in the provinces, especially in the western provinces, and they\nare afraid that it will not only spread from cities into the communities\nbut into areas where there may not be health facilities that are very\nclosely accessible to people. So, the challenge now is for China to not\nonly report, but to trace infection, to do infection control in the\nhospitals, and do everything that the other countries are doing to stop the\nspread of this disease.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 16 Apr 2003\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n\nAs of 3 PM 16 Apr 2003, there are an additional 36 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 7 healthcare workers (6 from Princess Margaret Hospital and\none from Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital). The remaining 29 were\nother patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n\nA total of 257 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have\nbeen discharged from public hospitals.

They comprise 2 staff\nmembers of National Cancer Centre (NCC), namely a radiographer who had been\nadmitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) since 9 Apr 2003 for observation,\nand a porter who was admitted to TTSH on 14 Apr 2003. Both patients\ndeveloped lung changes on chest X-ray yesterday and hence were diagnosed to\nhave SARS. The third SARS case is an inpatient at Singapore General\nHospital (SGH) Ward 58 who has been observed in TTSH since 13 Apr 2003, and\nwho developed lung changes yesterday. The other 2 cases comprise the son of\na SARS patient, and a doctor at National University Hospital (NUH) who\nlooked after 2 patients prior to their diagnosis of SARS.\n\nSituation Update at NCC\nThere are 2 NCC staff members who have been diagnosed as probable SARS.\n\nThe radiographer developed a fever (37.8 deg C) on Saturday 5 Apr 2003. He\ndid not see a doctor. He was well with no fever over the next 3 days (6--8\nApr 2003). He worked in the radiology department of NCC on 7 and 8 Apr\n2003. Twice-daily temperature monitoring was performed and he was noted to\nhave no fever. During these 2 days, he performed CT scans and MRI on a\ntotal of 11 patients.\n\nIn the early hours of 9 Apr 2003, he developed fever of 38.4 deg C. He went\nto Changi General Hospital (CGH) and was transferred to TTSH on the same\nday. On admission he was classified as a low-risk suspect for SARS. CGH\nobserved all the infection control measures when the patient was there.\n\nAnother hospital staff (porter), who handles dispatch work, developed a\nlow-grade fever (37.5 deg C) on the morning of Thu 10 Apr 2003. He was not\nassigned any duties and during that time he only came into contact with the\ndepartmental staff. At noon, his temperature went up to 38.6 deg C. He was\nseen at the SGH Staff Clinic and was given 2 days MC [medical leave?] and\nasked to return for a review on 12 Apr 2003.\n\nHe had no fever on 11 Apr 2003. He did not return to the Staff Clinic on 12\nApr 2003 and instead saw his neighbourhood General Practitioner (GP). He\nwas given 2 more days MC. He continued to have low-grade [fever]. On 14 Apr\n2003, he went directly to the Staff Clinic and was referred to TTSH and\nadmitted on the same day.\n\nBesides these 2 staff members, the other NCC staff are currently well. As a\nprecaution, NCC has closed its radiology department until 20 Apr 2003.\nUrgent radiological x-rays will be done at SGH A&E Dept. Non-urgent\nappointments will be deferred. NCC has contacted 10 of the 11 patients who\nhad X-ray investigations done by the radiographer and they are well.\nAlthough the radiographer did not go into the waiting room of the X-ray\ndepartment, as a precaution, NCC has been contacting the 200 patients who\nhave had other X-rays done during the period 7--9 Apr 2003. Investigations\nare still in progress to trace the source of infection.\n\nSituation Update at NUH\nThe doctor attended to a patient who was being treated for heart failure.\nThe patient, who was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, had been a visitor at\nSGH Ward 57 in end March. He had multiple medical conditions and did not\nhave fever at that time. When he was reviewed in the ward, the possibility\nof concurrent pneumonia was recognised as his condition had deteriorated.\nThe patient was unstable and required transfer to the NUH Intensive Care\nUnit where he was intubated. The transfer to TTSH took place later on the\nsame day when the patient's condition stabilised. The patient passed away\non 12 Apr 2003.\n\nThe NUH doctor developed fever on 11 Apr 2003 evening and was sent to TTSH\nEmergency Department on the same day. She has been diagnosed as a probable\nSARS case on 16 Apr 2003.\n\nHome Quarantine for non-SARS patients with chronic conditions discharged\nfrom SGH and TTSH\nContact tracing at SGH has identified the patients and healthcare workers\nwho may have been exposed to SARS. These contacts have been quarantined or\nare being monitored. There are about 800 inpatients at present in SGH who\nhave not been exposed. However, as a precaution, patients discharged from\nSGH from 17 Apr 2003 onwards who have chronic co-morbid conditions will be\nissued Home Quarantine Orders (HQO) for 10 days. At end of 10 days, SGH\nwill recall them for review, following which they will be on phone\nsurveillance for a further 10 days. The other discharged patients who do\nnot have any chronic conditions will not be on HQO but phone surveillance\nfor 21 days. The same arrangement will be implemented for non-SARS patients\nwith chronic conditions discharged from TTSH.\n\nSummary of SARS cases\nThere was a SARS patient in intensive care who died late 15 Apr 2003. She\nwas the mother of a doctor who contracted SARS while looking after a SARS\npatient. The other deceased is the mother of a SARS patient. On 13 Apr\n2003, we reported 2 SARS deaths linked to the SGH cluster comprising an\ninpatient and the brother of an index patient. The preliminary findings of\nboth patients were that they died of other medical conditions unrelated to\nSARS. We are awaiting results of further investigations.\n\nBelow is the summary of the SARS cases to date:\n\nNumber Discharged: 85 plus 6\nHospitalised: 61 (including 16 in intensive care)\nDeaths: 13 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)\n\nTotal: 167\n\nSuspected: 91 (including 8 children below 18)\nUnder home quarantine orders: 582\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS website 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome report of suspected cases under\ninvestigation in the United States\n\nThese data were reported to the World Health Organization on 15 Apr 2003.\n\nState: suspected cases under investigation\n\nAlabama: 1\nCalifornia: 42\nColorado: 6\nConnecticut: 4\nFlorida: 11\nGeorgia: 3\nHawaii: 5\nIllinois: 11\nIndiana: 1\nKansas: 1\nKentucky: 1\nMaine: 2\nMassachusetts: 8\nMichigan: 3\nMinnesota: 6\nMississippi: 1\nMissouri: 2\nNevada: 1\nNew Hampshire: 1\nNew Jersey: 3\nNew Mexico: 1\nNew York: 22\nNorth Carolina: 6\nOhio: 10\nOregon: 1\nPennsylvania: 5\nRhode Island: 1\nSouth Carolina: 1\nTexas: 7\nUtah: 5\nVermont: 2\nVirginia: 5\nWashington: 19\nWisconsin: 1\n\nTotal suspected cases under investigation: 199\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update32.html>\n\n\nUpdate 32: Severe acute respiratory syndrome -- 16 Apr 2003 4:30 PM\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 303 probable or\nsuspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada.

The information contained in this update is based on\nthe information available to Health Canada at this time.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario is reporting 122 probable and 127 suspect cases. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 38 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.\nSaskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n\nSo far, 91 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario.

Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of\nchronic diseases or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late\nstage of infection.

At end of 10 days, SGH\nwill recall them for review, following which they will be on phone\nsurveillance for a further 10 days.

She\nwas the mother of a doctor who contracted SARS while looking after a SARS\npatient. Then as it spreads out from those workers into other\npopulations, the ages change, so it's very important to understand the\ndynamics of this disease.

Sequencing the genome which computers at the\nBritish Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver completed at 4 a.m. on Sat 12\nApr 2003 after a team slaved over the problem 24 hours a day for a mere six\ndays is the first step toward developing a diagnostic test for the virus\nand possibly a vaccine.\nThe genome appears to be that of a 'completely new' coronavirus unrelated\nto any known human or animal viruses, a scientist at the Canadian agency\nsaid. a competing United States team at the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention in Atlanta is reaching the same conclusion, and scientists from\nboth teams said the virus's startling novelty could make it harder to trace\nwhat animal or bird it came from, if it did jump from another species.\nA spokesman for the World Health Organization called the speed at which the\ngene was sequenced 'stunning.' 'It was just three weeks ago that the\ncoronavirus was identified as the likely cause,' said the spokesman, Dick\nThompson. 'Don't forget that it took several years to find the virus that\ncauses AIDS. The way people worked together is just great.' Dr. Marco\nMarra, Director of the Genome Sciences Center at the Canadian cancer\nagency, said he hoped that 'this isn't viewed as `beating the C.D.C.';\nwe're trying to help.' Because 13 people in Canada have died of the\nsyndrome, known as SARS, and 274 more are believed to be infected with it,\nCanadian scientists feel a sense of urgency about the project, he said. No\none is believed to have died of the mysterious respiratory ailment in the\nUnited States, where 160 people are believed to be infected.Also, Dr. Marra\nsaid, samples should be sequenced in different laboratories so scientists\ncan check one another's work. Cautioning that his lab's work is 'a draft';\nthere are probably still errors in it,' he said he still expected it to be\nposted for public use today on the Web site of the National Center for\nBiotechnology Information in Bethesda, Md., part of the National Institutes\nof Health.\nThe virus appears to be unique. 'It doesn't look any more like one known\ncoronavirus than another,' he said. With 29 736 nucleotides, he said, 'it's\na biggie for a coronavirus.' Viruses usually have thousands of these base\npairs, while bacteria have millions and the human genome has over three\nbillion. [In general, the genomes of coronaviruses are larger than those of\nother RNA viruses, and the size of the SARAS-associated coronavirus genome\nis not unexpected. - Mod.CP]. Dr. Marra said the genome his lab found was\n'equidistant' from coronaviruses isolated from turkeys, cows and mice.\nIdeally, the sequence will make it possible to come up with a rapid test.\nRight now, there are three different tests for coronaviruses, but they can\ntake days, by which time a patient may have died or recovered. Because\nrapid tests for other coronaviruses exist, 'our confidence level is quite\ngood,' Dr. Marra said. Knowing the sequence of base pairs will indicate\nwhat proteins the DNA will build, which will hint at which protein-blocking\ndrugs might make the virus impotent. The possibility of a vaccine is more\nremote. While vaccines have wiped out or slowed smallpox, chicken pox,\nmeasles and other viruses, a vaccine against AIDS has eluded scientists for\nmore than a decade.\nScientists are still trying to prove that this coronavirus causes SARS. To\nthat end, a laboratory in the Netherlands is infecting primates with it to\nsee if they become sick and whether particles of the same virus can be\nfound in them. Dr. James Hughes, of the National Center for Infectious\nDisease at the C.D.C., which is working on a sample cultured from a throat\nswab on a patient who died in Asia, said it was also finding a\nnew,unrecognized virus. Known coronaviruses fall into three groups based on\ntheir surface proteins, he said, 'and it looks like this is a fourth.' 'If\nit had looked like it came from a turkey or a chicken,' he said, 'you could\nhave taken steps to diminish the likelihood of exposure.' It is impossible\nto know how much having a fully sequenced genome will trim the time it\ntakes to create a diagnostic test or a vaccine, Dr. Hughes said. A test\ncould come rapidly because another preliminary test based on pieces of the\ngenome was created within days, he said, though it is still in trials. He\nsaid he did not expect a marketable vaccine within a year.\nThe Canadian work began after Dr. Marra and the project's leader, Dr.\nCaroline Astell, volunteered to put aside their cancer research and devote\ntheir 20 scientists and 100 000-square-foot lab to the coronavirus. Last\nweek, the team received material that was isolated from a patient who had\ndied in Toronto and was grown in primate cells at the National Microbiology\nLaboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The 'sensitive, very delicate' work of\nconverting the sample's RNA into DNA took about five days by a two-person\nteam, Dr. Marra said, while 'the rest of us reorganized the laboratory so\nit could run rapidly.' Dr. Simon Sutcliffe, the cancer agency's president,\ndescribed the lab scene as 'a lot of tired and excited-looking young people\nstanding in front of their machines.' Their average age is 'probably 23 or\n24,' he said, and they are 'very genome-focused and technologically adept.'\nOn Friday afternoon, the samples were ready for the sequencing computers,\nwhich identify the bases in snippets of DNA about 500 bases long, and then\nsort them, trying to build something like a whole ladder out of hundreds of\npieces of a ladder whose rungs have been sawed apart at different lengths.\n'We were on pins and needles waiting for data,' Dr. Marra said. 'It began\nto appear at around 9 or 10 Friday night, and everything looked promising.'\nAbout 4 a.m., the computers finished their draft and before 8 a.m., Dr.\nSutcliffe was being called out of the shower and was giving the\nauthorization to make the announcement.\n(By: Donald G.

The Hong Kong man met with\nthe UK 6th case for a 2 hour face to face meeting in a Hotel at Heathrow\nairport (The Heathrow Marriott) on 3 Apr 2003. There are no other relevant\ncontacts for the UK case and therefore if his diagnosis is confirmed as\nSARS transmission has almost certainly occurred in the UK. This information\nis being made public today.Investigations has not found any indication that\nthe Hong Kong man had other close contacts in the 24 hours he was in the UK\nand no related suspect or probable cases of SARS have come to light. There\nis no ill-health among the hotel staff who had any direct contact with him\nor went into the man's room. Thorough cleaning was undertaken of the man's\nroom on departure.\nTo date there have been no reports of ill health among other visitors to\nthe hotel therefore this transmission does not seem analagous to the\noutbreak of SARS cases in a hotel in Hong Kong. It seems unlikely that\nthere will have been any further transmission associated with the Hong Kong\nman in the UK. However if any national authorities become aware of a SARS\ndiagnosis being made in a person who has been in the UK in the 10 days\nbefore developing disease they should immediately contact the CDSC duty\ndoctor (+44 208 200 6868 or e-mail respcdsc@phls.org.uk ) including details\nof the cases time and contacts in the UK, for example details of any hotel\nstay.\nIt should be borne in mind that close contact transmission has already\ntaken place in the US\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5214a1.htm> and\nCanada <http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/NEJMoa030634v1> as\nwell as in the Far East though we understand the chains of transmission in\nNorth America to date are limited.\nThe UK authorities understand from WHO - Europe, and direct contact with\nGerman authorities, that investigations to identify contacts in German and\nSpain are underway.\n--\nAgnus Nicoll\nInterim Director, Communicable Disease Surveillance\nHealth Protection Agency, UK\n<angus.nicoll@hpa.org.uk>\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The greatest concern arises when cases occur\noutside the established risk groups of health care workers and persons in\nclose face-to-face contact with patients, such as household contacts and\nhospital visitors.\n\nIn addition to Beijing, other affected areas in China include Guangdong\nProvince, Hong Kong SAR, Shanxi Province, and Taiwan Province. Toronto,\nSingapore, and Hanoi are also listed as affected.\n\nIn most other countries reporting SARS cases, the disease remains confined\nto a few imported cases, with no or very little spread of infection to others.\n\nChina\nA WHO team of 5 experts has been invited by the Beijing Health Bureau to\nvisit health facilities and review the SARS situation in Beijing. The\ninvitation followed WHO concern about management of the SARS situation by\nhealth authorities, particularly in relation to case reporting and contact\ntracing.\n\nThe meetings, which began on Friday, will continue throughout next week.\nSpecific objectives are to support the strengthening of surveillance and\nreporting, clinical management, infection control, and laboratory\nevaluation of cases.\n\nNo reports from China were received today.\n\nHong Kong\nHong Kong has today reported a cumulative total of 1108 cases with 35\ndeaths. This represents an increase of 49 new cases admitted to hospital\nwith symptoms of SARS, and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday. Of the\ncases newly admitted to hospital, 3 are in health care workers, and 11 are\nfrom the Amoy Gardens housing estate.\n\nThe majority of Hong Kong's cases are clustered in hospitals and in the\ndensely populated Amoy Gardens housing estate. Health authorities are\ncontinuing to investigate a possible environmental factor that may explain\nthe concentration of cases in a single wing of a single building, Block E.\nHealth officials are also investigating whether an outbreak in a second\nhousing estate may be related to the Amoy Gardens outbreak.\n\nThe Department of Health has today posted on its web site a detailed list\nof buildings where residents have developed SARS. [The complete list can be\naccessed at:\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm> - Mod.MPP]\n\nSingapore\nSingapore has today reported a cumulative total of 147 SARS cases of which\n60 remain hospitalized, with 15 in intensive care. Recent concern has\ncentered on clusters of SARS cases seen in health workers, inpatients, and\nvisitors at Singapore General Hospital and Ton Tock Seng Hospital.\n\nWHO has collaborated with health authorities in investigations and contact\ntracing that have linked most cases in the hospital outbreaks to a single\n'super-spreader.' This patient was treated at Ton Tock Seng Hospital from 5\nto 20 Mar 2003, where he is thought to have become infected. He was\nsubsequently admitted to Singapore General Hospital on 24 Mar 2003. The\npatient showed a very atypical clinical course before being isolated on 2\nApr 2003. This late isolation is thought to explain, in part, the large\nnumber of exposed and infected individuals linked to the single patient.\n\nOngoing investigations have linked the outbreaks at Singapore General\nHospital, Ton Tock Seng Hospital, and other hospitals in Singapore to clear\ntrains of transmission\n\nViet Nam\nIn Viet Nam, one new case was reported and one case was removed from the\nlist. The cumulative number of reported cases (62) remains the same as\nyesterday. High vigilance, excellent contact tracing, and good infection\ncontrol are in place and are expected to keep the number of new cases\nassociated with the initial outbreak small.\n\nCanada\nHealth Canada is today reporting 101 probable SARS cases. All Canadian\ncases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact\nwith SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. Ontario is\nreporting 98 probable cases. 3 probable cases are reported in British Columbia.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today [12 Apr 2003], a cumulative total of 2960 cases, with 119\ndeaths, have been reported from 19 countries. This represents an increase\nof 70 cases and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday. No reports from\nChina were received today.\n\nThe 3 new deaths were reported in Hong Kong SAR.

This report updates information on U.S. residents with SARS\nand summarizes the clinical histories of the 5 U.S. residents identified as\nof 9 Apr 2003, who have both suspected SARS and laboratory evidence of\ninfection with a novel coronavirus.\nEpidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing. CDC's\ninterim suspected SARS case definition (available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm>) continues to be based\non clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to other SARS cases or areas\nwith community transmission of SARS; abnormal radiographic findings are not\nrequired for suspected cases. The WHO case definition for probable SARS\nincludes radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or\nrespiratory distress syndrome (RDS) on chest radiograph (2). Cases reported\nto WHO outside the United States are probable SARS cases; the United States\nreports all suspected cases.\nAs of 9 Apr 2003, a total of 2722 SARS cases have been reported to WHO from\n16 countries, including the United States; 106 deaths (case-fatality\nproportion: 3.9 percent) have been reported to WHO (3). As of 9 Apr 2003,\nCDC had received 166 reports from 30 states of suspected SARS cases among\nU.S. residents [see epidemic curve on webpage\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5214a1.htm>]; 135 (81 percent)\ncases occurred among adults [see Table of characteristics of cases on\nwebpage link above]. Of the 166 persons with suspected SARS, 154 (93\npercent) had traveled within the 10 days before illness onset to one or\nmore of the areas listed in the case definition, 9 (5 percent) had\nhousehold contact with a person with suspected SARS, and 3 (2 percent) were\nhealth-care workers (HCWs) who had provided medical care to a patient with\nsuspected SARS. The majority of U.S. patients had normal chest radiographs\n[see table on webpage link]. As of 9 Apr 2003, a total of 33 (20 percent)\npatients were reported to have pneumonia or RDS. Of the 60 (36 percent)\npatients who were hospitalized for greater than 24 hours, 4 (7 percent)\nremained hospitalized as of 9 Apr 2003, and no deaths were reported.\nTravel Advisories\nTravel advisories from WHO and CDC remain in effect. CDC has issued a\ntravel advisory\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/acute_resp_syn_multi.htm>) recommending\nthat persons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China,\nHong Kong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until\nfurther notice. Persons who have traveled recently to these locations are\nurged to seek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.4 deg\nF (38.0 C), cough, or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel and to\ninform their health-care providers about recent travel to regions where\nSARS cases have been reported.\nInfection-Control Guidelines\nInterim infection-control guidelines for health-care, household, and\ncommunity settings will be updated and revised as new information becomes\navailable. Infection-control practitioners, clinicians providing medical\ncare for patients with suspected SARS, and persons who might have contact\nwith persons with suspected SARS should consult these guidelines frequently\nto keep current with recommendations\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/index.htm>).\nDiagnostic Testing\nLaboratory diagnostic tests used at CDC to test clinical specimens for\nevidence of this novel coronavirus are still in development and are not\navailable outside a research setting. Serologic testing for coronavirus\nantibody consists of indirect fluorescent antibody testing and\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that are specific for antibody produced\nafter infection. Although some patients have detectable coronavirus\nantibody within 14 days of illness onset, definitive interpretation of\nnegative coronavirus antibody tests is possible only for specimens obtained\ngreater than 21 days after onset of fever. For other suspected SARS cases\nin the United States, a second serum specimen collected greater than 21\ndays after fever onset will be necessary to determine whether infection\nwith the novel coronavirus can be documented. A reverse\ntranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test specific for RNA from\nthe novel coronavirus has been positive within the first 10 days after\nfever onset in specimens from some SARS patients, but the duration of\ndetectable viremia or viral shedding is unknown, and RT-PCR tests on\nsamples collected during convalescence might be negative. Viral culture\nfollowed by RT-PCR also has been used to detect the novel coronavirus in\nsome specimens.\nCase Histories\nOn 3 Apr 2003, CDC reported to the respective health departments positive\ncoronavirus test results for 5 persons with SARS. All 5 had pneumonia\nrequiring hospitalization and had traveled recently to a country in which\ncommunity transmission had occurred. The 5 patients did not travel together\nor at the same time. Although 2 patients had a common hotel exposure in\nHong Kong, no evidence of a single common exposure for all 5 patients has\nbeen found. Specimens from these 5 patients were among the first tested;\npatients were selected on the basis of their clinical and exposure\nhistories. A description of the exposure and brief clinical history for\neach of these 5 SARS patients follows.\nCase 1. Patient I is a pregnant woman aged 36 years with a history of\nintermittent chronic cough; as of 9 Apr 2003, she was in her 26th week of\npregnancy. During 19 Feb--2 Mar 2003, she traveled to Hong Kong and\nGuangdong province in China to visit her family. While in Hong Kong, she\nstayed at Hotel M during 19-22 Feb 2003 and again during 24 Feb--2 Mar\n2003. The first stay was on the same floor and during the same time as\nPatient A (the index case in a large cluster of persons with suspected SARS\ndescribed previously) (1). On 8 Feb 2003 [?typographic error - Mod.MPP],\nPatient I's intermittent cough resumed. On 24 Feb 2003, she had onset of\nfever, chills, and headache. During the next 3 days, her cough progressed,\nand she had shortness of breath, myalgia, and blood-streaked sputum. She\nsought medical care in Hong Kong and received an antibiotic. Her symptoms\nworsened, and on return to the United States on 2 Mar 2003, she was\nhospitalized with a diagnosis of pneumonia. On admission, her temperature\nwas 100.5 F (38.1 C), and rales were noted on chest examination. A chest\nradiograph showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, and her oxygen\nsaturation was 93 percent. Laboratory studies on admission included a white\nblood cell count (WBC) of 3300/mm3 (12 percent lymphocytes), platelets of\n103 000/mm3, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 42 U/L. During the next\n3 days, despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, she worsened\nclinically with persistent fever and progressive pulmonary infiltrates. On\n5 Mar 2003 she had respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation,\nand oseltamivir was added to her treatment. She improved gradually during\nthe next week and was extubated on 12 Mar 2003. On 17 Mar 2003, she was\ndischarged and was recovering as of 9 Apr 2003. Serologic testing of a\nserum specimen collected 12 days after illness onset was positive for\ncoronavirus antibody. RT-PCR testing for human metapneumovirus is pending.\nCase 2. Patient L is a man aged 39 years with a medical history of sleep\napnea and hypothyroidism. He traveled on vacation to Thailand on 23 Feb\n2003 and then to Hong Kong on 1 Mar 2003. During 1-6 Mar 2003, he stayed at\nHotel M, at the same time as 3 other suspected SARS patients who were ill\nduring their hotel stays (1). On 6 Mar 2003, he returned to the United\nStates. On 13 Mar 2003, he had fever, myalgia, and a mild cough. During the\nnext 3 days, he had diarrhea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and shortness of\nbreath. On 17 Mar 2003, he was hospitalized with pneumonia and a right\nupper lobe infiltrate on a chest radiograph. Laboratory studies included a\nWBC of 6600/mm3 (50 percent neutrophils and 30 percent lymphocytes) and\nplatelets of 439 000/mm3. Maximum temperature during hospitalization was\n102.4 F (39.1 C). He received broad-spectrum antibiotics but no antiviral\ntherapy and was discharged on 25 Mar 2003. Serologic testing of a blood\nspecimen collected 6 days after symptom onset was positive for coronavirus\nantibody. RT-PCR testing for human metapneumonia virus was negative. On 19\nMar 2003, his wife, who had traveled with him to Hong Kong, developed\nsuspected SARS, including pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Her illness\nonset occurred 13 days after return from Hong Kong and resulted presumably\nfrom close contact with patient L.\nCase 3. Patient X is a woman aged 49 years with a medical history of\nchronic sinusitis. She traveled to Hong Kong on business on 2 Mar 2003 and\nreturned to the United States on 8 Mar 2003. The same day, she had fever,\ncough, and shortness of breath for which she sought medical care. She was\ngiven an oral antibiotic. Her symptoms persisted; on 20 Mar 2003, she was\nhospitalized with shortness of breath, chest pain, and rigors. On\nadmission, she had a temperature of 101.4 F (38.6 C), a chest radiograph\nshowed interstitial infiltrates, and oxygen saturation on room air was 92\npercent. Laboratory studies on admission included a WBC of 5100/mm3 (68\npercent neutrophils and 28 percent lymphocytes), platelets of 156 000/mm3,\nand ALT of 25 U/L. During her hospitalization, she received broad-spectrum\nantibiotics and corticosteroids but no antiviral therapy. On 28 Mar 2003,\nshe was discharged in stable condition. An RT-PCR assay detected the novel\ncoronavirus on a sputum specimen collected 14 days after illness onset.\nRT-PCR testing for human metapneumovirus was negative.\nCase 4. Patient Y is a man aged 22 years with no notable medical history.\nHe traveled to Hong Kong on vacation on 3 Mar 2003 and returned to the\nUnited States on 6 Mar 2003. On 12 Mar 2003, he had onset of fever, chills,\nmyalgia, headache, and shortness of breath. On 13 Mar 2003, he had a cough\nand chest pain and was treated with oral antibiotics. The following day, he\nreported to an emergency department (ED) with persistent fever and cough. A\nchest radiograph demonstrated a right perihilar infiltrate. He received\nintravenous antibiotics in the ED and was discharged the same day on an\noral antibiotic. On 16 Mar 2003, he had worsening shortness of breath and\nrespiratory distress, and was admitted to a hospital intensive-care unit.\nOn admission, his temperature was 102.9 F (39.4 C), with an oxygen\nsaturation of 81 percent on room air. Chest radiograph demonstrated\nbilateral infiltrates with pleural effusion. Laboratory studies on\nadmission included a WBC of 5300/mm3 (82 percent neutrophils and 14 percent\nlymphocytes), platelets of 197 000 mm3/mL, and ALT of 74 U/L. He received\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics and oseltamavir. A direct fluorescent antibody\nassay for influenza type A and influenza type B was negative. By 20 Mar\n2003, his condition stabilized, and he was discharged on 22 Mar 2003.\nSerologic tests of specimens obtained 4, 6, and 13 days after illness onset\nwere positive for antibody to coronavirus.\nCase 5. Patient Z is a woman aged 53 years with no notable medical history.\nShe traveled to Singapore on 27 Feb 2003 and returned to the United States\non 13 Mar 2003. While in Singapore, she visited hospitals that were\nproviding care for patients with pneumonia and had close contact with\nseveral persons with probable SARS. She did not use a surgical mask or any\nrespiratory precautions while in the Singapore hospitals. On 9 Mar 2003,\nshe had a headache. During 12-15 Mar 2003, she had fever, chills, and\nmyalgia. On 15 Mar 2003, she was hospitalized with a temperature of 102.7 F\n(39.3 C). On admission, a chest radiograph indicated bilateral basilar\natelectasis. Laboratory studies on admission included a WBC of 6500/mm3 (68\npercent neutrophils and 19 percent lymphocytes), platelets of 216 000/mm3,\nand ALT of 56 U/L. She received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics but\nno antiviral therapy. Her condition stabilized by 12 Mar 2003, and she was\ndischarged on 26 Mar 2003. Although serologic testing of a specimen\nobtained 3 days after fever onset was negative, a second specimen collected\n26 days after onset was positive for antibody to coronavirus. RT-PCR\ntesting for human metapneumovirus is pending.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\nEvidence of infection with a novel coronavirus has been identified in\npatients with suspected SARS in several countries (4--6), including the 5\npatients in the United States described in this report. These patients were\namong those selected for priority coronavirus testing because of their\nspecific clinical presentations and exposure histories. All had fever and\nrespiratory symptoms (e.g., nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and\nradiographic evidence of pneumonia). No consistent abnormal laboratory\nfindings were noted, and the majority were within the normal ranges. Some\nlaboratory tests that have been reported to be elevated in SARS patients,\nsuch as lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase (4,6--7), were not\nmeasured for any of these patients. All 5 patients received broad-spectrum\nantibiotics appropriate for coverage of typical and atypical respiratory\npathogens. Patients I and Y received oseltamivir, and Patient X received\ncorticosteroids; no patients received ribavirin. These clinical histories\nare similar to those reported from Canada and Hong Kong, but, as of 9 Apr\n2003, no initial characteristic signs or symptoms that clearly distinguish\nSARS from pneumonia caused by other pathogens have been described (4,6--8).\nHowever, if this novel coronavirus is the cause of SARS in these patients,\nthe clinical symptoms described in this report most likely do not represent\nthe full spectrum of illness related to coronavirus infection. Viruses that\ncause respiratory illness typically are capable of causing a range of\nclinical manifestations, and asymptomatic infections are possible.\nState and local health departments are coordinating collection of follow-up\nserum specimens from SARS patients whose initial serum specimen might have\nbeen collected too early to indicate serologic evidence of infection. These\nresults and investigations among well household and other well contacts of\nSARS patients (including travelers who were on airline flights with persons\nwith SARS symptoms) will provide additional information about the spectrum\nof illness among patients with SARS and coronavirus infection.\nThe majority of U.S. residents with SARS, including the 5 persons described\nin this report who had evidence of coronavirus infection, have recovered or\nstabilized clinically without specific antiviral therapy. The efficacy of\navailable antiviral therapies against coronavirus infection is unknown.\nRibavirin is a known teratogen, and clinicians who use it should be aware\nof all potential adverse events, including severe hemolytic anemia (9).\nPreliminary results from in vitro testing indicate that ribavirin\nconcentrations that inhibit ribavirin-sensitive viruses do not inhibit\nreplication or cell-to-cell spread of the novel coronavirus (JW Huggins,\nU.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, personal\ncommunication, 2003). However, further in vitro testing of antiviral drugs\non other coronavirus isolates, and more information on the clinical\noutcomes of patients treated with ribavirin or other antiviral drugs in\ncontrolled trials is needed.\nIn several countries, widespread community transmission, as well as\ntransmission among HCWs, has been observed. As of 9 Apr 2003, no U.S. HCWs\nwho provided care for the 5 patients with coronavirus infection described\nin this report had suspected SARS. Among the close contacts of these 5 SARS\npatients, only one (the wife of Patient L) has suspected SARS. The\ndifferent transmission patterns observed probably are not attributable to\ndifferences in infection-control practices alone. The inability to predict\nwhich patients are more capable of transmitting the virus that causes SARS\nunderscores the need to adhere strictly to infection-control\nrecommendations in both health-care and household settings. Similarly,\nclose contacts of SARS patients should be vigilant to detect fever or\nrespiratory symptoms, and persons who develop fever or respiratory symptoms\nshould seek health-care evaluation.\nOn 4 Apr 2003, the president of the United States signed an executive order\nadding SARS to the list of quarantinable communicable diseases. This act\nprovides CDC, through its Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, with\nthe legal authority to implement isolation and quarantine measures as part\nof transmissible disease-control measures, if necessary. Isolation refers\nto the practice of keeping a patient with a communicable disease separate\nfrom other persons, usually within a health-care facility or at home.\nIsolation is used routinely in hospital and health-care settings to reduce\nthe transmission of infections to uninfected patients. Quarantine refers to\nany situation in which a person or group of persons who have been exposed\nto a communicable disease and might be infected, but who are not yet ill,\nare kept apart from others to prevent disease spread. States generally have\nauthority to invoke and enforce quarantine within their jurisdictions,\nalthough quarantine laws vary among states. Quarantine is an effective\npublic health tool. Quarantine in the United States is used primarily to\nrestrict patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who remain infectious but are\nunable or unwilling to remain in settings where they are less likely to\ntransmit illness. During the previous month, health officials in Singapore,\nHong Kong, and Canada have implemented quarantine and isolation measures to\nlimit the spread of SARS.\n(<http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/04/iraq/20030404-8.html>)\nAlthough evidence is accumulating that a novel coronavirus is the primary\ncausative agent of SARS, more laboratory and epidemiologic data are needed\nbefore this link is established fully. Once definitive identification of\nthe cause of SARS has been achieved, an intensive focus on development of\neffective treatment regimens might reduce morbidity and mortality of\npatients with SARS. However, specific measures to prevent transmission\n(e.g., vaccination programs, prophylactic drugs, or hyperimmune globulin)\nmight require more time to develop and implement. In the interim,\nstrengthening traditional public health functions such as collection and\nrapid analysis of surveillance and epidemiologic data, and implementing\nessential infection-control measures for suspected SARS patients and their\ncontacts, will be the mainstays of SARS control. A sustained and\ncooperative global public health response will be necessary to limit\nfurther dissemination of SARS and to prepare for emerging global microbial\nthreats.\nReferences\n1. CDC.

In this article\n(<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/10/science/10INFE.html>), 'Dr.[James]\nHughes said the reason CDC had not reported that it had local or community\ntransmission was that it uses a different definition.

But, in the case of SARS, Dr. Hughes said, 'there is\ngreat confusion about what is community transmission versus what is\ntransmission in recognized settings where transmission typically\noccurs. This is an area of inconsistency that needs further discussion.'\nBecause the secondary spread to hospital workers and household members\n'represents close contact transmission of patient to health care worker or\nill person to family contact in a household setting,' the CDC does not\nconsider such secondary transmission as community transmission, Dr. Hughes\nsaid.

Although some patients have detectable coronavirus\nantibody within 14 days of illness onset, definitive interpretation of\nnegative coronavirus antibody tests is possible only for specimens obtained\ngreater than 21 days after onset of fever. This report updates information on U.S. residents with SARS\nand summarizes the clinical histories of the 5 U.S. residents identified as\nof 9 Apr 2003, who have both suspected SARS and laboratory evidence of\ninfection with a novel coronavirus. Similarly,\nclose contacts of SARS patients should be vigilant to detect fever or\nrespiratory symptoms, and persons who develop fever or respiratory symptoms\nshould seek health-care evaluation. For other suspected SARS cases\nin the United States, a second serum specimen collected greater than 21\ndays after fever onset will be necessary to determine whether infection\nwith the novel coronavirus can be documented. These clinical histories\nare similar to those reported from Canada and Hong Kong, but, as of 9 Apr\n2003, no initial characteristic signs or symptoms that clearly distinguish\nSARS from pneumonia caused by other pathogens have been described (4,6--8).

Of the 60 (36 percent)\npatients who were hospitalized for greater than 24 hours, 4 (7 percent)\nremained hospitalized as of 9 Apr 2003, and no deaths were reported. Although serologic testing of a specimen\nobtained 3 days after fever onset was negative, a second specimen collected\n26 days after onset was positive for antibody to coronavirus. As of 9 Apr 2003, a total of 2722 SARS cases have been reported to WHO from\n16 countries, including the United States; 106 deaths (case-fatality\nproportion: 3.9 percent) have been reported to WHO (3). However, if this novel coronavirus is the cause of SARS in these patients,\nthe clinical symptoms described in this report most likely do not represent\nthe full spectrum of illness related to coronavirus infection. During 1-6 Mar 2003, he stayed at\nHotel M, at the same time as 3 other suspected SARS patients who were ill\nduring their hotel stays (1). The majority of U.S. residents with SARS, including the 5 persons described\nin this report who had evidence of coronavirus infection, have recovered or\nstabilized clinically without specific antiviral therapy. While in Hong Kong, she\nstayed at Hotel M during 19-22 Feb 2003 and again during 24 Feb--2 Mar\n2003. Serologic testing of a\nserum specimen collected 12 days after illness onset was positive for\ncoronavirus antibody. Although 2 patients had a common hotel exposure in\nHong Kong, no evidence of a single common exposure for all 5 patients has\nbeen found. State and local health departments are coordinating collection of follow-up\nserum specimens from SARS patients whose initial serum specimen might have\nbeen collected too early to indicate serologic evidence of infection. Specimens from these 5 patients were among the first tested;\npatients were selected on the basis of their clinical and exposure\nhistories. On 19\nMar 2003, his wife, who had traveled with him to Hong Kong, developed\nsuspected SARS, including pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Serologic testing of a blood\nspecimen collected 6 days after symptom onset was positive for coronavirus\nantibody. Laboratory studies on admission included a WBC of 6500/mm3 (68\npercent neutrophils and 19 percent lymphocytes), platelets of 216 000/mm3,\nand ALT of 56 U Laboratory studies on admission included a WBC of 5100/mm3 (68\npercent neutrophils and 28 percent lymphocytes), platelets of 156 000/mm3,\nand ALT of 25 U/L. Patient I is a pregnant woman aged 36 years with a history of\nintermittent chronic cough; as of 9 Apr 2003, she was in her 26th week of\npregnancy. Laboratory studies on\nadmission included a WBC of 5300/mm3 (82 percent neutrophils and 14 percent\nlymphocytes), platelets of 197 000 mm3/mL, and ALT of 74 U/L. All 5 patients received broad-spectrum\nantibiotics appropriate for coverage of typical and atypical respiratory\npathogens. These patients were\namong those selected for priority coronavirus testing because of their\nspecific clinical presentations and exposure histories. Laboratory studies included a\nWBC of 6600/mm3 (50 percent neutrophils and 30 percent lymphocytes) and\nplatelets of 439 000/mm3. On\n5 Mar 2003 she had respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation,\nand oseltamivir was added to her treatment. Laboratory studies on admission included a white\nblood cell count (WBC) of 3300/mm3 (12 percent lymphocytes), platelets of\n103 000/mm3, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 42 U/L. The WHO case definition for probable SARS\nincludes radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or\nrespiratory distress syndrome (RDS) on chest radiograph (2). Cases reported\nto WHO outside the United States are probable SARS cases; the United States\nreports all suspected cases. Her symptoms\nworsened, and on return to the United States on 2 Mar 2003, she was\nhospitalized with a diagnosis of pneumonia. While in Singapore, she visited hospitals that were\nproviding care for patients with pneumonia and had close contact with\nseveral persons with probable SARS. All had fever and\nrespiratory symptoms (e.g., nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and\nradiographic evidence of pneumonia). During the next\n3 days, despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, she worsened\nclinically with persistent fever and progressive pulmonary infiltrates.

Since then,\nprobable cases of SARS have been reported in 17 countries.\n- WHO is constantly investigating and, where appropriate, verifying rumours\nabout SARS coming in from a wide range of sources.\n- The current cumulative number of cases of SARS is 2781 cases with 111\ndeaths, officially notified by ministries of health. - - The global\ncase-fatality rate for probable SARS is 4 percent.\n- Most SARS cases to date have occurred in young adults. This transmission\npattern largely reflects the age of health care workers, their family\nmembers and social contacts, and international travellers. On the basis of\npresent data, children appear to be less likely to present with SARS than\nadults.\n- SARS appears to be spread most commonly by close person-to-person contact\ninvolving exposure to infectious droplets, and possibly by direct contact\nwith infected body fluids.\n- China continues to see new cases of SARS although the numbers are\ndecreasing following a peak in cases in February 2003. To date, 1290 cases\nand 55 deaths have been reported from mainland China.\n- Hong Kong is experiencing the second largest outbreak of SARS with 998\ncases and 30 deaths. A significant outbreak at the Amoy Gardens apartment\nblock between 27 Mar 2003 to 1 Apr 2003 resulted in a peak in cases.\nStringent public health measures appear to have controlled the Amoy Gardens\noutbreak. However, cases continue to be reported in health care workers,\nand Hong Kong health authorities are strengthening their infection control\nand community-based public health measures accordingly.\n- Canada has experienced an outbreak of 97 probable SARS cases and 10\ndeaths. Up to now, the outbreak has been largely confined to Toronto. All\ncases have been epidemiologically linked to transmission related to a\nhealth care setting and transmission among close contacts of known SARS\ncases. In the Canadian outbreak, the higher case-fatality ratio appears to\nbe linked to the older age of the patients, who frequently have underlying\nchronic disease.\n- Infection control and other public health measures implemented in Viet\nNam have effectively controlled the outbreak in Hanoi. Very low levels of\ntransmission have been reported after 24 Mar 2003. Since the outbreak began\non 26 Feb 2003, 4 deaths have been reported.\n- Although Singapore continues to see new cases, including clusters in\nhospital staff, inpatients, and visitors at 2 hospitals, the daily increase\nin numbers has decreased since a peak in mid-March 2003. As of 10 Apr 2003,\na cumulative total of 126 cases with 9 deaths has been reported. Singapore\nis currently investigating a new cluster at the Singapore General Hospital\naffecting 52 persons in Wards 57 and 58, comprising 19 probable and 33\nsuspect SARS cases. The index case was admitted to this hospital on 24 Mar\n2003 for the management of unrelated chronic illness, did not show\ncharacteristic SARS symptoms initially, and therefore was not placed in\nisolation and managed according to the principles of strict infection control.\n- Cases continue to increase in the United States with 154 persons under\ninvestigation. US figures include probable and suspect cases. The US now\nreports limited transmission from patients to health care workers. No\ndeaths have so far been reported from the US.\n- Areas defined as 'affected' are updated each day according to the latest\ndata on cases and evidence of patterns of transmission. Epidemiological\ndata indicate that SARS cases occurring in all other countries became\ninfected while present in one of the affected areas or by direct contact\nwith known cases of SARS.\nAn epidemic curve of worldwide reporting by dates of onset can be found at:\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsepicurve/epiindex/en/index1.html>.\n\n[E] Information to Member States regarding goods and animals arriving from\nSARS-affected areas 11 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/goods2003_04_10/en/>\nWHO is aware of concern over the possibility that SARS may be caused by\ncontact with animals. WHO is therefore working closely with the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Office\nInternational des Epizooties (OIE), to determine whether there is any\nevidence to suggest that SARS-related disease has occurred in animals.\nWHO, FAO and OIE have reviewed reports received regarding SARS\ntransmission. To date there is no epidemiological information to suggest\nthat contact with goods, products, or animals shipped from SARS-affected\nareas has been the source of SARS infection in humans.\nFor the above reasons, WHO does not at present conclude that any goods,\nproducts, or animals arriving from SARS-affected areas pose a risk to\npublic health. WHO will continue to closely monitor the evolution of SARS,\nin collaboration with Ministries of Health and our partner agencies.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 11 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health 11 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 11 Apr 2003\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 1 PM 11 Apr 2003, an additional 61 patients with symptoms of atypical\npneumonia were admitted to public hospitals.

Using a laser\nmicroscope to compare victim samples sent by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention to genetic material from about 1000 different\nviruses imprinted on a glass slide, the University of California researcher\nfound the telltale clues of the suspect virus appearing as illuminated dots\non his computer screen.\nDeRisi placed his computer's cursor over one lighted dot and it read\n'bovine coronavirus.' Another dot outputted 'avian coronavirus.' By the\ntime he got to the turkey and human coronavirus dots, he knew he was\ndealing with something the world's scientists had never seen before. If it\nhad been a known virus --- say the human coronavirus, a cause of the common\ncold --- then only human coronavirus dots would have lighted up. 'This\nsuggests this is not a simple mutation of a human virus,' said DeRisi.\nWhatever this was, it was related closely enough to the other viruses to\nbond to their DNA [cDNA in the case of RNA viruses?] but exotic enough to\nsuggest that it was something entirely new that had crossed the species\nbarrier. DeRisi immediately e-mailed CDC researchers on 23 Mar 2003\nconfirming that a new coronavirus was probably causing the syndrome, which\nhas killed at least 82 people and sickened hundreds, hurting business and\ntravel as it spread from China, where it apparently originated.\nThe 'virus chip' DeRisi and his colleagues created could come in handy as\nepidemiologists try to identify and contain emerging diseases --- including\npathogens that bioterrorists could launch. 'It's amazingly simple and\nstraightforward,' DeRisi said. 'There's nothing revolutionary about this\nconcept except for the fact that we did it.' What DeRisi did was build upon\nthe microarray, or gene chip, an 8-year-old invention that melds DNA onto\nglass using some of the same technology that makes computer chips.\nMicroarrays allow biologists to analyze thousands of genes simultaneously\ninstead of one at a time. 'Microarrays are pretty universal,' said Henry\nNiman, a cancer researcher at Harvard Medical School, who uses chips with\nhuman genes in his own research and called DeRisi's for his results on the\nSARS finding. 'Impressive,' Niman concluded after analyzing the data.\n--\nGeorge A.

We conducted studies to identify the\netiologic agent of this outbreak.\nMethods:\nWe received clinical specimens from patients in six countries and tested\nthem, using virus isolation techniques, electron-microscopical and\nhistologic studies, and molecular and serologic assays, in an attempt to\nidentify a wide range of potential pathogens.\nResults:\nNo classic respiratory or bacterial respiratory pathogen was consistently\nidentified. However, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients who met\nthe case definition of SARS. Cytopathological features were noted\nmicroscopically in Vero E6 cells inoculated with a throat-swab specimen.\nElectron-microscopical examination of cultures revealed ultrastructural\nfeatures characteristic of coronaviruses. Immunohistochemical and\nimmunofluorescence staining revealed reactivity with group I coronavirus\npolyclonal antibodies. Consensus coronavirus primers designed to amplify a\nfragment of the polymerase gene by reverse transcription\u00adpolymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR) were used to obtain a sequence that clearly identified\nthe isolate as a unique coronavirus only distantly related to previously\nsequenced coronaviruses. With specific diagnostic RT-PCR primers we\nidentified several identical nucleotide sequences in 12 patients from\nseveral locations, a finding consistent with a point source outbreak.\nIndirect fluorescent antibody tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays\nmade with the new coronavirus isolate have been used to demonstrate a\nvirus-specific serologic response. Preliminary studies suggest that this\nvirus may never before have infected the U.S. population.\nConclusion:\nA novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence\nindicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS. The name Urbani\nSARS-associated coronavirus is proposed for the virus.\n--\nThomas G. Ksiazek, D.V.M., Ph.D., Dean Erdman, Dr. P.H., Cynthia\nGoldsmith, M.S., Sherif R.

SARS is thought to be caused by an unknown\ninfectious agent.\nMethods:\nClinical specimens from patients with SARS were searched for unknown\nviruses with the use of cell cultures and molecular techniques.\nResults:\nA novel coronavirus was identified in patients with SARS. The virus was\nisolated in cell culture, and a sequence 300 nucleotides in length was\nobtained by a polymerase-chain reaction (PCR)\u00adbased random-amplification\nprocedure. Genetic characterization indicated that the virus is only\ndistantly related to known coronaviruses (identical in 50 to 60 percent of\nthe nucleotide sequence). On the basis of the obtained sequence,\nconventional and real-time PCR assays for specific and sensitive detection\nof the novel virus were established. Virus was detected in a variety of\nclinical specimens from patients with SARS but not in controls. High\nconcentrations of viral RNA of up to 100 million molecules per milliliter\nwere found in sputum. Viral RNA was also detected at extremely low\nconcentrations in plasma during the acute phase and in feces during the\nlate convalescent phase. Infected patients showed sero-conversion on the\nVero cells in which the virus was isolated.\nConclusion:\nThe novel coronavirus might have a role in causing SARS.\n--\nChristian Drosten, M.D., Stephan G\u00fcnther, M.D., Wolfgang Preiser, M.D.,\nSylvie van der Werf, Ph.D., Hans-Reinhard Brodt, M.D., Stephan Becker,\nPh.D., Holger Rabenau, Ph.D., Marcus Panning, M.D., Larissa Kolesnikova,\nPh.D., Ron A.M.

Again the methodology is described in detail and\nthe paper is supplemented by sequence alignments and a diagrammatic\nrepresentation of the location of the primers. An independently derived\nphylogenetic tree exhibits the same relationships among coronaviruses and\nindicates that the SARS-associated coronavirus is not closely related to\nany perviously known coronavirus. Whether it is a unique virus or a\nrecombinant between pre-exising viruses is an open question that must await\ncomplete sequencing of the virus genome.\nThe principal finding of the study is the identification of a novel\ncoronavirus in patients with SARS. Furthermore, it appears that patients\nwith SARS are acutely infected with this virus, since they have\nvirus-specific IgG, and sero-conversion was observed. A high rate of\npositivity among patients with probable SARS during an outbreak in Hanoi,\nin conjunction with the complete negativity among all healthy contacts of\npatients affected by the same outbreak, provides evidence of an association\nbetween the disease and the presence of this novel virus.\nThe authors caution, however, that in the past, viruses have been initially\nisolated from patients with a specific disease but subsequent\ninvestigations revealed no actual association.

This action follows concerns, connected with yesterday's report\nfrom a WHO investigative team, about SARS cases in Beijing and systems of\ncase reporting and contact tracing.\n\nChina is today reporting 10 new SARS cases, with 2 new deaths, compared\nwith yesterday.\n\nIn a separate development, 2 laboratories in China have announced detection\nof a coronavirus in specimens taken from SARS patients. The new virus,\nwhich is unlike any known human or animal virus in the coronavirus family,\nwas isolated by a WHO virtual network of 11 laboratories set up to expedite\nidentification of the etiological agent and development of a diagnostic\ntest. Detection of the coronavirus adds further evidence that the outbreak\nthat began in Guangdong Province in mid-November 2002 was caused by the\nSARS virus.\n\nHong Kong\nHealth authorities in Hong Kong have today announced that all household\ncontacts of confirmed SARS patients will be required to confine themselves\nat home for up to 10 days with immediate effect. The new measure is\nintended to facilitate early detection and treatment of SARS cases and to\nreduce to the absolute minimum the risk of further spread. With a\ncumulative total of 998 cases and 28 deaths, Hong Kong ranks just below\nChina in the severity of the SARS outbreak.\n\nHousehold contacts can choose between confinement in their homes and\nconfinement in holiday camps. No visitors are allowed during the\nconfinement period, and permission to leave homes or camps will be granted\nonly on exceptional grounds. During the confinement period, the Hong Kong\nDepartment of Health will conduct medical checks to monitor health, and the\npolice force will conduct compliance checks. Officials in the Department of\nHealth estimate that an initial 70 to 80 households, representing around\n150 persons, will be subject to the new requirement.\n\nIn a separate development, ongoing investigations of the source of\ninfection in the unusual cluster of cases in Amoy Gardens have failed to\ndetect the virus in animals. The findings refute previous hypotheses that\nthe SARS might have been spread by cockroaches or rodents, possibly through\nsome common system serving vertically connected flats. Most Amoy Gardens\ncases have been residents in a single wing of a single building, Block E.\n\nSingapore\nIn Singapore, particular concern has centered on a cluster of suspect and\nprobable SARS cases first noted on 5 Apr 2003 in 21 staff at the Tan Tock\nSeng Hospital. Intensive investigation by WHO staff and Ministry of Health\nofficials have traced most cases to a single Chinese man in his 60s was had\nbeen treated for chronic kidney disease and diabetes at another hospital\n(Singapore General Hospital) from 5 to 20 Mar 2003. The hospital\nsubsequently experienced a cluster of 19 probable and 33 suspected SARS\ncases in staff, visitors, and inpatients. Most have been linked to the\nChinese patient.\n\nThe second hospital-related cluster of SARS cases has now been linked to a\ndecision to transfer all patients at Singapore General Hospital to 2 wards\nat Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It is strongly suspected that the second cluster\narose from contact with the Chinese patient. The investigation is providing\nsome reassurance about the cause of these cases, which increasingly appear\nto fit the known pattern of exposure during close contact with patients.\n\nViet Nam\nThe number of cases in Viet Nam remains stable at 62. WHO staff and\nMinistry of Health officials anticipate that additional cases, associated\nwith a case in a provincial hospital, may emerge in the next few days.\nHowever, vigilance is high, contact tracing is intense, and good infection\ncontrol procedures are in place.\n\nCanada\nHealth Canada has reported a cumulative total of 97 cases, with 10 deaths.\nThe represents an increase of only 3 new cases for the second consecutive\nday. Ontario has reported 94 probable cases. All cases have occurred in\npersons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. British Columbia has reported 3\nprobable cases.\n\nMalaysia: history of third probable case\nWHO staff are collaborating with health authorities in Malaysia to conduct\nin-depth investigations, including history of recent travel and visits to\nhealth facilities, of the country's 3 probable SARS cases in an effort to\nprevent a wider outbreak. 2 new cases were reported today. Investigation of\nthe country's third case has revealed a history of travel to Beijing, China\nand Bangkok, Thailand. Onset of illness occurred in Bangkok. Upon return to\nPenang, Malaysia, the patient visited 2 private hospitals over a 2-day\nperiod. Possible contacts are now being traced.\n\nActive contact tracing is a sound and essential public health measure for\ndetecting persons who may have been exposed and alerting them to the steps\nto take should symptoms develop. Contact tracing can also establish whether\nall probable patients and suspect cases are linked together, through close\nface-to-face contact, and thus determine whether any instance of secondary\ntransmission in the general community has occurred.\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2781 cases and 111 deaths have been\nreported from 17 countries.

There are\nmultiple curves, representing the global outbreak, and then outbreaks by\ncountry for Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Singapore, Canada, the United States, and\nthe European Region. Reviewing the curves, when looking at the epidemic\ncurve by date of onset, it does appear as though the global outbreak may\nhave already peaked, although this curve represents a small fraction of\nactual reported probable cases, as dates of onset were not available for\n2105 cases. The date of onset of the most recent reported cases was 1 Apr\n2003, 6 days preceding the last date of notification. In contrast, the\nepidemic curve plotting reported cases by date of report appears to be\nconsistent with ongoing transmission at a steady rate, with a marked\nincrease in numbers of cases reported on 1 Apr 2003 (representing the\ndelayed reports from China) and another significant increase in reported\ncases on 8 Apr 2003.\n\nThe epidemic curve by date of report in Hong Kong suggests that there was a\nlarge peak during the week of 29 Mar 2003, and a second smaller peak during\nthe week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve by date of onset for Viet Nam\nsuggests that there was a peak during the week of 8 Mar 2003, and apparent\ninterruption of transmission (or missed cases, or one incubation period\npending appearance of new cases) during the week of 29 Mar 2003 and the\nappearance of a few cases during the week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic\ncurve, by date of onset for Singapore shows a clear peak in cases during\nthe period 15-22 Mar 2003 and a significant tapering off of cases by the\nweek 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve, by date of onset, for Canada shows a\nclear peak during the period 15-22 Mar 2003, with continued transmission\nbut at a lower rate. There have not been any cases reported with dates of\nonset since 4 Apr 2003 in Canada. The epidemic curve, by date of onset\n(current as of 4 Apr 2003), for the United States shows several peak\nperiods of cases, during the weeks of 15 Mar 2003, 22 Mar 2003, and 29 Mar\n2003. The maximum number of cases with dates of onset on a single day was\n9 on 17 Mar 2003. (We do not have information on the dates of onset of the\nfew healthcare workers and family members that were contacts of imported\ncases, but the overwhelming majority of cases reported in the United States\nwere in individuals with a history of travel to affected areas (see section\n[B] above). There have not been any cases reported with dates of onset\nsince 30 Mar 2003, representing a 5-day period without new cases. In\ncontrast, the epidemic curve by date of onset for the European Region is\nmore consistent with sporadic case reports, with a maximum of one or 2\ncases per day. To date there have not been reports of any secondary\ntransmission in the European Region. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\n[D] Update 25 - Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main\nSARS outbreaks in different countries 9 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_09/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to express our continuing gratitude to Marianne\nHopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for her daily monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\nChina\n------\nThe WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak\nin Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and\nVice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in\nGuangdong on 3 Apr 2003.\n\nThe team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to\nthe outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at\nevery level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore\nconcluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a\nhospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.\n\nHowever, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the\ncountryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further\nconcerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a\nparticular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the\nadequacy of contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of\nother provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in\nGuangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.\n\nIn Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of\nSARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not\nappear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact\ntracing will allow the disease to spread.\n\nThe team observed that many of China\u0092s poorer provinces may not have\nadequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of\nSARS, and underscored that Guangdong\u0092s capacity was exceptional among\nChina\u0092s provinces.\n\nIn Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health\ncare system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8\nPeople\u0092s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily\nduring the second week of February [2003]. The team noted that the response\nof the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication\nand bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.\n\nMicrobiological findings\n----------\nLarge banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases,\nfrom case contacts as well as from \u0093normal controls\u0094 exist at the\ninstitutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed\ninformation about the numbers and types of these specimens are available\nand were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on\neach of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the\nvery detailed epidemiological and clinical information held elsewhere in\nGuangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.\n\nThese specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from\nwhich the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as\npaired acute and convalescent sera (i.e., the first sample obtained during\nthe acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery), which will\nallow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that\nonce a causative agent for SARS was identified, these banks should be\ntested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however,\nless sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was\nalready sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed\nelsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested\nassistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer\nsequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental\ntests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.\n\nMain recommendations\n---------\nThe interim report made several major recommendations, including the following:\n\n- The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model\nthat all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures\nthat all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing\nthis system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for\nevaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by\ntechnical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent\nstandards are achieved and maintained.\n\n- The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards\nthroughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care\nfacilities.\n\n- Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak\nunder control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by\ntrained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but\npotential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport, needs\nto be routinely carried out. Contacts of cases should be provided with\ndetailed preventive advice verbally and in writing.\n\n- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is\nrequired, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens,\nand reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a\nnational SARS laboratory network within China:\n- National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou\n- Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou\nLaboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be\nincluded. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided\nto ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance\nactivities, as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease.\nChinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within\nChina to speed up the exchange of results, specimens, and reagents.\n\n- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the\nworld and their experience should be shared with the international\ncommunity through publications, meetings, and in drafting guidelines for\nthe management of SARS patients.\n\nPriority actions\nPriority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:\n\n- early recognition and treatment of cases\n\n- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics\n\n- prompt reporting of suspected cases\n\n- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public\nawareness campaigns and education.\n\n\nHong Kong: heavy burden on the health system\n---------\nWith today\u0092s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong\ncontinues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on\nhealth services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of\ninfection control may be needed.\n\nThe isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at\nmidnight, 9 Apr 2003. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that\nresidents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats\nhave been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.\n\nSingapore: role of 'super-spreaders'\n----------\nSingapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals\nfollowing an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include\nmandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and\nisolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital\noutbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses\nand doctors. Only 7 have been diagnosed as 'probable' SARS cases. The\ndistribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker\nconsidered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth\n'super-spreader' identified in Singapore.\n\nA 'super-spreader' is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons,\ninfected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS\nremain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such\n'super-spreaders' may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks\naround the world.\n\nUntil recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links\nto their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links\nfor the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show\nthat transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic and usually very\nill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers\ncontinue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation\nof the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community\nspread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients.\nHowever, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.\n\nViet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission\n--------\nVietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. 4 of these cases\nhave been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58\ncases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope\nthat the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained.\nHowever, a 59th case was reported on 31 Mar 2003.\n\nThis male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient\nat the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam\u0092s index case. This contact\ncontinued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter\u0092s husband,\nwho attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile\nillness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously.\nIt is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his\nfather-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists\nmaintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur.\nNor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently\nassumed (2-7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is\nbeing taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for\ncase 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi.\nCases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who\nprovided considerable care for case 59.\n\nWHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the\ncontacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will\nbe linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.\n\nOf the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died, and 14 remain in\nhospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although\nslightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.\n\nCanada: one new probable case reported\n--------\nHealth Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10\ndeaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in\npersons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in\nBritish Columbia (3).\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\n-------------\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been\nreported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3\ndeaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nNew cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42),\nSingapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case\nreported in Australia has been removed from the list.

With respect to China, the\nreports on the investigation in Guangdong are promising, and we look\nforward to seeing more epidemiologic and clinical details on the cases from\nthe outbreak. In addition, the collaboration with the Chinese MOH with\nrespect to laboratory studies is also very promising and will provide a\nbank of specimens among which to check diagnostic tests as well as to\nconduct further studies. On the negative side is the concern mentioned\nregarding other provinces' ability to manage an outbreak of SARS, both from\nthe clinical aspects as well as the public health aspects.\n\nFrom today's reported cases, it appears the predominant new case reports\nare coming from Hong Kong. In Singapore, there continues to be\ntransmission, as continuation of the original importations and further\ngenerations of transmission related to those original importations from\nHong Kong. The notion of 'super spreaders' is further highlighted by the\nSingapore experience, and we look forward to more details from studies of\nthese reported 'super spreaders'. The experience in Viet Nam seems to\nsuggest that transmission does not occur during asymptomatic infection or\nduring the incubation period, but rather after the onset of clinical\nillness. The new cluster of cases is linked to the original outbreak in\nHanoi, with nosocomial spread to a health care worker, suggesting that\nnewly involved areas have not automatically suspected SARS and that a SARS\npatient is initially cared for in the absence of infection control\nprocedures. This begs the question: At what point should all febrile\npatients in the health care setting be initially evaluated using infection\ncontrol procedures, including respiratory barriers to transmission?\n\nThe addition of epidemic curves and geographic mapping of the ongoing SARS\noutbreak is appreciated, as 'a picture is worth 1000 words' (as was\nevidenced by the amount of words necessary to attempt to describe the\nsignificance of the curves by this moderator).

A good\nquestion, but a difficult one to answer in the absence of a definitive\ndiagnostic test for SARS at this point in time. We look forward to seeing\ncrude attack rates when available (taking liberty to refer to estimates of\nattack rates based on current clinical and epidemiologic case definitions,\nrecognizing that in the absence of a definitive diagnostic test these\ncalculations would be estimates as they would not account for asymptomatic\ninfections).\n\nThe removal of Australia from the list of countries reporting SARS cases is\na further reminder that SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion until there is a\ndefinitive diagnostic test that will allow for confirmation of cases, and\nthat there are still many other diagnoses that present with the same\nclinical syndrome as described for SARS. - Mod.MPP]", "summary": "The following institutions should form the nucleus of a\nnational SARS laboratory network within China:\n- National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou\n- Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou\nLaboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be\nincluded. In contrast, the\nepidemic curve plotting reported cases by date of report appears to be\nconsistent with ongoing transmission at a steady rate, with a marked\nincrease in numbers of cases reported on 1 Apr 2003 (representing the\ndelayed reports from China) and another significant increase in reported\ncases on 8 Apr 2003.

The epidemic curve by date of onset for Viet Nam\nsuggests that there was a peak during the week of 8 Mar 2003, and apparent\ninterruption of transmission (or missed cases, or one incubation period\npending appearance of new cases) during the week of 29 Mar 2003 and the\nappearance of a few cases during the week of 5 Apr 2003. We look forward to seeing\ncrude attack rates when available (taking liberty to refer to estimates of\nattack rates based on current clinical and epidemiologic case definitions,\nrecognizing that in the absence of a definitive diagnostic test these\ncalculations would be estimates as they would not account for asymptomatic\ninfections). The laboratory staff agreed that\nonce a causative agent for SARS was identified, these banks should be\ntested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however,\nless sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was\nalready sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed\nelsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. Reviewing the curves, when looking at the epidemic\ncurve by date of onset, it does appear as though the global outbreak may\nhave already peaked, although this curve represents a small fraction of\nactual reported probable cases, as dates of onset were not available for\n2105 cases. \n\nThe removal of Australia from the list of countries reporting SARS cases is\na further reminder that SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion until there is a\ndefinitive diagnostic test that will allow for confirmation of cases, and\nthat there are still many other diagnoses that present with the same\nclinical syndrome as described for SARS.

The epidemic\ncurve, by date of onset for Singapore shows a clear peak in cases during\nthe period 15-22 Mar 2003 and a significant tapering off of cases by the\nweek 5 Apr 2003. The team was further\nconcerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a\nparticular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the\nadequacy of contact tracing. \n\n\n[D] Update 25 - Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main\nSARS outbreaks in different countries 9 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_09/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to express our continuing gratitude to Marianne\nHopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for her daily monitoring of WHO reports. In\ncontrast, the epidemic curve by date of onset for the European Region is\nmore consistent with sporadic case reports, with a maximum of one or 2\ncases per day. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by\ntrained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but\npotential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport, needs\nto be routinely carried out. With respect to China, the\nreports on the investigation in Guangdong are promising, and we look\nforward to seeing more epidemiologic and clinical details on the cases from\nthe outbreak. Prof. Rod\nGriffiths,West Midlands, UK <Rod@stonebow.demon.co.uk> inquired about\nattack rates -- what proportion of exposed individuals (contacts of\nprobable SARS cases) have gone on to develop SARS themselves. \n\n- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the\nworld and their experience should be shared with the international\ncommunity through publications, meetings, and in drafting guidelines for\nthe management of SARS patients. \n\nThe team observed that many of China\u0092s poorer provinces may not have\nadequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of\nSARS, and underscored that Guangdong\u0092s capacity was exceptional among\nChina\u0092s provinces. To date, investigation\nof the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community\nspread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients.\n The experience in Viet Nam seems to\nsuggest that transmission does not occur during asymptomatic infection or\nduring the incubation period, but rather after the onset of clinical\nillness. The addition of epidemic curves and geographic mapping of the ongoing SARS\noutbreak is appreciated, as 'a picture is worth 1000 words' (as was\nevidenced by the amount of words necessary to attempt to describe the\nsignificance of the curves by this moderator). In Singapore, there continues to be\ntransmission, as continuation of the original importations and further\ngenerations of transmission related to those original importations from\nHong Kong. Although the patient data on\neach of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the\nvery detailed epidemiological and clinical information held elsewhere in\nGuangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals. Although transmission patterns of SARS\nremain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such\n'super-spreaders' may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks\naround the world. In addition, the collaboration with the Chinese MOH with\nrespect to laboratory studies is also very promising and will provide a\nbank of specimens among which to check diagnostic tests as well as to\nconduct further studies. There are\nmultiple curves, representing the global outbreak, and then outbreaks by\ncountry for Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Singapore, Canada, the United States, and\nthe European Region. They requested\nassistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer\nsequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental\ntests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays. A programme for\nevaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by\ntechnical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent\nstandards are achieved and maintained. [A] Cumulative number of reported probable(\u00a7) cases of severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS)\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_04_09/en/>\n\nFrom: 1 Nov 2002 To: 9 Apr 2003, 15:00 GMT+2\n\nCountry: Cumulative no. Due to differences in the case definitions being used at a national level,\nprobable cases are reported by all countries except the United States of\nAmerica, which is reporting suspect cases under investigation. (current as of 4 Apr 2003), for the United States shows several peak\nperiods of cases, during the weeks of 15 Mar 2003, 22 Mar 2003, and 29 Mar\n2003. All cases have occurred in\npersons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. 4 of these cases\nhave been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58\ncases for several consecutive days. Priority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:\n\n- early recognition and treatment of cases\n\n- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics\n\n- prompt reporting of suspected cases\n\n- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public\nawareness campaigns and education. The epidemic curve by date of report in Hong Kong suggests that there was a\nlarge peak during the week of 29 Mar 2003, and a second smaller peak during\nthe week of 5 Apr 2003. The WHO report therefore\nconcluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a\nhospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported. The health worker\nconsidered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth\n'super-spreader' identified in Singapore. The epidemic curve, by date of onset, for Canada shows a\nclear peak during the period 15-22 Mar 2003, with continued transmission\nbut at a lower rate. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show\nthat transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic and usually very\nill. Measures include\nmandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and\nisolation of all possible SARS cases. This begs the question: At what point should all febrile\npatients in the health care setting be initially evaluated using infection\ncontrol procedures, including respiratory barriers to transmission? \n\n- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is\nrequired, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens,\nand reagents. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8\nPeople\u0092s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily\nduring the second week of February [2003]. The notion of 'super spreaders' is further highlighted by the\nSingapore experience, and we look forward to more details from studies of\nthese reported 'super spreaders'. \n\n--\nProMED-mail\n< The team noted that the response\nof the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication\nand bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals. On the negative side is the concern mentioned\nregarding other provinces' ability to manage an outbreak of SARS, both from\nthe clinical aspects as well as the public health aspects. The WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak\nin Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and\nVice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards\nthroughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care\nfacilities. In addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of\nother provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in\nGuangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures\nthat all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing\nthis system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. The strain on\nhealth services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of\ninfection control may be needed. The Singapore General Hospital\noutbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses\nand doctors. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided\nto ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance\nactivities, as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease. Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists\nmaintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur.\n \nChinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within\nChina to speed up the exchange of results, specimens, and reagents. A good\nquestion, but a difficult one to answer in the absence of a definitive\ndiagnostic test for SARS at this point in time.

This appears\nto be the first severe and easily transmissible new disease to emerge in\nthe 21st century. Though much about the disease remains poorly understood,\nincluding the exact identity of the causative virus, we do know that it has\nfeatures that allow it to spread rapidly along international air travel routes.\nAs of 10 Apr 2003, 2781 SARS cases, with 111 deaths, have been reported to\nWHO from 17 countries on 3 continents. Some outbreaks have reassuring\nfeatures. A high awareness of SARS symptoms among travellers and the\nmedical and nursing professions has often resulted in good management of\nimported cases - prompt isolation of patients and management according to\nstrict procedures of infection control. As a result, many countries having\nonly a single or a few imported cases have experienced no further spread to\nhospital staff, families of patients and hospital visitors, or the\ncommunity at large.\nThe list of countries and continents reporting suspect or probable SARS\ncases will no doubt continue to grow due to heightened global vigilance,\nknowledge about symptoms and exposures, and awareness of the need for\nimmediate isolation of cases and strict infection control. So long as these\nmeasures are followed, the detection of first cases in countries need not\nbe interpreted as evidence that SARS is continuing to spread. Tabular\ninformation on countries reporting SARS and the cumulative total of cases\nand deaths is published each day on the WHO SARS web site.\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/en/>\n'Hot zones' of concern\nDespite some positive signs that imported cases are not spreading further,\noutbreaks in China, Canada, Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore have taken root\nin hospitals and beyond, and give rise to considerable concern. One of the\nmost alarming features of SARS in these areas is its rapid spread in\nhospitals, where it has affected a large number of previously healthy\nhealth care workers. Many require intensive care, placing a huge strain on\nhospital facilities and staff. In countries, such as Canada, where cases\noccurred before WHO issued its global alert, SARS is continuing to spread\ndespite the introduction of strict patient isolation and excellent\ninfection control.\nChina\nOn 9 Apr 2003, a WHO investigative team, which had conducted interviews and\nstudies in Guangdong Province since 3 Apr 2003, presented its interim\nreport on the SARS outbreak to Chinese authorities. The team concluded that\nthe health system in Guangdong responded well to the outbreak, but that\nhealth systems in all other provinces had less capacity to cope with the\nseverity of the challenge posed by SARS. Several recommendations for\nimprovements were made in the report.\nThe team also found evidence of 'super-spreaders' in Guangdong, including\none who is thought to have infected as many as 100 other persons. The\noutbreak is now thought to date back to at least 16 Nov 2002, when an\ninitial case was reported in Foshan City.\nParticular concern centres on the situation in Beijing. Yesterday, WHO\ndeepened discussions with Beijing health authorities, particularly\nconcerning the efficiency of systems for case reporting and contact tracing.\nCanada\nTo date, Canada has reported 114 probable cases and 10 deaths. All cases\nhave occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had close contact\nwith SARS cases in households or health care facilities. Health Canada has\ntaken several steps to protect the health of Canadians and the travelling\npublic, and to reduce opportunities of transmitting the virus to others.\nSeveral Canadian schools and hospitals are closed.\nHong Kong\nHong Kong, with 998 cases and 30 deaths, is presently the hardest-hit area.\nHealth care workers continue to become infected in a growing number of\nhospitals. WHO learned this week that the chief executive of the Prince of\nWales Hospital - the initial epicentre of the Hong Kong outbreak - is\nhospitalized with atypical pneumonia. Hospitals are becoming overwhelmed. A\ndecision to suspend all primary, secondary, special schools and\nkindergartens until 6 Apr 2003 has been extended up to 21 Apr 2003.\nMost disturbing is a large cluster of 268 SARS cases linked to the Amoy\nGardens estate of high-rise apartment buildings. The vast majority of Amoy\nGardens cases have been traced to vertically linked apartments in a single\nbuilding, Block E. This pattern of transmission indicates that the disease\nhas moved out of the health care setting and is now occurring within the\ncommunity as secondary cases. Epidemiologists investigating the Amoy\nGardens outbreak are considering the hypothesis that some form of\nenvironmental contamination, perhaps linked to a sewage or ventilation\nsystem, is the source of the large cluster of cases. Although transmission\nthrough the faecal-oral route is being considered as one possibility, no\nevidence of airborne transmission has been demonstrated to date. Virus has\nnot been detected in animals, including cockroaches and rodents.\nYesterday, health authorities in Hong Kong announced that all household\ncontacts of confirmed SARS patients will be required immediately to confine\nthemselves at home for up to 10 days. Household contacts can choose between\nconfinement in their homes and confinement in holiday camps. No visitors\nare allowed during the confinement period, and permission to leave homes or\ncamps will be granted only on exceptional grounds. During the confinement\nperiod, the Hong Kong Department of Health will conduct medical checks to\nmonitor health, and the police force will conduct compliance checks.\nViet Nam\nIn Viet Nam, an epidemiologist from the Hanoi WHO office recognized the\nfirst case of SARS on 28 Feb 2003 at a French hospital in Hanoi. The number\nof cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 Mar 2003 at 58 cases\nand remained stable for 8 consecutive days. As the maximum incubation\nperiod for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over\nthis period raised hope that Viet Nam's outbreak had been brought under\ncontrol. However, on 3 Apr 2003 a probable SARS case was detected in a\nprovincial hospital. Though the case could be linked back to the French\nhospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the\nprovincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and\nvisitors may have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of\ncases. An additional 3 probable cases, known to have had close contacts\nwith cases, have been reported since 3 Apr 2003.\nSingapore\nIn Singapore, another of the earliest and hardest-hit areas, 126 persons,\nincluding several children under the age of 18 years, have been diagnosed\nwith SARS. Most disturbing are new and large clusters of suspected SARS\ncases among health workers, inpatients, and visitors in 2 interlinked wards\nat Singapore General Hospital and in a second hospital, Tan Tok Seng Hospital.\nIntense contact tracing and investigation of these clusters increasingly\npoints to contact with a single Chinese man in his 60s who was treated at\nSingapore General Hospital from 5 to 20 Mar 2003 for chronic kidney disease\nand diabetes at Singapore General Hospital. WHO epidemiologists, in\ncollaboration with national authorities, are finding increasing evidence\nthat the Chinese patient might have been a so-called 'super-spreader.'\nIn SARS outbreaks, a 'super-spreader' is a source case who has, for as yet\nunknown reasons, infected a large number of persons. It remains unknown\nwhether such 'super-spreaders' are persons secreting an exceptionally high\namount of infectious material or whether some other factor, perhaps in the\nenvironment, is working to amplify transmission at some key phase of virus\nshedding.\nNew coronavirus discovered\nThrough new mechanisms set up by WHO, progress on the research front has\nbeen unprecedented, particularly in the rapid discovery of a new\ncoronavirus and the rapid development of diagnostic tests. The best\nscientists from around the world are working on these problems around the\nclock, and in an unprecedented spirit of collaboration against a threat of\nas-yet-unknown dimensions. Nonetheless, we still do not have conclusive\nproof that the new virus is indeed the cause of SARS. The results of animal\nexperiments, which are currently being conducted by a laboratory in a WHO\nnetwork, will be available soon and may provide the last pieces of evidence\nneeded for definitive proof that SARS is caused by the newly discovered\ncoronavirus. Furthermore, the findings will provide additional evidence to\nunderstand the role of metapneumovirus as a possible 'helper virus' in\npersons co-infected with the new coronavirus.\nDiagnostic tests\nThe development of a diagnostic test has proved more problematic than\nhoped. 3 tests are now available and are helping to improve understanding\nof how the virus causes disease in humans. However, all 3 tests have\nlimitations as tools for bringing the SARS outbreak quickly under control.\nThe ELISA detects antibodies reliably but only from about day 20 after the\nonset of clinical symptoms. It therefore cannot be used to detect cases at\nan early stage before they have a chance to spread the infection to others.\nThe second test, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), detects antibodies\nreliably as of day 10 of infection, but is a comparatively slow test that\nrequires the growth of virus in cell culture.\nThe presently available PCR molecular test for detection of SARS virus\ngenetic material is useful in the early stages of infection but produces\nmany false negatives. This means that many persons who actually carry the\nvirus may not be detected -- creating a dangerous sense of false security\nin relation to a virus that is known to spread easily in close\nperson-to-person contact.\nPresent role of tests in diagnosis\nA positive test results indicates that a person is, or recently was,\ninfected with the coronavirus. However, a negative test result does not\nguarantee that the person is not infected with the virus.\nAt present, reporting to WHO of probable SARS cases is based on an\nassessment of clinical symptoms, history -- including travel history -- of\npossible exposure to an infected person, and distinctive chest X-rays. The\n9 countries in the WHO laboratory network, namely Canada, France, Germany,\nJapan, Hong Kong SAR, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and\nthe United States of America, are beginning to conduct routine laboratory\ntesting of suspect and probable SARS cases. WHO has posted on its web site\ndetails about the test methodology that allows other countries to perform\ntests. However, more work is needed to produce a robust test that is\ncapable of rapidly and reliably detecting cases at an early stage of infection.\nApart from the dimensions of the SARS outbreak apparent at this date, the\nsections below explain why this disease poses a particularly severe threat\nto international health, outline the chronology of events as SARS spread\naround the world, and discuss lessons based on strengths and weaknesses of\nthe global response for the immediate future. These lessons are of great\nimportance.\nThe SARS response is the roll-out of a global alert and response activity\nunder the revision of the International Health Regulations, which provide\nthe legal framework for the surveillance and reporting of infectious\ndisease and for the use of measures to prevent their international spread.\nSARS is showing how the alert and response activity works in practice for a\nnewly identified disease. It also indicates how the system now in operation\ncould apply to other highly significant infectious disease events,\nincluding the next influenza pandemic, the next emerging infection, and the\ndeliberate release of a biological agent in an act of warfare or terrorism.\nThe scientific community is now contending with an outbreak caused by a new\nvirus. This creates an extra step in the containment response:\nidentification and characterization of the causative agent, which then\nallows development of a diagnostic test, treatment protocols, and a\nscientifically sound basis for recommending control measures. This is a\nstep that would not be needed should a biological attack occur using a\nwell-known pathogen such as anthrax or smallpox. The response to an\ninfluenza pandemic would likewise not be dealing with an entirely new and\npoorly understood virus.\nSARS: a particularly serious threat to international health\nAlthough the last decades of the previous century witnessed the emergence\nof several new diseases, SARS needs to be regarded as a particularly\nserious threat for several reasons. If the SARS virus maintains its present\npathogenicity and transmissibility, SARS could become the first severe new\ndisease of the 21st century with global epidemic potential. As such, its\nclinical and epidemiological features, though poorly understood, give cause\nfor particular alarm. With the notable exception of AIDS, most new diseases\nthat emerged during the last 2 decades of the previous century or\nestablished endemicity in new geographical areas have features that limit\ntheir capacity to pose a major threat to international public health. Many\n(avian influenza, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Hanta virus) failed to\nestablish efficient human-to-human transmission. Others (_Escherichia coli_\nO157:H7, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) depend on food as a vehicle of\ntransmission. Diseases such as West Nile Fever and Rift Valley Fever that\nhave spread to new geographical areas require a vector as part of the\ntransmission cycle and are associated with low mortality, often in\nhigh-risk groups, such as the elderly, the immunocompromised, or persons\nwith co-morbidity. Still others (_Neisseria meningitidis_ W135, and the\nEbola, Marburg, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fevers) have strong\ngeographical foci. Although outbreaks of Ebola haemorrhagic fever have been\nassociated with case-fatality rates in the range of 53 percent (Uganda) to\n88 percent (Democratic Republic of the Congo), person-to-person\ntransmission requires close physical exposure to infected blood and other\nbodily fluids. Moreover, patients suffering from this disease during the\nperiod of high infectivity are visibly very ill and too unwell to travel.\nIn contrast, SARS is emerging in ways that suggest great potential for\nrapid international spread under the favourable conditions created by a\nhighly mobile, closely interconnected world. Anecdotal data indicate an\nincubation period of 2 to 10 days (average 2 to 7 days), allowing the\ninfectious agent to be transported, unsuspected and undetected, in a\nsymptomless air traveller from one city in the world to any other city\nhaving an international airport. Person-to-person transmission through\nclose contact with respiratory secretions has been demonstrated. The\ninitial symptoms are non-specific and common. The concentration of cases in\npreviously healthy hospital staff and the proportion of patients requiring\nintensive care are particularly alarming. This '21st century' disease could\nhave other consequences as well. Should SARS continue to spread, the global\neconomic consequences -- already estimated at around USD 30 billion --\ncould be great in a closely interconnected and interdependent world.\nChronology of events leading to an unprecedented emergency travel advisory\nSevere Acute Pulmonary Syndrome (SARS) was first identified in Viet Nam on\n28 Feb 2003, when Dr Carlo Urbani, an epidemiologist from the Hanoi WHO\noffice, examined a patient with a severe form of pneumonia for which no\netiology could be found. On 10 Mar 2003, 22 hospital workers in Hanoi\nFrench Hospital were ill with a similar acute respiratory syndrome, and by\n11 Mar 2003 similar outbreaks had been reported among hospital workers in\nHong Kong.\nSARS occurred at a time of heightened surveillance for atypical respiratory\ndisease. From 10 Feb 2003 the WHO office in Beijing, which reinforced its\nstaff with 2 epidemiologists, had been working with the government of China\nto learn more about an outbreak of atypical respiratory disease that\naffected health workers, their families and contacts in Guangdong Province,\nwith 305 cases and 5 deaths reported from 16 Nov 2002 to 7 Feb 2003. Around\n30 percent of cases were reported to occur in health care workers.\nSurveillance was heightened further when a 33-year-old man who had\ntravelled with his family to Fujian Province in China died in Hong Kong on\n17 Feb 2003. The next day, Hong Kong authorities announced that avian\ninfluenza A(H5N1) virus, the cause of 'bird flu', had been isolated from\nboth the man and his 9-year-old hospitalized son. Another member of the\nfamily, an 8-year-old daughter, died while in Fujian and was buried there.\nOn 12 Mar 2003, after an assessment of the situation in Asia with WHO teams\nin Hanoi, Hong Kong, and Beijing, a global alert was issued about cases of\nsevere atypical pneumonia with unknown etiology that appeared to place\nhealth workers at high risk.\n2 days later, on 14 Mar 2003, WHO received a report from the government of\nCanada that health authorities had taken steps to alert hospital workers,\nambulance services, and public health units across the provinces that there\nwere 4 cases of atypical pneumonia within a single family in Toronto that\nhad resulted in 2 deaths. At 02h00 Geneva time on the following day, 15 Mar\n2003, the government of Singapore notified WHO, by urgent\ntelecommunication, of a similar illness in a 32-year-old physician who had\ntreated hospital workers with a severe respiratory syndrome in Singapore,\nincluding one from the French Hanoi hospital who had self-evacuated to\nSingapore. This Singapore physician had travelled to the United States for\na medical conference, and at the end of the conference boarded a return\nflight to Singapore in New York. Before departure he had indicated to a\ncolleague in Singapore by telephone that he had symptoms similar to the\npatients he had treated in Singapore. The colleague notified health\nauthorities. WHO identified the airline and flight, and the physician and\nhis accompanying family members were removed from the flight at a stopover\nin Frankfurt, Germany, where he was immediately isolated and placed under\nhospital care, as were his 2 accompanying family members when they\ndeveloped fever and respiratory symptoms several days later. As a result of\nthis prompt action, Germany experienced no further spread linked to the 3\nimported cases.\nLater in the morning of 15 Mar 2003, with this background and chronology of\nevents, a decision was made by WHO to increase the level of the global\nalert issued on 12 Mar 2003. The decision was based on 5 different but\nrelated factors. First, the etiology, and therefore the potential for\ncontinued spread, of this new disease were not yet known. Second, the\noutbreaks appeared to pose a great risk to health workers who managed\npatients, and to the family members and other close contacts of patients.\nThird, many different antibiotics and antivirals had been tried empirically\nand did not seem to have an effect. Fourth, though the numbers were\ninitially small, a significant percentage of patients (25 of 26 hospital\nstaff in Hanoi, and 24 of 39 hospital staff in Hong Kong) had rapidly\nprogressed to respiratory failure, requiring intensive care and causing\nsome deaths in previously healthy persons. Finally, the disease had moved\nout of its initial focus in Asia and appeared to have spread to North\nAmerica and Europe.\nAt this time, the epidemiology of SARS was poorly understood. A virulent\nstrain of influenza had not been ruled out as a possible cause, even though\ntransmission patterns were not characteristic for influenza. There was also\nsome hope that the new disease, like many other new diseases of the recent\npast, would fail to maintain efficient person-to-person transmission, or\nthat it might attenuate with passage and eventually self-contain. Despite\nthe lack of understanding about the disease, its cause, and future\nevolution, the need was great to introduce a series of emergency measures\nto contain SARS outbreaks in the affected areas and prevent further\ninternational spread, thus reducing opportunities for the new disease to\nestablish endemicity. WHO thus decided, on 15 Mar 2003, to issue a rare\nemergency travel advisory as a global alert to international travellers,\nhealth care professionals, and health authorities.\nThe global alert called for increased attention to patients with atypical\npneumonia who fit the following case definition:\n- High fever (greater than 38 C)\n- One or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath,\ndifficulty breathing\nAND\nOne or more of the following:\n- Close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with SARS\n- Recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS.\nAt the same time the global alert recommended no change in patterns of\ninternational travel, but that passengers notify their health authority if\nthey should develop signs and symptoms as described above and have a\nhistory of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS. Following this alert,\nawareness increased immediately, and many potential new outbreaks were\nprevented by the prompt isolation and strict management of suspected cases.\nBy 27 Mar 2003, however, it was evident that international spread of SARS\nhad continued after the 15 Mar 2003 advisory at 2 of the earliest outbreak\nsites, namely Viet Nam and Hong Kong, and that persons on the same\naeroplanes as persons with symptoms consistent with SARS, and sitting in\nclose proximity to them, had developed signs and symptoms compatible with\nSARS. On this date it was decided to recommend new measures related to\ninternational travel, still with the intent of preventing the international\nspread of the infectious agent. These recommendations were that\nSARS-affected areas, where transmission was known to be occurring in chains\nof human-to-human transmission, institute measures to identify\ninternational passengers who had signs, symptoms and history compatible\nwith SARS, and to recommend that such persons postpone international travel\nand seek medical advice. These recommendations were instituted in most of\nthe affected areas shortly after 27 Mar 2003.\nHowever, concern continued to mount. An urgent investigation of the Amoy\nGardens outbreak in Hong Kong began on 29 Mar 2003, and the following day,\nhealth officials announced that 213 Amoy residents were probable cases of\nSARS. This followed an unusual cluster of cases, closely linked in time and\nplace, among guests and visitors who had stayed on the same floor of a\nhotel located in the same district (Kowloon) as Amoy Gardens. By this same\ndate, 9 business travellers and tourists had returned to Singapore, Beijing\nand Taiwan from Hong Kong, either sick or in the incubation period of SARS.\nOutbreaks in the hotel and housing estate indicated that SARS was showing\nan unusual pattern of transmission in Hong Kong, probably involving an\nenvironmental component, that would place persons at risk outside the\nconfined health care settings associated with outbreaks in most other\ncountries. The 9 cases of probable SARS that occurred in Singapore,\nBeijing, and Taiwan, and that were associated with travel in Hong Kong,\nindicated that the risk of international spread was continuing.\nConsultations were made with WHO teams and travel experts. On 2 Apr 2003 a\nrecommendation for voluntary postponement of all but essential travel was\nissued for travellers considering travel to Hong Kong. At the same time,\nbecause the WHO team and government of China had confirmed that the 4-month\nlong outbreak in Guangdong continued, and that cases fit the case\ndefinition being applied in Viet Nam and Hong Kong; and because\ntransmission patterns in Guangdong were not yet available, these same\nrecommendations were made for Guangdong as maximum security against spread\nof SARS outside of Guangdong in the absence of complete understanding of\ntransmission patterns of the outbreak there.\nCases of possible transmission in aeroplanes continue to be reported and\ninvestigated. As recently as 5 Apr 2003, notification of a SARS patient\ntravelling internationally by sea from Hong Kong to Vladivostak (Russian\nFederation) was received, opening a possible second route of international\ntravel for the virus.\nWHO travel recommendations are kept under constant review and will be\namended as more data about the evolution of SARS become available.\nLessons: the value of innovation and international collaboration\nThe knowledge obtained in the 3-week period since 15 Mar 2003 has been\nremarkable. It demonstrates the value of international cooperation on\nemerging infections and the importance of early detection and rapid\nintroduction of emergency measures to prevent further international spread\nand help ensure that imported cases are not allowed to cause disease in others.\nWhen WHO began to set up emergency plans on 15 Mar 2003, identification of\nthe SARS causative agent and the development of a diagnostic test were\ngiven paramount importance in the overall containment strategy. Detection\nof the disease in its early stage, confirmation of cases, understanding\nmodes of transmission, development of protocols for targeted treatment,\nvaccine research and development, and implementation of disease-specific\npreventive measures would all depend upon swift progress and results in\netiological and diagnostic research. Sound public health measures would\nalso require understanding of the presence and concentration of the\npathogen in different tissues and secretions, and patterns of excretion\nthroughout the course of illness and convalescence. So long as the\netiological agent remained unknown, specialists in infectious disease\ncontrol would be forced to resort to control tools dating back to the\n'Middle Ages' of microbiology: isolation and quarantine.\nOn 17 Mar 2003, a network of 11 leading laboratories around the world was\nset up as a mechanism for expediting identification of the SARS causative\nagent. Laboratories were selected on the basis of 3 criteria: outstanding\nscientific expertise, facilities at biosafety level III, and capacity to\ncontribute to the battery of tests and experiments that would be needed to\nfulfill Koch's 4 postulates for the identification of an infectious agent\nas the cause of a specific disease. The network was set up on the model of\nthe influenza network and provides another important lesson: models and\nsystems set up for one health emergency can be rapidly adapted to serve others.\nCollaboration is virtual. Members of the network confer in daily\nteleconferences coordinated by WHO and use a secure web site to post\nelectron microscopic pictures of candidate viruses, sequences of genetic\nmaterial for virus identification and characterization, descriptions of\nexperiments, and results. The well-guarded secret techniques that give each\nlaboratory its competitive edge have been immediately and openly shared\nwith others. Laboratories also quickly exchange various samples from\npatients and postmortem tissues. These arrangements have allowed the\nanalysis of samples from the same patient simultaneously in several\nlaboratories specialized in different approaches, with the results shared\nin real time. This collaboration has resulted in the identification of the\nsuspected causative agent, and the development of 3 diagnostic tests, with\nunprecedented speed.\nVirus isolation continues from patients with SARS, and at the same time\nvirus has been isolated from tears and faeces. Publications on these\nvarious findings are being prepared by members of this collaborating group,\nbut the need remains for a highly sensitive and specific PCR test to\ndiagnose acute infections.\nA similar collaborative group on epidemiology, made up of investigators\nfrom all sites with local transmission of SARS, continues to confirm\nperson-to-person transmission as the major route of transmission. Today,\nthe group exchanged information about the Hong Kong investigations to\nidentify a possible environmental source, which might prove useful in\nunderstanding the unusual new cluster of cases in Singapore. Key questions\ninclude the exact points during the course of incubation and infection when\ntransmission occurs and whether asymptotic cases are also capable of\nspreading SARS. These questions must be answered to better evaluate the\nextent of spread of SARS, and the success of containment activities.\nA third clinical group, which unites 80 clinicians from 13 countries having\nSARS cases, has consistently provided anecdotal information about the lack\nof efficacy of treatment with specific antibiotics and antivirals, and has\nbegun to develop systematic clinical trials of Ribaviran at 2 sites. Their\ndiscussions have shed light on features of the disease at presentation,\ntreatment and progression of the disease, prognostic indicators, and\ndischarge criteria. No therapy has been shown to demonstrate any particular\neffectiveness. The clinicians agreed that a subset of SARS patients,\nperhaps 10 percent, decline, usually around day 7, and need mechanical\nassistance to breathe. The care of these people is often complicated by the\npresence of other diseases. In this group, mortality is high. Age over 40\nyears also appears to be associated with a more severe form of disease.\nCountries have made travel recommendations for their citizens, using the\nguidance provided by WHO and other considerations such as feasibility of\nmedical evacuation of their citizens and their insurance coverage should\nthey become infected.\nOn 28 Mar 2003, at the end of the second week of the global response,\nChina, an initially reluctant partner in the global alert and response at\nthe start, became a full partner in the 3 working groups that were studying\nSARS, and concluded that the outbreaks of SARS elsewhere in Asia were\nrelated to the outbreak in Guangdong Province. The Chinese government has\nannounced that SARS is being given top priority. A system of alert and\nresponse for all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being developed.\nDaily electronic reporting of new cases and deaths, by province, has begun.\nEqually important, health officials have begun daily televised press\nconferences, thus taking the important step of increasing the awareness of\nthe population and hospital staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need\nto seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according\nto the principles of isolation and strict infection control.\nThe next weeks and months will tell whether the global alert and response\nwill contain the current SARS outbreaks, preventing SARS from becoming yet\nanother endemic infectious disease in human populations, or whether SARS\nwill remain confined to its origins in nature, to re-emerge at yet another\ntime and place. It is clear that the responsibility for containing the\nemergence of any new infectious disease showing international spread lies\non all countries. In a world where all national borders are porous when\nconfronted by a microbial threat, it is in the interest of all populations\nfor countries to share the information they may have as soon as it is\navailable. In so doing, they will allow both near and distant countries --\nall neighbours in our globalized world -- to benefit from the understanding\nthey have gained.\nby David L. Heymann\nExecutive Director, Communicable Diseases, WHO\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This is an excellent 'historical' overview of the sequence of events over\nthe past month since the recognition of this outbreak as a major global\nconcern.

A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: 11 Apr 2003\n From 10 Feb 2003 the WHO office in Beijing, which reinforced its\nstaff with 2 epidemiologists, had been working with the government of China\nto learn more about an outbreak of atypical respiratory disease that\naffected health workers, their families and contacts in Guangdong Province,\nwith 305 cases and 5 deaths reported from 16 Nov 2002 to 7 Feb 2003. 2 days later, on 14 Mar 2003, WHO received a report from the government of\nCanada that health authorities had taken steps to alert hospital workers,\nambulance services, and public health units across the provinces that there\nwere 4 cases of atypical pneumonia within a single family in Toronto that\nhad resulted in 2 deaths. Apart from the dimensions of the SARS outbreak apparent at this date, the\nsections below explain why this disease poses a particularly severe threat\nto international health, outline the chronology of events as SARS spread\naround the world, and discuss lessons based on strengths and weaknesses of\nthe global response for the immediate future. the lack of understanding about the disease, its cause, and future\nevolution, the need was great to introduce a series of emergency measures\nto contain SARS outbreaks in the affected areas and prevent further\ninternational spread, thus reducing opportunities for the new disease to\nestablish endemicity. Though the case could be linked back to the French\nhospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the\nprovincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and\nvisitors may have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of\ncases. On 28 Mar 2003, at the end of the second week of the global response,\nChina, an initially reluctant partner in the global alert and response at\nthe start, became a full partner in the 3 working groups that were studying\nSARS, and concluded that the outbreaks of SARS elsewhere in Asia were\nrelated to the outbreak in Guangdong Province.

In the moderator comment accompanying the\nProMED-mail posting, this moderator said: 'On a provocative note, checking\nthe geography it is noteworthy that Guangdong Province is adjacent to Hong\nKong and Fujian Province is the next northerly province on mainland\nChina. WHO\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n The list of countries and continents reporting suspect or probable SARS\ncases will no doubt continue to grow due to heightened global vigilance,\nknowledge about symptoms and exposures, and awareness of the need for\nimmediate isolation of cases and strict infection control. At the same time the global alert recommended no change in patterns of\ninternational travel, but that passengers notify their health authority if\nthey should develop signs and symptoms as described above and have a\nhistory of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS. The SARS response is the roll-out of a global alert and response activity\nunder the revision of the International Health Regulations, which provide\nthe legal framework for the surveillance and reporting of infectious\ndisease and for the use of measures to prevent their international spread. On 12 Mar 2003, after an assessment of the situation in Asia with WHO teams\nin Hanoi, Hong Kong, and Beijing, a global alert was issued about cases of\nsevere atypical pneumonia with unknown etiology that appeared to place\nhealth workers at high risk. It demonstrates the value of international cooperation on\nemerging infections and the importance of early detection and rapid\nintroduction of emergency measures to prevent further international spread\nand help ensure that imported cases are not allowed to cause disease in others. As a result, many countries having\nonly a single or a few imported cases have experienced no further spread to\nhospital staff, families of patients and hospital visitors, or the\ncommunity at large. In countries, such as Canada, where cases\noccurred before WHO issued its global alert, SARS is continuing to spread\ndespite the introduction of strict patient isolation and excellent\ninfection control. An urgent investigation of the Amoy\nGardens outbreak in Hong Kong began on 29 Mar 2003, and the following day,\nhealth officials announced that 213 Amoy residents were probable cases of\nSARS. With the notable exception of AIDS, most new diseases\nthat emerged during the last 2 decades of the previous century or\nestablished endemicity in new geographical areas have features that limit\ntheir capacity to pose a major threat to international public health. A high awareness of SARS symptoms among travellers and the\nmedical and nursing professions has often resulted in good management of\nimported cases - prompt isolation of patients and management according to\nstrict procedures of infection control. Intense contact tracing and investigation of these clusters increasingly\npoints to contact with a single Chinese man in his 60s who was treated at\nSingapore General Hospital from 5 to 20 Mar 2003 for chronic kidney disease\nand diabetes at Singapore General Hospital. As the maximum incubation\nperiod for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over\nthis period raised hope that Viet Nam's outbreak had been brought under\ncontrol. A third clinical group, which unites 80 clinicians from 13 countries having\nSARS cases, has consistently provided anecdotal information about the lack\nof efficacy of treatment with specific antibiotics and antivirals, and has\nbegun to develop systematic clinical trials of Ribaviran at 2 sites.

One of the\nmost alarming features of SARS in these areas is its rapid spread in\nhospitals, where it has affected a large number of previously healthy\nhealth care workers. Today,\nthe group exchanged information about the Hong Kong investigations to\nidentify a possible environmental source, which might prove useful in\nunderstanding the unusual new cluster of cases in Singapore. Epidemiologists investigating the Amoy\nGardens outbreak are considering the hypothesis that some form of\nenvironmental contamination, perhaps linked to a sewage or ventilation\nsystem, is the source of the large cluster of cases. It also indicates how the system now in operation\ncould apply to other highly significant infectious disease events,\nincluding the next influenza pandemic, the next emerging infection, and the\ndeliberate release of a biological agent in an act of warfare or terrorism. The team concluded that\nthe health system in Guangdong responded well to the outbreak, but that\nhealth systems in all other provinces had less capacity to cope with the\nseverity of the challenge posed by SARS. Key questions\ninclude the exact points during the course of incubation and infection when\ntransmission occurs and whether asymptotic cases are also capable of\nspreading SARS. So long as the\netiological agent remained unknown, specialists in infectious disease\ncontrol would be forced to resort to control tools dating back to the\n'Middle Ages' of microbiology: isolation and quarantine. This creates an extra step in the containment response:\nidentification and characterization of the causative agent, which then\nallows development of a diagnostic test, treatment protocols, and a\nscientifically sound basis for recommending control measures. Severe Acute Pulmonary Syndrome (SARS) was first identified in Viet Nam on\n28 Feb 2003, when Dr Carlo Urbani, an epidemiologist from the Hanoi WHO\noffice, examined a patient with a severe form of pneumonia for which no\netiology could be found. Their\ndiscussions have shed light on features of the disease at presentation,\ntreatment and progression of the disease, prognostic indicators, and\ndischarge criteria. Sound public health measures would\nalso require understanding of the presence and concentration of the\npathogen in different tissues and secretions, and patterns of excretion\nthroughout the course of illness and convalescence. Countries have made travel recommendations for their citizens, using the\nguidance provided by WHO and other considerations such as feasibility of\nmedical evacuation of their citizens and their insurance coverage should\nthey become infected. In a world where all national borders are porous when\nconfronted by a microbial threat, it is in the interest of all populations\nfor countries to share the information they may have as soon as it is\navailable. Publications on these\nvarious findings are being prepared by members of this collaborating group,\nbut the need remains for a highly sensitive and specific PCR test to\ndiagnose acute infections. The best\nscientists from around the world are working on these problems around the\nclock, and in an unprecedented spirit of collaboration against a threat of\nas-yet-unknown dimensions. These arrangements have allowed the\nanalysis of samples from the same patient simultaneously in several\nlaboratories specialized in different approaches, with the results shared\nin real time. It\nwould be interesting to know whether this family had SARS and the H5N1\ninfections were superinfections/co-infections with the coronavirus now felt\nto be responsible for SARS. \n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/en/>\n'Hot zones' of concern\n Most disturbing are new and large clusters of suspected SARS\ncases among health workers, inpatients, and visitors in 2 interlinked wards\nat Singapore General Hospital and in a second hospital, Tan Tok Seng Hospital. WHO thus decided, on 15 Mar 2003, to issue a rare\nemergency travel advisory as a global alert to international travellers,\nhealth care professionals, and health authorities. All cases\nhave occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had close contact\nwith SARS cases in households or health care facilities. At present, reporting to WHO of probable SARS cases is based on an\nassessment of clinical symptoms, history -- including travel history -- of\npossible exposure to an infected person, and distinctive chest X-rays. The number\nof cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 Mar 2003 at 58 cases\nand remained stable for 8 consecutive days. Though much about the disease remains poorly understood,\nincluding the exact identity of the causative virus, we do know that it has\nfeatures that allow it to spread rapidly along international air travel routes. At this moment, public health authorities, physicians and scientists around\nthe world are struggling to cope with a severe and rapidly spreading new\ndisease in humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. This pattern of transmission indicates that the disease\nhas moved out of the health care setting and is now occurring within the\ncommunity as secondary cases. some hope that the new disease, like many other new diseases of the recent\npast, would fail to maintain efficient person-to-person transmission, or\nthat it might attenuate with passage and eventually self-contain. On this date it was decided to recommend new measures related to\ninternational travel, still with the intent of preventing the international\nspread of the infectious agent. The 9 cases of probable SARS that occurred in Singapore,\nBeijing, and Taiwan, and that were associated with travel in Hong Kong,\nindicated that the risk of international spread was continuing. Following this alert,\nawareness increased immediately, and many potential new outbreaks were\nprevented by the prompt isolation and strict management of suspected cases. On 9 Apr 2003, a WHO investigative team, which had conducted interviews and\nstudies in Guangdong Province since 3 Apr 2003, presented its interim\nreport on the SARS outbreak to Chinese authorities. French Hospital were ill with a similar acute respiratory syndrome, and by\n11 Mar 2003 similar outbreaks had been reported among hospital workers in\nHong Kong. Later in the morning of 15 Mar 2003, with this background and chronology of\nevents, a decision was made by WHO to increase the level of the global\nalert issued on 12 Mar 2003. It is clear that the responsibility for containing the\nemergence of any new infectious disease showing international spread lies\non all countries. Second, the\noutbreaks appeared to pose a great risk to health workers who managed\npatients, and to the family members and other close contacts of patients. The mention of the 2 confirmed cases of H5N1 avian influenza in individuals\nthat had travelled to Fujian province that were identified in February 2003\n The concentration of cases in\npreviously healthy hospital staff and the proportion of patients requiring\nintensive care are particularly alarming. One or more of the following:\n- Close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with SARS\n- Recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS. If the SARS virus maintains its present\npathogenicity and transmissibility, SARS could become the first severe new\ndisease of the 21st century with global epidemic potential. A similar collaborative group on epidemiology, made up of investigators\nfrom all sites with local transmission of SARS, continues to confirm\nperson-to-person transmission as the major route of transmission.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever", "ebola haemorrhagic fever", "nipah virus", "rift valley fever", "sars", "smallpox"], "syndromes": ["haemorrhagic fever", "acute respiratory syndrome"], "event_date": ["2003-02-17 00:00:00", "2003-02-07 00:00:00", "2003-03-25 00:00:00", "2003-04-06 00:00:00", "2042-03-25 00:00:00", "2003-03-14 00:00:00", "2003-03-17 00:00:00", "2003-02-28 00:00:00", "2003-04-05 00:00:00", "2003-04-02 00:00:00", "2002-11-16 00:00:00", "2003-02-10 00:00:00", "2003-02-25 00:00:00", "2003-04-10 00:00:00", "2003-04-03 00:00:00", "2003-04-09 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Foshan City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Uganda", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the Netherlands", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "Germany"}, {"location": "North", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Vladivostak", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States of America", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Congo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Frankfurt", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "Hanoi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Geneva", "country": "Switzerland"}, {"location": "Fujian Province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Guangdong province", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Hong \n Kong", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Fujian province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hanta", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Guangdong", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Guangdong Province", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Toronto", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "Kowloon", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taiwan", "country": "Taiwan"}, {"location": "Hong Kong SAR", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Viet Nam 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United Kingdom", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "Japan"}, {"location": "Fujian", "country": "China"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Singapore", "country": "Singapore"}, {"location": "France", "country": "France"}, {"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "Vietnam"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "Hong Kong"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2203607", "headline": "PRO/EDR> SARS - worldwide (37):cases", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2203607", "date": "2003-04-09 23:50:00", "main_text": "SARS - WORLDWIDE (37): CASES\n*******************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Hong Kong - DOH (with links to article and discussion of clinical\nmanagement)\n[2] Singapore - MOH\n[3] USA - CDC\n[4] Canada - Health Canada\n[5] Briefs\n[A] South Africa\n[B] Kazakhstan\n******\n[1]\nDate: 9 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health 9 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 9 Apr 2003\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 3 PM 9 Apr 2003, an additional 42 patients with symptoms of atypical\npneumonia were admitted to public hospitals.

Patients\nwith persistent fever and worsening lung opacities were given intravenous\nribavirin (400 mg every 8 hours) and corticosteroid therapy (an additional\n2 to 3 pulses of 0.5 g of methylprednisolone daily). Patients in whom\nhypoxemia developed were given oxygen through a nasal cannula.

All identified probable cases of SARS have\nbeen linked to either travel-related exposures, or in healthcare and\nhousehold settings (Table 3). The index case in Ontario was an individual\nwho travelled to Hong Kong and stayed at the Metropole Hotel, where a\ncluster of SARS cases was subsequently identified (MMWR Vol 52, No. 12, 28\nMar 2003) . Upon return to Canada, disease transmission occurred in 4\nmembers of the immediate and extended family, and nearly all subsequently\nidentified probable cases in Ontario have been epidemiologically linked to\nexposure to the first hospitalised family member of the index case. Other\nprobable cases reported in Ontario as well as British Columbia have all\nbeen attributed to travel-related exposures. Thus, there is currently no\nevidence to suggest that community transmission is occurring in Canada.\nTable 3: Type of exposure to probable cases of SARS in Canada: 9 Apr 2003\nExposure: Number of probable cases/ proportion\nHospital or healthcare-related setting: 70/ 72.1 percent\nHousehold: 20/ 20.6 percent\nTravel: 7/ 7.2 percent\nTotal number of probable cases with known exposure: 97/ 100 percent\nAs part of the public health measures currently being implemented, the\nOntario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care have identified the following\npotential at-risk exposures(1):\n- The Scarborough Hospital, Grace Division, between 16--26 Mar 2003\n- York Central Hospital in Richmond Hill, between 16--28 Mar 2003\n- The Brookside/Hilltop Retirement Residence in Richmond Hill, between\n26--29 Mar 2003\n- Highland Funeral Home, evening of 3 Apr 2003\n(1) The Centenary site of the Rouge Valley Health System (formerly\nScarborough Centenary Hospital) is no longer being identified as a\npotential at-risk exposure.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[A review of the epidemiologic curve presented as part of this report\nreveals the most recent date of onset of a probable case was 2 Apr 2003,\nrepresenting 7 days since the onset of the last case.

The department has also\nprovided guidelines for infection control and recommendations on actions\nfor public health settings.\n All patients who were formerly in Wards 57 and 58 during the period\nfrom 20 March 2003 till 5 April 2003 and who are currently still in SGH\nwill also be transferred to TTSH. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons\nwho have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household\nor in a health-care setting. As an assurance, visitors who went to Wards 57 and 58 at SGH from 20 Mar\n2003 to 5 Apr 2003 may call SGH hotline at 6321-3591 between 8.00 AM and\n10.00 PM for free health checks to ensure their well-being. In Canada, all cases reported thusfar have\na history of contact with known cases of SARS, or a history of travel to\nareas with identified local transmission of SARS. We do not know\nif all of the newly reported cases can be traced to contact with other\ncases, or if there are indications of further community transmission. The remaining new case is a man who\nhad visited his mother when she was admitted to TTSH from mid January 2003\ntill the end of March 2003. In addition, an update on the number of\nsuspected and probable cases from the USA was not available for today or\nyesterday as of the time of this posting. To ring-fence the source of infection and to ensure continuity of care to\ntheir patients, SGH is transferring all patients from Wards 57 and 58 to\nTTSH. The newswire report from China suggests that there have been an additional\n27 cases in the past 24 hours since the last report to WHO, and in addition,\nthat there may now be identified transmission in Beijing. This is in addition to the 6 staff Health Canada has\ndeployed to assist Toronto's public health unit and the Ontario Ministry of\n Nurses, doctors, therapists and other\nstaff working in these 2 wards will also be transferred to TTSH to care for\ntheir patients. Apr 2003\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia\n Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of\nchronic diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively\nlate stage of infection. At the request of Ontario, Health Canada shipped 10 000 masks to Toronto as\na stop-gap measure until the province receives additional masks from its\nsupplier. Apr 2003\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5940>\n This includes the 20-year-old Ngee\nAnn Polytechnic student and the mother of the SARS patient who was\ntransferred from NUH yesterday.

The other 2 additional cases are a TTSH nurse who was in contact\nwith a SARS patient before the patient was diagnosed to be a SARS case and\na family member of a SARS patient. This family member is the husband of the\nwoman who broke quarantine and was transferred from NUH to TTSH on 5 Apr\n2003. She is in intensive care.\n\nSGH Ward 57 and 58 cluster\nOn 5 Apr 2003, SGH noted that a total of 21 staff from Wards 57 and 58 had\ndeveloped fever since the 1 Apr 2003; one on 1 and 2 Apr 2003, 2 on 3 Apr\n2003, 9 on 4 Apr 2003, and 8 on 5 Apr 2003. SGH sent the affected staff to\nTTSH and, while waiting for the medical assessment of the cases, stood down\nthat surgical team.\n\nOn 6 Apr 2003, as a precautionary measure and in order to ring-fence the\nsource of infection, SGH transferred all patients from Wards 57 and 58 to\nTTSH. All patients who were formerly in Wards 57 and 58 during the period\nfrom 20 Mar 2003 till 5 Apr 2003 and who were still in SGH were also\ntransferred to TTSH. Nurses, doctors, therapists, and other staff working\nin these 2 wards were also transferred to TTSH. The transfer, involving 80\npatients and 91 staff, was completed on 7 Apr 2003. SGH also contacting\ndischarged patients who were formerly in Wards 57 and 58 during the period\nfrom 20 Mar 2003 through 5 Apr 2003, as well as visitors to these wards\nduring this period, to ensure their well-being.\n\nSo far, 52 persons have been linked to the SGH cluster at Wards 57 and 58,\ncomprising 19 probable and 33 suspect SARS cases. They comprise 26 SGH\nstaff, 14 visitors, and 12 inpatients. In addition, 2 SGH staff and 4\ninpatients were admitted for observation. All 19 are stable except for 2\nwho are in serious condition in intensive care.\n\nEpidemiological investigations have traced the source of this cluster of\ninfections to a Chinese man in his 60s who had been admitted to TTSH from 5\nto 20 Mar 2003 for chronic kidney disease and diabetes. He was admitted to\nSGH Ward 57 Intermediate Care Area on 24 Mar 2003 for gastrointestinal\nbleeding. He had a diabetic foot ulcer and was noted to have a low-grade\nfever since admission. A chest X-ray on 24 Mar 2003 was clear. He was\ntreated for his medical conditions and was started on antibiotics.\n\nOn 28 Mar 2003, he developed high fever. A repeat chest X-ray on that day\nwas normal. He was treated with antibiotics and on 29 Mar 2003, he was\ntransferred to Ward 58 B2. Tests showed that he had an infection of the\nblood by _E.coli_. Chest X-ray on 30 Mar 2003 was again normal. He was\ngiven a stronger antibiotic and on 3 Apr 2003, he no longer had fever.\nHowever, his chest x-ray on 4 Apr 2003 showed signs of pneumonia and he has\nbeen diagnosed as a SARS case by the doctors in TTSH.\n\nAlthough the clinical picture of this patient is not typical of SARS, it is\nlikely that the typical symptoms of SARS were masked by his other\nunderlying medical conditions. It is believed that he had come in contact\nwith a SARS patient who had not yet been diagnosed during the time that he\nwas admitted to TTSH.\n\nThe 19 persons with probable SARS in the SGH cluster, comprising 1 doctor,\n9 nurses, 1 radiographer, 1 housekeeper, 4 inpatients and 3 visitors, are\nall linked to Wards 57 and 58. The hospital staff attended to the Chinese\nman when he was in Wards 57 and 58. One visitor was his brother who visited\nhim while he was in SGH.\n\nApart from ring fencing the staff and inpatients from Ward 57 and 58 at\nTTSH, to prevent further spread of infection, SGH has implemented mandatory\ntwice daily temperature checks for all staff, the use of N95 masks by all\ntheir staff, and limiting visitors to 2 per patient. SGH has also\nreorganised their teams of doctors to only work in specified locations.\nThis will help localise patient-doctor interactions to specific physical\nsites and will facilitate future epidemiological investigations, if necessary.\n\nOrange Valley Nursing Home cluster\nIt was reported that a nurse from Orange Valley Nursing Home was admitted\nto CGH on 4 Apr 2003 for pneumonia and transferred to TTSH on 6 Apr 2003\nfor probable SARS. He has been in intensive care since transfer to TTSH.\n\nInvestigations have revealed that a resident of the nursing home was\nadmitted to CGH on 25 Mar 2003 and died of pneumonia on 30 Mar 2003. This\nnursing home resident had been earlier discharged from TTSH on 23 Mar 2003\nfor non-SARS related condition. When the patient was in TTSH she was warded\nnext to a patient who was later diagnosed as a SARS case. The male nurse\nfrom the nursing home had been attending to this resident. The\ndaughter-in-law of this nursing home resident, a mediaCorp staff member,\nwas admitted to TTSH on 7 Apr 2003 for SARS. She is in serious condition in\nintensive care. A friend of hers who was in contact with her when she was\nunwell has also been admitted to TTSH on 8 Apr 2003. She is in stable\ncondition.\n\nThe girlfriend of the nurse from Orange Valley Nursing Home and the teenage\nson of the MediaCorp staff member, who is a student of Zhonghua Secondary\nSchool, have been admitted as suspect SARS cases. Although it is believed\nthat the resident of Orange Valley Nursing Home was the source of\ninfection, investigations are still ongoing to exclude other sources.\n\nTTSH Rehab Dept at Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital\nAt this point, investigations suggest that the source of infection for the\nTTSH occupational therapist might have been the SARS patient who presented\nat the NUH Emergency Department on 23 Mar 2003.\n\nImplications of the SGH cluster of infections\nTo reduce the spread of SARS, Singapore has adopted an isolate-and-contain\nstrategy, involving comprehensive and practical measures, and at times\nstronger than what is being done in other affected countries. One key\nthrust is to identify symptomatic cases as early as possible so that they\ncan receive treatment and are isolated early. As a precautionary measure,\nclose contacts of SARS patients are ring-fenced through home quarantine.\nThough contact tracing is not 100 percent foolproof, it helps to\nsignificantly reduce any further transmission of SARS, especially to the\ncommunity at large.\n\nThe isolate and contain approach is also adapted for schools. When a case\nis discovered in school or institute of higher learning, it will be shut\ndown for 3 days. This will facilitate active contract tracing, and\nepidemiological investigations, while reducing the risk of exposure of\nstudents to SARS.\n\nFor healthcare facilities, Tan Tock Seng Hospital Hospital/Communicable\nDisease Centre (TTSH/CDC) is the only hospital designated to screen and\ntreat both adults and children with or suspected to have SARS. These\npatients are treated in isolation rooms under strict infection control\nprocedures. They are not allowed visitors. SARS is a very new disease, and\nwe are learning that it can present in atypical ways, particularly in\npatients with other types of medical conditions. These medical conditions\nmask the typical features of SARS and make it very difficult for the\ndiagnosis to be made early. This is illustrated by the case in SGH.\n\nIn view of this, MOH has this week further enhanced its infection control\nrequirements in all hospitals. The types of cases that hospitals need to\nidentify early and isolate has been broadened to include all cases of\natypical pneumonia and fever without a known cause, as well as healthcare\nworkers who present with fever and/or respiratory symptoms of undetermined\ncause. All hospitals are required to ensure that the temperatures of all\nits healthcare workers are checked at least twice daily, with the first\ncheck being done before the staff start work.\n\nFebrile staff should not be allowed to work. The number of visitors to\nhospitals is also being limited and their details should be noted, to\nfacilitate contact tracing should the need arise. This is on top of the\nprocedures which MOH has already established with Accident and Emergency\nDepartments in all hospitals, on how to handle patients who are unwell and\nsuspected to have SARS. Staff are required to adopt full infection control\nprecautions and if they come across any such patients, they are instructed\nto transfer them to TTSH for further examination. A system of protected\ntriage staff in SOCs and polyclinics has also been established.\n\nOur isolate-and-contain strategy seems to be holding up. SARS cases are\nreferred to TTSH as soon as they are detected in other hospitals. This will\nhelp contain the spread and chance of outbreak in other hospitals and\nreduce the risk of spread into the community. In SGH, patients in the\naffected wards were transferred to TTSH for treatment. We should expect\nthat from time to time, clusters of infections may occur in our hospitals\nmainly from atypical cases that later turn out to be SARS. The public\nshould be reassured that there is a robust system in place to minimise and\nrespond quickly to such situations.\n\nDisposal of bio-hazardous wastes\nSince 1988, our hospitals have put in place a system to ensure that all\nbio-hazardous medical wastes (including masks, gloves, needles, etc.) are\nsegregated from general waste and safely disposed of. Bio-hazardous wastes\ncan only be collected by specially licensed waste collectors (only 3 of\nthem in Singapore), transported in dedicated vehicles, and brought to\nspecially designed and dedicated incinerators for disposal. Our procedures\nfor handling bio-hazardous medical wastes are in accordance with WHO\nguidelines.\n\nIn Singapore, all wastewater is discharged into a closed sewerage system.\nThe wastewater is conveyed through deep underground pipes to wastewater\ntreatment plants for treatment. At the plants, our workers too do not come\ninto contact with the sewage. As a precaution, our workers are provided\nwith protective gear and gloves etc. when they carry out maintenance work.\nThese underground sewers keep all wastewater out of contact with the public\nthus ensuring public health safety.\n\nHome Quarantine\nFrom today, MOH is engaging the services of CISCO to serve Home Quarantine\nOrders and ensure that contacts of probable SARS cases comply with the\norders. The measure follows a limited number of incidents in which the home\nquarantine order was flouted. In one such incident, the contact who\neventually became a SARS case went down to see her General Practitioner on\n3 Apr 2003 and did not disclose that she was under home quarantine. When\nher condition did not improve, her relative also broke quarantine and\nferried her in his car to NUH instead of using the available ambulance\nservice to TTSH. This irresponsible behaviour presents not just a risk to\nthe public but can also cause other hospitals to become contaminated with SARS.\n\nThe CISCO officers who serve the Order will site an electronic picture\n(EPIC) camera at the home of each contact. The contacts will be called at\nrandom intervals daily and requested to turn on the camera and present\nthemselves in front of the camera to show their presence. Anyone found\nbreaking the quarantine will be served a written warning and given an\nelectronic wrist tag. The tag is linked to a dedicated telephone line and\nwill alert the authorities if the person leaves the house again or tries to\nbreak the tag. Under section 65 of the Infectious Diseases Act, persons\nfound guilty of an offence shall be liable on conviction to a fine not\nexceeding $5000 and in the case of a second or subsequent offence, liable\nto a fine not exceeding $10 000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding\n6 months or to both.\n\nToday, 53 passengers from affected areas required further screening by the\nnurses at the airport. None were referred to TTSH for further assessment.\n\nSummary of SARS cases\nTo date, the total number of people diagnosed with SARS is 133. Among these\nare 3 children below 18 years of age. Out of the 47 patients still\nhospitalised, 13 are in intensive care. The Ngee Ann Polytechnic student\nwas discharged from intensive care yesterday. There were no new admissions\nto intensive care.\n\nThe number of suspect cases admitted is 82, including 5 children (below 18\nyears old). The number of people under Home Quarantine Orders is 490.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: 10 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: European Union [edited]\n\n[A] Cumulative Report of SARS Cases as of 7 Apr 2003\n<http://europa.eu.int/comm/health/ph_threats/com/sars/sars_stats_en.htm>\n\n\n[a] EU Member states\nSource: EU Communicable Diseases Network\n\nCountry: Probable cases ( * )/ Suspect cases ( * )/ Deaths\n[countries reporting no cases have been eliminated from this table - Mod.MPP]\n\nBelgium: 0/ 2/ 0\nFinland: 0/ 4/ 0\nFrance: 3/ 0/ 0\nGermany: 5/ 18/ 0\nIreland: 1/ 1/ 0\nItaly: 3/ 0/ 0\nPortugal: 0/ 1/ 0\nSpain: 1/ 0/ 0\nSweden: 0/ 3/ 0\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 5/ n/a/ 0\n\nTotal: 18/ 29/ 0\n\n[b] Accession and Other European Countries\nSource: EU Communicable Diseases Network\n\n[Countries with reports of no cases are not listed in this\ntable.

Other\nprobable cases reported in Ontario as well as British Columbia have all\nbeen attributed to travel-related exposures. Most of the case fatalities occurred in patients with\nunderlying illness, and nearly all were elderly patients over the age of 70\nyears. SGH sent the affected staff to\nTTSH and, while waiting for the medical assessment of the cases, stood down\nthat surgical team. 25 individuals have been discharged\n(25.5 percent) and of the 63 individuals currently hospitalised, 39 (65\npercent) are improving or in stable condition. The plea follows the detection of a confirmed case of\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) involving a 48-year-old man who\nhad taken these flights during the period. One key\nthrust is to identify symptomatic cases as early as possible so that they\ncan receive treatment and are isolated early. SARS is a very new disease, and\nwe are learning that it can present in atypical ways, particularly in\npatients with other types of medical conditions. Staff are required to adopt full infection control\nprecautions and if they come across any such patients, they are instructed\nto transfer them to TTSH for further examination. Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of chronic\ndiseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late stage\nof infection. All hospitals are required to ensure that the temperatures of all\nits healthcare workers are checked at least twice daily, with the first\ncheck being done before the staff start work. Since 1988, our hospitals have put in place a system to ensure that all\nbio-hazardous medical wastes (including masks, gloves, needles, etc.) are\nsegregated from general waste and safely disposed of. Probable Cases/ Proportion\nHospital or healthcare-related setting: 72/ 73.5 percent\n The number of visitors to\nhospitals is also being limited and their details should be noted, to\nfacilitate contact tracing should the need arise. Though contact tracing is not 100 percent foolproof, it helps to\nsignificantly reduce any further transmission of SARS, especially to the\ncommunity at large. It is believed that he had come in contact\nwith a SARS patient who had not yet been diagnosed during the time that he\nwas admitted to TTSH. In one such incident, the contact who\neventually became a SARS case went down to see her General Practitioner on\n3 Although the clinical picture of this patient is not typical of SARS, it is\nlikely that the typical symptoms of SARS were masked by his other\nunderlying medical conditions.

DH is\ntracing the crew members and passengers who had taken these 7 flights for\nsurveillance purpose. When a case\nis discovered in school or institute of higher learning, it will be shut\ndown for 3 days. By now there has been extensive\ndissemination of information, yet ill individuals are still travelling in\nan attempt to get home for medical care. This will\nhelp contain the spread and chance of outbreak in other hospitals and\nreduce the risk of spread into the community. Although it is believed\nthat the resident of Orange Valley Nursing Home was the source of\ninfection, investigations are still ongoing to exclude other sources. For healthcare facilities, Tan Tock Seng Hospital Hospital/Communicable\nDisease Centre (TTSH/CDC) is the only hospital designated to screen and\ntreat both adults and children with or suspected to have SARS. The spokesman reminded people who have respiratory\nsymptoms including fever, chills, malaise and cough to avoid traveling by\nplane before recovery. To reduce the spread of SARS, Singapore has adopted an isolate-and-contain\nstrategy, involving comprehensive and practical measures, and at times\nstronger than what is being done in other affected countries. - Critical/Deteriorating: (9)/ (14.3 percent)\n- Unknown: (12)/ (19.0 percent)\n They include 12 healthcare\nworkers (9 from Princess Margaret Hospital, one from Prince of Wales\n Prior to this new cluster,\nit did appear that transmission had been limited and might be interrupted\nfairly soon. The contacts will be called at\nrandom intervals daily and requested to turn on the camera and present\nthemselves in front of the camera to show their presence. This will facilitate active contract tracing, and\nepidemiological investigations, while reducing the risk of exposure of\nstudents to SARS. These medical conditions\nmask the typical features of SARS and make it very difficult for the\ndiagnosis to be made early. The Department of Health of Hong Kong is to be commended for\nthe in-depth investigation of potential contacts and the alerting of\nairlines of potential problems. Our procedures\nfor handling bio-hazardous medical wastes are in accordance with WHO\nguidelines. The tag is linked to a dedicated telephone line and\nwill alert the authorities if the person leaves the house again or tries to\nbreak the tag. Anyone found\nbreaking the quarantine will be served a written warning and given an\nelectronic wrist tag.

We investigated the viral cause and clinical\npresentation among 50 patients.\nMethods: We analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50\npatients with SARS, representing more than 5 separate epidemiologically\nlinked transmission clusters. We defined the clinical presentation and risk\nfactors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents\nby chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and\nsera samples. We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for\nmicrobiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose\nidentity was masked.\nResults: Patients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia,\nand cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest\nradiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were\ndisproportionately mild. Patients who were household contacts of other\ninfected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were\nassociated with severe disease. A virus belonging to the family\n_Coronaviridae_ was isolated from 2 patients. By use of serological and\nreverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with\nSARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.\nInterpretation: A coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that\nmight be the primary agent associated with this disease. Serological and\nmolecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory\ndiagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether\nother cofactors play a part in disease progression.\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 8 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: The Lancet, Sat 5 Apr 2003,Volume 361, Number 9364; published\nonline Tue 8 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.thelancet.com/journal/journal.isa>\n\nCommentary: Novel Coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\n--------------------------------------------------\n'The terror of the unknown is seldom better displayed than by the response\nof a population to the appearance of an epidemic, particularly when the\nepidemic strikes without apparent cause.' This quote from 1977 by Edward\nKass (1), describing the fears surrounding the newly recognised\nlegionnaires' disease, aptly describes the public response to the recent\nappearance of an unexplained atypical pneumonia referred to as severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS).\nJoseph Peiris and colleagues provide strong evidence that SARS is\nassociated with a novel coronavirus that has not been previously identified\nin human beings or animals, and begin the process of eliminating the many\nunknowns from this new syndrome. The investigators used classic viral\nculture and serological techniques, as well as modern molecular genetic\nmethods, to characterise and to determine the cause of the disease in 50\npatients with SARS in Hong Kong. One of the strengths of their report, and\nan important means of establishing causality, is their analysis of\nspecimens from control patients. None of 40 respiratory secretions from\npatients with other respiratory diseases contained coronavirus RNA, and\nnone of 200 serum samples from blood donors had serum antibody to this new\ncoronavirus. These findings significantly strengthen the tentative\naetiological association reported by other investigators from the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) in Atlanta and from Toronto, who\nhave also isolated a novel coronavirus from patients with SARS (2,3). As\nother pathogens, such as _Human metapneumovirus_ and _Chlamydia spp_, are\nidentified in SARS patients, it will be important to use control groups to\ndetermine the role of these other agents in causality or as cofactors for\nsevere disease (2,4).\nThe clinical features associated with SARS are rapidly becoming available\nthrough Peiris\u0092 and other reports (2,5). The Hong Kong investigators\nidentified 5 clusters of patients by using a modified WHO case definition\nfor SARS, and describe the clinical manifestations of this serious disease.\nIt is notable that nearly 40 percent of the patients developed respiratory\nfailure that required assisted ventilation. Clinical descriptions will be\nimportant in modifying the case definition of this syndrome should it\nspread -- as is likely -- beyond the tightly linked clusters that have\ncharacterised the epidemiology of SARS thus far. Unfortunately, the early\nclinical appearance may not allow ready distinction from other common\nwinter-time respiratory viral infections (6,7). However, certain\ncharacteristics of SARS are noteworthy. The constellation of absence of\nupper respiratory symptoms, the presence of dry cough, and minimal\nauscultatory findings with consolidation on chest radiographs may alert the\nclinician to the possible diagnosis of SARS. The presence of lymphopenia,\nleucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes and creatinine\nkinase may also raise suspicion.\nClinical diagnosis will become particularly problematic once the\nassociation with travel or case contact is lost. Thus, rapid and accurate\ndiagnostic tools will be critical in the management of this epidemic. Given\nthe experience with other respiratory viruses, it is likely that culture\nand direct antigen-detection from respiratory secretions will not suffice\nin view of the lethality and contagious nature of this new agent. Rapid\ndiagnosis of SARS, which is important for infection-control measures and\npotential treatment,will require very sensitive and specific methods. Real\ntime RT-PCR, currently in use for other respiratory viruses primarily in\nresearch settings, may be required as a routine test in clinical diagnostic\nmicrobiological laboratories (8,9).\nPeiris and colleagues suggest that early therapy with intravenous ribavirin\nand high-dose glucocorticosteroids may be beneficial. However, the lack of\nuntreated control patients precludes a firm conclusion about benefit.\nClinicians often find it difficult to withhold potentially beneficial, yet\nunproven, therapy in life-threatening situations. Controlled studies may be\ndifficult to do, and there are obviously no historical controls for the\ntreatment of SARS. Therefore it will be important for treating physicians\nto carefully document the dose, timing, and types of therapies used, and\nthe clinical and viral status of patients, so that experiences can be\npooled and information productively analysed.\nIt is truly remarkable and unprecedented that the progress reported by\nPeiris and colleagues, and elsewhere, on the aetiology and clinical and\nepidemiological characteristics of SARS has been achieved in less than 2\nmonths. It is fortuitous that this outbreak occurred at a time when viral\nsurveillance systems headed by WHO in collaboration with CDCP are in place\nthroughout the world. The work of individual laboratories, such as the ones\nin Hong Kong, Toronto, and CDCP, and cooperation between health authorities\nin many countries provides protection from the inevitable threat of new\nepidemic diseases.\nReferences:\n1.

Tests are still being developed and improved,\nbut using them now helps to understand how SARS and human coronavirus are\nconnected.\nStatus of currently available diagnostic tests\nAntibody tests:\n(1) ELISA (IGM/IGA) detects antibodies in the serum of SARS patients\nreliably as from about day 20 after onset of clinical signs. Antibodies\nalready are detected in some patients between 14-21 days;\n(2) Immunofluorescence Assays (detecting Immunoglobulin M) in SARS\nvirus-infected VERO cells detects antibodies in serum after about day 10 of\nonset of disease. This is a reliable but demanding test requiring amongst\nothers, use of live virus in cell culture and an immunofluorescence microscope.\nMolecular tests:\n(1) PCR can detect genetic material of coronavirus in various specimens\n(blood, stool, or respiratory secretions). For this test, several primers\nhave been developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nUnited States of America, Federal Laboratories for Health Canada, Hong Kong\nUniversity, and the Governmental Viral Unit of Hong Kong, and they have\nbeen shared on the WHO web site. Some laboratories in the WHO multi-centre\ncollaborative network on SARS are currently comparing these tests and first\nresults are will be forthcoming shortly.\nCell culture: Virus in specimens (respiratory secretions, blood) from SARS\npatients can also be detected by infecting cell cultures such as VERO cells.\nInterpretation of positive test results: Indicate that SARS patients are,\nor recently were, infected with the coronavirus. A negative coronavirus\ntest does not mean that the patient does not have SARS.\nInterpretation of negative test results: SARS is diagnosed not on the basis\nof laboratory tests but on clinical evaluation and possible past exposures.\nReasons for negative test results in a patient with SARS may be: (1) Tests\nare incorrect ('false-negative'). Current tests need to be further\ndeveloped to improve sensitivity. (2) Patient is not infected with the new\ncoronavirus. The cause of infection could be another pathogen (virus,\nbacteria, etc.) causing respiratory symptoms, and pneumonia.(3) Specimens\nwere not collected at a time when virus or its genetic material was\nexcreted.

The World Health Organization\n(WHO) has hypothesised that the causative virus(es) may be of animal\norigin, from domestic or wild animals located in Guangdong Province (in\nSouth China).\nThis is why the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has contacted\nthe Chinese Veterinary Authorities to obtain information on the animal\nhealth situation in China over the past 6 months and, in particular, in\nGuangdong Province.\nThe OIE has also approached its Reference Laboratories and Experts\nspecialising in Paramyxovirus and Coronavirus diseases.\nAs soon as it is available, the OIE, in close collaboration with the WHO,\nwill communicate the scientific information needed to confirm or invalidate\nthe animal origin of SARS and to evaluate, if necessary, the risks incurred\nby the international community.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[We look forward to hearing the results of the OIE investigation. - Mod.MPP]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 4 Apr 2003\nFrom: Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>\n\nSARS - Deja vu ?\n----------------\nAs SARS enters its fifth month, a number of questions remain unanswered.\nWhy Asia? Why now? Why young adults? To these I would add a fourth question\n(Why the panic?) and an hypothesis.\nEvery 10 years or so, a pandemic spreads out from China and surrounding\ncountries. The 'Asian flu' of 1957 claimed 98 000 lives worldwide, and the\n'Hong Kong flu' of 1968 an additional 45 000 lives. Although the world\ncommunity was rightly concerned, I do not recall a collapse of air travel,\nimposition of quarantine, or daily front-page headlines. To date, SARS has\nclaimed 79 lives, and the etiological agent appears to be far less\ncontagious than Influenza A virus.\nCurrent evidence suggests that new strains of Influenza A virus evolve as\nrecombinants when they pass between swine and ducks, a process favored by\nclose species proximity on Asian farms. Thus, I was surprised to learn in a\nrecent ProMed-mail posting that coronaviruses also exist in poultry and\nswine, as well as cattle, cats, dogs, and rodents (see: Coronavirus,\nChicken, New - Brazil 20030403.0816). I do not know whether coronaviruses\nare capable of recombination in the manner of influenza viruses, but such a\nmechanism would partially explain the origin of SARS.\n3 years ago, a 'new' human infection was described in the Netherlands. It\nsoon became evident that Human metapneumovirus [HMP] was neither new nor\nexotic, and seems to have affected most humans in every country\ninvestigated, going back decades. The clinical features of this infection\nmimic those of Human respiratory syncytial virus, and infant deaths are not\nuncommon. Indeed, it may well be that more people die of HMP than from SARS\neach year. These facts only became evident when serological tests were\ndeveloped. I suspect that use of serological and other tests for SARS\ndeveloped over the next few weeks will reveal: (1) a high degree of\nsero-positivity in the 'healthy' community of Asia, if not other countries;\nand (2) the existence of an animal (Porcine? Avian?) reservoir.\nDuring the H1N1 pandemic of 1977, there were suggestions that elderly\npersons had a lower rate of complications than would be expected. It was\ntheorized that persons who had survived the prior H1N1 pandemic of 1918 had\nretained partial immunity into old age. If, as noted above, background\nimmunity exists from a SARS outbreak several decades ago, relatively low\ndisease rates among the elderly during the current epidemic would not be\nsurprising. The fact that few children are affected is also not surprising,\nwhen we recall that viral diseases (measles, varicella, poliomyelitis,\nmumps) are often more overt and severe among adults.\n--\nSteve Berger\nTel Aviv Medical Center, Israel\n<mberger@post.tau.ac.il>\n[Steve Berger has posed some interesting questions and made some relevant\ncomments. My response is limited to consideration of the genetic\ncharacteristics of coronaviruses. High frequency recombination is a\ncharacteristic property of coronaviruses, and is probably restricted to\nclosely related coronaviruses. An example is Feline infectious peritonitis\nvirus, a coronavirus that exists as 2 serotypes and causes peritonitis,\npneumonia, meningoencephalitis, and other immunopathologic complications in\ncats. Serotype 2 of feline infectious peritonitis virus appears to be a\nrecombinant virus incorporating genetic information from a canine\ncoronavirus, which causes diarrhea in dogs. The serotype 2 virus, in\naddition to causing peritonitis, etc., in cats can -- unlike serotype 1 --\ninfect pups (but does not cause acute disease).\nThat said, it is not necessary to hypothesize origin of the putative\nSARS-associated coronavirus by recombination with an animal or avian\ncoronavirus. There are many coronaviruses in the natural environment that\ncould become pathogenic in humans as a result of progressive mutation, or\nperhaps have existed undetected.\nThe origin of pandemic influenza A viruses by 'recombination' is an\nentirely different process and can occur between dissimilar viruses. The\ngenome of influenza viruses exists as a complement of sub-units which can\nbe interchanged when genetically distinct viruses replicate in a common (or\nintermediate) host, generating progeny with non-parental combinations of\ngenes (and potentially expressing novel combinations of antigens and\ncausing an explosive pandemic). Consequently there could be abundant\nopportunity for exchange of sub-units between human and avian viruses where\nhumans, domesticated mammals, and birds live in close proximity. This is a\ngross oversimplification, of course, but the origin of pandemic strains of\ninfluenza A virus in east Asia in the past should not be used as an\nargument favouring the origin of the SARS agent by recombination between a\nhuman virus and an animal virus.\nAt this stage we simply do not know. Nor is it certain that the coronavirus\n(and/or the human metapneumovirus) present in SARS patients is the\npathogenic agent. As Steve Berger points out, coronaviruses and\npneumoviruses are ubiquitous in the human population. Caution is required\nin advancing hypotheses at this stage until more data become available. -\nMod.CP]\n*****\n[3]\nDate: 5 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC press briefing 4 Apr 2003 [excerpted and edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030404.htm>\n\nUpdate on the ongoing laboratory investigation:\n--------------------------------------\nCDC is part of an international collaborating network of laboratories led\nby WHO. There are 12 laboratories and 10 companies participating in this\nnetwork.\nEvidence for a previously unrecognized Coronavirus has been found now in\nat least 10 laboratories, including the laboratories here at CDC. The\npreponderance of the evidence continues to mount and continues to favor an\netiologic role or this previously unrecognized Coronavirus in the cause of\nSARS.\nSo far, in looking at specimens from the suspect cases in the United\nStates, we now have evidence of infection with this agent in a total of 4\npeople, and we are working with the state health departments in the states\nwhere these people reside, so that they are provided with the information\nand they, in turn, will provide the clinicians and the patients with the\ninformation.\nWe have cultured this Coronavirus from a total of 4 patients. We have\nelectron microscopic evidence from 2 patients of this virus. We have PCR\n(Polymerase Chain Reaction) results -- , the amplification technique --\nwhere we find evidence of Coronaviral nucleic acid in 11 patients.\nLooking at the antibody tests, of which we have 2 --an IFA\n[immunofluorescent antibody] test and Allose test -- there is evidence for\ninfection in a total of 5 patients. And from the standpoint of\nhistopathology, looking through the microscope at tissue from deceased\npatients, we have seen evidence of an entity that the pathologist call\ndiffuse alveolar damage, which is the pathologic correlate for the clinical\nsyndrome of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, which has appeared in\npatients with severe forms of SARS.\nWe have seen that evidence in a total of 4 specimens. Don't try to add those\nnumbers up and get a grand total because some patients, in some cases, have\nmore than one positive result.\n[In response to a question on whether there were samples that tested\nnegative for coronavirus]:\nThere are negative results. I don't have numbers. For example though, when\nyou think about antibody tests, what you really need, [in order] to be able\nto interpret those and to say that something's negative, is 2 serum\nspecimens collected 2 or 3 weeks apart. So any negative that we have now for\nthe most part represents a single serum that's negative. So we're not in the\nposition to say that evaluation is complete. Part of our effort now, working\nwith the states, is to get paired serum specimens from patients so they can\nbe tested.\n[In response to a question re: the information that some of the earlier\ncases had eaten wild game]:\n[Dr. Hughes had not heard the reports about the wild game consumption.] But,\nwe don't know the source, the original source\nof this previously unrecognized virus. There are a number of Coronaviruses\nthat do infect animals, though. So it may well be that there is an animal\norigin for this, and it's the sequencing of the full virus that will tell us\nthis. So I'm interested actually to follow up and see what sort of wild game\nthis is and what the evidence might be.\n[In response to the question if they have run the tests on controls] :\nIn terms of PCR, yes, we have negative controls that we run, both for the\nPCR and for the serologic tests that we have done, and it looks like these\ntests are performing quite well, but it is early in their use.\nThere are several diagnostic tests that look promising. There is the ELISA\ntest for antibody, there's the Indirect Fluorescent Antibody -- or IFA --\ntest, again, for antibody, and then there's a PCR assay [for viruse] that\nlook like they have\npotential to be useful.\nWe will be collecting and testing as many specimens as we can acquire from\nsuspect cases, from health care workers exposed to them, from household\ncontacts, and from healthy controls over time to further validate them.\nWe are going to be trying very soon to transfer some of these tests to\nstate public health laboratories through the Laboratory Response Network so\nwe can get the diagnostics, such as they are at the moment, closer to where\nthe illnesses are occurring. So that's a high priority\n[In response to the question on reports ot the isolation of Chlamydia]:\nThe outbreak in Guangdong Province initially was reported based on some lab\nevidence that I don't know the details of, to be caused by _Chlamydia and\n[sic] pneumoniae_. My impression is that they had relatively few positive\nresults for that. We certainly put _Chlamydia and [sic] pneumoniae_ on our\nlong list of differential diagnostic possibilities when we first heard about\nthe situation in Vietnam, Hong Kong and Canada. We, in our laboratories,\nlooked for evidence of _Chlamydia and [sic] pneumoniae_ infection in suspect\ncases, and so far have not found it.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The new information provided in this briefing from CDC is consistent with\nthe hypothesis that a novel (or perhaps previously unrecognized) human\ncoronavirus is the etiologic agent of SARS, either alone or in combination\nwith another agent still to be identified. The supporting evidence is far\nfrom conclusive, however.

This will allow the entire genome of the virus to be\nsequenced and its phylogenetic position in the family _Coronaviridae_ to be\nestablished. It will be possible then to deduce whether this virus is a new\nhuman pathogen derived by recombination with an animal coronavirus, or\nwhether it has evolved by progressive mutation from either of the 2 known\nhuman coronaviruses, which are associated with upper respiratory tract\ninfections, or from one of the known animal coronaviruses.

And from the standpoint of\nhistopathology, looking through the microscope at tissue from deceased\npatients, we have seen evidence of an entity that the pathologist call\ndiffuse alveolar damage, which is the pathologic correlate for the clinical\nsyndrome of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, which has appeared in\npatients with severe forms of SARS. The\ngenome of influenza viruses exists as a complement of sub-units which can\nbe interchanged when genetically distinct viruses replicate in a common (or\nintermediate) host, generating progeny with non-parental combinations of\ngenes (and potentially expressing novel combinations of antigens and\ncausing an explosive pandemic). A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n It will be possible then to deduce whether this virus is a new\nhuman pathogen derived by recombination with an animal coronavirus, or\nwhether it has evolved by progressive mutation from either of the 2 known\nhuman coronaviruses, which are associated with upper respiratory tract\ninfections, or from one of the known animal coronaviruses. It\nshould be a priority to extend these diagnostic procedures to a matched\nseries of non-SARS patients to exclude the possibility that this novel\nhuman coronavirus is no more than a ubiquitous resident in the human\nrespiratory tract. There is the ELISA\ntest for antibody, there's the Indirect Fluorescent Antibody -- or IFA --\ntest, again, for antibody, and then there's a PCR assay [for viruse] that\nlook like they have\npotential to be useful. As soon as it is available, the OIE, in close collaboration with the WHO,\nwill communicate the scientific information needed to confirm or invalidate\nthe animal origin of SARS and to evaluate, if necessary, the risks incurred\nby the international community.\n [The new information provided in this briefing from CDC is consistent with\nthe hypothesis that a novel (or perhaps previously unrecognized) human\ncoronavirus is the etiologic agent of SARS, either alone or in combination\nwith another agent still to be identified. An example is Feline infectious peritonitis\nvirus, a coronavirus that exists as 2 serotypes and causes peritonitis,\npneumonia, meningoencephalitis, and other immunopathologic complications in\ncats. For example though, when\nyou think about antibody tests, what you really need, [in order] to be able\nto interpret those and to say that something's negative, is 2 serum\nspecimens collected 2 or 3 weeks apart. I suspect that use of serological and other tests for SARS\ndeveloped over the next few weeks will reveal: (1) a high degree of\nsero-positivity in the 'healthy' community of Asia, if not other countries;\nand (2) the existence of an animal (Porcine? We, in our laboratories,\nlooked for evidence of _Chlamydia and [sic] pneumoniae_ infection in suspect\ncases, and so far have not found it.\n [In response to the question on reports ot the isolation of Chlamydia]:\nThe outbreak in Guangdong Province initially was reported based on some lab\nevidence that I don't know the details of, to be caused by _Chlamydia and\n[sic] pneumoniae_. This is why the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has contacted\nthe Chinese Veterinary Authorities to obtain information on the animal\nhealth situation in China over the past 6 months and, in particular, in\nGuangdong Province. Thus, I was surprised to learn in a\nrecent ProMed-mail posting that coronaviruses also exist in poultry and\nswine, as well as cattle, cats, dogs, and rodents (see: Coronavirus,\n The\npreponderance of the evidence continues to mount and continues to favor an\netiologic role or this previously unrecognized Coronavirus in the cause of\nSARS. Don't try to add those\nnumbers up and get a grand total because some patients, in some cases, have\nmore than one positive result.\n It\nsoon became evident that Human metapneumovirus [HMP] was neither new nor\nexotic, and seems to have affected most humans in every country\ninvestigated, going back decades. The World Health Organization\n(WHO) has hypothesised that the causative virus(es) may be of animal\norigin, from domestic or wild animals located in Guangdong Province (in\nSouth China). Part of our effort now, working\nwith the states, is to get paired serum specimens from patients so they can\nbe tested.\n If, as noted above, background\nimmunity exists from a SARS outbreak several decades ago, relatively low\ndisease rates among the elderly during the current epidemic would not be\nsurprising. A virus in east Asia in the past should not be used as an\nargument favouring the origin of the SARS agent by recombination between a\nhuman virus and an animal virus. Serotype 2 of feline infectious peritonitis virus appears to be a\nrecombinant virus incorporating genetic information from a canine\ncoronavirus, which causes diarrhea in dogs. The serotype 2 virus, in\naddition to causing peritonitis, etc., in cats can -- unlike serotype 1 --\ninfect pups (but does not cause acute disease). Several respiratory viruses, such\nas the common cold-associated coronaviruses and human respiratory syncytial\nvirus, are distributed world-wide and affect individuals of all ages. Current evidence suggests that new strains of Influenza A virus evolve as\nrecombinants when they pass between swine and ducks, a process favored by\nclose species proximity on Asian farms. the moment the single fact that best identifies this virus as the etiologic\nagent of SARS is its apparent low nucleotide sequence homology with other\ncoronaviruses. That said, it is not necessary to hypothesize origin of the putative\nSARS-associated coronavirus by recombination with an animal or avian\ncoronavirus. The RT-PCR amplification of coronavirus sequences produced 11 positive\nresults and was the most sensitive diagnostic procedure employed, but even\nwith this technique an unspecified number of negative results was obtained. The clinical features of this infection\nmimic those of Human respiratory syncytial virus, and infant deaths are not\nuncommon. Nor is it certain that the coronavirus\n(and/or the human metapneumovirus) present in SARS patients is the\npathogenic agent. To date, SARS has\nclaimed 79 lives, and the etiological agent appears to be far less\ncontagious than Influenza A virus. I do not know whether coronaviruses\nare capable of recombination in the manner of influenza viruses, but such a\nmechanism would partially explain the origin of SARS. In terms of PCR, yes, we have negative controls that we run, both for the\nPCR and for the serologic tests that we have done, and it looks like these\ntests are performing quite well, but it is early in their use. It is curious\nthat a virus, which has such devastating pathological potential in some\npeople, is present in these specimens in such low abundance. A human epidemic of atypical pneumonia called severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome (SARS) is currently raging across the globe and particularly in\nSouth-East Asia. Consequently there could be abundant\nopportunity for exchange of sub-units between human and avian viruses where\nhumans, domesticated mammals, and birds live in close proximity. If at the CDC only specimens from suspected cases\nin the United States have been examined so far, an undetermined proportion\nof whom may not be SARS patients, this would be a limitation. We are going to be trying very soon to transfer some of these tests to\nstate public health laboratories through the Laboratory Response Network so\n We will be collecting and testing as many specimens as we can acquire from\nsuspect cases, from health care workers exposed to them, from household\ncontacts, and from healthy controls over time to further validate them. So it may well be that there is an animal\norigin for this, and it's the sequencing of the full virus that will tell us\nthis. High frequency recombination is a\ncharacteristic property of coronaviruses, and is probably restricted to\nclosely related coronaviruses. But,\nwe don't know the source, the original source\nof this previously unrecognized virus.

The 4-person team, headed by John MacKenzie of Australia,\nhas been in Guangdong since Thursday 3 Apr 2003. The team was charged to\nassess the local situation and to support the strengthening of\nsurveillance, clinical management, infection control, and laboratory\nevaluation of SARS cases.\nThe team has visited Foshan City, where the earliest case is thought to\nhave occurred in mid-November 2002, and Guangzhou City, the provincial\ncapital. In a wide-ranging collaborative investigation, the team has met\nwith authorities, health and veterinary professionals, and technical\nexperts in the provincial Centers for Disease Control laboratories and the\nvirology laboratories of Zongshan Medical University. The team has\nconferred with staff at all levels and been granted full access to all\nsites, institutes, and hospitals requested.\nThe team will be reporting on the provincial surveillance system, measures\nfor community infection control, patient management, and hospital infection\ncontrol. It will also give a detailed review of microbiological findings.\nThe SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province is presently the largest and oldest\nknown outbreak of SARS and may hold important clues about both the origins\nor the virus and measures for clinical management. In one of its earliest\nreports about cases of atypical pneumonia to WHO, the Chinese Ministry of\nHealth reported 305 cases and 5 deaths, from mid-November 2002 to 9 Feb\n2003, in 6 municipalities: Foshan, Guangzhou, Heyuan, Jiangmen, Shenzhen,\nand Zhongshan.\nGuangzhou was the home of a 64-year-old professor of nephrology at\nZhongshan University, who is thought to be the index case who sparked the\noutbreak in Hong Kong. During late February 2003, he stayed in room 911 on\nthe ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel. Guests staying on the hotel\u0092s ninth\nfloor sparked outbreaks in other countries when they returned to their\nhomes in Toronto and Singapore. A 48-year-old American businessman, who\nalso stayed on the 9th floor, is believed to have originated the outbreaks\nin Hanoi and in Hong Kong\u0092s Princess Margaret [Hospital], where he was\ntransferred. One local Hong Kong resident, who visited an acquaintance on\nthe ninth floor, subsequently sparked an outbreak in a second Hong Kong\nhospital.\nElsewhere in China, Shanghai, which has reported its first SARS case, has\nrequested a visit from the WHO team to discuss SARS and be advised on how\nbest to deal with the disease.\nIn Beijing, the death on Sunday of a 53-year-old staff member of the\nInternational Labour Organization continued to cause considerable anxiety,\nparticularly at embassies and among staff of international organizations.\nEpidemiologists at the WHO Office in Beijing have conducted contact tracing\nand other investigations to determine the source of the staff member\u0092s\nexposure and to assess whether close contacts may have been exposed. To\ndate, no SARS cases or suspicious symptoms related to this death have been\nobserved. The investigations are continuing.\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, 2671 SARS cases with 103 deaths have been reported from 17\ncountries. This represents an increase of 70 cases and 5 deaths when\ncompared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in Canada (1), Hong\nKong SAR (2), and Singapore (2).

The full paper\nis accessible via the above URL. It confirms previous statements from\nCanadian sources that a human metapneumovirus had been isolated from a SARS\npatient and further appears to indicate the presence of both a novel\ncoronavirus and a human metapneumovirus in 4 of 5 virus-positive SARS\npatients. - Mod.CP]\nViral molecular testing has been completed on all respiratory and blood\nspecimens received from 9 of the 10 patients, yielding mostly negative\nresults. Specifically, DNA was extracted and PCR was completed for targets\nspecific to various DNA viruses, yielding negative results for\nadenoviruses, parvoviruses, circoviruses, herpesviruses, & orthopoxviruses.\nIn addition, RNA was extracted and reverse-transcriptase\u00ad PCR (RT-PCR) was\ncompleted for targets specific to various RNA viruses, including influenza\nvirus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus subtypes 1,\n2, 3, and 4, human metapneumovirus, filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg\nviruses), arenaviruses, measles virus, mumps virus, hantaviruses, and\nCrimean\u00ad-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, yielding negative results.\nFurther studies were completed on all respiratory specimens received from 9\nof the 10 patients. These included viral cultures (including inoculation\nonto cell culture and into embryonated hen eggs and intracerebral\ninoculation of suckling mice), immune electron microscopy of nasopharyngeal\nswabs and bronchoalveolar fluids with serum obtained during the\nconvalescent phase from Patient 10, RT-PCR for conserved portions of the\npolymerase gene of RNA viruses, and genus-specific degenerative primers for\nparamyxoviruses and bunyaviruses with use of nested RT-PCR. Results for all\nof these tests have been negative, with 2 exceptions.\nHuman metapneumovirus was amplified by nested PCR from bronchoalveolar\nlavage fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs from 5 of 9 patients with SARS and\nfrom a nasopharyngeal swab from an asymptomatic contact of one of the\npatients in Toronto (Patient 3) with use of the following primers:\n5'CTTTGGACTTAATGACAGATG3' and 5'GTCTTCCTGTGCTAACTTTG3'.\nFor confirmation of these positive findings, the amplicons were sequenced\nand found to be unique, ruling out the possibility of cross-contamination in\nthe laboratory.\nIn addition, a novel coronavirus was isolated from Vero cell cultures\ninoculated with respiratory specimens from 5 of 9 patients with SARS. 4 of\nthese patients had specimens from which metapneumovirus was also\nidentified. A cytopathic effect on the Vero cell cultures was noted on day\n6 of incubation. On the basis of collaboration with investigators in Hong\nKong and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who\nreported isolating a novel coronavirus from patients with SARS in other\nareas of the world, RT-PCR and nested PCR were completed targeting\nconserved regions of the coronavirus polymerase gene using the following\nprimer pairs: 5'CAGAGCCATGCCTAACATG3' and 5'AATGTTTACGCAGGTAAGCG3'; and\n5'TGTTAAACCAGGTGGAAC3' and 5'CCTGTGTTGTAGATTGCG3'. A novel coronavirus\nidentical to that reported by the CDC was amplified from all 5 cultures.\nAt a different laboratory, a coronavirus was also identified independently\nby amplification directly from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid from 2 of 4\npatients tested. Both of these patients had coronavirus isolated from cell\nculture and amplification as described above. Reverse transcription was\ncompleted using the primer 5'GCATAGGCAGTAGTTGCATC3', followed by PCR\ntargeting a highly conserved region of the coronavirus polymerase gene with\nuse of the paired primers 5'TGATGGGATGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA3' and\n5'TTGCATCACCACTAGTTGTGCCACCAGGTT3'.\nOne of the amplicons was sequenced, and although the nucleotide sequence was\ndifferent from that of any known coronaviruses, the deduced amino acid\nsequence had a high degree of homology (78 percent) to the polymerase amino\nacid sequence of several coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that\nthis is a novel virus that is not closely related to any of the known\nclusters of coronaviruses (groups 1, 2 & 3).\nFurther studies are currently being completed to determine whether the human\nmetapneumovirus and a novel coronavirus, either alone or in combination, are\nthe cause of SARS or whether other thus-far-undetected pathogens are\npossibly responsible.

Pending development of\nconfirmatory laboratory testing capacity, CDC's interim suspected SARS case\ndefinition (2) is based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to\nother SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS. This case\ndefinition will be updated periodically as new information becomes\navailable. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.\nAs of 2 Apr 2003, a total of 2223 suspected and/or probable SARS cases\nhave been reported to WHO from 16 countries, including the United States\n(3,4). The reported SARS cases include 78 deaths (case-fatality proportion:\n3.5 percent). This report summarizes SARS cases among U.S. residents and\nsurveillance and prevention activities in the United States.\nDescriptive Epidemiology\n----------------------\nAs of April 2, CDC had received 100 reports of suspected SARS cases [see\nFigure 1 on webpage for epidemiologic curve\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a1.htm>] from 28 states; 81\n(81 percent) cases occurred among adults [see table 1 below]. Of these 100\nsuspected cases, 94 (94%) persons had traveled within the 10 days before\nillness onset to the areas listed in the case definition (revised on 29 Mar\n2003 to include all of mainland China as an area with documented or\nsuspected community transmission), 4 had household contact with a person\nwith suspected SARS, and 2 were health-care workers (HCWs) who provided\nmedical care to a patient with suspected SARS.\nManifestations of SARS have been relatively less severe among patients in\nthe United States than among those reported elsewhere. A majority of U.S.\npatients had normal chest radiographs, and 23 (23 percent) were reported to\nhave pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest radiograph, thereby\nmeeting the WHO case definition of a probable case (4). As of 2 Apr 2003, of\nthe 40 (40 percent) patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24\nhours, 13 (33 percent of 40) remained hospitalized; one patient had required\nmechanical ventilatory support, and no deaths have been reported.\nReports on the clinical status of suspected SARS cases are being received\nby state health departments and CDC, and household and HCW contacts are\nbeing monitored for the possibility of secondary transmission. Since SARS\ninvestigations in the United States began, some persons believed initially\nto have suspected SARS have been excluded on the basis of more complete\nclinical histories (e.g., no documented fever or respiratory symptoms) or\nbecause of testing results that indicated other etiologies. Alternative\ndiagnoses have included infection with influenza virus, respiratory\nsyncytial virus, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and\n_Staphylococcus aureus_. Community transmission of SARS has not been\nidentified in the United States; transmission to HCWs has been observed in\none cluster involving 2 HCWs, compared with numerous reports of possible\ntransmission to HCWs in other countries (5--7).\nEnhanced Surveillance for SARS Related to Travel\n---------------------------------------------\nAs a precautionary measure, WHO has recommended that persons traveling to\nHong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing all but\nessential travel. CDC has issued a travel advisory recommending that\npersons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China, Hong\nKong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until further\nnotice.\nTo detect possible SARS cases among travelers returning to the United States\nfrom these areas, CDC and state and local health authorities have\nimplemented enhanced surveillance. Since 16 Mar 2003, notices (available in\nEnglish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) have been provided to\napproximately 220 000 passengers arriving in the United States on airline\nflights originating from China, Vietnam, and Singapore to inform\ndisembarking passengers and crew about SARS. Persons disembarking from these\ncountries are urged to monitor their health for 10 days after return, to\nseek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.5 F (39.0 C) and\ncough or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel, and to inform their\nhealth-care providers about recent travel to regions where SARS cases have\nbeen reported.\nLaboratory Investigations\n----------------------\nEfforts are ongoing to characterize further the role of a previously\nunrecognized coronavirus in SARS. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays,\nisolation studies, electron microscopic studies, and histologic studies are\nbeing developed to detect virus in specimens from patients with suspected\nSARS. Indirect immunoflorescence antibody assays and enzyme immunoassays to\nanti-coronavirus antibody as an indicator of infection have been developed\nand are being applied to specimens from suspected SARS patients. Laboratory\nstudies at CDC and other laboratories in the WHO-organized SARS Laboratory\nNetwork have detected this new coronavirus in SARS patients, which is\nconsistent with an etiologic role in this disease. CDC has detected human\nmetapneumovirus from one SARS patient, and other laboratories also have\ndetected metapneumovirus from SARS patients (6). The role of these viruses\nin the pathogenesis of SARS is unclear.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nThe number of SARS cases, and the number of countries reporting such cases,\ncontinues to increase worldwide. Transmission within hospitals and\nhouseholds continues in some areas, and transmission within communities\n(e.g., Hong Kong) continues to be reported. In the absence of a complete\nunderstanding of how SARS is transmitted, efforts to limit transmission in\nthe United States have focused on early identification of potential cases\nthrough surveillance and implementation of infection-control measures in\nhealth-care settings and the community.\nCDC has developed interim infection-control guidelines for use in U.S.\nhealth-care and household settings (8). These recommendations are based on\nexperience in the United States to date and will be revised as more\ninformation becomes available. Infection-control practitioners and\nclinicians providing medical care for patients with suspected SARS should\nconsult these guidelines frequently to keep current with recommendations.\nTransmission in health-care settings has been documented in several\ncountries. Transmission to HCWs appears to have occurred primarily after\nclose contact with symptomatic persons before recommended infection-control\nprecautions for SARS were implemented. Because a primary strategy to reduce\ntransmission in health-care settings is early recognition and isolation of\npatients who might have SARS, triage practices in hospitals and\nambulatory-care settings might require reevaluation. CDC guidelines for\ntriage of potential SARS cases are available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/triage_interim_guidance.htm>.\nIn the United States, decisions to admit persons with suspected SARS to\nhealth-care facilities should be based on clinical criteria. Patients with\nsuspected SARS who are discharged should limit interactions outside the\nhome and not go to work, school, out-of-home child care, or other public\nareas until 10 days after resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms.\nAdditional guidance for these patients is available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ic-closecontacts.htm>.\nThe majority of U.S. residents with SARS have recovered or stabilized\nclinically without specific antiviral therapy. The U.S. case-fatality\nproportion is lower than that reported in some other countries (3).\nPossible explanations for this include differing case definitions among\ncountries or differences in the sensitivity of surveillance, leading to\nidentification in the United States of patients with less severe or early\nmanifestations of infection or of a larger proportion of patients with\nother respiratory illnesses. Until confirmatory laboratory testing is\navailable, the case definition will include clinical criteria more likely\nto identify potentially infectious persons. Various therapies, including\nantiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir or ribavirin) and corticosteroids, have\nbeen administered to SARS patients, but the efficacy of these therapies has\nnot been determined.\nHealth-care providers of patients whose illness is consistent with the case\ndefinition for SARS should continue diagnostic evaluation for other causes\nof respiratory illness and, when appropriate, empiric therapy that includes\nactivity against organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia of\nuncertain etiology, including both typical and atypical respiratory\npathogens (9). Health-care providers who report suspected SARS cases should\nnotify their state health departments if these patients receive\nconfirmatory testing that indicates a diagnosis other than SARS.\nInformation on suggested diagnostic testing and evaluation for persons with\npossible SARS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/diagnosis.htm.\nAirline travel\n----------\nThe potential for transmission of SARS during airline travel is unknown.\nTransmission of other infectious agents (e.g., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_)\nduring air travel has been demonstrated (10). When an airline flight crew\nreports a passenger with respiratory illness, quarantine officials might\nboard the aircraft on arrival in the United States to assess whether the\npassenger's symptoms match the case definition of SARS and give the\npassenger information about following up. If a passenger with suspected\nSARS is identified after passengers have disembarked, public health\nauthorities will work with the airline to contact passengers and crew for\ninformation about the development of an illness suggestive of SARS.\nAlthough ill travelers have spread SARS rapidly across international\nborders, the proportion, if any, of persons who acquired SARS during\ninternational travel as a result of in-flight transmission is unknown.\nDespite vigorous efforts to identify and isolate suspected cases, reducing\ntransmission of the etiologic agents of SARS might be difficult.\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens such as those that\ncause SARS is challenging; approximately 40-60 percent of persons with\npneumonia do not have a defined etiology, even when extensive testing for\nknown respiratory pathogens is attempted (9). Minimizing transmission will\nrequire sustained attention to infection-control interventions within\nhealth-care settings and the community. The development of laboratory\ntesting techniques to identify infected persons rapidly will be an\nimportant step toward understanding and reducing transmission of SARS.\nReferences\n--------\n1.

This is an increase of\n4 to 5-fold in the global totals in the last 7 days\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_03_25/en/> with the greatest\nproportionate and absolute increases being in China (Hong Kong & Guangdong\nProvince), and to a much lesser extent in Canada. There has been little\nabsolute rise in other country totals.\n18 countries have now reported cases but in most of these no transmission\nseems to have occurred. Local transmission has occurred in Hanoi (Vietnam),\nSingapore, Toronto (Canada), Taiwan, and the following parts of China:\nGuangdong Province;\nBeijing; Shanxi; and Hong Kong SAR. In the United Kingdom 3 probable SARS\ncases have been reported; all have now recovered. Indeed, the only areas\nwhere WHO feels there is evidence consistent with current transmission are\nHong Kong and Guangdong\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>, and the WHO has issued\nadvice to international travellers not to travel to or through either area.\nGuangdong and Hong Kong\n--------------------------\nInformation about the outbreaks in Guangdong is limited, but the latest\nreports give a significant increase of over 350 cases during March 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>. Detailed\ndescriptions from Hong Kong are now available. Following transmission\ncentering on a large hotel, there have been intense hospital outbreaks\ninvolving staff, patient and families of staff (1) where community\ntransmission has been established. There is now evidence of community\ntransmission within a large housing complex.\nMeasures introduced by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada to control the\nlocal spread of SARS have included school closures (Hong Kong and\nSingapore), the quarantine of entire residential buildings (Hong Kong), and\nthe restriction of non-essential access to hospitals -- all 3,\n<http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/sars_6.html>.\nAlthough such precautions are not yet necessary in Europe, the experience\nin Canada is a sobering reminder of what could happen in any country\nreceiving a case.\nOntario, Canada\n---------------\nThe outbreak in Canada began with a Toronto woman who developed respiratory\nsymptoms 2 days after returning from Hong Kong. She died at home 10 days\nlater, but meanwhile appears to have transmitted infection to 4 members of\nher family. One of them, her adult son, was admitted to a local hospital\nwith respiratory symptoms. He spent some time in an open part of the\nemergency department before being transferred to the intensive care unit,\nwhere he remained until his death, 6 days after admission. It is now\napparent that transmission of SARS has occurred within the hospital. A\npatient who was in the next bed in the emergency department developed\nsymptoms of SARS 3 days after his visit to the emergency department, and\ndied 11 days later. A large number of hospital staff who worked in the\nemergency department and the intensive care unit where the son of the index\ncase was cared for have now presented with symptoms of SARS. Transmission\nin the intensive care unit may have been from the patient or from visiting\nfamily members, some of whom were symptomatic at the time they visited (2).\nThe Province of Ontario declared a health emergency on 26 Mar 2003, and on\n1 Apr 2003 a sixth death from SARS was reported from Toronto. As of 1 Apr\n2003, Ontario has reported 51 probable cases of SARS. The hospital has now\nbeen closed to new admissions.\nThe experience in Canada illustrates that highly developed countries can be\nvulnerable to transmission from imported cases of SARS, especially in\nhospitals (3,4). Most of the data have been consistent with transmission\nthrough large droplets or body fluids. Aerosol transmission cannot be\ntotally discounted, but if it occurs it is uncommon. If the causative\norganism had been readily transmissible by aerosol, many more cases would\nhave been expected, especially in the countries where transmission has\nslowed or never started. In Hong Kong there are some patterns of infection\nthat are most easily explained by environmental transmission such as\nfomites.\nIf the infection is not recognised early and appropriate infection control\nprecautions put in place, extensive transmission can occur. Those most at\nrisk seem to be family members and healthcare workers who have close\ncontact with symptomatic cases. It is worth noting that there have been no\nreported secondary cases from 2 hospitalised Canadian SARS cases where\nfamily members were not permitted to visit and healthcare workers adhered\nto strict infection control precautions.\nClinicians, accident and emergency, intensive treatment units, and\ninfectious disease staff in Europe should be alert to the possibility of\nSARS in people with fever and respiratory symptoms, IF they have recently\nreturned from areas where transmission of SARS is ongoing (currently Hong\nKong, and probably Guangdong) or who have had contact with a case of SARS\n<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/management_guidance.htm>. When\npatients suspected of having SARS are admitted to hospital, it is vital\nthat infection control precautions are rapidly implemented and rigorously\nenforced <http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/hospital_guidance.htm>.\nUpdates on the developing situation are also available from WHO\n(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/>) , on ProMED\n(<http://www.promedmail.org>), and at the websites of various national\npublic health organisations, including CDC\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/>), Health Canada\n(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/index.html>), and the Health\nProtection Agency in the United Kingdom\n(<http://www.phls.org.uk/topics_az/SARS/menu.htm>)(5-7).\nEurosurveillance Weekly welcomes comments on other useful information\nsources, please send\nto elizabeth.hoile@hpa.org.uk.\nReferences:\n1.

When an airline flight crew\nreports a passenger with respiratory illness, quarantine officials might\nboard the aircraft on arrival in the United States to assess whether the\npassenger's symptoms match the case definition of SARS and give the\npassenger information about following up. Since SARS\ninvestigations in the United States began, some persons believed initially\nto have suspected SARS have been excluded on the basis of more complete\nclinical histories (e.g., no documented fever or respiratory symptoms) or\nbecause of testing results that indicated other etiologies. Since 16 Mar 2003, notices (available in\nEnglish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) have been provided to\napproximately 220 000 passengers arriving in the United States on airline\nflights originating from China, Vietnam, and Singapore to inform\ndisembarking passengers and crew about SARS. This is an increase of\n4 to 5-fold in the global totals in the last 7 days\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_03_25/en/> with the greatest\nproportionate and absolute increases being in China (Hong Kong & Guangdong\nProvince), and to a much lesser extent in Canada. As of 2 Apr 2003, 2223 cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and\n78 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), a case\nfatality rate of 3.5 percent\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_04_02/en/>. Pending development of\nconfirmatory laboratory testing capacity, CDC's interim suspected SARS case\ndefinition (2) is based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to\nother SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS. As of April 2, CDC had received 100 reports of suspected SARS cases [see\nFigure 1 on webpage for epidemiologic curve\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a1.htm>] from 28 states; 81\n(81 percent) cases occurred among adults [see table 1 below]. It is worth noting that there have been no\nreported secondary cases from 2 hospitalised Canadian SARS cases where\nfamily members were not permitted to visit and healthcare workers adhered\nto strict infection control precautions. A majority of U.S.\npatients had normal chest radiographs, and 23 (23 percent) were reported to\nhave pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest radiograph, thereby\nmeeting the WHO case definition of a probable case (4). Community transmission of SARS has not been\nidentified in the United States; transmission to HCWs has been observed in\none cluster involving 2 HCWs, compared with numerous reports of possible\ntransmission to HCWs in other countries (5--7). The MMWR\narticle is interesting as it presents information on suspected as well as\nprobable cases, suggesting that the suspected cases, milder forms without\npneumonia may well be part of the clinical spectrum of SARS.

As of 2 Apr 2003, of\nthe 40 (40 percent) patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24\nhours, 13 (33 percent of 40) remained hospitalized; one patient had required\nmechanical ventilatory support, and no deaths have been reported. Following transmission\ncentering on a large hotel, there have been intense hospital outbreaks\ninvolving staff, patient and families of staff (1) where community\ntransmission has been established. Understanding the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens such as those that\ncause SARS is challenging; approximately 40-60 percent of persons with\npneumonia do not have a defined etiology, even when extensive testing for\nknown respiratory pathogens is attempted (9). \nCDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) are continuing to investigate\nthe multicountry outbreak of unexplained atypical pneumonia referred to as\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1). If a passenger with suspected\nSARS is identified after passengers have disembarked, public health\nauthorities will work with the airline to contact passengers and crew for\ninformation about the development of an illness suggestive of SARS.

Once\navailable, a definitive etiologic agent with laboratory testing for\nconfirmation will help define the true spectrum of clinical disease. CDC has detected human\nmetapneumovirus from one SARS patient, and other laboratories also have\ndetected metapneumovirus from SARS patients (6). Although such precautions are not yet necessary in Europe, the experience\nin Canada is a sobering reminder of what could happen in any country\nreceiving a case. As a precautionary measure, WHO has recommended that persons traveling to\nHong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing all but\nessential travel. These recommendations are based on\nexperience in the United States to date and will be revised as more\ninformation becomes available.

On 3 Apr 2003, a total of 17 new\ncases, including 2 deaths, were reported. 2 previously reported cases were\nexcluded. 11 new cases and one death occurred in Guangdong Province. One\ncase was reported from Shanghai, 4 from Beijing, and one case (fatal) from\nSichuan Province.\nOn 4 Apr 2003, 12 new cases, with no deaths, were reported, 11 from\nGuangdong and 1 from Shanxi. For 5 and 6 Apr 2003, 21 new cases and 2 new\ndeaths were reported. The breakdown by province is awaiting translation\nfrom Chinese. This brings the total number of reported cases in China to\n1268, with 53 deaths.\nChinese officials have announced that SARS is being made a high priority\nfor the government. A system of alert and response for early detection and\nreporting of all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being put in\nplace. The government has also begun holding daily press conferences. WHO\nwelcomes this move, which is an important way to increase awareness of the\npopulation and health care staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need\nto seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according\nto the principles of isolation and strict infection control.\nThe WHO office in China has reported considerable anxiety among the\ninternational community following the death in Beijing on Sunday of a\n53-year-old Finnish staff member of the International Labor Organization.\nThe ILO staff members was in Beijing to attend an international conference.\nAt present it is unclear how the staff member contracted SARS. He had\ntravelled to Beijing via Thailand, where no local transmission has been\nreported.\nHong Kong\nHong Kong SAR continues to report the largest number of new cases, placing\nsome hospitals under considerable strain. Today\u0092s report from the\nDepartment of Health indicates that the unusual outbreak among residents in\nthe Amoy Gardens estate, which has caused 268 cases, is coming to an end.\nInvestigation of environmental samples continues at a rapid pace with\nsupport from several government departments. Evidence that the causative\nagent is excreted in faeces has focused attention on the possibility of an\noral-faecal route of transmission, though no conclusions have been reached.\nGood data from the investigations are expected by the end of the week. The\ninvestigations have found no evidence of airborne spread.\nSingapore\nThe Singapore Ministry of Health has reported an unusual cluster of 29\nsuspected SARS cases in hospital staff from 2 wards of a single hospital.\nOf these 4 are probable SARS cases. The onset of the clustering is believed\nto be 29 Mar 2003. Officials investigating the cause of the outbreak are\nconsidering a possible point source in the environment, as it would be\nunusual for so many cases to begin on the same day if caused by contact\nwith a patient\nViet Nam\nThe outbreak in Viet Nam began at a French hospital in Hanoi, where the\nindex case, a 48-year-old Chinese-American businessman who worked for an\nimport-export company in Hong Kong, was admitted on 26 Feb 2003. The number\nof cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 Mar 2003 at 58 cases\nand remained stable for 10 consecutive days. As the maximum incubation\nperiod for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over\nthis period raised hope that Viet Nam\u0092s outbreak had been brought under\ncontrol. However, on 3 Apr 2003 a probable SARS case was detected in a\nprovincial hospital. Though the case could be linked back to the French\nhospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the\nprovincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and\nvisitors could have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of\ncases. An additional 3 probable cases have been reported over the past 2 days.\nCanada\nHealth Canada has received reports of 217 probable or suspect cases of\nSARS. There have been 9 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred\nin persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. The largest outbreak has occurred in\nOntario, where 87 probable and 92 suspect cases have been reported. British\nColumbia is reporting 3 probable and 23 suspect cases, New Brunswick is\nreporting 2 suspect cases, Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case,\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases, and Prince Edward Island is reporting\n4 suspect cases.\nThese reports account for the 90 probable cases included in the WHO\ncumulative table of cases and deaths for today.\nStatus of diagnostic tests\nThe development of a diagnostic test, which is being pursued around the\nclock by the WHO collaborating network of 11 laboratories, has proved more\nproblematic than hoped. 3 diagnostic tests are now available and all have\nlimitations as tools for bringing the SARS outbreak quickly under control.\nThe ELISA detects antibodies reliably but only from about day 20 after the\nonset of clinical symptoms. It therefore cannot be used to detect cases at\nan early stage before they have a chance to spread the infection to others.\nThe second test, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), detects antibodies\nreliably as of day 10 of infection, but is a demanding and comparatively\nslow test that requires the growth of virus in cell culture. The presently\navailable PCR molecular test for detection of SARS virus genetic material\nis useful in the early stages of infection but produces many\nfalse-negatives, meaning that many persons who actually carry the virus may\nnot be detected, creating a dangerous sense of false security for a virus\nthat is known to spread easily in close person-to-person contact.\nUpdate on cases and countries\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2601 cases of SARS, with 98 deaths, have\nbeen reported from 17 countries. This represents an increase of 85 cases\nand 9 deaths compared with the last update of 5 Apr 2003. The deaths\noccurred in Canada (2), China (4), and Hong Kong SAR (3).\nThe single case reported in Belgium has been removed from the list.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Our thanks to Marianne Hopp <mjh12@yahoo.com> for her continued coverage\nof WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n******\n[2]\nDate: 7 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 7 Apr 2003\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 3 PM 7 Apr 2003, an additional 41 patients with symptoms of atypical\npneumonia were admitted to public hospitals.

All are nurses; 1 from\nTTSH, 2 from SGH, 2 from CGH, 1 from a private nursing home and 1\nradiographer from SGH.\nNurse from TTSH\nA nurse from TTSH who had come into contact with a SARS patient before the\npatient was diagnosed with SARS was admitted on 28 Mar 2003 as a suspected\nSARS patient. She has since been upgraded to a probable SARS.\nNurses from CGH\n2 nurses from CGH have been admitted to TTSH on 5 and 6 Apr 2003 as\nprobable SARS cases. One had close contact with a patient before she was\ndiagnosed with SARS and transferred to TTSH 21 Mar 2003. This SARS patient\nwas infected when she visited her sister in TTSH. At that time, a SARS\npatient who had yet been diagnosed was in warded next to her sister at\nTTSH. CGH had put the whole ward staff on voluntary quarantine and were\nfollowed up closely. On 2 Apr [2003], the nurse who had attended to the\nSARS patient was admitted to a single room at CGH as the clinical picture\nthen was suggestive of dengue fever. She was later diagnosed as a probable\nSARS when her third chest x-ray showed changes. Her colleague who attended\nto her when she admitted has now been diagnosed with SARS.\nPrivate nursing home\nA nurse from a private nursing home was admitted to CGH on 4 Apr 2003 for\npneumonia and transferred to TTSH on 6 Apr 2003 for probable SARS. He is\nnow in serious condition in intensive care.\nHis girlfriend, who is also a nurse at the same nursing home, was admitted\nto TTSH on 7 Apr 2003 as a suspected SARS. Her condition is stable.\nInvestigations have revealed that a resident of the nursing home was\nadmitted to CGH on 25 Mar 2003 and died of pneumonia on 30 Mar 2003. This\nnursing home resident had been earlier discharged from TTSH on 23 Mar 2003\nfor non-SARS related condition. When the patient was in TTSH she was warded\nnext to a patient who was later diagnosed as a SARS case. The male nurse\nfrom the nursing home had been attending to this resident.\nUpdate on cluster of SGH staff\nArising from the transfer of staff and patients of SGH Wards 57 and 58, a\ntotal of 29 have been admitted to the SARS wards. Of these, there are 4\nprobable SARS cases (a doctor and 2 nurses), 18 suspected SARS cases and 7\nadmitted for observation. They are all stable.\nThere were a total of 346 patients who were discharged from Wards 57 & 58\nduring the period 20 Mar 2003 - 5 Apr 2003. So far, 284 have been contacted\nabout their well being. All of them including their immediate family\nmembers and friends who visited them when they were in SGH are well.\nAs an assurance, visitors who went to Wards 57 and 58 at SGH from 20 Mar\n2003 to 5 Apr 2003 may call SGH hotline at 6321-3591 between 8.00 AM and\n10.00 PM for free health checks to ensure their well-being. Investigations\nare on-going to determine the source of infection for these hospital staff.\n2 SARS patients in intensive care passed away today. One is the mother of\nthe first index case and the other a TTSH doctor who had attended to a SARS\npatient before she had been diagnosed with SARS. This patient has since\npassed away on 29 Mar 2003.\nToday, 7 passengers from affected areas required further screening by the\nnurses at the airport. None were referred to TTSH for further assessment.\nNo passenger vessels that had a travel history to SARS affected areas in\nthe last 10 days arrived today.\nThe Ministry would like to reiterate that we have taken steps to safeguard\nour public transport system. There is thus no need for commuters to avoid\ntaxis, buses or the MRT in fear of contracting SARS.\nSpecial arrangements have been made for 4 categories of persons with a\nhigher likelihood of getting SARS:\n(a) Persons with Home Quarantine Order who would have come into direct\ncontact with a SARS patient\n(b) Cases identified by General Practitioners and private dentists\n(c) Incoming passengers from affected countries who received a Health Alert\nNotice; and\n(d) Cases identified during medical screening at Changi Airport and\nSingapore Cruise Centre\nPeople belonging to any of the above categories who develop SARS symptoms\nshould call the hotline number that they have been given. Upon receiving\nsuch calls, MOH will arrange for a private ambulance to pick them up and\nsend them to TTSH directly for medical assessment. These people should not\ntake public transport or call relatives for transport arrangements.\nSummary: to date, the total number of people diagnosed with SARS is 113.\nAmong these are 3 children below 18 years of age. Out of the 31 patients\nstill hospitalised, 12 are in intensive care. Since yesterday, there were 2\ndeaths and 1 new admission to intensive care who is the nurse from the\nprivate nursing home.\nApart from the first imported case, the 6 other imported cases have not\ngiven rise to any SARS cases.\nThe number of suspect cases admitted is 73, including 3 children (below 18\nyears old). The number of people under Home Quarantine Orders is 133.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 7 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Taiwan - Department of Health [accessed 7 Apr 2003 10:30 AM EST;\nedited]\n<http://203.65.72.83/En/dpc/ShowPublication.ASP?RecNo=844>\n\nThe majority SARS are imported, no community spread\nAs of 6 Apr 2003, with 3 new imported cases and one new probable case\ninfected by close contact with a Hong Kong case, a cumulative total of 19\nprobable cases have been identified in Taiwan. 5 of them have been\ndischarged, and the other 14 are still hospitalized.\nThe SARS outbreak in Taiwan is mainly sporadic and imported, with only 4\ncases resulting from close contact (limited to primary transmission.)

On Monday, Chinese state\ntelevision reported that there were also one SARS death each in the\nprovinces of Shanxi in the north, Sichuan in the west, and Hunan in central\nChina, the first fatalities in those areas, and an indication the disease\nwas more widespread geographically than previously acknowledged.\n[B] Vietnam - from an AFP newswire report\nThe 5 new cases, confirmed at Hanoi's Bach Mai hospital over the weekend\ninclude a doctor who treated a 67-year-old man hospitalised last Wednesday\nin serious condition and 4 members of his family. All the new patients come\nfrom Ninh Binh province, 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Hanoi. The\n67-year-old, whose son had undergone surgery in the SARS-hit French\nhospital in Hanoi, apparently constitutes a new source of the\ndisease. Another man who came into close contact with him in Ninh Binh was\nalso hospitalized, on Thursday, bringing the province's suspected cases to\n7. Local health workers in Ninh Binh province have quarantined about 50\npeople who had contact with the initial patient.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[According to the WHO statistics presented in [1][A], as of today, there is\na cumulative total of 2601 cases of SARS, with 98 deaths, reported from 17\ncountries.

The Ngee Ann student was diagnosed to be a SARS case today, and is\ncurrently in intensive care.\nOn 29 Mar 2003, he called up his project teammate to inform him that he was\nnot attending class as he was unwell. He then walked to the Bukit Batok\nPolyclinic. At the Polyclinic, he was immediately triaged according to\nstandard procedure. As he was having fever, he was separated from the rest\nof the patients. The doctor and staff who attended to him in the isolation\nroom were masked, gowned, and gloved. He was seen by the polyclinic doctor\nat about 9.20 AM. During the consultation with the doctor, he told the\ndoctor that his mother was in intensive care at the National University\nHospital.\nHe was then transferred to the Accident and Emergency Department of Tan\nTock Seng Hospital (TTSH) by ambulance at about 10.20 AM. During the\nconsultation with the doctor, he told the doctor that his mother had\ntravelled to Sarawak and that she was in NUH. There was no indication at\nthat time that his mother had visited a friend in TTSH. In view that there\nwas no contact history for SARS, he was discharged with advice to return if\nhe continued to feel unwell. He was also put on daily telephone\nsurveillance by TTSH. On 30 Mar 2003, TTSH called him at home. Since he was\nstill unwell, an ambulance was sent to bring him from his home to the A&E\nDept of TTSH at about 17.30 PM. He was then admitted to TTSH.\nSo far, 25 close contacts have been identified and Home Quarantine Orders\nhave been issued.\nSafeguarding Public Transport\n-----------------------\nTo minimise public exposure to SARS, MOH has made special arrangements for\n4 categories of persons with a higher likelihood of being SARS patients to\nbe transported to TTSH by private ambulance, so that they would not need to\nuse the public transport system. The 4 categories are :\n(a) Persons on Home Quarantine Order who develop SARS symptoms;\n(b) Cases identified by General Practitioners and private dentists;\n(c) Incoming Passengers who receive Travel Advisory and develop SARS\nsymptoms subsequently; and\n(d) Cases identified during medical screening at Changi Airport and\nSingapore Cruise Centre.\nOn notification of above cases, MOH will arrange for a private ambulance to\npick them up and send them to TTSH directly for medical assessment.\nSummary of SARS cases\n---------------------\nBoth new cases are linked to the first index case. To date, 93 cases have\narisen from the first index case, comprising 47 family members, friends or\nclose contacts, and 46 hospital staff. Among these are 3 children below 18\nyears of age.\nSo far, apart from the first imported case, the 6 other imported cases have\nnot given rise to any SARS cases.\nThe number of suspect cases admitted is 38, including 2 children (below 18\nyears old).\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 4 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Eurosurveillance Weekly 4 Apr 2003 Volume 7 Issue 14 [edited]\n<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2003/030403.asp>\n\nSARS: the situation in France - 3 Apr 2003\n---------------------------------\nSince an epidemic alert was released in France on 13 Mar 2003 (1), 216\npeople with symptoms of respiratory infection returning from Vietnam,\nChina, Hong Kong, or Singapore were notified to the national Public Health\nInstitute (Institut de veille sanitaire, InVS) (2).

The agent causing SARS is under intensive international\nstudy, but as of today it has not been fully characterized, and there is no\nvaccine or other prophylaxis available.\nSince WHO issued the global alert on 12 Mar 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_03_12/en/> national authorities\nhave implemented heightened surveillance for cases of SARS, and where such\ncases have been identified their prompt isolation has prevented further\nspread of the disease in virtually all countries. For instance the outbreak\nin Hanoi has passed its peak and no new cases have been identified for the\nlast week.

These\nrecommendations still apply -- see WHO recommends new measures to prevent\ntravel-related spread of SARS at:\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_03_27/en/>\nThe SARS situation in Hong Kong SAR has developed features of concern: a\ncontinuing and significant increase in cases with indications that SARS has\nspread beyond the initial focus in hospitals. These developments have\nsuggested environmental routes of transmission from a SARS infected person\nwhich may be related to contamination of common systems that link rooms or\nflats together. Despite the implementation of strict measures to control\nthe outbreak, there have continued to be a small number of visitors to Hong\nKong who have been identified as SARS cases after their return from Hong\nKong. The epidemic in Guangdong Province of China, situated adjacent to\nHong Kong, is the largest outbreak of SARS reported and has also shown\nevidence of spread in the wider community.\n***As a measure of precaution WHO is now recommending that persons\ntravelling to Hong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing\nall but essential travel.

'These are very\npositive steps taken today by China,' said Dr David Heymann, Executive\nDirector of Communicable Diseases at WHO. 'As a result we'll be able to\ngather even more evidence about the nature of the SARS outbreak in China.'\n***In addition, WHO began recommending that persons travelling to Hong Kong\nSAR and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential\ntravel. This updated travel advice comes as a result of new developments,\nparticularly in Hong Kong, in the multi-country outbreak of Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndrome (SARS). This temporary recommendation will be\nreassessed daily as the epidemic evolves. The recommendation does not apply\nto passengers simply transiting through airports in Hong Kong Special\nAdministrative Region or Guangdong Province, China.***[asterisks added by\nProMED - Mod.JW].\nThe new travel advisory is intended to limit the spread of SARS by reducing\ntravel to high risk areas. All other elements of Severe Acute Respiratory\nSyndrome (SARS) WHO previous travel guidance still stand.\nThe SARS situation in Hong Kong SAR, China has developed unique features.\nThere is a continuing and significant increase in cases* with indications\nthat SARS has spread beyond the initial focus in hospitals. These\ndevelopments raise questions related to other possible routes of\ntransmission of SARS. These may involve transport of the virus from one\nperson to another via some type of environmental means. To date, no\nsatisfactory explanation has been found regarding this possibility. Also,\nsince 19 Mar 2003, 9 travellers have been identified as SARS cases on\nreturning from a visit to Hong Kong SAR of China.\nMany questions about the state of the outbreak in Guangdong Province, China\nwhich borders Hong Kong have yet to be answered. The Guangdong outbreak is\nthe largest reported and has also shown evidence of spread in the wider\ncommunity. New information provided today by provincial authorities of more\nthan 300 new cases in March [2003] alone indicates the outbreak there\ncontinues.\nUnprecedented global cooperation helps advance knowledge and containment of\nSARS\n--------------\nIn the 4 weeks that WHO has been tracking SARS much has been learned. This\nis largely because scientists, clinicians, laboratory chiefs and public\nhealth officials everywhere have collaborated closely.\nAs a result of WHO's global alert issued on 15 Mar 2003, national\nauthorities have implemented heightened surveillance for cases of SARS.\nWhile an increasing number of countries are reporting new cases, these\ncases are quickly identified, patients are isolated and local transmission\nis stopped in most countries.\nIt is now known that infection control methods work to contain the spread\nof SARS in hospitals, even in countries which do not have the most modern\nequipment.\nWHO and a network of 11 of the world's top laboratories are zeroing in on\nthe cause of SARS and a diagnostic test is being developed. This test will\nhelp distinguish between those who are infected and those who are free of\nthe SARS virus.\nThe laboratory network is continuing its investigations. So far, the agent\ncausing SARS has not been fully characterized and there is no certain\ntreatment, vaccine or known other preventative measure.\n'There will be other new diseases that will emerge in the future, and we\nwill respond just as we have with SARS -- with maximum efforts to contain\nits spread,' stated Dr Gu\u00e9na\u00ebl Rodier, Director, Communicable Disease\nSurveillance and Response, WHO.\n* Cases of SARS and the countries in which they appear are posted on the\nWHO web site every evening in Geneva, Switzerland.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 2 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: WHO SARS website 2 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>\nUpdate 19 - China deepens its collaboration to contain SARS, WHO revises\nits advice to international travellers as new data come in\n---------------------------\nNew data from China, WHO team leaving immediately for Guangdong\nChinese authorities have today announced updated figures for the number of\ncases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and deaths in Guangdong\nProvince. The figures, which cover the reporting period of 1 to 31 Mar\n2003, are 361 new SARS cases and 9 deaths.\nChinese authorities had previously reported 792 cases and 31 deaths in\nGuangdong Province in the reporting period of 16 Nov 2002 to 28 Feb 2003.\nThe cumulative total of SARS cases in Guangdong from 16 Nov 2002 to 31 Mar\n2003 now stands at 1153 cases and 40 deaths.\nThe Chinese Ministry of Health has further announced that a 5-person WHO\nteam will be travelling immediately to Guangdong Province to confer with\nofficials there. Chinese experience with the oldest SARS outbreak is\nexpected to yield epidemiological and clinical clues useful in establishing\npolicies to contain outbreaks elsewhere and prevent further international\nspread.\nMany questions about the outbreak in Guangdong Province, which borders Hong\nKong, have yet to be answered. This outbreak is the largest reported to\ndate and has also shown evidence of spread in the wider community.\nNo transmission of new cases is being reported elsewhere in the country.\nChinese authorities are in the process of setting up a reporting system\nthat will result in daily real-time reporting of SAS cases throughout the\ncountry.\nNew advice to travellers\n--------------------\nOn the basis of new data from China and Hong Kong, WHO has today revised\nits advice to international travellers as a measure for preventing the\nfurther international spread of SARS.\nIn a press release this morning, WHO issued the following advice:\n***'The World Health Organization (WHO) today began recommending that\npersons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and\nGuangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This\nupdated travel advice comes as a result of new developments in the\nmulti-country outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome\n(SARS).'***[asterisks added by ProMED - Mod.JW].\n\nThe new travel advice is intended to limit further international spread of\nSARS by restricting travel [into] areas where the transmission patterns of\nSARS\nare not fully understood. The SARS situation, which is rapidly evolving, is\nunder constant assessment by WHO in collaboration with three global\nnetworks of experts. The new advice is issued as part of a series of\nmeasures that will change as more information about SARS becomes available.\nNew data on international spread\n-----------------------------\nOvernight, WHO received reports on 9 persons, with a history of travel to\nHong Kong dating from 15 Mar 2003, who subsequently developed symptoms\nsuggesting probable cases of SARS when they travelled to other countries.\nThese 9 cases of probable SARS, related to travel in Hong Kong, occurred in\nTaiwan, Province of China, and Singapore. The data on these cases, and what\nis known about the incubation period of SARS, indicate that travel to Hong\nKong can contribute to the international spread of SARS.\n15 Mar 2003 is the date when WHO issued its first SARS-related emergency\ntravel advisory, which increased global awareness of this new disease, made\ntravellers and health staff alert to symptoms, and initiated prompt\nreporting of cases.\nThe SARS outbreak in Hong Kong SAR has developed an unusual pattern of\ntransmission. This pattern is different from what is being seen in the vast\nmajority of other SARS outbreaks, and is not yet fully understood. The\nnumber of cases is continuing to increase significantly, and there is\nevidence that the disease has spread beyond the initial focus in hospitals.\nThese developments raise questions related to other routes of transmission,\nin addition to well-documented face-to-face exposure to droplets released\nwhen an infected person coughs or sneezes. Epidemiologists are considering\nwhether SARS is being transmitted in Hong Kong by some environmental means\nfor which no satisfactory explanation has been found. Particular concern\ncentres on a large cluster of cases linked to residential buildings in the\nAmoy Garden housing estate in the Kowloon [mainland] district of Hong Kong.\nHistorical perspective\n---------------\nThis is the first time in the history of WHO that such travel advice has\nbeen issued for specific geographical areas because of an outbreak of an\ninfectious disease.\nSince 1958, WHO has issued weekly lists of areas infected with\nquarantinable diseases so that national authorities can decide whether to\napply public health measures to arriving travellers. During the last years\nof the smallpox eradication campaign cases spread internationally by land.\nControls at borders between neighbouring countries were relied on to\nprevent international spread. No global recommendations were necessary.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Our continuing thanks and gratitude to Marianne Hopp <mjh12@yahoo.com> for\nher role as WHO notifications rapporteur.\nThe major increase in reported cases in the past 24 hours (from 1804 cases\nand 62 deaths to 2223 cases and 78 deaths) is primarily attributable to the\n361 cases and 9 deaths reported to have occurred in Guangdong China during\nthe period 1-31 Mar 2003, and represent a one month incidence and not a 24\nhour incidence increase. The 24 hour increase in cases is 58, of which\nthere were 23 in Hong Kong, another 23 were in [mainland] China.\nOther areas with increases in reported cases include Canada with 5,\nSingapore with 3, & United States with 3. Neither\nViet Nam nor Taiwan have reported new cases in the past 24 hours.\nThe enigma presented by the increase in cases in Hong Kong, that to date\nhave *not* been confirmed as due to close contact, awaits further\ndefinition. Information from Hong Kong suggests that the index case in the\nAmoy Gardens outbreak was an individual on immunosuppressant medication for\nrenal disease; perhaps serving as a co-factor for enhanced transmission of a\nhigher viral load. Purely speculation at this point -- there are still many\nmore questions than there are answers. This moderator still feels strongly\nthat the high population density in this area may lead to many more 'casual\ncontacts' that by literal 'space' definition may in fact be comparable to\n'close contact' in other areas, and may be a significant factor in disease\ntransmission here.\nThe WHO travel advice is a first in its history. It is not a quarantine,\nbut rather a sensible guidance to avoid travel to an identified area of\nhigh transmission if travel is not essential and can be avoided. Many\nindividual countries have been making this recommendation for some time\nnow. Once more information on SARS is known, this recommendation may\nchange. The occurrence of cases in people who have travelled to the areas\nof high transmission (9 cases) -- combined with the enigma surrounding the\nincrease in cases in Hong Kong that have not been identified as close\ncontact transmission -- were the driving events behind this travel advice.\nJust putting things into perspective, we are only in week 4 of major,\ninternational investigations into this newly emerging disease currently\nnamed SARS.

This\nrepresents an increase of 182 cases and 4 deaths compared with the previous\nday.\nThe largest increase occurred in Hong Kong, where 155 new cases were\nreported. This brings the cumulative total of cases in Hong Kong to 685\ncases with 16 deaths.\nOf the 4 new SARS deaths, 3 occurred in Hong Kong. The fourth death was\nreported in Singapore.\nChina remains the country with the largest number of cases. According to\nofficial reports, 806 cases with 34 deaths have occurred. The majority of\nthese cases and deaths were associated with an outbreak in Guangdong\nProvince. During that outbreak, authorities recorded 792 cases and 31\ndeaths from 16 Nov 2002 through 28 Feb 2003.\nOther countries reporting additional cases include Canada (9), Taiwan,\nChina (3), Italy (1) Singapore (1), Thailand (1), and the United States of\nAmerica (10). Australia and Belgium reported their first probable cases\ntoday.\nIn Viet Nam, where hospitals in Hanoi were among the earliest to experience\na rapid burst of cases within a health care setting, the number of cases\n(58) and deaths (4) remained stable for the eighth day in a row. The\nincubation period for SARS is currently believed to range from 2 to 10\ndays. WHO epidemiologists regard [this] 8-day period with no newly detected\ncases as an encouraging sign that the outbreak in Hanoi has been controlled\nand that no further spread is occurring beyond the initial hospital foci.\nSingapore, another country that was hard hit at the beginning of the\nepidemic, is likewise showing a stable pattern, with cases confined to\nwell-documented risk groups and few new cases being detected.\nAn evolving epidemic, SARS is a newly identified disease with transmission\npatterns that are only beginning to emerge and thus difficult to interpret.\nMuch about the disease remains poorly understood, despite great progress in\ncharacterization of the causative virus and development of a robust\ndiagnostic test.\nParticularly puzzling are the great differences between areas where\noutbreaks appear to have been fairly rapidly contained and confined to\nhealth care settings and persons in close face-to-face contact with\npatients, and other areas, such as Hong Kong and Toronto, where\ntransmission is continuing despite the prompt isolation of patients and\nintroduction of strict barrier nursing practices.\nWHO has established a set of priority issues requiring urgent scientific\ninvestigation. More studies are needed about how the disease is spread, the\nstages of the disease when virus is shed, which bodily secretions carry the\nvirus, and whether certain secretions are more infectious than others.\nResearchers also need to understand whether persons infected with SARS\nbecome more infectious at a certain stage in the course of the disease, and\nwhether factors such as age or underlying disease influence severity and\nprognosis.\nSome of the world's foremost scientists and clinicians are now\ncollaborating around the clock, through 3 WHO networks of 'virtual' labs\nand clinics, to find answers to these questions. Evidence can then form the\nbasis for more precise public health advice on how to prevent further\nspread both internationally and within those countries where cases have\noccurred. Based on more than 5 decades of experience, WHO maintains the\nposition that good surveillance and response will contain any infectious\ndiseases.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 1 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health 1 Apr 2003\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n[A] Daily update 1 Apr 2003\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs at 1 PM 1 Apr 2003, 5 more patients are recovered.

The local airport authority has placed the Health\nAlert Notices and posters at strategic locations at the Pearson\nInternational Airport informing travellers who meet certain criteria to\ndefer their flights. These criteria include: having SARS symptoms (fever,\ncough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing); having been in\ncontact with a SARS-affected person in the last 10 days; and, having\nvisited a health facility that has been identified by public health\nofficials as being affected by SARS.\nIf passengers have visited a SARS-affected facility or have had contact\nwith a SARS-affected person, they are instructed to call their local health\ndepartment.\nA Health Canada SARS Team of physicians and nurses have been deployed to\nPearson to provide information to airline and airport staff.\nLatest Canadian Numbers on SARS\n----------------------------\nAs of 1 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately 151\nprobable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in\nCanada. There have been 6 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting. The information\ncontained in this update is based on the best available information Health\nCanada has at this time.\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\nOntario is reporting 56 probable and 68 suspect cases. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 2 probable and 12 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting one suspect case.\nSaskatchewan is reporting one suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 7 suspect cases.\nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n[B] Summary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Cases: 31 Mar 2003\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/sars20030331_e.html>\nLatest Case Counts: Since yesterday, 9 additional probable cases have been\nreported in Canada. A total of 53 individuals who meet the probable case\ndefinition of SARS have been reported in Ontario and British Columbia,\nincluding 4 deaths. In addition, a total of 76 individuals who meet the\ndefinition of a suspect case of SARS have been reported in British\nColumbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick. Since SARS is a\ndiagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may change over time.\nThus, previously reported cases may be discarded after further\ninvestigation and follow-up. The current number of probable cases by\nreported symptom onset date and type of exposure is also provided\n(Figure 1) [see webpage.\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/sars20030331_e.html>\nRecent Ontario Epidemiologic Findings: The Ontario Ministry of Health and\nLong-Term Care has reported a total of 51 probable cases of SARS. Of these,\nmost remain hospitalised for isolation purposes and only 2 are currently in\nintensive care. All 4 deaths were associated with individuals with\nunderlying illness, and all but one occurred in elderly patients. Using the\ninformation currently available, the average age of probable cases is 46.5\nyears (n=37, range 17 to 82 years), with 26 known females and 17 known\nmales.\nWhile it is difficult to conclusively determine the incubation period of\nthe etiologic agent, given the fact that many of the probable cases in\nOntario may have multiple exposures, the current estimated mean incubation\nperiod is 4 days (estimated range 2 to 10 days).\nIt is believed that 4 generations of transmission have occurred. The index\ncase in Ontario was an individual who travelled to Hong Kong and stayed at\nthe Metropole Hotel, where a cluster of SARS cases has since been reported.\nUpon return to Canada, disease transmission occurred in 4 members of the\nimmediate and extended family. A physician who had close contact with\nmembers of this family was also diagnosed with SARS. Following this, cases\nwere reported in individuals in a hospital setting where some of the first\ncases were treated. Most recently, SARS has been reported in a few of the\nhousehold contacts of these hospital-associated cases. An isolated case in\nOntario was reported in an individual who had travelled to Asia, but did\nnot stay in at the Metropole Hotel.\nBased on the most recent epidemiologic investigations, nearly all of the\nprobable cases of SARS that occurred in individuals outside of the initial\nfamily cluster have been linked either directly or indirectly back to\nexposure to the first hospitalised case of SARS, on 7 Mar 2003. It is\nbelieved that disease transmission occurred mainly as a result of\nperson-to-person contact. The initial hospital-associated cases are thought\nto have contracted the illness as a result of unprotected contact with the\ninitial cases prior to the recognition of SARS. Subsequent transmission may\nhave then occurred between households of these hospital-associated cases,\nand between other healthcare workers. To date, there has been no evidence\nof transmission in the general community. Furthermore, there is presently\nno evidence to suggest that disease transmission occurs prior to the onset\nof fever in a suspected or probable case of SARS.\nOther Reports: A Canadian with SARS [not counted in the official Canadian\ncase count], who is currently hospitalised in Hong Kong, stayed at the\nMetropole Hotel, as did the first identified probable case of SARS in\nBritish Columbia. However, while a second probable case reported by BC did\nnot stay at this hotel, this individual was exposed to a SARS case while in\nHong Kong. Both BC cases are currently in isolation and there is no\nevidence of further spread in the province. The 11 suspected cases\ncurrently under investigation are all associated with travel-related\nexposures.\nOntario has declared a provincial emergency and SARS is now a reportable\ndiseases under Ontario's Health Protection and Promotion Act. The province\nhas introduced a number of public measures in an effort to contain the\nspread of SARS. Key public health measures include: extensive contact\ntracing of persons who may have come in contact with SARS cases, isolation\nof suspect and probable cases, and voluntary home quarantine for\nasymptomatic contacts. Isolation wards have been established at hospitals\nand health care staff are required to observe full airborne and contact\nprecautions. Health care staff across the province are now alerted to SARS\nand have implemented infection control practices to protect themselves and\ntheir patients in an effort to prevent any further infection.\n\nTable 1\nCumulative Number of SARS Cases Reported in Canada, 31 Mar 2003\nProvince/Territory Individuals Meeting the Criteria for a:\nProbable Case(1)/ Suspect Case(1)/ Death\nBritish Columbia: 2/ 11/ 0\nAlberta: 0/ 5/ 0\nSaskatchewan: 0/ 1/ 0\nOntario: 51/ 58/ 4\nNew Brunswick: 0/ 1/ 0\nTOTAL 53 76 4\n(1) These persons may drop off the probable or suspect case list if another\ncause if identified for their illness\nFigure 1: Number of probable cases of SARS in Canada by symptom onset date\nand exposure type from: 23 Feb 2003 to 31 Mar 2003 (n=38, excluding 15 for\nwhom onset dates are missing) [see webpage for graphic representation\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/sars20030331_e.html>]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 1 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Public Health Foundation E News\n<http://www.phf.org>\n\nCDC Broadcast information\n-----------------------\n'Preventing Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)'\nA Public Health Training Network Live Satellite Broadcast, Webcast &\nAudiobridge\nFriday, April 4, 2003, 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM ET - Rebroadcast 2:00 - 3:30 PM\nET\nBroadcast/webcast/audiobridge information:\n<http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/PHTN/sars> (go to course overview at bottom of\npage)\nProgram description\nThis broadcast sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and\nsupported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will provide\ninformation on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) reported in\npatients in Asia, North America, and Europe.

The situation in Hong Kong\nawaits further clarification as to the presumed mechanism of transmission\nin the apartment complex where the most recent cluster of cases has\noccurred. Elsewhere, transmission is still following the pattern of\nrequiring close contact with an active case of SARS. It appears as though\ntransmission may have been interrupted in Viet Nam, where the majority of\ntransmission was in the healthcare setting and infection control procedures\nhave been implemented. Traditionally interruption of transmission is\nconsidered to have occurred when 2 maximum incubation periods of a disease\nhave passed without new cases being identified. In the case of SARS, the\nmaximum incubation period is currently described as 10 days, so that at 20\ndays one might consider transmission to have been interrupted. Clearly\nthis may change once the etiologic agent has been definitively identified\nand studies on duration of viral shedding are completed.\nFor additional information on the early outbreak investigations in Canada\nand Hong Kong and an editorial addressed to the medical community, the New\nEngland Journal of Medicine has posted 3 articles on SARS.

The local airport authority has placed the Health\nAlert Notices and posters at strategic locations at the Pearson\nInternational Airport informing travellers who meet certain criteria to\ndefer their flights. the program will be distributed\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org He said Block E\nwas still under isolation orders and would be under Police protection to\nensure residents' flats were not broken into.\n Based on more than 5 decades of experience, WHO maintains the\nposition that good surveillance and response will contain any infectious\ndiseases.\n (go to course overview at bottom of\npage)\nProgram description\n Singapore: Singapore\nChina: Guangdong, Hong Kong SAR China, Shanxi, Taiwan Province\nViet Nam: Hanoi\n Due to differences in the case definitions being used at a national\nlevel, probable cases are reported by all countries except the United\nStates of America, which is reporting suspect cases under investigation. In Viet Nam, where hospitals in Hanoi were among the earliest to experience\na rapid burst of cases within a health care setting, the number of cases\n(58) and deaths (4) remained stable for the eighth day in a row. All Canadian cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting. The start of the period of surveillance has been changed to 1 Nov 2002\nto capture cases of atypical pneumonia in China that are now recognized as\nbeing cases of SARS. The initial hospital-associated cases are thought\nto have contracted the illness as a result of unprotected contact with the\ninitial cases prior to the recognition of SARS. Following this, cases\nwere reported in individuals in a hospital setting where some of the first\ncases were treated. This brings the cumulative total of cases in Hong Kong to 685\ncases with 16 deaths.\n Health Canada has deployed 6 staff to assist Toronto's public health unit\nand the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation of the SARS\ncases. Traditionally interruption of transmission is\nconsidered to have occurred when 2 maximum incubation periods of a disease\nhave passed without new cases being identified. [C] Update 16 - Update on cases and countries 1 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_01/en/>\n The current number of probable cases by\nreported symptom onset date and type of exposure is also provided\n Subsequent transmission may\nhave then occurred between households of these hospital-associated cases,\nand between other healthcare workers. A total of 53 individuals who meet the probable case\ndefinition of SARS have been reported in Ontario and British Columbia,\nincluding 4 deaths. The index\ncase in Ontario was an individual who travelled to Hong Kong and stayed at\nthe Metropole Hotel, where a cluster of SARS cases has since been reported. WHO epidemiologists regard [this] 8-day period with no newly detected\ncases as an encouraging sign that the outbreak in Hanoi has been controlled\nand that no further spread is occurring beyond the initial hospital foci. Total: 1804/ 62\nNotes:\nCumulative number of cases includes number of deaths. This\nrepresents an increase of 182 cases and 4 deaths compared with the previous\nday. [B] Summary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Cases: 31 Mar 2003\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/sars20030331_e.html>\n An affected area: an area in which local chain(s) of transmission of SARS\nis/are occurring as reported by the national public health authorities.\n \nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n Apr 2003\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n[A] Daily update 1 Apr 2003\n The majority of\nthese cases and deaths were associated with an outbreak in Guangdong\nProvince. The 11 suspected cases\ncurrently under investigation are all associated with travel-related\nexposures. In the case of SARS, the\nmaximum incubation period is currently described as 10 days, so that at 20\ndays one might consider transmission to have been interrupted. Furthermore, there is presently\nno evidence to suggest that disease transmission occurs prior to the onset\nof fever in a suspected or probable case of SARS. However, while a second probable case reported by BC did\nnot stay at this hotel, this individual was exposed to a SARS case while in\nHong Kong. In addition, a total of 76 individuals who meet the\ndefinition of a suspect case of SARS have been reported in British\nColumbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick. Health care staff across the province are now alerted to SARS\nand have implemented infection control practices to protect themselves and\ntheir patients in an effort to prevent any further infection. This brought to 84\nthe total number of patients who have recovered from atypical\npneumonia and have been discharged from public hospitals. It is\nbelieved that disease transmission occurred mainly as a result of\nperson-to-person contact. Most of the deaths\noccurred in individuals who have a history of chronic diseases, or were\npatients who sought treatment at a relatively late stage of infection. SARS - WORLDWIDE (23): CASES\n********************\n Isolation wards have been established at hospitals\nand health care staff are required to observe full airborne and contact\nprecautions. If passengers have visited a SARS-affected facility or have had contact\nwith a SARS-affected person, they are instructed to call their local health\ndepartment.

Between 19-23 Mar 2003, she met and\nworked with 2 Singaporean colleagues, who have since returned to Singapore\nand are well. She arrived back in Singapore on Southern China Airlines CZ\n355 at Terminal 1, Changi Airport on 26 Mar 2003 at 5.38 am. Accompanied by\nher mother, she took a taxi from the airport to the Accident & Emergency\nDepartment, Singapore General Hospital. From there, she was transferred by\nambulance and admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.\nHer mother and 2 colleagues have been issued with Home Quarantine Orders.\nOthers who were served the Orders were 3 SATS officers, 2 SIR officers and\n2 relations officers from the airline. We have identified a taxi-driver who\nsaid that he had ferried 2 women from Changi Airport to the Accident &\nEmergency Department, Singapore General Hospital on the morning of 26 Mar\n2003. As a precautionary measure, a Home Quarantine Order has been issued\nto him.\nFollowing yesterday's press statement, we have been able to locate 10 more\npassengers. They are all well and quarantine orders are being served to\nthem. In total, 40 of the 48 passengers (excluding the case) have been\nidentified. There is a possibility that some of the remaining 8 passengers\nare no longer in Singapore. The names of the remaining 8 passengers who we\nhave still been unable to locate are [see\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5740> for list of names.]\nThe latest (fifth) imported case is a 17-year-old Indonesian male student\nwho left Singapore on 15 Mar 2003 with his parents and his 15-year-old\nbrother for Guangdong and Hong Kong. The family returned to Singapore on\nthe night of 23 Mar 2003. On 24 Mar 2003, he was well and attended school\nat Bowen Secondary School. On 25 Mar 2003, he developed a fever and was\nseen at TTSH as an outpatient. He was given 5 days medical leave. He was\nseen again on 27 Mar 2003 and admitted to TTSH as a suspect SARS case. He\nstayed at home all this while. He was upgraded as a SARS case on 29 Mar\n2003. His mother is also admitted to TTSH as a suspect case. His father and\nbrother are well.\nAdditional precautionary measures at Changi Airport to minimize the import\nof SARS\nTo minimize the import of SARS cases, Singapore is stepping up health\nscreening procedures for passengers arriving at Changi Airport from\naffected countries. This is in view of new index cases that are traced to\npeople who have traveled overseas.\nAdditional Precautionary Measures For Incoming Passengers\nFrom 5 PM 31 Mar 2003 onwards, for all incoming flights from affected\nareas as identified by WHO, nurses will be present to check on passengers\nwho appear unwell. Those who have fever, will be sent to TTSH for assessment.\nAdditionally, CAAS has today issued a directive that takes immediate effect\nto all airlines operating at Changi Airport requiring them to ask\npassengers the 3 questions recommended by the World Health Organisation\n(WHO) before allowing them to board the flight to Singapore. The 3\nquestions are :\n1. Do you have high fever of more than 38 degrees Celsius?\n2. Do you have one or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness\nof breath, difficulty breathing?\n3. Have you had close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with\nSARS or had recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS?\nAny visibly unwell passenger will be asked to obtain a doctor's\ncertification before they are allowed to board the flight to Singapore.\nThe above measures are on top of the health advisory cards distributed to\nall passengers coming from Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Guangdong. MOH and CAAS\nwill scale up the operations and implement the above measures to other\naffected countries as and when WHO updates the list.\nAdditional Precautionary Measures For Outgoing Passengers\nCAAS has issued a directive to airlines in Changi Airport requiring all\nairlines to ask departing passengers the 3 questions recommended by the\nWHO. This directive takes effect immediately. This is in addition to the\nhealth advisory cards which are distributed to passengers bound for Hong\nKong, Hanoi and Guangdong when checking in for their flights.\nSARS Situation Update\nAs at 30 Mar 2003, the total number of people who have recovered from SARS\nand are discharged from hospital is 35. The remaining 53 patients are\nhospitalised.\nA total of 91 people with SARS have been reported to the Ministry of\nHealth. Of the 2 additional patients, one is a healthcare worker who is\nstill traced back to the initial 3 index cases, and the other is the new\n(fifth) imported case.\nSo far, there have been no SARS cases that are linked to the fourth and\nfifth imported cases. This brings the total number of family members,\nfriends or close contacts infected by SARS to 44, and the total number of\nhospital staff infected by SARS to 42. These 86 cases are all linked to the\nfirst 3 index cases. The number of infected children still remains at 3.\nThere are currently 36 suspected cases, 2 out of which are children.\nThere are 12 patients who are in serious condition, including the fourth\nimported case. One patient who was in intensive care passed away on 29 Mar\n2003.

The information contained in this update is based on\nthe best available information Health Canada has at this time.\nHealth Canada is changing the way it is reporting probable and suspect\ncases of SARS to ensure consistency in reporting across the country.\n'Probable' cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often they have\na more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty\nbreathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays show signs of atypical pneumonia.\nA 'suspect' case of SARS is a person who fits into one of the following 2\ncategories: a person who develops fever and one or more respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,\nwithin 10 days of returning from travel to areas in Asia where SARS cases\nare being reported, or a person who develops fever and one or more\nrespiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty\nbreathing, within 10 days of having had close contact with a 'probable'\ncase of SARS (i.e., within one metre).\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\nOntario is reporting approximately 81 probable and suspect cases.

It was generally accepted that polio was more of an 'urban disease'\nwith higher incidences observed in urban areas. Results of studies on the\nbaseline incidence of polio in a highly populated state revealed that the\nrural incidence was on a par with the urban incidence. Our interpretation\nof this observation was that the standard western definition of urban vs.\nrural was based on population density, where rural areas had a markedly\nlower population density than urban areas. In the highly populated\ndistricts of India, rural areas had population densities similar to many\nwestern urban areas.

To date, 91 cases have arisen from the first index\ncase, comprising 45 family members, friends, or close contacts, and 46\nhospital staff. Among these are 3 children below 18 years of age.\nA 7th imported case was reported today. She is a 42-year-old Indonesian\nwoman, the mother of the 5th imported case (17-year-old Indonesian\nstudent). She left Singapore for Hong Kong and Guangdong on 15 Mar 2003 and\nreturned to Singapore on 23 Mar 2003. She became unwell on 24 Mar 2003 and\nwas admitted to TTSH as a suspect SARS case on 25 Mar 2003.\nSo far, apart from the first imported case, the 6 other imported cases have\nnot given rise to any SARS cases.\nThe total number of people who have recovered from SARS and have been\ndischarged from hospital is 57. The remaining 37 patients are hospitalised,\nout of which 11 are in serious condition (including the fourth imported\ncase).\nThe number of suspect cases is 47, including 2 children (below 18 years\nold) and the 20-year-old student from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.\nDischarge and follow-up of SARS patients\n-------------------------------------\nSARS patients are discharged from TTSH and followed up in accordance with\nthe guidelines from the World Health Organisation (WHO). Upon discharge,\nSARS patients are given medical leave for 2 weeks and are required to stay\nat home. They are reviewed by the doctors at TTSH before they return to\nwork or school. During their 2 weeks' medical leave at home, their\ncondition is monitored by staff from TTSH through daily phone calls.\nUpdate on Children with SARS\n----------------------------\nOne of the children with SARS is the 4-year-old boy from Pat's Schoolhouse\nwhose condition remains stable. None of the children in the Schoolhouse\nhave developed SARS as of today, 12 days later.\nAnother is the 17-year-old brother of the above boy, who did not attend\nschool during the school holidays.

A total of 58 individuals who meet the probable case\ndefinition of SARS have been reported in Ontario and British Columbia,\nincluding 6 deaths; 93 individuals who meet the definition of a suspect\ncase of SARS have also been reported in British Columbia, Alberta,\nSaskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.\nSince SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may\nchange over time. At the present time, the case fatality rate in Canada is\nestimated at approximately 4.0 percent of probable or suspect cases (N=151),\nwhich is similar to that reported by other countries, depending on the\ncriteria used to define a SARS case.\nTable 1: Cumulative Number of SARS Cases Reported in Canada: 1 Apr 2003\nProvince/Territory: Probable Case(1)/ Suspect Case(1)/ Deaths(2)\nBritish Columbia: 2/ 12/ 0\nAlberta: 0/ 7/ 0\nSaskatchewan: 0/ 1/ 0\nOntario: 56/ 68/ 6\nNew Brunswick: 0/ 1/ 0\nPrince Edward Island: 0/ 4/ 0\nTotal: 58/ 93/ 6\n(1) These persons may drop off the probable or suspect case list if another\ncause is identified for their illness\n(2) This figure is included in the number of probable cases\nSummary of Disease Transmission to Date\n----------------------------------\nThe Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care has reported a total of\n56 probable cases of SARS. It is believed that 4 generations of\ntransmission have occurred. The index case in Ontario was an individual who\ntravelled to Hong Kong and stayed at the Metropole Hotel, where a cluster\nof SARS cases has since been reported. Upon return to Canada, disease\ntransmission occurred in 4 members of the immediate and extended family. A\nphysician who had close contact with members of this family was also\ndiagnosed with SARS. Following this, cases were reported in individuals in\na hospital setting where some of the first cases were treated. Most\nrecently, SARS has been reported in a few of the household contacts of\nthese hospital-associated cases. To date, transmission of disease has\noccurred in household and hospital settings. There is no evidence of\ntransmission in the general community. An isolated case in Ontario was\nreported in an individual who had travelled to Asia, but did not stay in at\nthe Metropole Hotel.\nReports of the 2 probable cases from British Columbia have been linked to\ntravel-related exposure. The first identified probable case of SARS in\nBritish Columbia stayed at the Metropole Hotel, and the second individual\nwas exposed to a SARS case in Hong Kong. Both individuals are currently in\nisolation and there is no evidence of further spread in British Columbia.\nAll of the 12 suspected cases currently under investigation in BC are also\nassociated with travel-related exposures. A Canadian with SARS [not counted\nin the official Canadian case count], who is currently hospitalised in Hong\nKong, also stayed at the Metropole Hotel.\nPreliminary Descriptive Findings\n-----------------------------\nGiven the information currently available, the average age of probable\ncases in Canada is 46.2 years (n=45, range 2 to 82 years), with 31 females\nand 20 males. The current number of probable cases by reported symptom\nonset date and type of exposure is also provided (Figure 1 - Number of\nprobable cases of SARS in Canada by symptom onset date and exposure type\nfrom: 23 Feb 23 to 1 Apr 2003 (n=45, excluding 13 for whom onset dates or\nexposure classification are unknown))\n[see webpage for epidemic curve:\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/eu-ae/sars20030401_e.html>]\nTable 2: Known current status of probable cases in Canada: 1 Apr 2003\n(n=23, excluding 35 individuals whose status is either unknown or missing)\nStatus: Number of Cases/ Proportion\nImproving: 5/ 21.7 percent\nStable: 15/ 65.2 percent\nDeteriorating: 2/ 8.7 percent\nCritical: 1/ 4.4 percent\nTotal no. of probable cases with known status, currently hospitalised:\n23/100 percent\nPreliminary Epidemiologic Findings\n------------------------------\nTransmission: Based on the most recent epidemiologic investigations, nearly\nall of the probable cases of SARS in Ontario that occurred in individuals\noutside of the initial family cluster have been linked either directly or\nindirectly back to exposure to the first hospitalised case of SARS, on 7\nMar 2003. It is believed that disease transmission occurred mainly as a\nresult of person-to-person contact. The initial hospital-associated cases\nare thought to have contracted the illness as a result of unprotected\ncontact with the initial cases prior to the recognition of SARS. Subsequent\ntransmission may have then occurred between households of these\nhospital-associated cases, and between other healthcare workers. To date,\nthere has been no evidence of transmission in the general community.\nFurthermore, there is presently no evidence to suggest that disease\ntransmission occurs prior to the onset of fever in a suspected or probable\ncase of SARS.\nEstimated incubation period: While it is difficult to conclusively\ndetermine the incubation period of the etiologic agent, given the fact that\nmany of the probable cases in Ontario may have multiple exposures, the\ncurrent estimated mean incubation period is 4 days (estimated range 2 to 10\ndays).\nClinical Manifestations: The main signs and symptoms seen in cases of SARS\ninclude fever (greater than 38.0 degrees Celsius), cough and shortness of\nbreath. Symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may not be\npresent. A few cases have developed increasing respiratory distress and\nrequire mechanical ventilation. In the majority of hospitalised cases, an\ninfiltrate on chest x-ray and lymphopenia is evident. In addition,\nthrombocytopenia (less than 150 000 / cubic mm), elevated creatinine kinase\nand elevated ALT/AST may be observed. The WHO is coordinating global\nefforts to better characterize the clinical manifestations of SARS. Because\nawareness and surveillance of the disease have increased worldwide, an\nincrease in the number of suspected cases is to be expected.\nSeverity of Illness: Of all of the probable cases reported to date, most\nremain hospitalised for isolation purposes and only 3 are now in intensive\ncare. All 6 deaths have been associated with individuals with underlying\nillness and all but one occurred in elderly patients. Of 32 probable cases\nfor whom hospitalisation status is known, 3 are currently in intensive\ncare. In addition, 2 of the 3 cases that required intubation have since\ndied.\nPublic Health Measures\n---------------------\nOntario has declared a provincial emergency and SARS is now a reportable\ndiseases under Ontario's Health Protection and Promotion Act. The province\nhas introduced a number of public measures in an effort to contain the\nspread of SARS. Key public health measures include: extensive contact\ntracing of persons who may have come in contact with SARS cases, isolation\nof suspect and probable cases, and voluntary home quarantine for\nasymptomatic contacts. Isolation wards have been established at hospitals\nand health care staff are required to observe full airborne and contact\nprecautions. Health care staff across the province are now alerted to SARS\nand have implemented infection control practices to protect themselves and\ntheir patients in an effort to prevent any further infection.\nHealth Canada is supporting Ontario in its SARS response efforts by\nproviding epidemiologic and infection control expertise, as well as\nemergency supplies as needed. Health Canada, in collaboration with the\nProvinces and Territories, has implemented enhanced surveillance for the\ndetection of SARS cases, alerted laboratories, and initiated special\nlaboratory investigations in an effort to identify the cause of SARS. In\naddition, Health Canada has initiated the first phase of implementing\nscreening procedures for all domestic and international travellers\ndeparting from Toronto, in response to the WHO recommendations to prevent\ntravel-related spread of SARS. In addition, due to recent concerns\nregarding the possibility of transmission of SARS aboard aircraft, Health\nCanada has also recommended the follow-up of all passengers on flights\nwhere a suspect or probable SARS case is identified.

Total deaths to date in\nmainland(?) increased to 43. From 1-31 Mar 2003, the province has had 361\natypical pneumonia cases, representing a drop of 47.5 percent compared with\nFebruary 2003. At the beginning of March 2003 there were 145 cases, in the\nmiddle of the month 128, and by the last 10 days of the month 88. The trend\nis clearly down. The spread of the ilness appears to be under control,\nespecially among health workers.\nFor this month [March?], patients that left the hospital were 507, an\nincrease of 133 over the previous month [February?]; 9 deaths, 18 fewer\nthan last month. The provincial government earlier indicated that the\nentire province has had 31 deaths due to atypical pneumonia.\nOn a separate note, Beijing has had 3 deaths from atypical pneumonia.\n\n[similar report from China Daily 3 Apr 2003\n<http://www1.chinadaily.com.cn/news/2003-04-03/110553.html>]\n9 people died of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province last month,\nGuangdong Provincial Bureau of Public Health revealed Wednesday. There\nwere 18 fewer deaths from the mystery illness last month, compared to\nFebruary's toll of 27 deaths, a bureau official, who declined to be named,\nsaid. A total of 361 people were diagnosed with atypical pneumonia in the\nsouthern Chinese province between 1-31 Mar 2003, down 47.5 percent from\nFebruary's total.\nSome 145 cases of atypical pneumonia were detected from 1-10 Mar 2003, 128\nwere discovered from 11-20 Mar 2003, while the remaining 88 cases were\ndiagnosed in the last 11 days of last month. Most of March's cases were\nreported in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, the official said.\nThe gradual fall in the number of new infections indicated that the fatal\ndisease was basically under control in Guangdong Province, the official\nsaid. No doctors, nurses, or medical staff were diagnosed with atypical\npneumonia in March, the official said, and the peak period of infection,\nmid-February 2003, was believed to have passed. The official urged local\nresidents and tourists in the province not to panic.\nMeanwhile, a total of 507 atypical pneumonia patients recovered and were\ndischarged from hospital in March 2003 -- 133 more than in February 2003,\nthe official said. By the end of March [2003], Guangdong had detected a\ntotal of 1153 atypical pneumonia patients since its first case was reported\nin Foshan on 16 Nov 2002. So far, 40 people have died of the disease in\nthe province.\nAbout 80 percent of Guangdong's atypical pneumonia patients have now\nrecovered and been discharged from hospitals thanks to effective medical\ntreatment, the official said. The atypical pneumonia outbreak struck 7\ncities -- Guangzhou, Heyuan, Shenzhen, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhaoqing, and\nJiangmen -- in the Pearl River Delta.\n\n[B] China, Shanghai from the Statesman / Xinhua\n<http://www.thestatesman.net/page.news.php?clid=8&theme=&usrsess\n=1&id=10180>\nShanghai today reported its first SARS case. 'A woman suspected of being\ninfected has been hospitalised and isolated for treatment in the city of\nShanghai,' the official Xinhua news agency reported. The patient travelled\nto south China on a business trip in late March [2003]. Shortly after her\nreturn to Shanghai she fell ill with SARS symptoms. The Shanghai municipal\ncommittee of the communist party of China and government gave assurances\nthat they would keep the public well informed of the matter, the report\nsaid.\n[C] Thailand from the Strait Times\n<http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,180850,00.html>\nThailand yesterday ordered all foreigners from SARS-affected countries to\nwear masks at all times or face a fine of 10 000 baht (US $417) or up to 6\nmonths in jail. Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan told a news\nconference that visitors from Singapore, mainland China, Hongkong, Taiwan,\nand Vietnam would be screened on arrival, and anyone with SARS symptoms\nwould be deported immediately.\n'Those without symptoms who are allowed to enter must wear masks at all\ntimes,' she added.\nThai residents returning from Singapore, Vietnam, Hongkong, mainland China,\nand Taiwan must stay at home for 14 days, cannot go to school or work, and\nmust avoid close contact with friends and relatives.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[As of the time of finalizing this posting, the new data available on the\nHealth Canada and CDC USA websites were for probable and suspected cases\nreported to the respective agencies as of 1 Apr 2003. It should be noted\nthat the data for Health Canada disaggregates cases by suspected and\nprobable, whereas the USA data combines all suspected and probable\ncases. Hence, there are challenges in attempting to draw comparisons\nbetween these data and those of countries where only probable cases are\nbeing reported.\nSuspected cases are important in public health investigation to ensure\nappropriate infection control measures are implemented, and for contact\ntracing and evaluation. But, as they are considered suspected cases, it is\npossible that as further information becomes available, they will be shown\nto be due to etiologies other than the yet-to-be-determined agent(s)\nresponsible for SARS.\nAgain, with the exception of Hong Kong SAR and Guangdong, China, all cases\nto date are traceable to known contact with other cases of SARS. One should\nquestion here whether the case definition used in some areas precludes the\nidentification of cases without known contact with a SARS case. The CDC\ncriteria include: 'Travel within 10 days of onset of symptoms to an area\nwith documented or suspected community transmission of SARS (see list\nbelow; excludes areas with secondary cases limited to healthcare workers or\ndirect household contacts) or, Close contact* within 10 days of onset of\nsymptoms with either a person with a respiratory illness who traveled to a\nSARS area or a person known to be a suspect SARS case.\n* Close contact is defined as having cared for, having lived with, or\nhaving direct contact with respiratory secretions and/or body fluids of a\npatient known to be suspect SARS case. Areas with documented or suspected\ncommunity transmission of SARS: Peoples' Republic of China (i.e., mainland\nChina and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region); Hanoi, Vietnam; and\nSingapore'.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm>\nWe await further information on the epidemiologic studies of SARS in Hong\nKong and Guangdong, China.\nThe information on the Canadian cases now includes daily descriptive\nepidemiology, providing the age distribution of cases as well as further\nclassification by severity of illness. According to these data, the\nfatalities have been associated with increased age and presence of\npre-existing health conditions.\nWe have included several newswire reports in this update to highlight an\nincrease in the amount of information now coming out of China, with\npreliminary epidemiologic information on disease trends in Guangdong and the\nreport of 3 fatal cases in Beijing & a first possible case in Shanghai.\nHopefully this reporting will continue on a real-time basis so that there\nwill be daily updates on the situation in China.\nThe newswire report on the infection control measures taken by Thailand was\nincluded to demonstrate the level of concern and the various degrees of\ninfection control measures being undertaken at national levels. This brings\nback memories of initial reactions during the early increases in HIV/AIDS\nbefore much information on transmission routes and the etiologic agent were\nknown. However, it is very hard to be overly critical in the face of an\noutbreak of 'unknown' etiology with respiratory spread. - Mod.MPP]", "summary": "1\nHawaii: 4\nIllinois: 2\nKansas: 1\nMaine: 2\nMassachusetts: 4\nMichigan: 3\nMissouri: 2\nMississippi: 1\nMinnesota: 3\nNew Hampshire: 1\nNew Jersey: 1\nNew Mexico: 1\nNorth Carolina: 2\nNew York: 13\nOhio: 1\nPennsylvania: 3\nRhode Island: 1\nTexas: 3\nUtah: 4\nVermont: 2\nVirginia: 3\nWashington: 4\nWisconsin: 1\n The CDC\ncriteria include: 'Travel within 10 days of onset of symptoms to an area\nwith documented or suspected community transmission of SARS (see list\nbelow; excludes areas with secondary cases limited to healthcare workers or\ndirect household contacts) or, Close contact* within 10 days of onset of\nsymptoms with either a person with a respiratory illness who traveled to a\nSARS area or a person known to be a suspect SARS case.\n The current number of probable cases by reported symptom\nonset date and type of exposure is also provided (Figure 1 - Number of\nprobable cases of SARS in Canada by symptom onset date and exposure type\nfrom: 23 Feb 23 to 1 Apr 2003 (n=45, excluding 13 for whom onset dates or\nexposure classification are unknown))\n \nEstimated incubation period: While it is difficult to conclusively\ndetermine the incubation period of the etiologic agent, given the fact that\nmany of the probable cases in Ontario may have multiple exposures, the\ncurrent estimated mean incubation period is 4 days (estimated range 2 to 10\ndays).

[2 Apr 2003 accessed 6:00 PM EST]\nLatest Case Counts\n-----------------\n Health Canada, in collaboration with the\nProvinces and Territories, has implemented enhanced surveillance for the\ndetection of SARS cases, alerted laboratories, and initiated special\nlaboratory investigations in an effort to identify the cause of SARS. Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n There\nwere 18 fewer deaths from the mystery illness last month, compared to\nFebruary's toll of 27 deaths, a bureau official, who declined to be named,\nsaid. Thai residents returning from Singapore, Vietnam, Hongkong, mainland China,\nand Taiwan must stay at home for 14 days, cannot go to school or work, and\nmust avoid close contact with friends and relatives.\n This brings\nback memories of initial reactions during the early increases in HIV/AIDS\nbefore much information on transmission routes and the etiologic agent were\nknown. Investigation in the United States\n*Case definition:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm>\n Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan told a news\nconference that visitors from Singapore, mainland China, Hongkong, Taiwan,\nand Vietnam would be screened on arrival, and anyone with SARS symptoms\nwould be deported immediately. The Shanghai municipal\ncommittee of the communist party of China and government gave assurances\nthat they would keep the public well informed of the matter, the report\nsaid. [A] China, Guangdong/Beijing from Ming Pao newspaper, Hong Kong [in Chinese,\ntrans. by JS]\n<http://www.mpinews.com/newsletter.cfm?newsid=200304021057ca31057y>\n [B] China, Shanghai from the Statesman / Xinhua\n<http://www.thestatesman.net/page.news.php?clid=8&theme=&usrsess\n=1&id=10180>\n Some 145 cases of atypical pneumonia were detected from 1-10 Mar 2003, 128\nwere discovered from 11-20 Mar 2003, while the remaining 88 cases were\ndiagnosed in the last 11 days of last month. From 1-31 Mar 2003, the province has had 361\natypical pneumonia cases, representing a drop of 47.5 percent compared with\nFebruary 2003. [As of the time of finalizing this posting, the new data available on the\nHealth Canada and CDC USA websites were for probable and suspected cases\nreported to the respective agencies as of 1 Apr 2003. Meanwhile, a total of 507 atypical pneumonia patients recovered and were\ndischarged from hospital in March 2003 -- 133 more than in February 2003,\nthe official said. \n2 of these new cases were reported in hospital staff who are linked back to\nthe first index case. The initial hospital-associated cases\nare thought to have contracted the illness as a result of unprotected\ncontact with the initial cases prior to the recognition of SARS. Given the information currently available, the average age of probable\ncases in Canada is 46.2 years (n=45, range 2 to 82 years), with 31 females\nand 20 males. Source: CDC SARS website 2 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Report of Suspected Cases Under\n Severity of Illness: Of all of the probable cases reported to date, most\nremain hospitalised for isolation purposes and only 3 are now in intensive\ncare. By the end of March [2003], Guangdong had detected a\ntotal of 1153 atypical pneumonia patients since its first case was reported\nin Foshan on 16 Nov 2002. A total of 361 people were diagnosed with atypical pneumonia in the\nsouthern Chinese province between 1-31 Mar 2003, down 47.5 percent from\nFebruary's total. One should\nquestion here whether the case definition used in some areas precludes the\nidentification of cases without known contact with a SARS case. The information on the Canadian cases now includes daily descriptive\nepidemiology, providing the age distribution of cases as well as further\nclassification by severity of illness. To date, 91 cases have arisen from the first index\ncase, comprising 45 family members, friends, or close contacts, and 46\nhospital staff. Suspected cases are important in public health investigation to ensure\nappropriate infection control measures are implemented, and for contact\ntracing and evaluation. Of 32 probable cases\nfor whom hospitalisation status is known, 3 are currently in intensive\ncare. The index case in Ontario was an individual who\ntravelled to Hong Kong and stayed at the Metropole Hotel, where a cluster\nof SARS cases has since been reported. No doctors, nurses, or medical staff were diagnosed with atypical\npneumonia in March, the official said, and the peak period of infection,\nmid-February 2003, was believed to have passed. Hence, there are challenges in attempting to draw comparisons\nbetween these data and those of countries where only probable cases are\nbeing reported. About 80 percent of Guangdong's atypical pneumonia patients have now\nrecovered and been discharged from hospitals thanks to effective medical\ntreatment, the official said. Most\nrecently, SARS has been reported in a few of the household contacts of\nthese hospital-associated cases. Subsequent\ntransmission may have then occurred between households of these\nhospital-associated cases, and between other healthcare workers. Furthermore, there is presently no evidence to suggest that disease\ntransmission occurs prior to the onset of fever in a suspected or probable\ncase of SARS. * Close contact is defined as having cared for, having lived with, or\nhaving direct contact with respiratory secretions and/or body fluids of a\npatient known to be suspect SARS case. State: Suspected cases under investigation*\nAlabama: 1\nCalifornia: Because\nawareness and surveillance of the disease have increased worldwide, an\nincrease in the number of suspected cases is to be expected. The first identified probable case of SARS in\nBritish Columbia stayed at the Metropole Hotel, and the second individual\nwas exposed to a SARS case in Hong Kong. Clinical Manifestations: The main signs and symptoms seen in cases of SARS\ninclude fever (greater than 38.0 degrees Celsius), cough and shortness of\nbreath. For this month [March?], patients that left the hospital were 507, an\nincrease of 133 over the previous month [February?]; 9 deaths, 18 fewer\nthan last month. Health care staff across the province are now alerted to SARS\nand have implemented infection control practices to protect themselves and\ntheir patients in an effort to prevent any further infection. The remaining 37 patients are hospitalised,\nout of which 11 are in serious condition (including the fourth imported\ncase). She is a 42-year-old Indonesian\nwoman, the mother of the 5th imported case (17-year-old Indonesian\nstudent). He has since been discharged, together\nwith his 13-year-old sister from Pei Cai Secondary School, who was a\nsuspect SARS case. Upon discharge,\nSARS patients are given medical leave for 2 weeks and are required to stay\nat home. A woman suspected of being\ninfected has been hospitalised and isolated for treatment in the city of\nShanghai,' the official Xinhua news agency reported. An isolated case in Ontario was\nreported in an individual who had travelled to Asia, but did not stay in at\nthe Metropole Hotel. SARS - WORLDWIDE (25): CASES\n**********************\n The newswire report on the infection control measures taken by Thailand was\nincluded to demonstrate the level of concern and the various degrees of\ninfection control measures being undertaken at national levels. The gradual fall in the number of new infections indicated that the fatal\ndisease was basically under control in Guangdong Province, the official\nsaid. A Canadian with SARS [not counted\nin the official Canadian case count], who is currently hospitalised in Hong\nKong, also stayed at the Metropole Hotel. The atypical pneumonia outbreak struck 7\ncities -- Guangzhou, Heyuan, Shenzhen, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhaoqing, and\nJiangmen -- in the Pearl River Delta.

The team was authorized to travel to the\nprovince yesterday.\nMeetings were held today with senior provincial health officials. The WHO\nteam also listened to reports about the SARS outbreak, and held initial\nmeetings with health workers at all levels. These workers, who have\nfirst-hand knowledge of the outbreak, include epidemiologists and\nclinicians treating SARS patients. Discussion focused on patterns of\ntransmission, clinical profiles, and the suspected causative agent.\nChinese authorities had previously reported a cumulative total of 1153\ncases and 40 deaths in Guangdong Province from 16 Nov 2002, when the\noutbreak began, to the end of March [2003], making this province the area\nmost seriously affected by SARS to date.\nThe world's first recognized case of SARS occurred in Guangdong Province on\n16 Nov 2002. Expectations are high that important clues will emerge\nconcerning the origins of SARS, which is thought to be caused by a new\nvirus in the coronavirus family. The exact identity of the virus has proved\nelusive. Scientists, who confer daily in teleconferences organized by WHO,\ncurrently speculate that the SARS virus either jumped to humans from an\nanimal species or mutated into a more virulent form.\nIn its continuing work, the WHO team is expected to visit Foshan city,\nwhere the first case of SARS was reported, and Guangzhou city. The team\nwill also visit health care facilities, review case records, and hold\nfurther discussions before returning to Beijing early next week.\nIn Beijing, the government of China is now gearing up to fight SARS on a\npriority basis. Reports in today's media referred to a State Council\nexecutive meeting on SARS and described 3 key decisions.\nA special task force, headed by Minister of Health Dr Zhang Wenkang, will\ntake charge of the fight against SARS. A vice secretary-general of the\nState Council will coordinate actions by relevant ministries. The task\nforce will provide updates on SARS to WHO. A nationwide mechanism for\noutbreak alert and response will be set up shortly to ensure rapid\ndetection and reporting of outbreaks. Dr Zhang appeared on Chinese\nnational TV to address SARS-related issues.\nSituation in Hong Kong SAR\n-----------------------\nThe Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR reported 26 new cases today [3\nApr 2003], compared with 23 yesterday [2 Apr 2003]. These figures represent\na significant decline from the 155 cases reported on Tuesday [1 Apr 2003]\nand 60 reported on Monday [31 Mar 2003]. This trend suggests that the\nextraordinary control measures undertaken by the government are working.\nThe Department of Health further announced that 89 SARS patients have been\ndischarged from hospitals.\nUpdate on cases and countries\n------------------------\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2270 SARS cases and 79 deaths have been\nreported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 47 cases and 1\ndeath (in Hong Kong) compared with yesterday.\nWith the addition of the first probable case in Brazil, SARS is now being\nreported on 4 continents.\nNew cases were reported in Canada (4), Hong Kong (26), Taiwan, China (1),\nFrance (2), Singapore (3), the United States of America (13), and Viet Nam\n(1).

The current number of probable cases by reported symptom\nonset date and type of exposure is also provided [see Figure 1- Number of\nprobable cases of SARS in Canada by symptom onset date and exposure type\nfrom: 23 Feb2003 to 2 Apr 2003 on website:\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/eu-ae/sars20030402_e.html>].\nPreliminary Epidemiologic Findings\n--------------------------------\nTransmission: To date, all probable cases of SARS have been linked to either\ntravel-related exposures, or in healthcare or household settings (Figure\n1 -- see website). Thus, based on the current data available, there is no\nevidence to suggest disease transmission in the general community.\nClinical Manifestations: A summary of the clinical presentation of SARS\nbased on the first 10 cases identified in Canada has recently been\npublished (source: New England Journal of Medicine,\n<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/NEJMoa030634v1.pdf>). Listed in order\nof observed frequency are fever (10/10), nonproductive cough (10/10),\nshortness of breath (8/10), malaise (7/10), diarrhea (5/10), chest pain\n(3/10), headache (3/10), sore throat (3/10), myalgias (2/10), and vomitting\n(1/10). Lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, elevated\naspartate amino-transferase levels and elevated creatinine kinase levels\nwere also reported.

A total of 44 probable cases with SARS have been\nreported in Ontario and British Columbia, including 4 deaths (Table 1). The\nnumber of probable cases by symptom onset date and type of exposure is also\nshown (Figure 1). One individual previously classified as a probable case\nin Manitoba is no longer being considered for SARS since a specific etiology\nhas been identified.\nRecent Ontario Epidemiologic Findings\n--------------------------------\nThe Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care has reported a total of\n42 probable cases of SARS. Of these, most remain hospitalised for isolation\npurposes while six are in intensive care. Using the information currently\navailable, the average age of probable cases is 46.3 years (n=35, range 17\nto 82 years), with 24 known females and 17 known males. The majority of\nthose with severe illness or deaths have occurred in elderly patients with\nunderlying illness.\nWhile it is difficult to accurately determine the incubation period of the\netiologic agent, given the fact that many of the probable cases in Ontario\nmay have multiple exposures, the current estimated mean incubation period\nis 4 days (estimated range 2 to 10 days).\nIt is believed that 4 generations of transmission have occurred. The index\ncase in Ontario was an individual who travelled to Hong Kong and stayed at\nthe Metropole Hotel, where a cluster of SARS cases has since been reported.\nUpon return to Canada, disease transmission occurred in 4 members of the\nimmediate and extended family. A physician who had close contact with\nmembers of this family was also diagnosed with SARS. Following this, cases\nwere reported in individuals in a hospital setting where some of the first\ncases were treated. Most recently, SARS has been reported in a few of the\nhousehold contacts of these hospital-associated cases. An isolated case in\nOntario was reported in an individual who had travelled to Asia, but did\nnot stay in at the Metropole Hotel.\nBased on the most recent epidemiologic investigations, nearly all of the\nprobable cases of SARS that occurred in individuals outside of the initial\nfamily cluster have been linked to exposure to the first hospitalised case\nof SARS, on 7 Mar 2003. It is believed that disease transmission occurred\nmainly as a result of person-to-person contact. The initial\nhospital-associated cases are believed to have contracted the illness as a\nresult of unprotected contact with the initial cases prior to the\nrecognition of SARS. Subsequent transmission is thought to have occurred\nbetween households of these hospital-associated cases, and between other\nhealthcare workers. To date, there has been no evidence of transmission in\nthe general community.\nOther Reports\n--------------\nA Canadian with SARS [not counted in the official Canadian case count], who\nis currently hospitalised in Hong Kong, stayed at the Metropole Hotel. The\nfirst identified probable case of SARS in British Columbia also stayed at\nthis hotel. The second probable case reported by BC today did not stay at\nthe hotel but was exposed to a SARS case while in Hong Kong. Both\nindividuals are currently in isolation and no community transmission has\noccurred in this province.\nOntario has declared a provincial emergency and SARS is now a reportable\ndiseases under Ontario's Health Protection and Promotion Act. The province\nhas introduced a number of public measures in an effort to contain the\nspread of SARS. Key public health measures include extensive contact\ntracing of persons who may have come in contact with SARS cases, isolation\nof suspect and probable cases, and voluntary home quarantine for\nasymptomatic contacts. Isolation wards have been established at hospitals\nand health care staff are required to observe full airborne and contact\nprecautions. Health care staff across the province are now alerted to SARS\nand have implemented infection control practices to protect themselves and\ntheir patients in an effort to prevent any further infection.\nHealth Canada is supporting Ontario in its SARS response efforts by\nproviding epidemiologic and infection control expertise, as well as\nemergency supplies as needed. Health Canada in collaboration with the\nProvinces and Territories has implemented enhanced surveillance for the\ndetection of SARS cases, alerted laboratories and initiated special\nlaboratory investigations in an effort to identify the cause of SARS. In\naddition, Health Canada is working quickly to implement a screening\nprotocol for international travellers in response to the WHO\nrecommendations to prevent travel-related spread of SARS. Due to recent\nconcerns regarding the possibility of transmission of SARS aboard aircraft,\nHealth Canada has also recommended follow-up of all passengers on flights\nwhere a suspect or probable SARS case is identified.

The majority of cases are\nreported from Guangdong Province and Hong Kong SAR China, Singapore and\nHanoi, Vietnam with Hong Kong presently showing the greatest increase in\ncases. Cases of SARS in other parts of the world have occurred in persons\nor close contacts of persons who have travelled to these destinations. As\nof 30 Mar 2003, 51 deaths have been reported outside of Canada, the\nmajority (34) of which were reported in Guangdong Province of China. The\ntotal number of cases and deaths in Guangdong was only recently reported in\nthe WHO cumulative international total.\nAs of 25 Mar 2003, a cluster of 13 persons with suspected or probable SARS\nare known to have stayed at the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong. These cases\nsubsequently became index cases in several countries, including Vietnam,\nSingapore, the United States, Ireland, and Canada (MMWR Vol 52, No. 12,\nMarch 28, 2003). The visitor from mainland China, a medical doctor from\nGuangdong Province who became ill a week before staying at the hotel, is\nconsidered to be the original source of the infection. No further cases\nhave been linked to the hotel.\nThe majority of cases have occurred in people who have had very close\ncontact with other cases including household contacts and health care\nworkers.\n[B] Update 16 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 31 Mar 2003 8:00 PM\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2003/2003_11update16.htm\n>\nAs of 31 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately129\nprobable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in\nOntario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and New Brunswick. There\nhave been 4 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons\nwho have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household\nor in a health-care setting. The information contained in this update is\nbased on the best available information Health Canada has at this time.\nHealth Canada is changing the way it is reporting probable and suspect\ncases of SARS to ensure consistency in reporting across the country.\n'Probable' cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often they have\na more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty\nbreathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays show signs of atypical pneumonia.\nA 'suspect' case of SARS is a person who fits into one of the following two\ncategories: a person who develops fever and one or more respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,\nwithin 10 days of returning from travel to areas in Asia where SARS cases\nare being reported, or a person who develops fever and one or more\nrespiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty\nbreathing, within 10 days of having had close contact with a 'probable'\ncase of SARS (i.e. within one metre).\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n-----------------------------------\nOntario is reporting 51 probable and 58 suspect cases. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 2 probable and 11 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting one suspect case.\nSaskatchewan is reporting one suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nHere are the most recent developments:\n-------------------------\nDue to the mounting concern about transmission of the SARS agent in\nnon-hospital and community settings in the City of Hanoi, Vietnam; the\nPeople's Republic of China including the Hong Kong SAR; Singapore; and\nTaiwan, Health Canada recommends that persons planning to travel to these\nareas should defer all travel until further notice. Health Canada also\nrecommends alternate routing be considered, when possible, if a traveller\nis transiting through the People's Republic of China including the Hong\nKong Special Administrative; City of Hanoi, Vietnam; Singapore; or Taiwan.\nHealth Canada is aware that health authorities in these affected areas are\nmaking concerted efforts to contain the spread of SARS in their\npopulations. Given the uncertainties of the current situation, Health\nCanada believes it is prudent to await the outcome of national and\ninternational control measures before undertaking travel to these\ndestinations.\nFor further information on this travel advisory, please see:\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/tmp-pmv/2003/sars0329_e.html>\nEffective 1 Apr 2003, Health Canada will launch an initiative to inform all\ndeparting passengers from the Pearson International Airport about symptoms\nand contact with persons with SARS through the Health Alert Notice (cherry\ncards).\nFor more information on this initiative, please see: 'SARS Screening of\nTravellers To and From Canada'\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2003/2003_11factsheet1.h\ntm>\nOn 31 Mar 2003, Health Canada sent 2 mobile x-ray machines and processors\nto Toronto for 2 isolation units that are being set up in non-hospital\nfacilities.\nOn 29 Mar 2003, Health Canada deployed 2 additional staff to assist Toronto\nPublic Health and the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation of\nSARS cases.

(albeit in the 30 Mar 2003 SARS - Worldwide (20):cases update,\nthe Health Canada website discussed 98 cases of suspected and probable\ncases of SARS, representing an increase of approximately 31 cases). All Canadian cases have occurred in persons\nwho have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household\nor in a health-care setting. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting. Following this, cases\nwere reported in individuals in a hospital setting where some of the first\ncases were treated. As of 31 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately129\nprobable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in\nOntario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and New Brunswick. On 29 Mar 2003, Health Canada deployed 2 additional staff to assist Toronto\nPublic Health and the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation of\nSARS cases. Using the information currently\navailable, the average age of probable cases is 46.3 years (n=35, range 17\nto 82 years), with 24 known females and 17 known males. The\nnumber of probable cases by symptom onset date and type of exposure is also\nshown (Figure 1).

The isolation order requires residents of Block E of Amoy\nGarden to remain in their flats until midnight on 9 Apr 2003.\nThe decision to issue the isolation order was made following a continued\nsteep rise in the number of SARS cases detected in the building over the\npast few days. Concern about a possible outbreak in Amoy Garden mounted on\nSaturday [29 Mar 2003], when 22 of Hong Kong's 45 new SAR cases\nhospitalized that day were determined to be residents of the estate. On\nSunday [30 Mar 2003], 36 of the 60 new patients admitted to hospital with\nprobable SARS were Amoy Garden residents.\nHong Kong health authorities today informed the public that a cumulative\ntotal of 213 residents of Amoy Garden had been admitted to hospital with\nsuspected SARS since reporting on the disease began. Hong Kong's outbreak\nbegan on 12 Mar 2003 when health officials first recognized a cluster of\ncases of atypical pneumonia in the Prince of Wales Hospital.\nOf the 213 Amoy residents affected in the outbreak, 107 patients resided in\nBlock E. In addition, most of these 107 patients from Block E lived in flats\nthat were vertically arranged. This suggests that SARS may be spreading in\nHong Kong according to a different pattern, still involving close\nperson-to-person contact with bodily secretions from an infected person. WHO\nepidemiologists are considering the possibility that bodily secretions\ncontaining the causative virus might somehow enter common systems that link\nrooms or flats together. This pattern of spread would be in addition to the\nwell-documented\nface-to-face contact that has been seen in the majority of cases reported so\nfar.\nEarlier this month, Hong Kong epidemiologists detected an unusual pattern\nof transmission among guests and visitors at the Metropole Hotel during the\ncritical period of 15 to 23 Feb 2003. Guests and visitors at a single floor\nof the hotel are thought to have spread SARS to Toronto and Singapore and\nto have started the outbreak in Hong Kong's Prince of Wales Hospital. No\nstaff at the hotel developed symptoms.\nAmoy Garden is a large housing estate consisting of 10 blocks of 35-storey\nbuildings, where around 15 000 persons reside. It is located in Kowloon\nDistrict. WHO has been informed that environmental samples have been taken\nfrom the affected flats in Block E and that investigations are under way to\ndetermine a possible explanation for this apparent vertical spread of the\ndisease. Although the investigation is complex, results from testing of the\nenvironmental samples should be available within days and will help\ndetermine the source of infection in Block E and the mechanisms by which the\npathogen has spread.\nHong Kong epidemiologists have identified a possible 'index' case in the\nAmoy Garden outbreak. This is a patient, now hospitalized in Prince of\nWales Hospital, who visited his brother, a resident of Block E, several\ntimes before hospital admission.\nMainland China\n---------------\nThe WHO expert team spent the day in the Beijing Municipality Center for\nDisease Control and Prevention reviewing case records for all 10 cases\nreported in Beijing Municipality. Following the cases in Guangdong province\nin late January [2003] and early February 2003, Beijing Municipality CDC\nofficials said an enhanced local surveillance system was established by\nadding 11 sentinel hospitals (out of 50 total hospitals) to report cases of\natypical pneumonia.\nThe laboratory service was also geared up to receive specimens and carry\nout tests in secure conditions. Other preparation included stockpiling of\ndrugs, setting up a public hotline, and holding 2 news conferences. In\naddition, CDC and hospital staff were trained in prompt reporting of\natypical pneumonia and infection control. An isolation unit was\nestablished. CDC Beijing said that antibiotics and Ribovirin are being used\nroutinely as treatment and prophylaxis.\nThe team were told that contact tracing had begun as soon as the first\ncases of atypical pneumonia had been recognized in Beijing and had been\ncarried out for all subsequent cases. 8 of the cases were imported (from\nHong Kong and Taiyuan city, Shanxi province) and 2 were health care workers\nwho became infected trying to revive a 72-year-old man believed to have\nbecome ill after visiting a relative with SARS in a Hong Kong hospital.\nBesides the 2 health care workers, no other cases have been infected in\nBeijing.\nDiscussions concerning a visit by the expert team to Guangdong Province are\ncontinuing with the Ministry of Health.\nUpdate on cases and countries:\n--------------------------\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 1622 cases, with 58 deaths, have been\nreported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 72 cases and 4\ndeaths since the last figures were compiled on Saturday [29 Mar 2003].\nThe greatest increase in cases occurred in Hong Kong SAR. The additional\ndeaths were reported in Canada (1) and Hong Kong (3).

The patient had travelled to\nSarawak with her family from 15 Mar 2003 to 18 Mar 2003 and had developed\nfever when she returned to Singapore on 18 Mar 2003.\nShe presented at NUH Emergency Department on 24 Mar 2003 with features of\npneumonia. At that time, the medical staff were unable to obtain from the\nrelatives a history of contact with a patient with SARS and she had also\nnot travelled to an affected areas. She was too unwell to be transferred to\nTTSH. Nevertheless, in line with MOH guidelines, she was treated as a\npotentially infectious patient and was warded in an isolation room. NUH\nstaff took all the necessary infection control precautions after her\nadmission, and the patient was isolated throughout her admission. She was\nalso not allowed any visitors. She was transferred to the ICU on 24 Mar\n2003, where she was received intensive treatment under isolation.\nOn 30 Mar 2003, one of her relatives gave the history that the NUH patient\nhad visited a non-SARS patient in a ward in TTSH on 12 Mar 2003. A patient\nin this ward was later found to have SARS. As the NUH patient herself was\nvery sick, it was not possible to ascertain who she had come into contact\nwith. Despite intensive treatment, her condition worsened and she passed\naway today. As a precautionary measure, this patient is being considered as\na case of SARS. Contact tracing is being carried out.\nApart from this case, there were no new cases of SARS reported. As at 31\nMar 2003, a total of 92 people with SARS have been reported to the Ministry\nof Health. The total number of people who have recovered from SARS and have\nbeen discharged from hospital is 41. The remaining 47 patients are\nhospitalised.\nTo date, there have been no SARS cases that are linked to the fourth and\nfifth imported cases. The cases in Singapore are still traced to the first\n3 people who travelled to Hong Kong and contracted SARS. The number of\ninfected children still remains at 3. There is no change in the number of\npersons on the suspect list.\nThere are 13 patients who are in serious condition, including the fourth\nimported case.\nCase of death on board the cargo ship, Kota Hasil from Hong Kong\n---------------------------------------------------\nMOH was notified of a case of an Indonesian crewman who developed high\nfever on 23 Mar 2003 while on board a cargo ship sailing between Taiwan and\nHong Kong, and who passed away on 28 Mar 203 while the ship was enroute to\nSingapore.

On Monday, the colleagues\nin Frankfurt found seroconversion in an immunofluorescence test on these\nsame cells using serum of the index patient after defeverescence.\n\nThe virus was detected in the supernatant by a random amplification\napproach. 15 different pairs of primers directed to various parts of\nviruses other than coronaviruses were used in a low stringency RT-PCR. The\nrandom PCR products were sequenced, and 2 of the obtained sequences matched\nat the protein level to known coronavirus sequences deposited in GenBank.\nBoth sequences (90 and 300 nucleotides in length) are located in the\npolymerase gene but do not overlap with the sequence reported by CDC on 24\nMon 2003. Phylogenetic analysis of the larger fragment suggests that the\nnovel virus is not related closely to any of the known phylogenetic\nlineages of coronaviruses (groups 1, 2, and 3). The sequence diverges by\n50-60 percent from known coronavirus sequences and segregates\nphylogenetically between bovine coronavirus (group 2) and avian infectious\nbronchitis virus (group 3). Using primers specifically targeting the\nsequence reported by CDC, coronavirus sequences were also found in clinical\nspecimens of the Frankfurt index patient. The sequence of this PCR fragment\nmatched exactly the sequence reported by CDC, indicating an epidemiological\nlink between the patient in Frankfurt (who came from Singapore) and the\npatient(s) from whom the CDC sequence originates.\n\nWe are now setting up molecular diagnostic tests (RT-PCR, real-time\nRT-PCR).

The previous CDC\ntravel advisory was for only Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, People's\nRepublic of China and Hanoi, Vietnam.\n\nCDC advises that people planning elective or non-essential travel to\nmainland China and Hong Kong; Singapore; and Hanoi, Vietnam may wish to\npostpone their trips until further notice. CDC has been working closely\nwith the World Health Organization (WHO) to investigate cases of SARS. At\nthis time CDC is not advising against travel to or from Canada because\nthere is not evidence of widespread community transmission.\n\nCDC officials are meeting planes, cargo ships and cruise ships coming\neither directly or indirectly to the United States from China, Singapore\nand Vietnam and distributing health alert cards\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/travel_alert.htm>) to disembarking\npassengers. In addition officials are assessing passengers returning from\nthose areas for symptoms of SARS.\n\nCDC is also issuing guidance for patients with suspected SARS designed to\nprevent transmission of the illness to their family members and other close\ncontacts. Health care officials are not certain how long a patient with\nSARS may be contagious to people with whom they have close contact.\n\nCDC recommends the following infection control measures for suspected\npatients with SARS in household or other residential settings:\n\nInfection control precautions should be continued for SARS patients for 10\ndays after respiratory symptoms and fever are gone. SARS patients should\nlimit interactions outside the home and should not go to work, school,\nout-of-home day care, or other public areas during the 10 day period;\n\nDuring this 10 day period, all members of the household with a SARS patient\nshould carefully follow recommendations for hand hygiene, such as frequent\nhand washing or the use of alcohol-based rubs;\n\nEach patient with SARS should cover his or her mouth and nose with a tissue\nbefore sneezing or coughing. If possible, a person recovering from SARS\nshould wear a surgical mask during close contact with uninfected persons.\nIf the patient is unable to wear a surgical mask, other persons in the home\nshould wear masks when in close contact with the patient;\n\nDisposable gloves should be considered for any contact with body fluids\nfrom a SARS patient. However, immediately after activities involving\ncontact with body fluids, gloves should be removed and discarded and hands\nshould be washed. Gloves should not be reused, and are not intended to\nreplace proper hand hygiene.\n\nSARS patients should avoid sharing eating utensils, towels and bedding with\nother members of the household, although these items can be used by others\nafter routine cleaning such as washing or laundering with soap and hot water;\n\nOther members of the household need not restrict their outside activities\nunless they develop symptoms of SARS such as a fever or respiratory illness.\n\n[B] Excerpts from Update Telebriefing Conference 29 Mar 2003\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030329.htm>\n\nWe continue to regard the new coronavirus as the leading hypothesis for the\netiology of this condition. The evidence is mounting from a number of\ninternational laboratories, that this is indeed the case; but we are also\nexploring other potential viruses as are our collaborators. A number of\nthings are in progress, including sequencing of the whole virus genome.\n\nWe recognize that the disease is still primarily limited to travelers, to\nhealth care personnel who have taken care of SARS patients, and to close\ncontact with SARS patients. The affected travelers are those who have been\nin Hong Kong, in Hanoi, in Singapore, and in mainland China, for the most part.\n\nWe believe, based on the investigations so far, that the major mode of\ntransmission is through droplet spread when an infected person coughs or\nsneezes and droplets are spread to a nearby contact. But we are concerned\nabout the possibility of airborne transmission across broader areas and\nalso the possibility that objects that become contaminated in the\nenvironment could serve as modes of spread. Coronaviruses can survive in\nthe environment for up to 2 or 3 hours ,and so it's possible that a\ncontaminated object could serve as a vehicle for transfer to someone else.\n\nFor the people who are living in the household with the SARS patients, and\nwho are otherwise well, there is no reason to limit activities at this\npoint in time. The experience in the United States has not demonstrated\nspread of SARS from household contacts into the community and so we are not\nadvising any restrictions on the activity of contacts at this point in\ntime. However, it's very important that contacts with SARS patients be\nalert to the earliest symptom of a respiratory illness. If they have any\nsymptoms suggestive of an impending illness, they should contact a medical\nprovider, alert them that they are a SARS contact, so that the health care\nsystem can advise them where to come and get evaluation, and prepare the\ndelivery system to implement the appropriate infection control precautions\nso that others are not exposed in the health care setting.\n\nWe also are updating our guidance to travelers. The travelers at risk for\nSARS are those who have been in mainland China, in Hong Kong, in Hanoi and\nin Singapore. These travel alerts do not include passengers coming in from\nCanada. The epidemiology of the SARS in Canada is very different and there\nis not a risk from incoming travelers at this point in time. WHO is not\nissuing any travel restrictions. We are not issuing any travel restrictions\neither, but WHO has also implemented procedures for screening passengers\nbefore they leave the country of SARS origin.\n\nOf the 62 cases under investigation [in the USA], 2 of those cases are in\nhealth care workers and there have been no further signs of spread in that\nparticular cluster. 5 cases have been in household contact and the rest of\nthe cases have all been in travelers coming in from SARS areas. We are not\nexperiencing any sign of community transmission at this point in time.\n\nIn response to a question related to Hong Kong health officials reporting\nsuspect cases from an apartment complex: Information from Hong Kong does\nsuggest that in at least one apartment complex there has been spread. [It\nhasn't been identified as yet] to what extent the individuals in that\napartment have had face to face contact with each other, to what extent\nthey might have contacted contaminated environments in that facility or to\nwhat extent airborne transmission could play a role.\n\nIn response to a question on other modes of transmission and guidance for\nairlines: Preliminary guidance on appropriate means for disinfection of\ncommercial aircraft as well as very specific and more focused guidance for\ndisinfection of an aircraft that might be used in a medical evacuation of a\nhigh-risk or critically-ill patient [have been issued].\n\nIn response to a question re: treatment guidelines: [There is] no evidence\nright now, that any specific anti-viral therapy, or steroid treatment, or\nother agents that are targeting this virus, are of any benefit to patients.\n\nIn response to questions re: concern about community spread in the USA: We\nrecognize that there are at least some patients with SARS that are\nextremely efficient transmitters. For example, in Hanoi where there was one\npatient who was a source for health care worker transmission and\napproximately 56 percent of the health care [workers] who had direct\ncontact with the patient appeared to have acquired SARS.\n\nIn response to a question on evidence of coronavirus as the etiology:\nFirst, we have isolated the coronavirus from 2 patients, here, in the USA\nand elsewhere additional isolations are reported. We are using PCR or\npolymerase chain reaction technology to identify very specific pieces of\nthe coronavirus in the secretions and fluids from many of the case\npatients. We have developed an antibody assay which detects antibodies to\nthis new coronavirus with a high degree of specificity, some of the\npatients who have negative antibody tests at the beginning of their\nillness, subsequently, in paired serum have demonstrated development of\nantibody within days after their infection occurred. They are developing an\nimmunologic reaction to this new coronavirus, strong evidence of infection.\n\nWe now have 2 antibody tests that look quite promising and seem to be\nreproducible in different laboratories, and we're working to transfer\ndiagnostic testing capacity to public health laboratories around the\ncountry, so that before too long, tests will be available much more locally.\n\nLaboratories in at least 7 other countries now have evidence for coronavirus.\n\nIn response to a question on the period of infectivity of cases: One of the\nimportant studies going on is to look at passengers who traveled in\nairplanes with SARS patients, we have 3 separate cohorts of passengers who\ntraveled on the same plane with someone we knew was incubating SARS or had\nSARS during their travel experience. So far, those studies have not\nidentified evidence of transmission before people become sick but the\nnumbers are small and we can't draw any conclusions at this point in time.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\n\nDate: 29 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada - SARS website 29 Mar 2003 [edited]\n\n\nUpdate 14 - SARS 29 Mar 2003 5:00 PM\n\nAs of 29 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 37 cases of severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Ontario, British Columbia and\nManitoba.

The information\ncontained in this update is based on the best available information Health\nCanada has at this time.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario: 35 total cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have\ntraveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a\nhealth-care setting.\n\nBritish Columbia: one person has been hospitalized with SARS after\nreturning from travel in southeast Asia.\n\nManitoba: one person has been hospitalized with SARS after returning from\ntravel in southeast Asia.\n\nDue to the mounting concern about transmission of the SARS agent in\nnon-hospital and community settings in the City of Hanoi, Vietnam; the\nPeople's Republic of China including the Hong Kong SAR; and Singapore,\nHealth Canada recommends that persons planning to travel to these areas\nshould defer all travel until further notice. Health Canada also recommends\nalternate routing be considered, when possible, if a traveller is\ntransiting through the People's Republic of China including the Hong Kong\nSAR; City of Hanoi, Vietnam; or Singapore. Health Canada is aware that\nhealth authorities in these affected areas are making concerted efforts to\ncontain the spread of SARS in their populations. Given the uncertainties of\nthe current situation, Health Canada believes it is prudent to await the\noutcome of national and international control measures before undertaking\ntravel to these destinations.\n\nOn 29 Mar 2003, Health Canada deployed 2 additional staff to assist Toronto\nPublic Health and the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation of\nSARS cases.

The measures proposed by WHO on the screening of passengers presenting for\ninternational travel are under active consideration by Health\nCanada. In response to questions re: concern about community spread in the USA: We\nrecognize that there are at least some patients with SARS that are\nextremely efficient transmitters. So far, those studies have not\nidentified evidence of transmission before people become sick but the\nnumbers are small and we can't draw any conclusions at this point in time. At\nthis time CDC is not advising against travel to or from Canada because\nthere is not evidence of widespread community transmission. SARS - WORLDWIDE (18): CASES\n****************************\n She arrived back in\nSingapore on Southern China Airlines CZ 355 at Terminal 1, Changi Airport\non 26 Mar 2003 at 5.38 AM. The information\ncontained in this update is based on the best available information Health\nCanada has at this time. We are not issuing any travel restrictions\neither, but WHO has also implemented procedures for screening passengers\nbefore they leave the country of SARS origin. The evidence is mounting from a number of\ninternational laboratories, that this is indeed the case; but we are also\nexploring other potential viruses as are our collaborators. Coronaviruses can survive in\nthe environment for up to 2 or 3 hours ,and so it's possible that a\ncontaminated object could serve as a vehicle for transfer to someone else. However, immediately after activities involving\ncontact with body fluids, gloves should be removed and discarded and hands\nshould be washed. \nDr. Urbani, worked in public health programs in Cambodia, Laos and Viet\nNam. The previous CDC\ntravel advisory was for only Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, People's\nRepublic of China and Hanoi, Vietnam. and so we are not\nadvising any restrictions on the activity of contacts at this point in\ntime.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "malaria", "sars"], "syndromes": ["acute respiratory syndrome"], "event_date": ["2003-02-25 00:00:00", "2046-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-26 00:00:00", "1550-03-25 00:00:00", "2003-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2002-11-16 00:00:00", "2002-11-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Guangdong Province", "country": "China"}, {"location": "British Columbia", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "Prince", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Ontario", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "Toronto", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "Hong Kong - DOH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "none", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Guangdong", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Thailand", "country": "Thailand"}, {"location": "Singapore", "country": "Singapore"}, {"location": "Laos", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "France"}, {"location": "Shanxi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}, {"location": "the United States of America", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hong \n Kong", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cambodia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "thailand", "country": "Thailand"}, {"location": "the Hong Kong SAR", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Vietnam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the City of Hanoi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "Hong Kong"}, {"location": "Hanoi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Manitoba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the Hong Kong", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "switzerland", "country": "Switzerland"}, {"location": "Italy", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the People 's Republic of China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taiwan", "country": "Taiwan"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2203548", "headline": "PRO/ERR> SARS - worldwide (12): correction Shanxi not Shanghai", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2203548", "date": "2003-03-27 23:50:00", "main_text": "SARS - WORLDWIDE (12):CORRECTION SHANXI NOT SHANGHAI\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\nDate: Thu, 27 Mar 2003 12:00:20 -0500\nFrom: 'Dan Silver' <daniel.silver6@verizon.net>\nSubject: Shanxi vs. Shanghai\n\nWith regard to your 26 Mar 2003 newswire coverage of SARS, [SARS -\nworldwide (11): cases 20030326.0753] you have incorrectly stated that\nShanxi is Shanghai.

This report\nincludes summaries of the epidemiologic investigations and public health\nresponses in several affected locations where CDC is collaborating with\ninternational and national health authorities. This report also describes\nan unusual cluster of cases associated with a hotel in Hong Kong and\nidentifies the potential etiologic agent of SARS. Epidemiologic and\nlaboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.\nAs of 26 Mar 2003, a total of 1323 suspected and/or probable SARS cases\nhave been reported to WHO from 14 locations (2), using the WHO case\ndefinition or country-specific variations* (3). These reported SARS cases\ninclude 49 deaths (case-fatality proportion: 4 percent). The Chinese\nauthorities have reported 792 suspected/probable cases, including 31\ndeaths, which occurred in Guangdong province during 16 Nov 2002 - 28 Feb 2003.\nCDC is assisting in epidemiologic investigations of cases in Hong Kong,\nVietnam, Taiwan, and Thailand. CDC also is conducting surveillance and\nprevention activities in the United States.\nHong Kong: As of 25 Mar 2003, the Hong Kong Department of Health (DH)\nreported 290 suspected and probable SARS cases. Beginning on 11 Mar 2003,\nan increase in acute pneumonia cases among health-care workers (HCWs) at\nhospital 1 in Hong Kong was reported to DH. Epidemiologic investigation has\nlinked these cases to an index patient (Patient J) who visited a friend in\nhotel M in late February 2003, became ill a few days later, and was\nadmitted to hospital 1 on 4 Mar 2003 [see Figure 1 at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5212a1.htm#tab> an excellent\ndiagrammatic presentation of the outbreak associated with contact at hotel\nM - Mod.MPP]. Patient J visited hotel M while patient A, an ill visitor\nfrom Guangdong province, was staying there.\nAs of 25 Mar 2003, a cluster of 13 persons with suspected/probable SARS are\nknown to have stayed at hotel M (Figure 1). The index patient (patient A)\nhad onset of symptoms on 15 Feb 2003. He traveled from Guangdong province\nto Hong Kong to visit family and stayed on the ninth floor of the hotel on\n21 Feb 2003. He was admitted to hospital 2 on 22 Feb 2003 and died the next\nday. 4 HCWs and 2 of his family members subsequently became ill; one family\nmember died. Of the 12 other patients linked to hotel M, 10 were in the\nhotel the same day as the index patient; the other 2 patients (patients L\nand M) stayed in the hotel during the time that 3 other symptomatic\npatients were guests in the hotel. 9 of the 13 patients, including patient\nA, stayed on the ninth floor; one stayed on the 14th floor; one stayed on\nthe 11th floor; and 2 stayed on both the ninth and 14th floors.\nEpidemiologic investigations have identified patients from this cluster as\nindex patients in subsequent clusters in Hong Kong and other areas. Patient\nB is the index patient for the outbreak in Hanoi involving 59 HCWs and\nclose contacts and also is linked to one case in Thailand. Patients C, D,\nand E are associated with 70 cases in Singapore and 3 cases in Germany.\nPatient F is linked with a cluster of 16 other cases in Toronto (4).\nPatients H and J are linked with outbreaks among HCWs in other hospitals in\nHong Kong. Patient L appears to have become infected during his stay at\nhotel M, with subsequent transmission to his wife, patient M.\nAs of 25 Mar 2003, 6 hospitals and one clinic in Hong Kong have reported\nnosocomial transmission to HCWs following admission of persons with SARS.\nThe suspected index patients of 3 of the 7 nosocomial clusters reported in\nHong Kong have been associated with hotel M (Figure 1).\nHong Kong health authorities have implemented enhanced infection-control\nprocedures in all hospitals in Hong Kong, including more stringent barrier\nand respiratory protection for HCWs, at least daily environmental\ndisinfection of affected wards, and cohorting of SARS patients. New cases\namong HCWs have declined following implementation of these new guidelines.\nHowever, new cases continue to be reported, predominantly among close\ncontacts\u0086 of known patients.\nVietnam: As of 24 Mar 2003, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health in Hanoi has\nreported 59 probable SARS cases. The probable index patient (patient B) was\nan Asian-American businessman aged 47 years who had visited Hong Kong\nbefore traveling to Hanoi. During his visit to Hong Kong, he had stayed at\nhotel M on the same floor, and during the same time, as patient A. Patient\nB became ill after arrival in Hanoi on 23 Feb 2003 and was hospitalized\nwith lower respiratory symptoms on 26 Feb 2003. On 2 Mar 2003, he was\nplaced on mechanical ventilation. On 5 Mar 2003, he was medically evacuated\nto a hospital in Hong Kong and died on 12 Mar 2003. By 5 Mar 2003,\nsecondary probable SARS cases were identified among HCWs in Hanoi. All\nprobable SARS cases reported as of 24 Mar 2003 in Hanoi have been linked\nthrough primary or secondary exposure to the same hospital. 2 patients who\nwere exposed to hospitalized SARS patients traveled subsequently to\nThailand and France and are not included in these numbers.\nThe government of Vietnam has implemented control activities in Hanoi and\nthroughout the country, including daily follow-up of contacts of probable\nSARS cases and community surveillance for suspected SARS cases.\nInfection-control practices to prevent nosocomial transmission have been\nimplemented at Hanoi hospitals with probable SARS cases. Nosocomial cases\nhave decreased since the initial peak of cases linked to exposure to the\nindex patient.\nThailand: As of 23 Mar 2003, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has\nreported 4 suspected/probable cases. Dates of illness onset ranged from 11\nto 18 Mar 2003. Of these 4 ill persons, 3 reported travel to Hong Kong\nduring the week before illness onset; the other person is a physician who\ncared for SARS patients in Hanoi. Thailand has begun to implement hospital\ninfection control procedures on the presumption of airborne spread. Gowns,\ngloves, and N-95 masks are widely available in Thailand. As of 26 Mar 2003,\nsurveillance has not documented spread of infection to HCWs. However, one\nHCW from Thailand became infected while investigating the outbreak in Hanoi.\nTaiwan: As of 25 Mar 2003, the Taiwan Department of Health has reported 6\nprobable cases. Dates of illness onset ranged from 25 Feb 2003 to 17 Mar\n2003. Of these 6 ill persons, 4 reported travel to Guangdong province and\nHong Kong during the week before illness onset; none of them had stayed at\nhotel M. The other 2 cases occurred in family members of the first patient.\n2 patients required mechanical ventilation but have improved clinically.\nOn the basis of presumed airborne spread of SARS, Taiwan has aggressively\nimplemented and monitored strict infection-control procedures. Negative\npressure rooms and N-95 respirators are uniformly available for\nhospitalized patients. Active surveillance has not identified nosocomial\ntransmission. Epidemiologic studies are under way to determine specific\nrisk factors for transmission.\nUnited States: As of 26 Mar 2003, CDC has received 51 reports of suspected\nSARS cases from 21 states, identified using the CDC updated interim case\ndefinition. The first suspected case was identified on 15 Mar 2003, in a\nman aged 53 years who traveled to Singapore and became ill on 10 Mar 2003.\n4 clusters of suspected cases have been identified, 3 of which involved a\ntraveler who had visited Southeast Asia (including Guangdong province, Hong\nKong, or Vietnam) and a single family contact. One of these clusters\ninvolved suspected cases in patients L and M, who had stayed together at\nhotel M during 1-6 Mar 2003, when other hotel guests were symptomatic.\nPatient L became sick on 13 Mar 2003 after returning to the United States.\nHis wife, patient M, became ill several days after the onset of her\nhusband's symptoms, suggesting secondary transmission. 3 patients in the\nUnited States with suspected SARS (patients I, L, and M) reported staying\nat hotel M when other persons staying in the hotel were symptomatic. The\nfourth cluster began with a suspected case in a person who traveled in\nGuangdong province and Hong Kong. 2 HCWs subsequently became ill at the\nU.S. hospital where this patient was admitted.\nLaboratory investigations. On 24 Mar 2003, CDC announced that laboratory\nanalysis had identified a previously unrecognized coronavirus in patients\nwith suspected or probable SARS. The new coronavirus was isolated in Vero\nE6 cells from clinical specimens of 2 patients in Thailand and Hong Kong\nwith suspected SARS. The isolate was identified initially as a coronavirus\nby electron microscopy (EM). The identity was corroborated by results of\nimmunostaining, indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assays, and\nreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with sequencing of\na segment of the polymerase gene. IFA testing of sera and RT-PCR analysis\nof clinical specimens from 6 other SARS cases were positive for the new\ncoronavirus. Coronavirus particles also were identified by EM in cells\nobtained by bronchial lavage from a patient with SARS. Sequence analysis\nsuggests that this new agent is distinct from other known coronaviruses.\nOther laboratories collaborating in the WHO-led investigation have found\nsimilar results and also have isolated a different virus, human\nmetapneumovirus, from some patients with suspected SARS. Information is\ninsufficient to determine what roles these 2 viruses might play in the\netiology of SARS.\nEditorial Note:\nCases of SARS continue to be reported from around the world. These cases\nare linked primarily to areas with ongoing transmission, with some reports\nof secondary local transmission. Transmission has been reported in\nGuangdong Province, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Hanoi. In Canada,\ntransmission appears to be limited to a well-defined population of HCWs and\nclose contacts. In Taiwan, limited transmission has occurred to family\nmembers but not to HCWs. Chinese authorities have updated the number of\ncases in Guangdong province and confirmed ongoing disease activity. The\nnumbers of reported cases in Canada, Singapore, and the United States also\ncontinue to increase (2). Transmission in hospitals and households\ncontinues to occur. In addition, reports have been received of possible\ntransmission on ships and planes and in offices. On the basis of available\ninformation, country-specific efforts to limit and halt transmission have\nincluded enhancing surveillance, improving infection-control measures in\nhospitals and homes, selectively closing hospitals and schools, furloughing\nhospital staff, issuing travel advisories, restricting movement of patients\nwith suspected SARS, and establishing quarantines of exposed persons. In\nthe United States, CDC has issued travel advisories and developed\ninfection-control guidelines; efforts have been focused on rapid\nidentification and early isolation of symptomatic persons whose illnesses\nmeet the CDC case definition.\nThe summary of the demographic, clinical, and transmission patterns from\nthe reported areas documents some disparities in case-fatality proportion\nwith pneumonia, and ease of transmission. The data also highlight gaps in\nknowledge about the epidemiology of this new syndrome. Some differences\nprobably reflect concomitant differences in case definition and\nsurveillance methodologies. However, because of the nonspecific case\ndefinition, all reported cases might not represent a single clinical\nentity. Confirmation of the etiology and development of a diagnostic test\nshould help to resolve these discrepancies.\nAlthough the mechanism of SARS transmission remains unclear, on the basis\nof the reported exposures for the majority of cases (i.e., household\ncontacts and HCWs), droplet and contact transmission appear to be the\npredominant modes. The cases in the hotel M cluster and certain hospital\nclusters involving seriously ill patients suggest airborne or fomite\ntransmission. Therefore, infection-control recommendations should include\nprecautions to prevent airborne, droplet, and contact transmission. With\nthe introduction of these control measures, decreases in the reported\nincidence of SARS have been reported in Hong Kong.\nAlthough the etiologic agent has not been confirmed, laboratory data\nindicate that a metapneumovirus or a coronavirus are possible agents.\nInfection with a metapneumovirus, (i.e., enveloped, single-stranded RNA\nvirus) has been associated previously with respiratory disease with much\nless frequent occurrence of severe disease than SARS. Coronaviruses are\nenveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect both humans and animals\n(5). The known human coronaviruses can cause serious infections of the\nlower respiratory tract in children and adults and necrotizing\nenterocolitis in newborns (5,6). Coronaviruses are able to survive on\nenvironmental surfaces for up to 3 hours (6). Coronaviruses might be\ntransmitted person-to-person by droplets, hand contamination, fomites, and\nsmall-particle aerosols (7).\nClinicians evaluating suspected cases should use standard precautions\n(e.g., hand hygiene) together with airborne (e.g., N-95 respirator) and\ncontact (e.g., gowns and gloves) precautions (8). Until the mode of\ntransmission has been defined more precisely, eye protection also should be\nworn for all patient contact. As more clinical and epidemiologic\ninformation becomes available, interim recommendations will be updated.\nThe international spread of disease underscores the need for strong global\npublic health systems, robust health service infrastructures, and expertise\nthat can be mobilized quickly across national boundaries to mirror disease\nmovements. The Institute of Medicine has recently issued recommendations\nfor invigorating the response to emerging infectious diseases that reflect\nthese needs, including the development of a comprehensive system of\nsurveillance for global infectious diseases, the enhancement of disease\nreporting, the development of diagnostic tests, and the formulation and\ndistribution of guidelines on diagnosis (9).\nReferences\n1.

Findings shared by network labs\nearlier this week began pointing, with increasing consistency, to\ncoronaviruses.\n'Data from many network laboratories indicate that a coronavirus is the\nprimary cause of the disease,' said WHO virologist and epidemiologist Klaus\nStoehr. 'This virus is unlike any known human or animal member of this\nvirus family. It is consistently found in specimens from SARS patients from\nmany countries. It has been isolated in cell culture. We are very close to\nknowing for sure.'\nConclusive identification of a causative [agent] must meet all criteria in\nthe so-called 'Koch\u0092s postulate.' The additional experiments needed to\nfulfill these criteria are currently underway at a laboratory in the\nNetherlands.\nScientists at Hong Kong University had previously announced, on 21 Mar\n2003, the isolation of a new virus that was strongly suspected to be the\ncausative agent of SARS. The virus was detected in cell culture and by\nelectron microscopy. The identity of the virus was not known at the time.\nEarlier this week, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) produced strong evidence implicating a coronavirus as the\nagent that causes SARS. Many labs of the WHO network have since been using\nmolecular tests provided by CDC to confirm the presence of a coronavirus in\nspecimens from patients in various countries.\nRapid progress was also facilitated by the sharing of samples, taken from\nSARS patients in areas with large numbers of confirmed cases, among\nparticipants in the laboratory.\nHong Kong, with 367 patients, many of whom are in intensive care, and 10\ndeaths remains the most severely affected area.\nSequencing of the virus is ongoing in 4 laboratories. Results will help\nclassify the virus and refine molecular diagnostic tools. Results will also\nguide the development of specific interventions.\nAt present, no treatment beyond good intensive and supportive care has been\nconsistently shown to improve prognosis in persons with SARS.\nScientists in the network suspect that the virus will prove to be an\nentirely new, or until now undetected, member of the coronavirus family.\nProgress in the development of a diagnostic test:\nEfforts to develop a reliable and easy to use diagnostic test are also\nmoving forward quickly. Hong Kong University, Chinese University, and\nPublic Virus Labs, all located in Hong Kong and all members of the WHO\nnetwork, have devised a basic diagnostic test. In studies using confirmed\nSARS patients and healthy controls, results to date have been consistently\npositive in confirmed cases and consistently negative in the healthy\ncontrols. Further testing will begin tomorrow.\nThe Hong Kong diagnostic test is a molecular test based on the polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) technology. Hong Kong scientists have also developed a\ndiagnostic tool using the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) technique.\nValidation of the test is being facilitated by gene sequences of the PCR\nprimers electronically by laboratories collaborating in the network. The\nWHO network is offering to make these test materials immediately available\nto labs in other countries throughout the world.\nOver the next few days, samples from hundreds of confirmed and suspected\nSARS cases will be tested using these new diagnostic tools. In so doing,\nthe tools will be further refined and streamlined to upgrade their capacity\nfor daily screening of large numbers of samples.\nThe PCR test is already showing good reliability in detecting SARS cases in\nthe early days of infection. The IFA test is being used to detect infection\nin convalescent sera at about 3 weeks after infection begins.

A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n WHO defines a probable\ncase as a suspected case of illness that occurs in a person with either 1)\nchest radiograph findings of pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome\n(RDS) or 2) unexplained respiratory illness resulting in death, with\nautopsy examination demonstrating pathology of RDS but no identifiable cause. In\nthe United States, CDC has issued travel advisories and developed\ninfection-control guidelines; efforts have been focused on rapid\nidentification and early isolation of symptomatic persons whose illnesses\nmeet the CDC case definition. Of the 12 other patients linked to hotel M, 10 were in the\nhotel the same day as the index patient; the other 2 patients (patients L\nand M) stayed in the hotel during the time that 3 other symptomatic\npatients were guests in the hotel. Epidemiologic investigation has\nlinked these cases to an index patient (Patient J) who visited a friend in\nhotel M in late February 2003, became ill a few days later, and was\nadmitted to hospital 1 on 4 Mar 2003 During his visit to Hong Kong, he had stayed at\nhotel M on the same floor, and during the same time, as patient A. Patient\nB became ill after arrival in Hanoi on 23 Feb 2003 and was hospitalized\nwith lower respiratory symptoms on 26 Feb 2003. \n4 clusters of suspected cases have been identified, 3 of which involved a\ntraveler who had visited Southeast Asia (including Guangdong province, Hong\nKong, or Vietnam) and a single family contact. Although the mechanism of SARS transmission remains unclear, on the basis\nof the reported exposures for the majority of cases (i.e., household\ncontacts and HCWs), droplet and contact transmission appear to be the\npredominant modes. In studies using confirmed\nSARS patients and healthy controls, results to date have been consistently\npositive in confirmed cases and consistently negative in the healthy\ncontrols. Hong Kong health authorities have implemented enhanced infection-control\nprocedures in all hospitals in Hong Kong, including more stringent barrier\nand respiratory protection for HCWs, at least daily environmental\ndisinfection of affected wards, and cohorting of SARS patients. Together, the\n2 tests should help to quickly and safely reassure the many patients the\nworld over who are concerned about suspicious symptoms and yet may be\nsuffering from common illnesses safely treated at home. The international spread of disease underscores the need for strong global\npublic health systems, robust health service infrastructures, and expertise\nthat can be mobilized quickly across national boundaries to mirror disease\nmovements.

This report\nincludes summaries of the epidemiologic investigations and public health\nresponses in several affected locations where CDC is collaborating with\ninternational and national health authorities. Coronaviruses might be\ntransmitted person-to-person by droplets, hand contamination, fomites, and\nsmall-particle aerosols (7).\n The identity was corroborated by results of\nimmunostaining, indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assays, and\nreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with sequencing of\na segment of the polymerase gene. The additional experiments needed to\nfulfill these criteria are currently underway at a laboratory in the\nNetherlands.\n As of 26 Mar 2003, a total of 1323 suspected and/or probable SARS cases\nhave been reported to WHO from 14 locations (2), using the WHO case\ndefinition or country-specific variations* (3). One of these clusters\ninvolved suspected cases in patients L and M, who had stayed together at\nhotel M during 1-6 Mar 2003, when other hotel guests were symptomatic. The Chinese\nauthorities have reported 792 suspected/probable cases, including 31\ndeaths, which occurred in Guangdong province during 16 Nov 2002 - 28 Feb 2003. The government of Vietnam has implemented control activities in Hanoi and\nthroughout the country, including daily follow-up of contacts of probable\nSARS cases and community surveillance for suspected SARS cases. 3 patients in the\nUnited States with suspected SARS (patients I, L, and M) reported staying\nat hotel M when other persons staying in the hotel were symptomatic. Beginning on 11 Mar 2003,\nan increase in acute pneumonia cases among health-care workers (HCWs) at\nhospital 1 in Hong Kong was reported to DH. United States: As of 26 Mar 2003, CDC has received 51 reports of suspected\nSARS cases from 21 states, identified using the CDC updated interim case\ndefinition. All\nprobable SARS cases reported as of 24 Mar 2003 in Hanoi have been linked\nthrough primary or secondary exposure to the same hospital. The cases in the hotel M cluster and certain hospital\nclusters involving seriously ill patients suggest airborne or fomite\ntransmission. On 24 Mar 2003, CDC announced that laboratory\nanalysis had identified a previously unrecognized coronavirus in patients\nwith suspected or probable SARS. Nosocomial cases\nhave decreased since the initial peak of cases linked to exposure to the\nindex patient.

Of these 6 ill persons, 4 reported travel to Guangdong province and\nHong Kong during the week before illness onset; none of them had stayed at\nhotel M. Procedures of isolation and strict barrier nursing, recommended by WHO for\nthe management of suspected SARS cases, have placed a heavy burden on\nhealth care services in several affected areas. These cases\nare linked primarily to areas with ongoing transmission, with some reports\nof secondary local transmission. Rapid progress was also facilitated by the sharing of samples, taken from\nSARS patients in areas with large numbers of confirmed cases, among\nparticipants in the laboratory. On 17 Mar 2003, WHO established a global network of leading laboratories to\ncollaborate in the identification of the causative agent of severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS). Scientists at Hong Kong University had previously announced, on 21 Mar\n2003, the isolation of a new virus that was strongly suspected to be the\ncausative agent of SARS. However, because of the nonspecific case\ndefinition, all reported cases might not represent a single clinical\nentity. The\nnumbers of reported cases in Canada, Singapore, and the United States also\ncontinue to increase (2). The new coronavirus was isolated in Vero\nE6 cells from clinical specimens of 2 patients in Thailand and Hong Kong\nwith suspected SARS. He traveled from Guangdong province\nto Hong Kong to visit family and stayed on the ninth floor of the hotel on\n21 Feb 2003. The summary of the demographic, clinical, and transmission patterns from\nthe reported areas documents some disparities in case-fatality proportion\nwith pneumonia, and ease of transmission. This report also describes\nan unusual cluster of cases associated with a hotel in Hong Kong and\nidentifies the potential etiologic agent of SARS. IFA testing of sera and RT-PCR analysis\nof clinical specimens from 6 other SARS cases were positive for the new\ncoronavirus. Other laboratories collaborating in the WHO-led investigation have found\nsimilar results and also have isolated a different virus, human\nmetapneumovirus, from some patients with suspected SARS. Epidemiology, clinical presentation and laboratory\ninvestigation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada, March\n2003. 2 patients who\nwere exposed to hospitalized SARS patients traveled subsequently to\n \nEditorial Note:\nCases of SARS continue to be reported from around the world. Patient L appears to have become infected during his stay at\nhotel M, with subsequent transmission to his wife, patient M.\n Patient\nB is the index patient for the outbreak in Hanoi involving 59 HCWs and\nclose contacts and also is linked to one case in Thailand. Infection with a metapneumovirus, (i.e., enveloped, single-stranded RNA\nvirus) has been associated previously with respiratory disease with much\nless frequent occurrence of severe disease than SARS. CDC continues to support the World Health Organization (WHO) in the\ninvestigation of a multicountry outbreak of unexplained atypical pneumonia\nreferred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1). Many labs of the WHO network have since been using\nmolecular tests provided by CDC to confirm the presence of a coronavirus in\nspecimens from patients in various countries. The probable index patient (patient B) was\nan Asian-American businessman aged 47 years who had visited Hong Kong\nbefore traveling to Hanoi. The\nfourth cluster began with a suspected case in a person who traveled in\nGuangdong province and Hong Kong. Until the mode of\ntransmission has been defined more precisely, eye protection also should be\nworn for all patient contact. Hong Kong University, Chinese University, and\nPublic Virus Labs, all located in Hong Kong and all members of the WHO\nnetwork, have devised a basic diagnostic test. Earlier this week, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) produced strong evidence implicating a coronavirus as the\nagent that causes SARS. Data from many network laboratories indicate that a coronavirus is the\nprimary cause of the disease,' said WHO virologist and epidemiologist Klaus\nStoehr. ' Negative\npressure rooms and N-95 respirators are uniformly available for\nhospitalized patients. The known human coronaviruses can cause serious infections of the\nlower respiratory tract in children and adults and necrotizing\nenterocolitis in newborns (5,6). The\nWHO network is offering to make these test materials immediately available\nto labs in other countries throughout the world. The diagrammatic representation\nof the outbreak associated with the hotel in Hong Kong in the MMWR article\nabove is worth seeing. In Canada,\ntransmission appears to be limited to a well-defined population of HCWs and\nclose contacts. Some differences\nprobably reflect concomitant differences in case definition and\nsurveillance methodologies.

The disease has since spread to 13\ncountries on 3 continents.\nThe WHO investigation is being conducted in collaboration with the Chinese\nMinistry of Health, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, and officials\nfrom Guangdong Province.\nIn the initial stage of the investigation, the WHO team compared case\ndefinitions used in China with those used by WHO to identify SARS and\nconcluded that most cases of atypical pneumonia reported in China from\nmid-November 2002 until 28 Feb 2003 were \u0093indeed cases of SARS.\u0094\nAs reported by the WHO team, Chinese authorities have now agreed to join\nthe WHO collaborative effort to contain the SARS outbreak and prevent its\nfurther international spread. Chinese institutes will be selected within\ndays to participate in 3 global electronic networks set up by WHO to\nfacilitate rapid international collaboration on SARS-related scientific and\nmedical problems. Networks of experts are working to further identify and\ncharacterize the SARS virus, develop better tools for diagnosis and\nmanagement, and understand how the disease is transmitted and what works\nbest to prevent its spread.\nWHO authorities have also been given access to meticulous records kept on\nChinese SARS cases. As China, according to statistics released earlier this\nweek, has experienced the largest number of SARS cases of any country in\nthe world, these data are expected to take understanding of the new\ndisease, and particularly its origins, a major step forward.\nOne of the greatest challenges in containing new diseases is the lack of\nunderstanding of their behaviour as they emerge. The Chinese data, which\nalso cover the longest time frame, are further expected to improve\nunderstanding of how the disease spreads from person to person and why some\noutbreaks appear to have much milder cases than others.\nProgress in identifying the causative agent, now being reported by members\nin a WHO global network of collaborating laboratories, indicates that the\ncausative agent is a new virus in humans that may have jumped the species\nbarrier from its animal host or mutated in ways that have given it more\nlethal properties. Chinese data may help solve the riddle of how the new\nvirus first began to cause disease in humans.\nChina released new figures on the Guangdong outbreak on Wednesday,\nsignificantly increasing the global cumulative total. On Thursday,\nofficials issued the first reports of cases and deaths in ongoing outbreaks\nin Beijing province and in the northern province of Shanxi.\nChina has further agreed today to begin providing up-to-date electronic\nreports of SARS cases throughout China. These reports will be submitted\nelectronically as official reports to WHO from the Ministry of Health.\nAccording to members of the WHO team in China, the government may need a\nfew days to get the new nationwide system of daily electronic reports in\noperation.\nUpdate on cases and countries:\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 1485 cases and 53 deaths have been\nreported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 77 cases. No new\ndeaths have occurred.\nNo reports were received from China today due to the decision to introduce\na new system of nationwide daily electronic reporting to WHO.\nWith 58 new cases, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains\nthe most severely affected area. Other countries reporting new cases\ninclude Canada (1), China, Taiwan (4), Singapore (8), and the United States\nof America (6).\nViet Nam reported no new cases and no new deaths for the fifth day in a\nrow. WHO experts believe that rapid detection of the outbreak and immediate\nintroduction of stringent infection control procedures may have held\nfurther transmission at bay.\nSome patients recovering\nTo date, 19 SARS patients have been discharged from hospitals in Hong Kong,\n17 from Viet Nam, and 25 from Singapore.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 28 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong Department of Health SARS website [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm>\n\n[A] Figures on atypical pneumonia 28 Mar 2003\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs of 1 PM 28 Mar 2003, a total of 425 people with pneumonia symptoms have\nbeen admitted to public hospitals.

Investigation also revealed that they went to Beijing on flight\nCA 112 on 15 Mar 2003. A number of passengers in flight CA 112 were\nconfirmed to have contracted with atypical pneumonia earlier this week. It\nis suspected that the 4 Taiwan passengers contracted the disease from a\n73-year-old passenger in flight CA 112 on their way to Beijing.\nDH has informed the Airport Authority and the 2 airlines concerned. Advice\nwas also given to the airline concerned to disinfect the airplanes. DH is\ntracing the crew members and passengers who had taken these 2 flights, for\nsurveillance purposes.\nThe spokesman reminded members of the public who have respiratory symptoms\nincluding fever, chills, malaise, and cough to avoid traveling by plane\nbefore recovery.\n[These advisories are consistent with the now global recommendation for\npre-boarding screening of airline passengers for symptoms compatible with\nSARS coming from areas with known local transmission. These cases do not\nas yet suggest a more widespread easier transmission, as sitting close to\nan individual who is actively coughing for several hours on an airline\nflight would still be classified as 'close contact'. - Mod.MPP]\n[C] Enhanced measures to control infectious disease 28 Mar 2003\nA spokesman for the Department of Health (DH) on 28 Mar 2003 called on\nmembers of the public who have paid visits to Metropole Hotel on 21-22 Feb\n2003 or the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) on or after 1 Mar 2003,\nexcluding staff working in PWH, to contact them for health surveillance.\nThe spokesman said in order to enhance measures to control atypical\npneumonia, DH has converted 4 clinics into designated medical centres (DMC)\nfor daily surveillance of contacts of confirmed atypical pneumonia cases.\nThe 4v DMC are Pamela Youde Child Assessment Centre (Shatin); South Kwai\nChung Jockey Club Polyclinic; Shek Kip Mei Health Centre, and Sai Ying Pun\nJockey Club Clinic. They will be operated from 9 am to 5 pm daily, starting\n31 Mar 2003.\nThe spokesman said that people who are identified to be close contacts of\npatients suffering from atypical pneumonia are required to report each day\nfor check-up at one of these DMCs for 10 consecutive days. 'Surveillance\nof the health condition of these individuals will be made accordingly. If\nthey have developed symptoms of the disease, they will be admitted to\nhospital for isolation and treatment. People who had close contact with\nthese patients should stay at home as far as possible and should not go out\nunless it is absolutely necessary,' the spokesman said. [This appears to\nbe a contradiction, as in order to report to one of the 4 designated DMCs,\nthese individuals will be leaving their homes and travelling to the DMCs,\nmany of whom might be travelling by public transportation. - Mod.MPP]\nDH will send letters to all close contacts to ask them to attend one of the\nDMCs for check-up. To ensure that every close contact would be put under\nhealth surveillance, DH will set up a special hotline 187 2222 to answer\nenquiries from this group of people. The hotline will be operated between 2\nPM and 6 PM 29 Mar 2003 and from 9 am to 5 pm from 30 Mar 2003 onwards. DH\nhas the power to enforce these mandatory measures whenever necessary.\nClose contact means persons having cared for, having lived with, or having\nhad direct contact with respiratory secretions and body fluids of a person\nwith severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Hong Kong, the\ntransportation hub from which the disease apparently spread worldwide,\nannounced the immediate quarantine of more than 1000 residents suspected of\ninfection and shut down schools for 1 million students. ''Hong Kong faces\nan epidemic that the world has never seen before,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, the\nterritory's chief executive. ''This is a very, very serious issue.''\nHong Kong has been battling a wildfire the rapid spread of the disease for\n2 weeks. The quarantine announced Friday applies to 1080 people who had\nclose contact with those infected by the disease. Nearly 1000 other people\nwho had social contact with infected patients will undergo\nsurveillance. Penalties for breaking domestic quarantine include a fine of\n5000 Hong Kong dollars (about USD 640) , obligatory confinement and 6\nmonths in prison. The Hong Kong measures came a day after Singapore\nundertook similar moves. Singapore, by contrast, cancelled all schools and\ninstituted draconian quarantine measures shortly after the first sign of\ninfection appeared.\n''We are favor of any measure within the law that will contain a disease\noutbreak,'' said Peter Cordingley, a spokesman for the World Health\nOrganization. ''We don't have any problem with Singapore's approach.''\nThe most secretive least forthcoming country, however, has been China,\nwhich on Wednesday acknowledged the presence of the atypical pneumonia for\nthe first time, announcing the highest number of infected patients and\nfatalities in the world. The Chinese authorities also said the situation\nwas ''basically under control,'' hoping to avert the panic that took place\nseveral months ago over outbreak of pneumonia now thought to be linked to\nthe current crisis.\nPopular worries were evident throughout Hong Kong on Thursday as a growing\nproportion of the public put on face masks while walking in public areas.\nResearchers at the University of Hong Kong announced successful DNA\nsequencing of a virus that they say causes the disease. The finding, if\nconfirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could\nallow creation of a rapid diagnostic test and reduce death rates by\nallowing doctors to identify affected patients sooner.\nThe illness, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, has killed at\nleast 53 people, mostly in Asia, and infected 1300 in more than a dozen\ncountries. The group of microbiologists from the University of Hong Kong\nidentified the virus as a new strain from the family of coronaviruses,\nhighly contagious viruses that are the second leading cause of colds in humans.\n''The coronavirus is the primary cause of the disease,'' said Malik Peiris,\na professor of microbiology, adding that another virus, of the family that\ncauses mumps, may also be involved and increase the severity of the\ndisease. Peiris said the new strain had characteristics unlike any other he\nhad ever seen.\n''This is unlike any other human or animal virus ever described before,''\nhe said, adding that humans may not necessarily develop immunity to such a\nvirus after recovering from an infection.\n''If we find they behave like a cold, you can get the same cold again and\nagain,'' Peiris said, warning that transmission of such a virus occurs\nthrough droplets and can take place in many common public areas.\n''Railings, lift buttons and just about anything touched by a person with\nan infection can pass on the virus,'' he said.\nTo avoid infection, he warned people to wash their hands frequently, avoid\ntouching the eyes, mouth or nose and wipe down with rubbing alcohol. ''The\nvirus is easily killed with rubbing alcohol,'' Peiris said. ''Wear a mask\nif you want, but make sure not to touch your face with your hands when\nadjusting it.''\nPeiris said his findings supported the multiple drug treatment with\nribavirin and steroids currently administered to patients. The ribavirin\nsuppresses growth of the virus, while the steroids mitigate damage caused\nby the body's own immune reaction.\n[byline: Thomas Crampton]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 27 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Reuters 27 Mar 2003 10:50 EST [edited]\n<http://asia.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=healthNews&storyID=2459976>\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Microbiologist Bernhard Fleischer, head of Hamburg's\nBernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNI), said his institute\nhad probably identified the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome\n(SARS).\n'I don't assume that there will be a worldwide epidemic which will spread\namong the population,' Fleischer told Reuters in an interview. 'We are\nlucky that this disease is not as contagious and does not spread as easily\nas first assumed.'\nScientists from the BNI, Germany's top tropical diseases institute, worked\non identifying the virus by analyzing tissue samples taken from a doctor\nfrom Singapore who was being treated in Frankfurt after showing symptoms of\nSARS. Fleischer said his institute had developed a test with which experts\ncould detect within one or two hours whether a patient had caught the virus.\nA group of microbiologists from the University of Hong Kong said on\nThursday they had also identified a virus and believe it is a new strain\nfrom the family of coronaviruses, the second-leading cause of colds in\nhumans. The finding is consistent with tests conducted by the U.S. Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention.\nCoronaviruses, so named because they have a crown-like appearance when seen\nunder a microscope, are often responsible for upper respiratory infections\nin premature infants.\nFleischer said he believed it is spread through droplets by sneezing and\ncoughing and therefore can only be caught through very close contact with\nan infected person. 'I expect it to abate in the next few weeks,' he\nadded. Fleischer also said he believed the disease was not very contagious\nbefore a patient started to show symptoms, such as high fever and shortness\nof breath.

[Two of the laboratories that originally suggested that SARS was associated\nwith infection by an unspecified paramyxovirus have now come into line with\nthe CDC verdict that the etiologic agent has the characteristics of a\nmember of the genus _Coronavirus_ of the family _Coronaviridae_. Scientists from the BNI, Germany's top tropical diseases institute, worked\non identifying the virus by analyzing tissue samples taken from a doctor\nfrom Singapore who was being treated in Frankfurt after showing symptoms of\nSARS. The most secretive least forthcoming country, however, has been China,\nwhich on Wednesday acknowledged the presence of the atypical pneumonia for\nthe first time, announcing the highest number of infected patients and\nfatalities in the world.

[byline: Thomas Crampton]\n--\nProMED-mail\n< [byline: Kerstin Gehmlich]\n--\nProMED-mail\n< The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said earlier this\nweek that the virus causing the global outbreak of atypical pneumonia, or\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), was from the Coronavirus group. We are favor of any measure within the law that will contain a disease\noutbreak,'' said Peter Cordingley, a spokesman for the World Health\nOrganization. '' If we find they behave like a cold, you can get the same cold again and\nagain,'' Peiris said, warning that transmission of such a virus occurs\nthrough droplets and can take place in many common public areas. Hong Kong faces\nan epidemic that the world has never seen before,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, the\nterritory's chief executive. '' In their statement, the University of Hong Kong researchers said they have\n'confirmed that the recent outbreak of pneumonia is caused by the virus\nknown as Coronavirus. The government imposed quarantine measures Thursday to impede the\nspread of an epidemic of deadly pneumonia as scientists announced a\nbreakthrough in testing patients for the mysterious virus. The discovery of the agent is an important international research\nbreakthrough,' they said, adding that the disease should be referred to as\nCoronavirus Pneumonia, or CVP. The group of microbiologists from the University of Hong Kong\nidentified the virus as a new strain from the family of coronaviruses,\nhighly contagious viruses that are the second leading cause of colds in humans. In a statement, the Department of Microbiology of the Faculty of Medicine\nof the University of Hong Kong also said it has confirmed previous findings\nthat the global outbreak of atypical pneumonia was caused by the Coronavirus. Fleischer said he believed it is spread through droplets by sneezing and\ncoughing and therefore can only be caught through very close contact with\nan infected person. ' Fleischer also said he believed the disease was not very contagious\nbefore a patient started to show symptoms, such as high fever and shortness\nof breath. Developing a serum against SARS could take years, Fleischer said, but he\nadded that a new vaccination may not be necessary as known medications\nagainst viruses could help to combat it. ' The early phase diagnostic test helps infection control by identifying\nwhich contacts have or have not acquired CVP and ensure discharged patients\nwill not infect the community,' they added. The Hong Kong\nresearch team said patients were responding well to a cocktail of\nanti-viral drugs and steroids. The ribavirin\nsuppresses growth of the virus, while the steroids mitigate damage caused\nby the body's own immune reaction. Wear a mask\nif you want, but make sure not to touch your face with your hands when\nadjusting it.'' The illness, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, has killed at\nleast 53 people, mostly in Asia, and infected 1300 in more than a dozen\ncountries. Nearly 1000 other people\nwho had social contact with infected patients will undergo\nsurveillance.

At present, only 4 countries are\nconcerned. [see affected areas [B] above]\nNo additional precautions for the screening of departing passengers at\nairports in any other parts of the world are called for in today\u0092s\nrecommendations.\nThe screening measures, recommended for consideration by national health\nofficials and port authorities, involve an interview with passengers,\ndeparting from a limited number of areas, to detect illness with symptoms\nthat give reason to suspect that a passenger may be infected with SARS.\nNational authorities may wish to advise travellers with fever departing on\ninternational flights from the few areas where SARS transmission has been\ndocumented to postpone travel until they feel better. All international\ntravellers should be aware of the symptoms of SARS and seek immediate\nmedical attention should symptoms occur.\nSince global surveillance of SARS began at the end of February 2003, some\nevidence suggests that a small number of suspected and probable cases of\nSARS have departed from the small number of affected countries on flights\nto other countries.\nMost cases continue to occur in persons in close face-to-face contact with\nSARS patients. Close face-to-face contact could conceivably occur in an\naircraft among persons seated close to a person infected with SARS and\ncoughing or sneezing.\nWHO has also issued detailed recommendations to airlines on steps to take\nshould a suspected case of SARS be detected in flight. The WHO\nrecommendations include advice on step-by-step procedures for following up\nfellow passengers on the flight who may have had close contact with the\npossible case and the specific advice that should be given to these\ntravellers and their families.\nWHO recommends that contacts of a person be allowed to continue to travel\nso long as they do not have symptoms compatible with SARS.\nThe WHO case definition, which is being widely used for surveillance\npurposes, is posted at the WHO web site and is kept under constant review.\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/casedefinition/en/>\nMany national health authorities have also issued SARS-related advice to\ninternational travellers.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 27 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n[A] Figures on atypical pneumonia 27 Mar 2003\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\nAs at 1 PM 27 Mar 2003, a total of 367 people with pneumonia symptoms have\nbeen admitted to public hospitals.

The number of SARS patients reported to MOH is 78. The 4\nadditional patients consist of one family member and 3 hospital staff.\nThis brings the total number of family members, friends, or close contacts\ninfected by SARS to 38, and the total number of hospital staff affected by\nSARS to 37. 2 patients have passed away. Among the 60 patients who are\nstill hospitalised, all are in stable condition, except for 11 patients who\nare in serious conditions.\nThe Ministry would like to reiterate that SARS is not infectious until the\nperson develops fever. Transmission of SARS is only through close contact\nwith infected persons, and all SARS cases in Singapore so far could be\ntraced back to the 3 index cases. There is no evidence to date that the\ndisease spreads through casual contact.\nSARS patients have been isolated for treatment at TTSH/ CDC, while those\nwho had close contact with them have been quarantined under the Infectious\nDisease Act. The risk of transmission to the general public is therefore\nvery low, so Singaporeans should stay calm and continue with their daily\nroutine.\nThe Ministry of Health advises the public to heed our travel advisory and\nto avoid travel to Hong Kong, Hanoi and Guangdong province in China for the\ntime being, unless absolutely necessary.

Due to differences in the case definitions being used at a national level,\nprobable cases are reported by all countries except the United States of\nAmerica, which is reporting suspect cases under investigation.\n The data reported by WHO above represent an increase of 85 cases in the\npast 24 hours, of which 14 were in China, 51 were in Hong Kong SAR, China,\n4 were in Singapore, and 9 were in Canada, all areas with local\ntransmission. The screening measures, recommended for consideration by national health\nofficials and port authorities, involve an interview with passengers,\ndeparting from a limited number of areas, to detect illness with symptoms\nthat give reason to suspect that a passenger may be infected with SARS.

Their discussion, organized by the WHO\nnetwork of clinicians focused on the disease's features at presentation,\ntreatment, progression, prognostic indicators, and discharge criteria. No\ntherapy demonstrated any particular effectiveness. Clinicians agreed that a\nsubset of SARS patients, perhaps 10 percent, decline and need mechanical\nassistance to breathe. These people often have other illnesses that\ncomplicate their care. In this group, mortality is high.\nBased on their experiences with patients, SARS clinicians are drawing the\nfollowing conclusions:\nDisease presentation:\nAll of the clinicians described presentations of SARS patients and the\ngeneral consensus is that presentation is relatively consistent across all\nnations. Presentation is of a prodromal illness with a sudden onset of high\nfever. In a great number of cases this sudden, high fever is associated\nwith myalgia, chills, rigors, and non-productive cough. At presentation\n(which is often 3 to 4 days after onset of symptoms), a large proportion of\npatients have characteristic changes on chest x-rays.\nDisease progression:\nFollowing presentation, chest x-rays continue to worsen and most patients\ndemonstrate bilateral changes with interstitial infiltrations (fluid\nbuild-up between cells in the lungs). These infiltrations produce x-rays\nwith a characteristic cloudy appearance. Patients then fall into one of 2\ngroups. The majority, 80 to 90 percent of patients at day 6 or 7, show\nimprovement in signs and symptoms. A second smaller group, progress to a\nmore severe form of SARS, many of whom develop acute respiratory distress\nsyndrome and require mechanical ventilatory support. Though mortality\nassociated with the more severe group is high, a number of patients have\nremained on ventilator support for prolonged periods of time. Mortality in\nthe severe group appears to be linked to a patient's other illnesses\n(co-morbid factors).\nPrognostic indicators:\nGenerally, patients over 40 with other illnesses are more likely to\nprogress to the severe form of the disease.\nTherapy:\nNumerous antibiotic therapies have been tried to date with little clear\neffect. Ribavirin with or without use of steroids has been used in an\nincreasing number of patients. But in the absence of clinical indicators,\nits effectiveness has not been proven. Currently the most appropriate\nmanagement measures are general supportive therapy, insuring the person is\nhydrated and treated for subsequent infections.\nWhat next:\nPlanning these grand rounds regularly. The clinicians involved in\nestablishing management guidelines (treatment, management of patients and\ncontacts, discharge).\nThe participants agreed to 'meet' regularly using electronic communications\nand to rapidly develop international guidelines for the care of SARS patients.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 26 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC MMWR 21 Mar 2003 52 (Dispatch);1-2\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/m2d321.htm>\n\nPreliminary Clinical Description of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\n-----------------------\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a condition of unknown etiology\nthat has been described in patients in Asia, North America, and Europe.\nThis report summarizes the clinical description of patients with SARS based\non information collected since mid-February 2003 by the World Health\nOrganization (WHO), Health Canada, and CDC in collaboration with health\nauthorities and clinicians in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Bangkok, Singapore, the\nUnited Kingdom, Slovenia, Canada, and the United States. This information\nis preliminary and limited by the broad and necessarily nonspecific case\ndefinition.\nAs of 21 Mar 2003, the majority of patients identified as having SARS have\nbeen adults aged 25--70 years who were previously healthy. Few suspected\ncases of SARS have been reported among children aged <15 years.\nThe incubation period for SARS is typically 2--7 days; however, isolated\nreports have suggested an incubation period as long as 10 days. The illness\nbegins generally with a prodrome of fever (greater than 100.4 F [greater\nthan 38.0 C]). Fever often is high, sometimes is associated with chills and\nrigors, and might be accompanied by other symptoms, including headache,\nmalaise, and myalgia. At the onset of illness, some persons have mild\nrespiratory symptoms. Typically, rash and neurologic or gastrointestinal\nfindings are absent; however, some patients have reported diarrhea during\nthe febrile prodrome.\nAfter 3--7 days, a lower respiratory phase begins with the onset of a dry,\nnonproductive cough or dyspnea, which might be accompanied by or progress\nto hypoxemia. In 10--20 percent of cases, the respiratory illness is severe\nenough to require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The case-fatality\nrate among persons with illness meeting the current WHO case definition of\nSARS is approximately 3 percent [based on today's data with the additional\ninformation from China, 49 deaths reported and 1323 cases the observed case\nfatality rate is now 3.7 percent - Mod.MPP].\nChest radiographs might be normal during the febrile prodrome and\nthroughout the course of illness. However, in a substantial proportion of\npatients, the respiratory phase is characterized by early focal\ninterstitial infiltrates progressing to more generalized, patchy,\ninterstitial infiltrates. Some chest radiographs from patients in the late\nstages of SARS also have shown areas of consolidation.\nEarly in the course of disease, the absolute lymphocyte count is often\ndecreased. Overall white blood cell counts have generally been normal or\ndecreased. At the peak of the respiratory illness, approximately 50 percent\nof patients have leukopenia and thrombocytopenia or low-normal platelet\ncounts (50 000 - 150 000 / microL). Early in the respiratory phase,\nelevated creatine phosphokinase levels (as high as 3000 IU/L) and hepatic\ntransaminases (2 to 6 times the upper limits of normal) have been noted. In\nthe majority of patients, renal function has remained normal.\nThe severity of illness might be highly variable, ranging from mild illness\nto death. Although a few close contacts of patients with SARS have\ndeveloped a similar illness, the majority have remained well. Some close\ncontacts have reported a mild, febrile illness without respiratory signs or\nsymptoms, suggesting the illness might not always progress to the\nrespiratory phase.\nTreatment regimens have included several antibiotics to presumptively treat\nknown bacterial agents of atypical pneumonia. In several locations, therapy\nalso has included antiviral agents such as oseltamivir or ribavirin.\nSteroids have also been administered orally or intravenously to patients in\ncombination with ribavirin and other antimicrobials. At present, the most\nefficacious treatment regimen, if any, is unknown.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[We are posting this for the benefit of clinician subscribers who might not\nhave seen cases of SARS and would be interested in the current clinical\ndescription and discussions.

Several cases have occurred in travelers to this area. An\n'impressive' cluster has been linked to one hotel in Hong Kong. A physician\nfrom Guongdong visited Hong Kong for a wedding on 21 Feb 2003, and stayed\none night at this hotel. 12 other cases have been linked to this hotel; 9\nof the 12 stayed on the same floor. These cases were then responsible for\nsecondary clusters in Toronto, Hanoi, Singapore, and further cases at 3\nHong Kong hospitals. It is my understanding that this floor is a 'smoking\nfloor' of the hotel, which may be of interest with regard to transmission.\nAt least 200 cases have occurred in Hong Kong, and transmission has been\ndocumented from patients to healthcare workers to healthcare worker's\nfamilies, and most recently into the schools in that area. WHO is\ncurrently investigating 456 cases, including 17 deaths in 16 countries.\nThis total does not include any from China. In the United States, CDC is\ncurrently investigating 40 cases that meet the case definition in 18\nstates. The age range is 7 years to 78 years. 16 of these cases were\nhospitalized, and one patient was placed on mechanical ventilation but has\nsince recovered. There have been no deaths attributed to SARS in the United\nStates to date. At least 10 of the cases had documented pneumonia by chest\nx-ray. 2 of the cases occurred in health care workers and 4 have been in\nfamily contacts.\nClinical Syndrome:\nIllness begins with a prodrome of fever, chills, headache, myalgias, and\nmalaise followed later by a respiratory phase characterized by a dry,\nnonproductive cough and dyspnea. Laboratory abnormalities include\nlymphopenia, leukopenia, mild thrombocytopenia, and elevations in serum CK\nand/or transaminase concentrations. Among the 7 cases investigated by CDC\nto date, all demonstrated lymphopenia (defined as less than 1500\nlymphocytes/mm3). For further details on the clinical findings, including\nchest x-ray, pathology, etc., please consult the MMWR dispatch\n[<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/m2d321.htm>, covered in\nProMED-mail SARS - Worldwide (09): clinical features - Mod.MPP].\nEtiology\nOn Monday evening [24 Mar 2003], CDC has detected evidence for a\ncoronavirus-like agent in 5 patients. Samples from a patient from Thailand,\nalthough initially negative by PCR, produced a cytopathic effect in Vero\ncell culture. Supernatants from cell cultures were then tested by PCR,\nincluding a broadly reactive primer set against the polymerase region, and\ndetected the presence of a virus from the coronavirus family. A more\nspecific primer set is now being used to test other specimens. Initially,\nthis 400 base-pair amplicon suggests through a virus dendrogram analysis,\n[a virus] outside the 3 existing groups of coronaviruses known to infect\nhumans. cDNA cloning is in progress. CDC has developed an IFA in-house and\nhas used this to test supernatants from cell culture as well as paired\nsera from additional patients. Please note that these 'paired' sera were\nnot obtained more than 2 weeks apart and in fact, are often separated by\nonly several days. Nevertheless, IFA was initially negative in acute\nsamples and positive in a second sample from 3 patients from widely varied\ngeographic areas. Furthermore, CPE was detected in Vero cell culture from\nautopsy materials from the Hong Kong index patient. Again, PCR was\npositive. The sequence of this amplicon is pending, but it will\nbe interesting to note whether it is the same as from the Thai patient\nnoted above. In addition, BAL-cell pellets from the autopsy materials from\nthis Hong Kong index case also revealed coronavirus-like particles on\nthin-section electron microscopy. CDC has stressed that all specimens that\nthey have tested are negative for human metapneumovirus; nevertheless,\nthese agents have been detected in material in Canada and Hong Kong by\nPCR, and according to Donald Low, a human metapneumovirus was grown from\nlung tissue yesterday in Frank Plummer's laboratory in Toronto. A great\ndeal of discussion followed this information and the potential for a\ncoronavirus to 'jump' from animals to humans. This has been detected rarely\nin the past, but there is some precedent. At least in my view, it is\npremature to assume that a coronavirus is the etiologic agent. CDC is\nconsulting numerous experts and has shared PCR reagents with groups in\nToronto and Hong Kong.\nTreatment\nVery little information is available on treatment regimens and/or\noutcomes. Physicians in Hong Kong have reported 'success' with ribavirin,\nwith or without the addition of corticosteroids. As there are no controls,\nthese reports must be considered anecdotal at present. CDC has not yet\nmade recommendations on the potential use of ribavirin, the route of\nadministration (oral, intravenous, and/or aerosol), nor on the need for\nadjunctive corticosteroids.

Supernatants from cell cultures were then tested by PCR,\nincluding a broadly reactive primer set against the polymerase region, and\ndetected the presence of a virus from the coronavirus family. At least 200 cases have occurred in Hong Kong, and transmission has been\ndocumented from patients to healthcare workers to healthcare worker's\nfamilies, and most recently into the schools in that area. In addition, BAL-cell pellets from the autopsy materials from\nthis Hong Kong index case also revealed coronavirus-like particles on\nthin-section electron microscopy.

These cases were then responsible for\nsecondary clusters in Toronto, Hanoi, Singapore, and further cases at 3\nHong Kong hospitals. A great\ndeal of discussion followed this information and the potential for a\ncoronavirus to 'jump' from animals to humans. CDC has developed an IFA in-house and\nhas used this to test supernatants from cell culture as well as paired\nsera from additional patients. Nevertheless, IFA was initially negative in acute\nsamples and positive in a second sample from 3 patients from widely varied\ngeographic areas. 2 of the cases occurred in health care workers and 4 have been in\nfamily contacts.\n 16 of these cases were\nhospitalized, and one patient was placed on mechanical ventilation but has\nsince recovered. In the United States, CDC is\ncurrently investigating 40 cases that meet the case definition in 18\nstates. Among the 7 cases investigated by CDC\nto date, all demonstrated lymphopenia (defined as less than 1500\nlymphocytes/mm3). Samples from a patient from Thailand,\nalthough initially negative by PCR, produced a cytopathic effect in Vero\ncell culture.

Cases were reported to have\noccurred in 7 cities of Guangdong Province.\n\nChinese authorities had previously reported to WHO, on 14 Feb 2003, a total\nof 305 cases and 5 deaths from 16 Nov 2002 to 9 Feb 2003. The new figures\ncover the period of 16 Nov 2002 to 28 Feb 2003.\n\nA WHO team of 5 international experts, which arrived in China on the\nweekend, has today reviewed the case definition used in reporting cases of\natypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province. The WHO team compared this\ndefinition with the WHO definition used to identify probable cases of\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and concluded that the 2\ndefinitions are compatible.\n\nFollowing in-depth discussion with central-level authorities and health\nofficials in Guangdong Province on the details of several clusters of\ncases, the WHO expert team reached the conclusion that the atypical\npneumonia cases which began occurring in southern China in November 2002\nare likely cases of the same disease, now referred to as SARS, that began\nappearing in other Asian countries on 26 Feb 2003 and has since spread\nwidely to several cities throughout the world.\n\nChinese authorities further informed the WHO team of a new reporting system\nthat will rely on regular provincial updates. WHO is expecting further\ninformation on reported cases in China for March 2003 as these data become\navailable.\n\nCase management guidelines being used in China are in line with WHO\nrecommendations for minimizing further transmission.\n\nChina is also beginning a collaborative programme in which sera from\ninfected Chinese patients will be exchanged with the WHO network of\ncollaborating laboratories who are working to identify the SARS causative\nagent.\n\nUpdate on reported cases\nThe new data from China bring the total number of reported probable cases\nworldwide, dating back to 16 Nov 2003, to 1323 cases and 49 deaths. When\nthe data from China are excluded, today\u0092s figures represent an increase of\n41 cases, largely concentrated in Hong Kong SAR China, and one death, in\nSingapore, compared with yesterday. [see [A] above]\n\nNational measures to contain further spread\nSeveral countries are introducing maximum measures, including quarantine,\nto prevent the further spread of SARS.\n\nNew diseases such as SARS are poorly understood as they emerge. At the\nbeginning of an outbreak, it is sound public health policy to institute\nmaximum control measures needed to prevent further spread.\n\nMaximum measures are justified when, in the view of national health\nauthorities, they can be expected to protect populations against infection,\nkeep the disease from spreading into the general population, and help\nprevent international spread to other countries, particularly through air\ntravel.\n\nAs the epidemiology of SARS becomes more fully understood, such measures\ncan be adjusted and reduced in line with what is known about how the\ndisease is transmitted and what works best to stop its spread, both\nnationally and internationally.\n\nThe first global 'grand rounds' on SARS clinical features and treatment\nwere held today by WHO. The electronic meeting united 80 clinicians from 13\ncountries. A summary of their discussions and conclusions has been posted\ntoday at the WHO web site. [see ProMED-mail posting: SARS - Worldwide (09):\nclinical features]\n\nPrevious hypothesis for Chinese outbreak: atypical pneumonia caused by\nChlamydia:\nOn 18 Feb 2003, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in\ncollaboration with the Guangdong Center for Disease Control and Prevention,\nannounced the finding of evidence of infection with the Chlamydia bacterium\nin 2 specimens taken from the lungs of patients who died from atypical\npneumonia in southern China. [see ProMED-mail posting Pneumonia - China\n(Guangdong) (04) 20030219.0427 - Mod.MPP]\n\nOn Monday, Chinese authorities asked the WHO team to assist in\ninvestigation of Chlamydia as a causative agent. This request was\ntransmitted to members of a WHO network of 11 labs set up to expedite\nidentification of the SARS pathogen.\n\nOn Tuesday, during the daily teleconference with the network, laboratory\nscientists reported that numerous tests had been run to determine the\npresence of Chlamydia bacteria in specimens from confirmed SARS cases\nelsewhere in the world. Most tests have come back negative for Chlamydia.\nAdditional negative test results were reported today.\n\nThese findings suggest that Chinese patients were likely co-infected with\nChlamydial organisms together with the true cause of the outbreak, which\nremains unidentified.\n\nProgress towards identification of the virus:\nResearch attention is increasingly focusing on the Coronavirus family,\nthough viruses from the Paramyxovirus and other families are also being\nconsidered as scientists cast the widest possible net in their search for\nthe cause of SARS. Many are of the opinion that a diagnostic test could\nrapidly follow conclusive identification of the pathogen. Experts in the\nnetwork are also considering the theory that SARS is caused by co-infection\nwith 2 new viruses that somehow need each other in order to cause severe\ndisease in humans. Evidence is strongly pointing to a new virus, or\npossibly 2 new viruses, that have not previously been known to infect\nhumans or cause severe disease.\n\nHypotheses include a virus known to cause disease in an animal host that\nhas jumped the species barrier to infect humans, or a known human virus\nthat has mutated to acquire properties that are causing much more severe\ndisease in humans. It is increasingly certain, however, that SARS is a\nserious new disease caused by a newly recognized pathogen.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 26 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong SAR - Department of Health\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n\nPart 1 - Figures on atypical pneumonia 26 Mar 2003\n-----\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n\nAs at 1 PM 26 Mar 2003 , the admission statistics of patients who have been\nin close contacts with atypical pneumonia patients are as follow: (The\nnumbers in bracket are those with Pneumonia Symptoms)\n\nA.

The 5 additional patients are hospital staff. All these\ncases are still traced back to the index cases. 13 patients have been\ndischarged from hospital, while the remaining 60 patients are hospitalised.\nAll the patients are stable except for 10 patients who are in serious\ncondition. One patient who was in intensive care passed away on 25 Mar 2003.\n\nSARS is not infectious until the person develops fever. Transmission of\nSARS is only through close contact with infected persons. All the SARS\ncases in Singapore so far are close contacts which are linked to the 3\nindex cases.\n\n\n[B] Joint Press Release by Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health -\nClosure of schools 26 Mar 2003\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5661>\n\nAs an additional precautionary measure in response to concerns expressed by\nparents on the recent SARS cases, the Ministry of Education (MOE) and\nMinistry of Health (MOH) have decided to close all primary schools,\nsecondary schools, junior colleges, and centralised institutes from Thu 27\nMar 2003 to Sun 6 April 2003.\n\nAll schools have been adhering closely to MOH's advisories since school\nre-opened after the March holidays. They have been screening their students\nevery day since school re-opened. On purely medical grounds, there are\ncurrently no strong reasons for closing all schools. However, principals\nand general practitioners have reported that parents continue to be\nconcerned about the risk to their children in schools. MOE and MOH hope\nthat this additional precautionary step to close schools will address\nparents' concerns and further reassure them.\n\n\nUpdate on SARS\n--------------\nThe control measures already instituted are minimising the risk of\ntransmission of SARS within the community. Home quarantine of contacts\nallows us to identify and isolate those who come down with SARS early and\nprevent spread to others. In the hospitals, no more healthcare workers have\nbeen infected with SARS by known or suspected cases, since the\nimplementation of the enhanced infection control precautions.\n\nAll the SARS cases in Singapore so far can be traced back to the 3 index\ncases. The index cases passed on the infection to 21 primary close\ncontacts, who in turn infected 26 other secondary close contacts. Further\ntransmission of the infection appears to be stabilising, with only 23 more\ntertiary close contacts being infected. The control measures appear to be\nworking, although it is still too early to be confident of this.\n\nDetails of school closure\n---------------\nAll school competitions and co-curricular activities scheduled between now\n[26 Mar 2003] and 6 Apr 2003 will be cancelled or postponed. The current\nschool term, Term 2, will be extended into the June school holidays, to\nmake up for losses in curriculum time.\n\nThe universities, polytechnics, and Institute of Technical Education will\ncontinue to operate as normal. These institutes of higher learning have a\ndifferent system of operation from our national schools. Furthermore, the\nstudents in our post-secondary institutions are older and are better able\nto understand the situation and take the necessary precautions.\n\nMOE will advise the pre-school centres to close for the same period.\nSimilarly, the Ministry of Community Development and Sports will be closing\nchildcare centres while the People's Association will be closing the\nplaygroups and tuition classes at community centres/clubs and residents'\ncommittees. Student Care Centres are advised to do likewise. Special\neducation schools, as advised by the National Council of Social Services,\nand madrasahs, as advised by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, will also close\nduring this period.\n\nMOE urges employers to exercise flexibility in allowing their employees\naffected by the closure of schools to take urgent leave to make alternative\nchild care arrangements.\n\nThe Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health will review the SARS\nsituation before the end of next week.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4]\nDate: 26 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS website 26 Mar 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\n\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Report of Suspected Cases Under\nInvestigation in the United States\n*Case definition <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm>\n\nState: suspected cases under investigation*\n\nCalifornia: 10\nConnecticut: 1\nHawaii: 3\nIllinois: 1\nKansas: 1\nMaine: 2\nMassachusetts: 1\nMichigan: 2\nMissouri: 2\nMississippi: 1\nNew Jersey: 1\nNew Mexico: 1\nNorth Carolina: 2\nNew York: 4\nPennsylvania: 2\nRhode Island: 1\nTexas: 3\nUtah: 3\nVirginia: 3\nWisconsin: 1\n\nTotal suspected cases under investigation 45\n[representing 20 states]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: 26 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada SARS website 26 Mar 2003 5:00 PM [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2003/2003_11update11.htm>\n\n\nUpdate 11 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\n--------------------\nAs of 26 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 28 individuals who\nhave become ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Ontario\nand British Columbia. There have been 3 deaths in Canada. All Canadian\ncases have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact\nwith SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The\ninformation contained in this update is based on the best available\ninformation Health Canada has at this time.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario: 27 total cases. To date, all cases have occurred in close family\ncontacts of travelers returning from Hong Kong or in heath care workers who\nhave cared for these cases.\n\nBritish Columbia: one person has been hospitalized with SARS after\nreturning from travel in southeast Asia.\n\nAt this time, the cause of SARS remains unknown, however national and\ninternational laboratory testing and collaboration is ongoing. Here are the\nmost recent developments:\n\nDue to the mounting concern about transmission of the SARS agent in\nnon-hospital and community settings in the City of Hanoi, Vietnam; Hong\nKong Special Administrative Region and Guangdong Province in China; and\nSingapore, Health Canada recommends that persons planning to travel to\nthese areas should defer all travel until further notice. Health Canada is\naware that health authorities in these affected areas are making concerted\nefforts to contain the spread of SARS in their populations.

The WHO team compared this\ndefinition with the WHO definition used to identify probable cases of\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and concluded that the 2\ndefinitions are compatible. On Tuesday, during the daily teleconference with the network, laboratory\nscientists reported that numerous tests had been run to determine the\npresence of Chlamydia bacteria in specimens from confirmed SARS cases\nelsewhere in the world. Experts in the\nnetwork are also considering the theory that SARS is caused by co-infection\nwith 2 new viruses that somehow need each other in order to cause severe\ndisease in humans. When\nthe data from China are excluded, today\u0092s figures represent an increase of\n41 cases, largely concentrated in Hong Kong SAR China, and one death, in\nSingapore, compared with yesterday. Hypotheses include a virus known to cause disease in an animal host that\nhas jumped the species barrier to infect humans, or a known human virus\nthat has mutated to acquire properties that are causing much more severe\ndisease in humans.

We have cases that have spread\nout of Hong Kong and Viet Nam, throughout the world, and we have a\nlaboratory group which has identified 2 different viruses in patient\nspecimens. a paramyxovirus and a coronavirus. At the same time, we\u0092ve done\nepidemiological studies which, to date, have shown us that most if not all\ncases can be identified in a chain of transmission from the patient back\nsomehow to a family member or to a contact directly with a hospital worker\nor with a hotel in Hong Kong.\nAs of now we still maintain that travel is not to be interrupted throughout\nthe world. But as you know there\u0092s much, much information coming out of\nHong Kong, and there\u0092s been a rapid increase in the number of cases this\nweek, and we are in regular contact with Hong Kong and with our Regional\nOffice in Manila and we will be reconsidering today our travel\nrecommendations as we do every day.\nToday we will be with a group of industrialized countries that have cases\nas well as the countries in which the majority of cases are occurring in\nAsia. So we\u0092re at the end of a 10-day period which has seen a remarkable\nworking together of scientists, epidemiologists and countries in the world\nto better understand and stop the spread of what we believe is a previously\nunrecognized infectious agent.\nDr Klaus Stohr: 8 days ago, WHO established a network of 11 laboratories in\n9 countries. Now 8 days later, these 11 laboratories in these 9 countries\nhave found already 2 very strong contenders, 2 viruses which are\nconsistently isolated from many patients from very many different countries.\nThe research is ongoing. It is not normal that one disease is caused by 2\nviruses. We will have to strengthen the activities, particularly as far as\nelectron microscopy is concerned, as well as genetic analysis.\nDr Julie Hall: WHO is working very closely with all its partners in the\nGlobal Outbreak Alert and Response Network. We\u0092ve been able to produce\nguidance based on clinical and epidemiological evidence posted on our web\nsite on the SARS page.We\u0092ve established a logistic basis throughout the\nworld and worked in close collaboration with bilateral arrangements from a\nvariety of different countries to ensure that supplies are in place. We\nalso have 3 field teams in place.\nIn Hanoi there are 9 people who have been there since 14 Mar 2003. Their\nkey focus has been on infection control and where infection control has\nbeen put in place and has been practised effectively, we have seen a\ndramatic reduction in inter-hospital and community transfer of this agent.\nThey have also been working hard in terms of clinical management, and we\nnow have a large data set of information about this syndrome which will\nhelp us to understand its clinical cause and possible effective treatments.\nIt\u0092s been shown that good supportive care has been effective, and we are\nnow in a position in Viet Nam where, now that we have developed a discharge\npolicy, a number of patients are likely to be discharged from hospital in\nthe very near future.\nIn Hong Kong we have a 5-person team that has been focusing on\nepidemiological research and has provided a lot of data in terms of how\nthis infectious agent has been transferred and transmitted between people\nand what infection control measures are required. A 5-person team arrived\non Sunday in China. They have a remit [permit?] to review the\nepidemiological data that\u0092s been collected by the Chinese authorities and\nalso to help support the microbiology and virology investigations into this\noutbreak. So there has been an unprecedented collaborative effort, and all\nthe institutions that are working in the various forms, whether it be in\nthe field teams, in the clinical network, or in the laboratory network; the\ndetails of all of those are on the sheets at the back if people want to\nlook at those.\nQ. When I look at the latest figures from the WHO, it is really worrying\nbecause it seems to me that only in Hong Kong, the figures kept increasing\nand we have now 10 deaths. What are the factors that make Hong Kong so\nspecial? It seems the situation is not under control.\nA. Dr David Heymann: Our teams are also concerned about the situation in\nHong Kong because of its spread in many different hospitals, and our team\nthere is working with the government in Hong Kong, not only to better\nunderstand what\u0092s going on in Hong Kong as far as the epidemiology or the\ntransmission of the disease, but also in trying to stop the spread of the\ndisease. There are people who are infection control experts working in the\ngovernment and with the government to try to make sure that we can stop\nthis outbreak. I just need to remind you though that at present there is no\nevidence that there is any transmission other than close contact with\npatients, either sitting next to patients or being in close contact with\npatients. But this adds to the urgency in Hong Kong to make sure that this\nremains true in the studies that are found because now, as you know, there\nare cases in schools, there are cases other places, and we need to make\nsure that if there are other cases in schools, they aren\u0092t cases that are\nrandomly occurring but are cases which sat next to students who were sick.\nAnd the same goes for airplanes, if there are airplanes that [transported]\nsomeone who\u0092s sick, we would want to be sure that it was people sitting\nnext to that person and not the ventilation system in the aeroplane which\nwas spreading the disease. We have no evidence of the latter right now, but\nthis is why studies are so important and why we reinforced our team to work\nwith the very excellent teams in Hong Kong to find out what\u0092s going on for\nsure.\nQ. A couple of questions. I assume you are supportive of the mass\nquarantine that Singapore authorities have announced that they are starting\ntoday. Singapore today began ordering hundreds of people to stay at home\nand it\u0092s being described as the world\u0092s largest quarantine. They are making\nuse of the Infectious Diseases Act, which is the first time they\u0092ve ever\nused it. So (a) are you in favour of measures like that? and (b) my second\nquestion is, when you were talking about the travel advisory, you seemed to\nstress there\u0092s no new advice for the present. But are you expecting this\nmight change after the meeting with industrialized countries today?\nA. Dr David Heymann: The first is that WHO puts out recommendations on\ntravel but it\u0092s countries who make the final decision based on their\nlegislation and their national laws. That\u0092s why we\u0092re meeting with\ncountries today, because other countries have the same concerns as\nSingapore. And we\u0092re trying to work with them to better understand the\nbasis for their concerns. The recommendations of WHO are always\nevidence-based. That means that when we get evidence that suggests that we\nshould be changing a policy, we move to change that policy. We\u0092ve been\nmeeting on a regular basis by telephone with many countries. Today we will\nbring all those countries together to discuss travel recommendations. And I\nwill say what I would say every day, that we leave it open that if there is\nnew evidence with which we can make a better policy or a different policy,\nwe will do that and we will not hesitate to do it. So, our recommendations\nwill be evidence-based and we do not make a recommendation if there\u0092s no\nevidence to support that. This many times occurs in national contexts\nbecause there are rules or laws which require them to judge on the side of\nsafety rather than on the side of non-safety, if you understand what I\u0092m\nsaying. So, yes there\u0092s always a chance that WHO will change its\nrecommendations and we will keep you posted if that should occur.\nQ. With Singapore, I presume that you are in favour of measures taken, such\nas those in Singapore \u00ad mass quarantine?\nA. Dr David Heymann: Governments take a decision based on the conditions\nlocally. If for some reason Singapore feels that they will not be able to\ntrace all cases because there\u0092s such great mobility in their populations\nthat they must make restrictions on them, then that\u0092s what they\u0092ve decided\nto do. Our recommendation is that there be no restrictions at present. But\nthat\u0092s a global recommendation. And again, that\u0092s being reconsidered on a\ndaily basis and will be re-considered today at 2.30 pm in our conference call.\nQ. The question about the 2 viruses having been, or 2 families of viruses\nhaving been associated with this disease or with this outbreak. You said it\nwas not normal, if I\u0092m not mistaken. Could you give us an idea of whether\nor not it\u0092s possible for a single disease to be caused by 2 viruses or is\nit more likely that at least one of the samples might not be related to SARS?\nA. Dr Klaus Stohr: Speaking as a scientist, we are looking at a very\ninteresting and a fascinating situation. Looking from the point of\ninfectious disease control, we are a bit puzzled because we are not only\ndealing apparently with one pathogen but with 2. The reason why we believe\nthat both pathogens should be given equal attention is that there is\nconsistent finding of both pathogens in individual patients or of either of\nthe pathogens in other patients. What we are seeing actually are 3\nhypotheses. The first hypothesis is that one of the viruses, for instance\nthe corona virus, causes the disease, and that might be a new corona virus.\nThe second hypothesis is that the paramyxoviruses cause the disease and if\nthat was the case, it\u0092s certainly also a new paramyxovirus. The third\nhypothesis, very obviously, is that these 2 pathogens have to come together\nto cause this very severe outbreak. One of the viruses, for instance the\ncoronavirus, is known to live in immune cells, cells which are important\nfor defense against infection. So what one could hypothesize is that this\ncoronavirus destroys or at least diminishes the immunity in the patient so\nthat the second virus has practically an open door to go in and to sicken\nthe patient beyond what this virus would be able to do normally.\nDr David Heymann: Let me just add to that: there could be a fourth\nhypothesis. It is possible that both are common viruses: one found in all\nthe patients, even though it's not causing disease, and the other will be\nthe disease-causing agent, so they could both be found but not be related\nin any way, just there by chance. So it's a very complicated issue that's\nbeing sorted out.\nQ. In China, is the team in Beijing getting new figures on how many cases\nwe have in China? Also, can they go to Guangdong or will they just remain\nin Beijing doing that kind of laboratory service?\nA. Dr David Heymann: Yesterday the team in China had a question from the\nGovernment, and that was 'why is WHO not putting on its web site the 305\ncases that we reported?' The answer was because we only started recording\ncases from 1 Feb 2003, and we don't know how many cases China had from 1\nFeb 2003 on. That made the Chinese believe that they needed to go back and\nlook at their data, and they've promised us they would do that and give us\nmore information. Today that information has not come out yet. Our team has\nmet with officials from Guangdong and from Beijing but the information is\nnot yet available, but we have reason to believe that it will be made\navailable and that there is very much interest in Beijing by the\ninternational press on these issues as well as by the press from outside\nBeijing.\nQ. Is the team going to Guangdong?\nA.Dr David Heymann: The team has not yet been invited to go to Guangdong\nand we don't know whether that invitation will be coming. Certainly our\nwish would be that the Government will permit us to work with them in all\naspects of this outbreak.\nQ. Do you think it's advisable for the team to go to Guangdong to help\ninvestigate what's going on? Did WHO request specifically that they should\ngo to Guangdong?\nA. Dr David Heymann: WHO has requested the Government to let the team work\nwith them as best it possibly can, and we would hope that that would\ninclude working in Guangdong as well as working in Beijing.\nQ. I have 2 questions. My first is that there is a lot of hypothesising\nabout the first case of the outbreak, a lot of media reported that it was\nthe Chinese businessman who came back from China who went to Hanoi who was\nthe one who was dead in Hong Kong. Do you have any information about the\nfirst case? Secondly, can you clarify the route of transmission. Is it\npossible to have transmission by air?\nA. Dr Julie Hall: We have quite a lot of information about the gentleman,\nwhat we are calling the 'Hanoi index case', the Chinese-American\nbusinessman who went to Hanoi, became unwell, and was then transferred to\nhospital in Hong Kong. He was transferred in isolation and treated in\nisolation as well once he got to Hong Kong. The team in Hanoi are currently\nfollowing up his travels prior to arriving in Hanoi. It seems that he\ntravelled quite extensively prior to becoming unwell and prior to arrival\nin Viet Nam. Further details on that are currently being sought by our team\nso that we can follow his travels in the 2-3 weeks prior to his becoming\nunwell in a little more detail. Obviously, when somebody becomes unwell in\none country, lives in another country, and is then transferred for care in\na third country, it does take a while for all this detailed information to\nbe put together.\nDr David Heymann: To date, in looking at every case that occurs, it has not\nbeen possible to say that there was not close contact with another patient,\nbe it a family member of a hospital worker, a hospital worker, or one of\nthe initial cases. Now that information comes in on a daily basis. If, and\nthe minute we find that there are cases which cannot be traced to close\ncontact with another patient or another person at risk, we will then be\nvery concerned that this might have become airborne. Airborne meaning that\nyou would be at risk sitting where you are. The way it is today that we\nbelieve from the evidence we have, the only person at risk in this room\nwould be Dr Stohr, who's sitting next to me. But if we find that you are at\nrisk, we will immediately have to consider a whole series of new measures\nto recommend and the studies will have to intensify to find out how it's\ncirculating more widely than just by person-to-person contact.\nQ. From what I understand from the end of last week, you were becoming more\nconfident that you had this under control. But the data this week seems to\nshow the opposite. How confident are you that you've got it under control?\nHow concerned are you that it could be getting worse instead of better?\nA. Dr David Heymann: When we made the global alert 10 days ago, our goal\nwas to stop outbreaks occurring in other countries than Hong Kong and Viet\nNam because of imported cases. We knew that Canada had had imported cases\nand had had local transmission within Canada. If you look at the global\nalert, it has brought in reports of disease from many different countries -\n13 I believe is the latest count - and there have been no additional\noutbreaks in those countries. So the global containment exercise has been\nsuccessful to date. The exercise of containing the disease in Viet Nam\nappears to have been successful, there has been a slowdown in new cases,\nhospital infection control has been strengthened in hospitals, and it\nappears that that outbreak has been contained in Viet Nam. In Singapore,\nwhere there were imported cases, there appears to now have been a closing\nin on contacts of patients, and we believe that the situation in Singapore\nis being controlled. In Hong Kong there is a very difficult situation and a\ndifferent situation in that 10 hospitals are now involved. It is a very\nimportant exercise to contain the disease in these 10 hospitals. We also\nknow that people have been in schools who have become sick, so there is\nwhere the efforts must be now intensified in addition to better\nunderstanding what is going on in China. So we have 2 countries in which we\nare very concerned now -- Hong Kong -- and in finding out more about what\nis going on in China, because those are the 2 countries where we have less\ninformation and we are less sure that containment activities are being\nsuccessful.\nQ. For the incubation period of the disease, WHO said that it was 2-5 days\nor 2-7 days. In Hong Kong, however, the doctor was in close contact with\nthe patient 11 or 12 days before. So people are now concerned whether we\nshould play safe and extend the incubation period so that the virus won't\nspread even further. Do you have any information and recommendation on this?\nA. Dr Klaus Stohr: Thank you. The incubation period is the period between\nthe infection, when the patient gets in contact possibly with the pathogen,\nand when the first clinical signs occur. Now that is a very important\nperiod of time because it tells us presumably that during this period of\ntime the person can start spreading the virus. The incubation period in\nHanoi, from the data which has been collected during the first two weeks of\nthe outbreak, the average incubation period is 4.5 days. The minimum\nincubation period is 2 days. The maximum incubation period is 7 days. Very\nsimilar data were forthcoming from Singapore, with a minimum 2 days,\nmaximum 7 days. We are talking about a biological phenomenon and we cannot\nrule out that there have been slightly shorter or slightly longer\nincubation periods. However, we have also to realize that not every contact\nof a doctor with a patient must necessarily lead to an infection, so even\nif there has already been contact between the doctor and the patient over a\nperiod of time, perhaps the infection took only place 4 or 5 days after the\ncontact began and the doctor started incubating. We are looking at a new\ndisease. We are looking at possibly 2 different viruses, so we really have\nto cautious in drawing generic and absolute conclusions. The data that we\nhave are relatively firm 2 days to 7 days and we have to take more data and\nanalyse them, and these data are going to be collected particularly from\nHong Kong and particularly in Hanoi, but there will be analytical\ninformation perhaps as you describe, but that has to be verified.\nQ. Now we have 10 days of the global alert, can we say what of the number\nof cases known, what the mortality percentage is?\nA. Dr Julie Hall: It has remained pretty static over the last 10 days, it's\naround about 4 percent mortality rate. So it's quite low and we haven't\nseen any change in that mortality rate over the 10 days.\nQ. In that case is it really such a horrible scourge that's menacing the\nworld, because normally influenza has that kind of mortality rate doesn't it?\nA. Dr David Heymann: I would differ I would say that this is not a low\nmortality rate, we want zero mortality rate. This is a 4 percent mortality\nin a disease for which we do not yet know the cause. So it's a very serious\nissue in having a 4 percent mortality in a disease for which we don't yet\nknow the cause and which is spreading throughout the world. 4 percent is a\nlevel of mortality that could be equivalent to other viral infections in\nmany parts of the world. It's equivalent of what might be occurring with\nWest Nile, it's probably more than what is happening with West Nile in\nNorth America.\nDr Klaus Stohr: The low mortality rate is perhaps also being contributed to\nby the enormous clinical efforts taken with those patients. In one hospital\nin Hong Kong there are more than 150 patients, almost 30 of whom are in\nintensive care. Quite a few of them are on ventilators; they would die\nwithout mechanical ventilation. The health system is burdened almost to the\nlimit in quite a few of the hospitals, and we of course have to look at the\ncase mortality rate and morbidity but also at the burden on the public\nhealth system, which is enormous.\nDr David Heymann: And just to put one more thing in perspective. Suppose\nthat there were 2 diseases occurring at the same time, SARS and a disease\nwhich causes the same symptoms but is less severe. It my be that this\nsecond less severe background disease, caused by another virus, would cause\na different case fatality rate. We can only begin to distinguish genuine\nSARS cases from other less severe diseases having similar initial symptoms\nwhen we have a diagnostic test. So we're still far from understanding\neverything.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Rather than be critical of changing interpretations and explanations,\nreaders should be reminded that this is a new disease process, a truly\n'emerging infectious disease' about which we have many questions and few\ndefinitive answers. We are very early in our identification of this\noutbreak, the etiology is still unknown, and the epidemiology is still\nbeing defined as more cases are identified and investigated. In our quest\nfor 'transparency' in investigations, the price we pay is early release of\nvery preliminary findings that with further investigation and study are\ndisproven or disqualified.

But this adds to the urgency in Hong Kong to make sure that this\nremains true in the studies that are found because now, as you know, there\nare cases in schools, there are cases other places, and we need to make\nsure that if there are other cases in schools, they aren\u0092t cases that are\nrandomly occurring but are cases which sat next to students who were sick.\n Our team has\nmet with officials from Guangdong and from Beijing but the information is\nnot yet available, but we have reason to believe that it will be made\navailable and that there is very much interest in Beijing by the\ninternational press on these issues as well as by the press from outside\nBeijing.

But as you know there\u0092s much, much information coming out of\nHong Kong, and there\u0092s been a rapid increase in the number of cases this\nweek, and we are in regular contact with Hong Kong and with our Regional\nOffice in Manila and we will be reconsidering today our travel\nrecommendations as we do every day. At the same time, we\u0092ve done\nepidemiological studies which, to date, have shown us that most if not all\ncases can be identified in a chain of transmission from the patient back\nsomehow to a family member or to a contact directly with a hospital worker\nor with a hotel in Hong Kong. The health system is burdened almost to the\nlimit in quite a few of the hospitals, and we of course have to look at the\ncase mortality rate and morbidity but also at the burden on the public\nhealth system, which is enormous.\n So what one could hypothesize is that this\ncoronavirus destroys or at least diminishes the immunity in the patient so\nthat the second virus has practically an open door to go in and to sicken\nthe patient beyond what this virus would be able to do normally.\n So there has been an unprecedented collaborative effort, and all\nthe institutions that are working in the various forms, whether it be in\nthe field teams, in the clinical network, or in the laboratory network; the\ndetails of all of those are on the sheets at the back if people want to\nlook at those. \nA.

So we\u0092re at the end of a 10-day period which has seen a remarkable\nworking together of scientists, epidemiologists and countries in the world\nto better understand and stop the spread of what we believe is a previously\nunrecognized infectious agent. I just need to remind you though that at present there is no\nevidence that there is any transmission other than close contact with\npatients, either sitting next to patients or being in close contact with\npatients. We have cases that have spread\nout of Hong Kong and Viet Nam, throughout the world, and we have a\nlaboratory group which has identified 2 different viruses in patient\nspecimens. It is possible that both are common viruses: one found in all\nthe patients, even though it's not causing disease, and the other will be\nthe disease-causing agent, so they could both be found but not be related\nin any way, just there by chance.

It's equivalent of what might be occurring with\nWest Nile, it's probably more than what is happening with West Nile in\nNorth America.\n Now 8 days later, these 11 laboratories in these 9 countries\nhave found already 2 very strong contenders, 2 viruses which are\nconsistently isolated from many patients from very many different countries. Today we will be with a group of industrialized countries that have cases\nas well as the countries in which the majority of cases are occurring in\nAsia. The incubation period in\nHanoi, from the data which has been collected during the first two weeks of\nthe outbreak, the average incubation period is 4.5 days.

There are people who are infection control experts working in the\ngovernment and with the government to try to make sure that we can stop\nthis outbreak. We\u0092ve established a logistic basis throughout the\nworld and worked in close collaboration with bilateral arrangements from a\nvariety of different countries to ensure that supplies are in place.

Since then, more than 450 cases, with\n17 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries on 3 continents.\nOn 15 Mar 2003, WHO issued an emergency travel advisory, based on\ninformation available at that time, and a preliminary case definition of\nSARS. The travel advisory was intended to alert national authorities and\nclinicians to potential cases of SARS and to urge travelers, including\nairline crew, with symptoms suggestive of SARS to seek medical attention.\nWHO continues to recommend, on the basis of currently available data, no\ntravel restrictions to any destination. Guidance to governments, airlines,\nphysicians and travelers issued on 15 Mar 2003 remains valid.\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2003/pr23/en/>\nAdvice for health authorities and clinicians\nA more detailed clinical picture of SARS has been posted at the WHO Web\nsite: <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/clinical/en/>\nWHO has further recommended that suspect cases be placed in isolation and\nmanaged using strict barrier nursing practices:\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/management/en/>\nDrawing on partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, WHO\nand its partner institutes and collaborating centres have placed field\nteams in Hanoi, Viet Nam, Hong Kong SAR, and Taiwan, China to assist health\nauthorities. Last week, WHO flew 300 kilos of protective equipment and\nmedical supplies to Hanoi.\nHealth authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the\nsymptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly\nreported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the\nrisk of transmission of newly detected cases to others.\nAs of data available today, the vast majority of cases continue to occur in\nhealth care workers managing patients in hospital environments, and in the\nfamilies and other close contacts of patients. [see [1] above].\nUpdate on cases and countries affected\nReports from health authorities in 13 countries, compiled today, indicate a\ncumulative total of 456 cases of SARS and 17 deaths. This compares with\nreports a week ago (17 Mar 2003) of 150 cases in 7 countries. [see [1] above]\nFor most of the affected countries, cases reported today are for probable\ncases. Previous reports included both probable and suspected cases. As case\ndefinitions of SARS differ in some countries, the United States of America\nis today reporting 37 suspect cases under investigation.\nHong Kong SAR China remains the most severely affected area, reporting 260\ncases and 10 deaths. Other severely affected areas included Singapore, with\n65 cases and no deaths, and Vietnam, with 58 cases and 4 deaths. Canada has\nreported 11 cases and 3 deaths.\nChest X-rays showing distinctive features of SARS are presently the main\ntool for distinguishing suspected from probable cases. A \u0093hand-made\u0094\ndiagnostic test, developed by Hong Kong scientists, began producing\nreliable results on Saturday and will be made available to key laboratories\nin a matter of days. A more sophisticated test is expected to be available\nfor widespread use in diagnosing SARS cases within weeks.\nWork towards the definitive identification of the causative agent, now\nstrongly expected to be a virus of the Paramyxovirus or Coronavirus\nfamilies, is continuing at breakneck speed. Researchers in a network of 11\nleading laboratories, set up on Monday 17 Mar 2003, exchange data on a\nrestricted web site and compare virological and clinical information during\ndaily teleconferences.\nA second network of clinicians was set up on 20 Mar 2003 to expedite work\non diagnosis and treatment.\nWHO team of experts in China\nA WHO international team of experts in epidemiology, microbiology,\nvirology, and respiratory diseases arrived in Beijing, China on Sunday 23\nMar 2003. The multinational team was assembled in response to a request\nfrom the Chinese Ministry of Health to investigate possible links between\nthe current SARS outbreak, which began in Asia in mid-February 2003, and an\noutbreak of atypical pneumonia which began in Guangdong Province in China\nin mid-November 2002.\nThe WHO team, which includes experts from 5 countries, will review\navailable epidemiological and laboratory data on cases in the southern\nChina outbreak. It will also propose what additional investigations should\nbe carried out, and which additional reagents, antibodies, tests, equipment\nand expertise might be required to continue the laboratory and virological\nwork. This additional expertise and equipment is expected to bolster\nefforts to trace the source of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province.\nConcern over international spread\nThe first concern WHO has regarding travel is the possibility that the\ndisease will spread rapidly and become established in many countries around\nthe world. The extent to which this is happening is being monitored by\nheightened surveillance for SARS symptoms around the world and rapid\nreporting of suspected cases.\nThe worldwide awareness of the disease has been demonstrated by the number\nof countries reporting to WHO. Recommended isolation procedures appear to\nbe working. Since these measures were introduced, no onward transmission of\nthe disease, beyond those initially identified, has been reported.\nIn these circumstances, where the rapid identification and isolation of\ncases appears to be containing international spread, WHO does not consider\nthat any additional restrictions on travel or trade are required.\nConcerns over travel to affected areas\nAs countries around the world have increased surveillance activities they\nhave discovered a small number of cases in persons who have traveled to the\naffected areas. The small number of such cases, at present, is an\nindication that SARS poses little risk to travelers visiting the affected\nareas.\nBased on available information, WHO does not consider that the small health\nrisk attributable to SARS significantly increases the health risk\nassociated with travel to any destination. WHO therefore maintains its\nadvice that no SARS-related restrictions on travel to any destination are\nnecessary.\nWHO is aware that a number of countries have advised their nationals to\nconsider postponing unnecessary or elective travel to the areas where local\ntransmission of the disease has been demonstrated. Such advice does not\namount to a restriction of travel, and is the responsibility of the\nconcerned national authorities.\nConcern about air travel\nThe public is also concerned about the safety of air travel. Cases that\nhave been identified in countries outside the initially affected areas have\narrived by air transport.\nIt is important to note that there is no evidence to date to indicate that\nthe disease is transmitted during air travel, or that travelling in an\naeroplane with an infected person has resulted in illness to other\npassengers or crew. In case of concern that passengers have been exposed to\nan infected person during a flight, a protocol exists for the follow up of\npassengers and crew. When an airline wishes to disinfect an aeroplane after\ncarrying a suspected SARS case there is good reason to believe that the\nprocedures described in the WHO Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation\nwill be fully effective.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Of interest is the mention that the etiologic agent could be a member of\neither the paramyxovirus family or the coronavirus family, 2 very distinct\nviral families. We await further clarification and testing of the\nhypotheses as to the etiology of SARS.\nAs mentioned in this update, transmission to date still seems to be\nrestricted to close contact of cases and not to general spread within the\ncommunity. It is noteworthy that with the implementation of appropriate\ninfection control procedures, transmission in the health care setting has\nbeen apparently interrupted. - Mod.MPP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n MPP]\n\n[3] Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) multi-country outbreak -\nUpdate 8 24 Mar 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_24B/en/>\n\nAdvice to travelers, situation update\nTravel advice\n The multinational team was assembled in response to a request\nfrom the Chinese Ministry of Health to investigate possible links between\nthe current SARS outbreak, which began in Asia in mid-February 2003, and an\noutbreak of atypical pneumonia which began in Guangdong Province in China\nin mid-November 2002.

Information on the identification of the\netiologic agent and development of specific diagnostic tests will be\ncovered separately as has been done by the issuing of separate 'stand\nalone' posts in the past week. \nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n To date, apart from the 3 initial people who had travelled to Hong Kong, a\ntotal of 24 family, friends and those who had close contacts with the\ncases, and 24 hospital staff have been diagnosed with SARS. In addition, no further cases have occurred among\nhospital staff as a result of infection from known or suspected cases of\nSARS after the implementation of enhanced infection control precautions. All suspected and probable cases, including pediatric cases, will be\nmanaged centrally at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and the Centre for\nCommunicable Diseases. Scientists in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Germany, and Canada identified viruses\ntaken from patients as paramyxoviruses, a large family of microbes that\nincludes germs that cause measles, mumps, and respiratory infections.

The Consultant in-charge of\nDH's Disease Prevention and Control Unit, Dr Tse Lai-yin, said the girl is\na student of City One Anglo-Chinese Kindergarten in Sha Tin. She is among\nthe 286 persons confirmed today to have contracted atypical pneumonia. The\ngirl developed symptoms on 21 Mar 2003 and was admitted to Prince of Wales\nHospital today. Her condition is stable. Dr Tse said the girl had\nconsulted a private doctor on 14 Mar 2003. The doctor was confirmed to have\ncontracted atypical pneumonia earlier.\n'We are still looking for the source of infection. The health condition of\nthe girl's family members, classmates, and teachers are also under close\nsurveillance,' Dr Tse said. As a precaution against atypical pneumonia,\nthe kindergarten and City One Nursery, both of which shared the same\npremises, in consultation with DH and the Education and Manpower Bureau,\nhave decided to close from today to 31 Mar 2003 for disinfection and cleansing.\nDr Tse reminded teachers and parents to be cautious about the health\ncondition of their students and children and take every possible means to\nprevent infection.\nMeanwhile, the ninth floor of Metropole Hotel in Ho Man Tin has been\nre-opened. The ninth floor was closed for cleansing and disinfection on 19\nMar 2003 following reports that 8 people had contracted atypical pneumonia\nduring their stay or visit there. The environmental condition of the hotel\nis found to be satisfactory.\nTo enable members of the public to better understand the prevention of\natypical pneumonia, DH in conjunction with Home Affairs Department, will\nconduct a series of health talks at the community halls and community\ncentres in Sha Tin, Happy Valley, Yau Ma Tei, Tsuen Wan, and Tai Po from 26\nMar 2003 to 3 Apr 2003 in the morning and afternoon sessions. The talks\nwill be conducted in Cantonese. Members of the public who wish to attend\nare requested to call 2961 8673 during office hours for details and\nreservation.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 25 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Singapore Ministry of Health [edited]\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5640>\n\nUpdate (12) on SARS cases in Singapore 25 Mar 2003\nAs at 25 Mar 2003, a total of 69 people with SARS have been reported to the\nMinistry of Health (MOH). The 4 additional patients reported today comprise\na hospital staff and 3 close contacts of patients. All these cases are\nstill traced back to the index cases. 13 patients have been discharged from\nhospital while the remaining 56 patients are hospitalised. All the patients\nare stable except for 11 patients who are in serious condition.\nWith the control measures instituted so far, including implementation of\nhome quarantine to isolate all contacts who have been diagnosed with SARS,\nthe Ministry of Health would like to assure the public that there is little\nrisk of a community spread. We would also like to emphasize that the\ndisease is not infectious until symptomatic. The home quarantine measures\nare additional safeguards to cut off any possible transmission to more\npeople. It enables contacts who may become symptomatic to be picked up\nearlier and limits the exposure of other people to symptomatic contacts. It\ndoes not mean that people under quarantine are infectious currently.\nTo date, there have been no additional children who have contracted SARS.\nThere had been reports circulating about a 2-year-old girl from the Little\nSkool House who had contracted pneumonia and high fever. This is not true.\nDoctors at KKH have confirmed that clinically, the girl does not have SARS.\nThe Ministry was notified of the death of a cancer patient at NUH who had\npreviously travelled to Hong Kong and who had developed pneumonia. The\ndeath has not been classified as a death from SARS because the patient did\nnot have the symptoms suggestive of SARS.\nHome Quarantine Measures\nThe Ministry would like to remind all persons served the quarantine order\nto stay at home for the period indicated in the letter to them. They should\nminimise contacts with other family friends or friends and to check their\ntemperature everyday. NEA officers will also be checking with these\ncontacts daily and conducting spot checks. If they develop symptoms\nsuggestive of the illness, they will be immediately referred to TTSH for\nfurther evaluation and treatment if necessary. If they do not develop any\nof the symptoms of SARS after 10 days, they are unlikely to contract SARS.\nThe public can call 1800-2254122 from 8.30am to 6.00 pm from Mon-Fri and\nSat from 8.30am to 1.30pm.\nThe Ministry is also asking all employers whose staff are affected by the\nhome quarantine measure to accept the letter from MOH to the contacts as\nvalid medical leave certificate from work. MOH would like to appeal to all\nemployers whose staff are quarantined to extend their understanding and\ncompassion to these people.\nTighter Screening Measures in school\nThe Ministry would also like to assure parents that the tighter screening\nmeasures in school are precautionary measures. Children who have come back\nfrom the affected countries and who have not shown any symptoms are not\ninfectious. This is based on the detailed analysis of all the SARS cases in\nSingapore so far.\nIt is not necessary to close all schools as the measures that have been put\nin place are adequate.\nTravel advisory\nThe public should continue to avoid travel to Hong Kong, Hanoi, and\nGuangdong province in China for the time being, unless absolutely\nnecessary. This would help us greatly in our efforts to contain the number\nof new cases.\nConcerned members of the public can call MOH hotline at tel: 1800-225-4122\nduring office hours.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 25 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS update [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Report of Suspected Cases Under\nInvestigation in the United States\nThese data were reported to the World Health Organization 25 Mar 2003.\nState: Suspected cases under investigation*\n*Case definition <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm>\nCalifornia: 10\nConnecticut: 1\nHawaii: 3\nIllinois: 1\nMaine: 1\nMassachusetts: 1\nMichigan: 2\nMissouri: 2\nMississippi: 1\nNew Jersey: 1\nNew Mexico: 1\nNorth Carolina: 2\nNew York: 5\nPennsylvania: 1\nRhode Island: 1\nTexas: 3\nUtah: 1\nVirginia: 3\nTotal suspected cases under investigation: 40\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[5]\nDate: 25 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Newswire briefs [edited]\n[A] Japan From: AFX News - Asia 24 Mar 2003 17:53\n2 more people in Japan have been identified as possible [cases of SARS],\nthe health ministry said yesterday.

Officials said about 25 people who appear\nsymptomatic, and their close family contacts have been ordered to stay home\nfor a period of 10 days. That is believed to be the outside limit of the\ninfectious period of the disease. Health Minister Tony Clement announced\nthat Ontario had moved to make SARS a reportable disease Tuesday, giving\npublic health officials the power to order people to remain in quarantine\nif necessary.\nThe number of probable cases of SARS in the province jumped to 18 from 10,\nwith 5 people remaining as suspect cases. Elsewhere in Canada, there is a\nprobable case in Vancouver and 2 suspected cases in Alberta. 3 people have\ndied.\nThe new cases are in health-care workers from Scarborough Grace Hospital,\nwhere a patient who later died of SARS was treated in mid-March 2003. A man\nwho shared an emergency department room with him also contracted the\ndisease and died last Friday. The health-care workers -- who include\nnurses, doctors, technicians, and paramedics -- treated the man before\nworldwide attention was drawn to the fact that a mysterious, contagious,\nand potentially fatal disease had spread from Southeast Asia. As such,\nthey were not taking the high level of care -- using special masks, gowns,\nand treating patients in isolation -- that is now being used for SARS\ncases. To date none of the staff in other Toronto hospitals caring for\nSARS patients have shown signs of the disease.

The first case involved a 17-year-old girl\nwho is a student of Wa Ying College in Ho Man Tin. She has been feeling\nunwell since 10 Mar 2003 and took sick leave since 13 Mar 2003. She was\nadmitted to Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) on 22 Mar 2003 for treatment.\nHer condition is stable. The second case involved a 13-year-old girl who is\na student of SKH Kei Tak Primary School (AM) in Wong Tai Sin. She has not\nattended school since 13 Mar 2003 and developed symptoms on 12 Mar 2003.\nShe was admitted to PMH on 22 Mar 2003. Her condition is stable.\nMeanwhile, DH is also investigating a suspected case in which a 7 year old\ngirl student, of SKH Kei Tak Primary School (PM) was found to have\ndeveloped atypical pneumonia symptoms 23 Mar 2003. She was admitted to\nKwong Wah Hospital today for observation.\nAs a precaution against atypical pneumonia, Wa Ying College and both the AM\nand PM sessions of SKH Kei Tak Primary School, in consultation with DH and\nthe Education and Manpower Bureau, have decided to close for 7 days until\n31 Mar 2003. Investigation is being conducted to ascertain if any of the\ngirls' close contacts have contracted atypical pneumonia.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 24 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Singapore - Ministry of Health 24 Mar 2003\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5620>\n\nUpdate (11) on SARS cases in Singapore\n-------------------\nAs at 24 Mar 2003, a total of 65 people with SARS have been reported to the\nMinistry of Health (MOH). The 14 additional patients reported today\ncomprise 4 hospital staff and 10 close contacts of patients. Among the\nclose contacts are 3 siblings (two boys and one girl) aged 17, 13 and 5.\nFive patients have been discharged from hospital while the remaining 60\npatients are hospitalised. All the patients are stable except for 12\npatients who are in serious condition and being treated in the ICU.\nBased on the detailed analysis of the 65 cases so far, the evidence is that\nSARS is transmitted only when a patient develops the symptoms of the\nillness. The incubation period is usually 3-7 days but could be up to 10\ndays. Epidemiological tracking of the outbreak shows that the initial 3\nindex cases resulted in 21 primary contacts developing probable SARS. This\nlatter group of patients in turn have infected a further 41 cases of\nprobable SARS. While stringent infection control measures have been\ninstituted, their effect will only be apparent several days later, during\nwhich time we expect further increases in the numbers of SARS cases from\nsecondary and tertiary transmission.\nSince the implementation of the stringent control measures in hospitals,\nparticularly TTSH/CDC, no new health care workers have been infected. The\nnew cases of probable SARS involving healthcare workers are still traced\nback to the primary contacts.\nAt present, MOH/NEA officers trace contacts of cases and advise them to see\na doctor in TTSH/CDC immediately if they develop fever or symptoms\nsuggestive of SARS. In addition, the officers call the contacts every day\nto check on their condition. As a further step to reduce the possibility of\ntransmission from symptomatic contacts to others in the community, MOH will\nbe instituting home quarantine measures.\nHome Quarantine Measures\nMOH will be invoking the Infectious Diseases Act to isolate all contacts\nwho have been exposed to infected SARS patients. They will be required to\nstay at home for 10 days and to minimise contact with other people. Those\nwho do not heed the quarantine requirement are liable for prosecution under\nthe Act.\nDuring the home quarantine period, NEA officers will be checking with these\ncontacts daily. If they develop symptoms suggestive of the illness, they\nwill be immediately referred to CDC and TTSH for further evaluation and\ntreatment if necessary. If they do not develop any of the symptoms of SARs\nafter 10 days, they are unlikely to contract SARS.\nThere are presently more than 300 people on our contact tracing list who\nwill be quarantined at home. These are mainly family and friends who have\ncome into close contact with the SARS patients.\nMOH will make provisions for those who experience financial difficulties\narising from home quarantine.\nTighter Screening Measures in Schools\nThe 5-year-old boy is from the Pats School House in Lim Ah Pin Road. As a\nprecautionary measure, the Ministry of Health has asked Pats School House\nto close for 10 days.\nThe 13 year old girl, a student at Pei Cai Secondary School had limited\ncontact with her classmates during the school holidays. Although she was\nwell at that time when she was with her classmates, as a precautionary\nmeasure Pei Cai Secondary School has asked about 200 students who may have\ncome in contact with her to stay away from school for a week. The 17 year\nold boy did not attend school during the school holidays.\nWHO has not recommended closure of all schools as cases of transmission are\nstill confined to those who have been in close contact with infected persons.\nTo prevent any possible SARS outbreak in childcare centres, pre-schools and\nschools, the MOH, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Community\nDevelopment and Sports have tightened screening measures in these places.\nAny child with fever will be asked not to attend school, even though they\nmay not have been in contact with infected persons or had not travelled to\nthe affected areas. Nurses from the Health Promotion Board will also help\nto detect unwell children in childcare centres and kindergartens for early\nmedical attention.\nThe Health Advisory to child care centres, kindergartens and schools is\nattached at Annex A.\nThe MOH would like to appeal to all parents whose children have been to\nHong Kong, Guangdong province in China or Hanoi to closely monitor their\nchildren. They should not be sent to school if they have fever and should\nbe seen by a doctor immediately.\nMore stringent infection control measures at hospitals\nTo fully protect visitors, MOH is heeding WHO advice to stop visitations\nfrom family and friends for all SARS patients. At all other hospitals,\npatients with fever which may or may not be SARS will be isolated until a\ndiagnosis is made. All discharges from TTSH from 10 Mar 2003 will also be\nadded to the contact tracing list for daily surveillance.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 24 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS update 24 Mar 2003\n<<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm >>\n\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Report of Suspected Cases Under\nInvestigation in the United States\n(These data were reported to the World Health Organization on March 24, 2003.)\nState: No. suspected cases under investigation*\nCalifornia: 10\nConnecticut: 1\nHawaii: 3\nIllinois: 1\nMaine: 1\nMassachusetts: 1\nMichigan: 2\nMissouri: 2\nMississippi: 1\nNew Jersey: 1\nNew Mexico: 1\nNorth Carolina: 2\nNew York: 5\nPennsylvania: 1\nRhode Island: 1\nTexas: 3\nUtah: 1\nVirginia: 2\nTotal Suspected Cases Under Investigation: 39\n*Case definition <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm>\n[As mentioned in the WHO update [1] above, the USA is reporting suspected\ncases under investigation, while other reports to WHO have been on probable\ncases.

There have been 3 deaths in Canada. All Canadian\ncases have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact\nwith SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The details\nof the cases to date are as follows:\nOntario: 10 total cases. To date, all cases have occurred in close family\ncontacts of travelers returning from Hong Kong or in heath care workers who\nhave cared for these cases.\nBritish Columbia: one person has been hospitalized with SARS after\nreturning from travel in southeast Asia.\nAt this time, the cause of SARS remains unknown, however national and\ninternational laboratory testing and collaboration is ongoing. Here are the\nmost recent developments:\nHealth Canada has deployed 3 epidemiologists to assist Toronto Public\nHealth and the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation of SARS\ncases currently under investigation.The department has also provided draft\nguidelines for infection control and draft recommendations on actions for\npublic health settings.\nHealth Canada is ready to respond to any requests for support from\nprovinces and territories on the SARS issue.\nHealth Canada issued a revised Travel Advisory on 23 Mar 2003. The overall\nrisk for travellers appears to be low at this time. However, because of\nrecent increases in cases of SARS in the City of Hanoi, Vietnam; Hong Kong\nSAR; and Singapore and that transmission may not be limited to the hospital\nsetting, Health Canada advises that persons planning elective or\nnonessential travel to the City of Hanoi, Vietnam; Hong Kong SAR; and\nSingapore may wish to postpone their trips until further notice. For\nfurther information on this travel advisory, please see:\n\nScientists at Health Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in\nWinnipeg are now able to report that they have found evidence of human\nmetapneumovirus (hMPV) in specimens from 6 of the 8 cases they are\nstudying. The metapneumovirus is part of paramyxoviridae family. These\nfindings are consistent with the results previously released by scientists\nin Germany and Hong Kong.\nThe findings of the NML are significant in that a common thread has been\nfound in a majority of cases in Canada. This is a promising step in the\nongoing investigation. Scientists will continue their work to try to verify\nthe findings and to determine if there are other factors involved that are\ninfluencing the severity of this outbreak. These findings will not likely\nalter the current treatment for SARS patients. For more information on\nhMPV, please see Health Canada's Qs & As:\n\nHealth Canada has initiated the following activities:\nHealth Canada is providing epidemiological expertise and laboratory support\nto provinces/territories and hospitals involved in managing the SARS cases.\nHealth Canada is chairing five Working Groups made up of\nfederal/provincial/territorial and public health officials, as well as\nother community-based experts dealing with such issues as infection\ncontrol, treatment guidelines and public health measures.\nHealth Canada is in daily contact with the provinces and territories, the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) and the Centre for Disease Control (CDC).\nWe have expanded health alert card distribution at major airports in\nCanada. In addition to Pearson and Vancouver, these cards are available at\nall airports that receive international flights from all destinations other\nthan the United States.\nIn collaboration with the provinces, territories, and local health units,\nHealth Canada is leading enhanced surveillance activities for the\nrecognition of SARS cases.\nHealth Canada has also asked officials at the Pearson and Vancouver\nInternational Airports to carefully monitor passengers arriving from Hong\nKong and Singapore to see if anyone has flu-like symptoms.\nHealth Canada has sent staff to Pearson and Vancouver International\nAirports to support airport staff. Health professionals have been sent to\neach airport to help monitor passengers arriving on direct flights from\nHong Kong and Singapore for flu-like symptoms and to assist those who\nappear to be ill.\nThey have started distributing Health Alert Notices to all passengers\narriving in or returning from Hong Kong and Singapore which will ask\npassengers to see a physician if they begin to have any symptoms related to\nSARS. These symptoms include a fever over 38.0 degrees Celsius AND one or\nmore of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, shortness of breath or\ndifficulty breathing.\nHealth Canada's Workplace Health and Public Safety Programme is providing\nadvice to federal employers on occupational health and safety matters.\nHealth professionals from Health Canada's Workplace Health and Public\nSafety Programme were on site at the Pearson and Vancouver airports to\nprovide information sessions for federal employees. They are available, at\nthe employer's request, to provide sessions for federal employees at all\nairports that receive international flights from all destinations other\nthan the United States. The Workplace Health and Safety Programme has\nissued an advisory and has spoken to or met with representatives of a\nnumber of federal departments to provide them with information and advice\nthey can use in determining what health and safety measures they deem\nappropriate for their employees. It is Health Canada's position that\nGovernment of Canada workers are not considered to be at high risk of\ninfection because of the limited contact with and proximity to the\nindividuals. Therefore, Health Canada advises that the use of masks is not\nnecessary.
