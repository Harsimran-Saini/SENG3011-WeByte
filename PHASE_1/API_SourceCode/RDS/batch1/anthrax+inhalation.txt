Emerg Infect Dis [Internet]. 2014 Feb [date cited]. http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2002.130021\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\nInhalation anthrax occurred in a man who vacationed in 4 US states where anthrax is enzootic. Despite an extensive multi-agency investigation, the specific source was not detected, and no additional related human or animal cases were found. Although rare, inhalation anthrax can occur naturally in the United States.\n\nAnthrax is a naturally occurring disease, affecting herbivores that ingest bacterial spores when consuming contaminated vegetation or soil (1). _Bacillus anthracis_ spores are highly resistant to weather extremes and can remain viable in soil and contaminated animal products, such as bones or hides, for many years (2,3). Heavy rains or flooding can bring spores to the surface or concentrate organic material and spores in low-lying areas. As surface water evaporates, spores may attach to growing vegetation or become concentrated in soil around roots (3,4).\n\nHumans can become infected from exposure to infected animals or contaminated animal products (including meat, hides, and hair) or to contaminated dust associated with these products (1). Historically, inhalation anthrax was considered an occupational hazard for those working in wool and goat hair mills and tanneries (5). Recently, inhalation anthrax cases have resulted from exposure to African-style drums made of animal hides and from bioterrorist attacks (6,7). State or local health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) undertake epidemiologic and criminal investigations whenever a clinical isolate is confirmed as _B. anthracis_.\n\nThe Study\n[Refer to the actual paper at the source URL. There is an excellent map of the 3-week route taken.]\n\nConclusions\nWe did not find a specific exposure associated with anthrax infection for this case-patient and no other human or related animal cases. The clinical isolate genotype and sequence closely matched several previous environmental sample isolates from North America; however, no epidemiologic links were identified. The case-patient was exposed to airborne dust while traveling through areas where anthrax was enzootic; however, testing of vehicle air filters in which the dust was concentrated was negative for _B. anthracis_. Nonetheless, the patient may have been exposed through contact with an unidentified contaminated item. This investigation was limited by the poor sensitivity expected for soil sampling and lack of data to guide additional focused environmental sampling, precluding widespread random sample collection and testing along the route traveled.\n\nIt is unusual for inhalation anthrax case-patients to have no identified exposure source (5,9,15). Inhalation of spore-contaminated soil has been suggested as a possible source of infection for bison in anthrax outbreaks in Canada (16). A heavy equipment operator acquired inhalation anthrax during a bison outbreak in Canada, where he dragged carcasses to burial sites and was exposed to airborne dust during operations (2).\n\nChronic pulmonary disease or immuno-suppression may increase a person's susceptibility to inhalation anthrax (9,15). This case-patient had a decades-long history of chemical pneumonitis, and although he reported no respiratory difficulties, perhaps his risk was increased. He also had a history of mild diabetes; diabetes has been observed in other anthrax patients (9).\n\nThis report highlights the challenges of investigating cases of anthrax when no specific suspected source exists. Anthrax, either naturally-occurring or bioterrorism-related, is a major public health concern, and timely recognition is critical. Clinicians and public health professionals should be cognizant that naturally acquired anthrax can occur in the United States and take appropriate steps to rapidly diagnose and investigate such cases.\n\n[Figure, table and references are available at the sure URL.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This itinerant Florida man acquiring pneumonic anthrax in 2011 while on a 3-week driving holiday in the Midwest remains a mystery. It is a pity that the hospital team did not get a blood sample from the wife before they initiated prophylactic treatment and vaccination, as it would have been helpful to know whether she had also been meaningfully exposed. The patient had a long history of chemical pneumonitis and was a mild diabetic, which together might have reduced his necessary exposure dose.\n\nThese mystery cases, though uncommon, are not unknown. In 2012 in the UK, a vaccinated soldier came down with pneumonic anthrax, similarly with no known exposure [ProMED-mail post Anthrax, human, 2012 - UK 20130705.1809481].

The man traveled recently to the west\ncoast of Africa and became ill after his return. A federal law\nenforcement official told the Associated Press that the anthrax may\nhave been on animal skins he was importing.\nAides to the mayor said only the one man was injured and is\nrecovering in a hospital in Sayre, Pennsylvania. Federal and city\nofficials reportedly traced the exposure to New York City after the\nman became ill there. Officials stressed that the case is NOT related\nto any kind of terrorist attack.\nWeeks after the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and\nthe Pentagon, the nation was on high alert, as anthrax-laced letters\npopped up in several places, including New York City. NBC anchor Tom\nBrokaw, 2 American senators and the offices of the New York Post were\namong the targets.\nContracting anthrax from rawhide is said to be a common threat among\nranchers. The CDC says that anthrax can be carried by cattle, sheep\nand horses, and that other animals can be infected. They can get it\nby breathing in spores from infected soil. In some cases, those\nspores can live in the dirt for decades.\nAnimals that are infected are clearly sick within days, with signs\nlike weakness, staggering and trouble breathing. It's often fatal to\nthem within days.\nThe CDC says that while the disease does not usually spread between\nanimals, dead animals can be a point of infection. Federal rules\nrequire that anthrax-infected carcasses be burned or buried in deep\npits, since moving them could further contaminate the ground or send\nthe bacteria into the air.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[From the ongoing news conference, it appears that the individual has\ninhalation anthrax, confirmed by CDC, but he is doing well in a\nhospital in Pennsylvania. 4 other individuals apparently exposed to\nthe same untreated animal hides are being evaluated, and the 3\nevaluated so far (one is in transit) are well and are receiving\nantimicrobial prophylaxis.

Laboratory Response Network (LRN) and Polymerase Chain\nReaction (PCR) on 21 Feb 2006 and gamma phage lysis on 22 Feb 2006 from blood\nculture isolate were positive for _Bacillus anthracis_.\nPatient resides in New York City and makes drums from unprocessed domestic and\nimported (Africa) animal hides (cow and goat). Patient reports frequent travel\nto Africa (most recent travel 12/4/05 [4 Dec 2005] & 12/21/05 [21 Dec 2005]).\nPatient reports last work with animal hides on 15 Feb 2006. Process includes\ncleaning and removal of hair from hides without chemical fixatives. While\ntraveling to Pennsylvania on 16 Feb 2006, the patient collapsed with rigors\nand was transported and admitted to a small local hospital.\nPatient transferred to a tertiary care center on 18 Feb 2006. Patient is\nreported to be stable on antibiotic therapy in the ICU without mechanical\nventilation. No signs of cutaneous or pharyngeal anthrax lesions. Preliminary\nclinical impression suggests anthrax sepsis secondary to inhalation route of\nexposure due to spores from contaminated animal hides.\nOngoing investigation by PA and NYC departments of health in coordination\nwith law enforcement includes environmental assessment of patients\nstorage/work facility and home, and identification of individuals who may\nhave had contact with unprocessed hides.\nAnthrax causes and transmission\n-------------------------------\nAnthrax is caused by exposure to _B. anthracis_, an encapsulated, aerobic,\ngram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium. Depending on the route\nof infection, human anthrax can occur in 3 clinical forms: cutaneous,\ninhalational, and gastrointestinal. Direct skin contact with contaminated\nanimal products can result in cutaneous anthrax. Inhalation of aerosolized\nspores, such as through industrial processing of contaminated wool, hair, or\nhides, can result in inhalational anthrax. Hemorrhagic meningitis can result\nfrom hematogenous spread of the organism following any form of the disease.\nThe incubation period for anthrax is generally less than 2 weeks. However, due\nto spore dormancy and slow clearance from the lungs, the incubation period for\ninhalational anthrax may be prolonged. This phenomenon of delayed onset of\ndisease is not recognized to occur with cutaneous or gastrointestinal\nexposures.\nSkin/cutaneous anthrax\n----------------------\nSkin or cutaneous anthrax is the most common type of naturally-acquired\ninfection. Infection begins as a pruritic papule or vesicle that enlarges\nand erodes (1-2 days) leaving a necrotic ulcer with subsequent formation of\na central black eschar (Images at\nhttp://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/cutaneous.asp.)\nThe lesion is usually painless with surrounding edema, hyperemia, and regional\nlymphadenopathy. Patients may have associated fever, malaise and headache.\nHistorically, the case-fatality rate for cutaneous anthrax has been less than\n1 percent with antibiotic treatment and 20 percent without antibiotic\ntreatment. There are rare case reports of person-to-person transmission of\ncutaneous disease.\nSee http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5042a1.htm#tab2 for specific\ntreatment of cutaneous anthrax.\nInhalational anthrax\n--------------------\nInhalational anthrax is rare but is the most lethal form of the disease.\nDisease may initially involve a prodrome of fever, chills, nonproductive\ncough, chest pain, headache, myalgias, and malaise. However, more\ndistinctive clinical hallmarks include hemorrhagic mediastinal\nlymphadenitis, hemorrhagic pleural effusions, bacteremia and toxemia\nresulting in severe dyspnea, hypoxia and septic shock. Widened mediastinum\nis the classic finding on imaging of the chest, but may initially be subtle\n(Images at http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/inhalational.asp and in the\nappendices).\nCase-fatality rates for inhalational anthrax are high, even with appropriate\nantibiotics, and supportive care. Following the bioterrorist attack in fall\n[autumn] 2001, the case-fatality rate among patients with inhalational disease\nwas 45 percent (5/11). Person-to person spread of inhalational anthrax has not\nbeen documented.\nFor case definitions, treatment guidelines, laboratory testing procedures,\netc, see Anthrax Information for Health Care Providers\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/anthrax-hcp-factsheet.asp>\n_______________________________\nCategories of Health Alert messages:\nHealth Alert conveys the highest level of importance; warrants immediate\naction or attention.\nHealth Advisory provides important information for a specific incident or\nsituation; may not require immediate action.\nHealth Update provides updated information regarding an incident or\nsituation; unlikely to require immediate action.\n##This Message was distributed to State and Local Health Officers, Public\nInformation Officers, Epidemiologists, State Laboratory Directors, Weapons\nof Mass Destruction Coordinators and HAN Coordinators, as well as Public\nHealth Associations and Clinician organizations##\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[I think we can assume that this drum-maker brought a heavily contaminated\nhide back with him from Africa and while handling it inhaled the bloody dirt\nembedded in the hair.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on 24\nFeb 2006 that tests revealed _Bacillus anthracis_ in the workplace, home,\nand van of the 44 year old man. He fell ill with inhalational anthrax after\nperforming in a concert in Mansfield, PA, on 16 Feb 2006. The test results\n'are consistent with the hypothesis that the patient's exposure occurred\nwhile working on contaminated hides while making traditional drums,' CDC\nsaid in a notice sent through its Health Alert Network.\nThe man, who is the 1st known US anthrax case since 2001, remains in\nserious condition in a Pennsylvania hospital, according to a New York Times\nreport today [1 Mar 2006]. He was reported to have made drums from goat\nhides imported from Africa.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency planned to begin cleaning the man's\nGreenwich Village apartment and his studio near the Brooklyn waterfront\nthis week, the Times reported yesterday [28 Feb 2006]. The agency intended\nto clean the apartment hallways and other common areas, plus other\nresidents' apartments on request, the story said.\nThe Times also reported yesterday [28 Feb 2006] that testing had revealed\nno anthrax in an apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where a man worked\non unprocessed hides obtained from the drum maker.\nThe CDC said about 2/3rds of anthrax cases in the United States in recent\ndecades were linked to handling animal hides or hair, but hides nonetheless\npose little risk of causing anthrax. Hides 'pose a low risk of cutaneous\n[skin] anthrax, and an extremely low risk of inhalation anthrax,' the\nagency said. However, the industrial handling of large numbers of hides or\nof hair from many animals has been linked historically with an increased\nrisk. Among 236 anthrax cases reported to CDC from 1955 through 1999, 153\n(65 per cent) were tied to industrial handling of hides or hair, the CDC\nsaid. But only 9 of the 153 cases (6 per cent) were inhalation anthrax, the\nmost dangerous form.\n'No cases of inhalation anthrax in the US have ever been associated with\nanimal hide drums,' the agency said. The man's exposure 'occurred when he\nwas making and finishing drums made from un-tanned animal hides and was not\nassociated with playing finished drums. His exposure was similar to that\nexperienced during industrial handling of hides.'\nWhile CDC does not recommend preventive treatment for people who have had\ncontact with animal-hide drums, drum owners or players should report any\nunexplained fever or skin lesions to their health care provider, the agency\nsaid.\nThe man's illness worried parents of children attending a New York area\nschool, where he performed about a week before he got sick, according to a\nreport in today's [1 Mar 2006] Journal News in White Plains, NY. At a\nmeeting last night, 4 doctors assured about 50 parents there was virtually\nno chance that their children would contract anthrax as a result of the\nman's performance at Hillside School in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY, the\nnewspaper reported.\nAda Huang of the Westchester County Health Department said the drums the\nman used had been treated with chemicals that would kill anthrax spores.\nAnd school superintendent John Russell said public health agencies would\nnot test for anthrax at the school, because there was next to no chance of\nfinding any spores, according to the story. However, some parents asked\nwhether the rooms where the man performed could be chemically\ndecontaminated, and school board members said they would consider that, the\nreport said.\nThe story said the man's dance troupe has traveled globally promoting the\nculture of Ivory Coast through chant, mime, dance, and music.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Thanks to the awareness policies of Homeland Security, the public is more\nthan sensitive of possible risks from anthrax but not of the true level of\nrisk, which is modest. Plus the disease is essentially not contagious.\nHistorically, those at greatest risk from contaminated hides were\nstevedores. When hoisted out of a ship's hold, the hides could slam down\nonto the dock, and hide dust and sharp particles would go flying. Handling\nthem put them at direct risk of cuts from the sharp dry hides. Over the\ndecades of tourists and others buying Haitian Voodoo dolls and drums, the\nrisk was more a footnote by enthusiastic public health laboratory folk\nsampling them. In West Africa, _Bacillus anthracis_ has been isolated from\na significant proportion of shade-tree slaughterings of sick livestock. So\nanyone casually buying goat hides from street vendors in West Africa should\nbe aware of the risk they are taking. Properly processed, however, the\ntanned hides present no risk. - Mod.MHJ]\n******\n[2]\nDate: 1 Mar 2006\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: New York Times [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/nyregion/01anthrax.html?_r=1&oref=slogin>\n\nTenants irked as anthrax keeps a Brooklyn warehouse closed\n-----------------------------------------------\nAs government workers prepared to decontaminate the apartment of a man who\ncontracted anthrax, tenants of the warehouse where he kept unprocessed\nanimal skins complained yesterday [28 Feb 2006] that the closing of the\nbuilding had hurt their livelihoods.\nAn Australian fashion designer, who pays USD 850 a month to rent a 500\nsquare foot studio in the 8 storey building, said that his 5 employees had\nnot been paid in a week and that 2 of them were planning to quit.

A sample is sent to the Pennsylvania Department of Health\nfor further testing.\n21 Feb: The Pennsylvania Dept of Health detects anthrax, and a public\nhealth investigation begins. Officials notify the New York City\nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Centers for Disease\nControl & Prevention, and the F.B.I. The CDC receives a sample for\nits own testing.\n22 Feb: The CDC confirms the diagnosis of anthrax. New York City\nofficials announce that Mr Diomande has inhalation anthrax. They say\nthey have sealed his workplace in Brooklyn and his apartment building\nin the West Village. Officials suggest that the case is isolated, and\ndiscount terrorism. At least 3 other people are given antibiotics.\n[2] Possible prior exposure:\nDr. Melanie A. MacLennan, a friend and personal physician of Mr.\nDiomande, said she believed that he had been infected with anthrax\noverseas in the past. In December 2003, she said, he was hospitalized\nfor 6 weeks in the Netherlands with a skin infection so severe that\nhe had to receive several skin grafts on his left thigh. She said he\nprobably contracted the bacteria in Africa. 'When he became ill in\n2003, in the Netherlands with a serious skin infection, his friends\nworried whether he would live. He was deathly ill, almost to the\npoint where people didn't think he was going to survive,' Ms. Becker\nsaid. 'He was very, very, very sick. Somehow he came through it, and\nis back in tiptop form.'\n[3] Hide handling by Diomande:\nIn his work as a maker of drums, Mr. Diomande has used both domestic\nand imported skins, but he and his relatives have told investigators\nthat he worked with the imported skins in the Brooklyn warehouse in\nthe days preceding his trip to Pennsylvania.\nHe made the drums by 'soaking the hide and then stretching and\nscraping it to remove the hair, which is potentially a scenario where\nhe could aerosolize any spores,' said Dr. Lisa Rotz, a medical\nepidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in\nAtlanta. [This is the traditional means of removing hair from a\nsun-dried hide. - Mod.MHJ] [But] Mr. Diomande told investigators that\nhe uses a razor to strip off the hair, then pours water over it so he\ncan more easily manipulate the skin.\nIn fact, the [CDC] officials said they could not rule out the\npossibility that the germs had come from some of the domestic animal\nskins that Mr. Diomande also worked with in his Brooklyn warehouse.\nThe authorities were just beginning their search and examination of\nthe musician's warehouse and his Manhattan home last night.\nEven though Mr. Diomande might have traveled across the city with\ncontaminated hides, officials said that it likely took aggressive\nhandling to release enough anthrax spores to do any damage. The\nprocess of making a drum is ideal for such a release.\n[4] Hide importation:\nMayor Bloomberg and officials in Pennsylvania said the chain of\nevents leading to Mr. Diomande's illness began on 21 Dec 2005, when\nhe returned from a 2-week trip to Ivory Coast. There, he obtained raw\nanimal hides to bring home with him, the mayor said. A city official\nwho is close to the investigation and spoke on the condition of\nanonymity because of the sensitivity of the case said Mr. Diomande\narrived at Kennedy International Airport with 4 goat skins and took\nthem in suitcases directly to his studio in Brooklyn. The skins were\nprobably never taken to his Manhattan apartment, the official said. A\nrelative disputed the officials' account. 'I think the officials are\nconfused,' said a brother-in-law, Alexander Harman, 43, a computer\nanimator in Jersey City. 'He is not importing, by hand this quantity\nof skins. I've always understood that he buys them from local\ndistributors, and I am positive that he does not carry skins through\ncustoms himself. They are heavy, and he goes through sometimes 100 in\na month. He's only made 2 trips to Africa in the last 14 years.'\nMark J. Mershon, the assistant director in charge of the F.B.I. field\noffice in New York City, said there was no indication that the skins\nwere smuggled into the country.\n[5] Official Responses:\n(a) NYC Building:\nYesterday [22 Feb.] morning, federal authorities concluded\ndefinitively that Mr. Diomande had inhalational anthrax. About 5 p.m.\nyesterday, federal agents, police officers, firefighters and other\ncity workers surrounded Mr. Diomande's apartment building at 31\nDowning Street in the West Village of Manhattan and the warehouse at\n2 Prince Street, near the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn,\nwhere he used animal skins to make drums for his dance troupe and for\nother musicians. Mr. Diomande's 5th-floor apartment was sealed.\nResidents on the first 4 floors were allowed to enter the building.\nThe officials set up a command post near the warehouse, an 8-story\nbuilding, and police cordoned off the area as workers -- some\ncarrying radiation detectors, others wearing protective suits --\nprepared for a floor-to-floor search.\nAt 8:30 p.m. [22 Feb], Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman, said the\ntests at both the apartment building and the warehouse were complete\nand showed no evidence that anthrax had been produced there. Outside\nMr. Diomande's apartment building, city health officials distributed\nfliers saying the residents were not 'at risk for anthrax,' but\nfederal officials said they were actively investigating whether any\nof the hides were passed along to others.\nThe warehouse, identified as Pinnacle Storage on a sign, is mostly\nused for storage, but parts of several floors have been converted to\nrecording and art studios and other commercial uses over the past\nyear or so, according to occupants.\n(b) USDA/APHIS:\nOfficials with the United States Department of Agriculture said no\nanimals or animal products are allowed into the country from Africa.\nCustoms officials said agents generally questioned anyone trying to\nimport animal skins and seized any untanned or partially tanned hides.\nAmong the animals plagued by anthrax are goats, which are prized for\ntheir skins. When stretched tight, those skins provide the perfect\nacoustical top for a drum. And that most pre-modern of instruments is\nwildly popular in the most modern of cities, sold on street corners\nfrom London to New York. It is through this bit of commerce, the\nauthorities now suspect, that the germ was brought to New York in\nDecember 2005, lurking in the hairs of a hide that was carried in a\nsuitcase through Kennedy International Airport by an unsuspecting\nAfrican musician. Now, officials are investigating how that musician,\nVado Diomande, was able to transport infected animal carcasses\nthousands of miles without being detected.\nRegulations on the importation of animals or animal byproducts from\nAfrica are clear, said Teresa Howes, a spokeswoman for the United\nStates Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Inspection\nService. 'We restrict the importation of animal product from\nslaughtered animals, including hides, skins, wool, hair, and bristles\nfrom countries where anthrax infections occur,' she said, noting that\nshe was based in Colorado and not familiar with the details of Mr.\nDiomande's case. 'African animals and animal byproducts are\nprohibited entry into this country entirely.'\nJudging, however, by even a cursory survey of the brisk trade among\nsidewalk vendors, shop owners and Internet vendors in drums made with\nAfrican animal skins, it seems to be a difficult ban to enforce.\nThe agency responsible for regulating the importation of animal\nskins, along with the Agriculture Department, is Customs and Border\nProtection, part of the Department of Homeland Security. 'If you're\ntrying to come into the country and you have animal skins, we're\ngoing to question you about your use of them,' said Kelly Klundt, a\nspokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection. The goal, she said, is\nto determine whether the goods are illegal and whether they pose any\ndanger. [Note the FBI comment above.]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[It would seem that Mr. Diomande's good fortune may have resulted\nfrom a prior exposure in 2003. The print version has him having a\nskin transplant to his thigh at some point in the Netherlands in\n2003. It is not unusual for physicians without prior experience\nattending a cutaneous anthrax case to see the grossly inflamed\noedematous lesion as worse than it is and resort to surgery. Left to\nthemselves and antibiotics, cutaneous lesions do heal well if slowly.\nIn the weeks to come we will hear much about the official speed or\nlack of it in responding to this incident.\nHaiti has long been recognised as a source of anthrax-contaminated\ngoat hides for drums. We can clearly add West Africa to this list of\nrisky sources. Regardless of what is said, the USDA's major concern\nregarding importing raw animal products is not anthrax but serious\ncontagious diseases such as foot & mouth. Until the industry went\nabroad, New England imported enormous volumes of hides, hair, and\nwool for processing, with resultant risks to downstream livestock\nfrom the contaminated washwater. Since that industry shut down in the\n1960s, anthrax has disappeared from the eastern states. Obviously it\nhas re-emerged as a metropolitan niche-risk to humans. - Mod.MHJ]", "summary": "About 5 p.m.\nyesterday, federal agents, police officers, firefighters and other\ncity workers surrounded Mr. Diomande's apartment building at 31\nDowning Street in the West Village of Manhattan and the warehouse at\n2 Prince Street, near the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn,\nwhere he used animal skins to make drums for his dance troupe and for\nother musicians.
