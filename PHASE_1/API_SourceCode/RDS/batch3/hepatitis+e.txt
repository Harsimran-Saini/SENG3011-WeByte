Out of the notified cases, one death has been recorded.\n\nMost of the reported cases in the region are from Gobabis, mainly from the Kanaan C informal settlement, where 123 cases were reported. This is as a result of a lack of clean drinking water, lack of sanitation facilities, and open-air defecation in the settlement.

The patient, who lives on a public housing estate in Aberdeen, was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam on 7 Apr 2020 for treatment of his underlying illnesses. Five days later, he was found to have abnormal liver functions.\n\nHis condition improved, and he was transferred to Tung Wah Hospital for rehabilitation. His blood sample tested positive for the rat hepatitis E virus. It was the 2nd infection with the virus in 2020, after another case was recorded in January 2020. There were 6 cases in 2019.\n\nThe Centre for Health Protection's investigations found neither rodents nor their droppings in the patient's home on Shek Pai Wan Estate. He also had no travel history during the incubation period. His home contacts remained asymptomatic. 'Based on the available epidemiological information, the source and the route of infection could not be determined,' a centre spokesman said on Thursday [30 Apr 2020].\n\n[Byline: Danny Mok]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is the introduction from a 2018 report: Sridhar S, Yip CCY, Wu S, et al. Rat hepatitis E virus as cause of persistent hepatitis after liver transplant. Emerg Infect Dis. 2018; 24(12): 2241-50; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6256372/pdf/18-0937.pdf. The references can be seen at the original URL.\n\n'Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infects 20 million humans worldwide annually (1). HEV-infected persons usually have self-limiting acute hepatitis. However, persistent hepatitis can occur in HEV-infected immunocompromised patients who acquire infection by eating undercooked pork, rabbit, deer, camel, or boar meat (2-6). HEV transmission through blood product transfusion also has been described (7).\n\n'The diverse _Hepeviridae_ family, which incorporates all HEV variants, includes members whose primary host species are terrestrial mammals (genus _Orthohepevirus_) and fish (genus _Piscihepevirus_) (8). The _Orthohepevirus_ genus is classified into 4 species; HEV variants that have been reported to infect humans belong to _Orthohepevirus_ A (HEV-A). A total of 5 genotypes within HEV-A (HEV-1-4 and HEV-7) cause hepatitis in humans, and 3 genotypes (HEV-3, -4, and -7) can cause chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients after foodborne zoonotic transmission (2,6,9,10).\n\n'In addition to HEV-A, the _Orthohepevirus_ genus includes 3 other species: _Orthohepevirus B_ circulates in chickens, _Orthohepevirus C_ (HEV-C) in rats and ferrets, and _Orthohepevirus D_ in bats. HEV-C, also known as rat hepatitis E virus, shares only 50% to 60% nt [nucleotide] identity with HEV-A (8). The zoonotic potential of HEV-C is unknown; cases of clinical infection have not been reported. The substantial phylogenetic divergence between HEV-A and HEV-C, especially in critical receptor binding domains, forms a theoretical species barrier (11). Serologic and molecular tests for HEV are designed primarily to detect HEV-A, and they might miss HEV-C infections. Therefore, the threat to human health, including blood and organ supply safety, from HEV-C is unknown. We aimed to prove definitively that HEV-C can infect humans and describe the clinical, epidemiologic, genomic, and serologic features of this new zoonosis.'\n\nAdditionally, a case was reported from Canada in 2019: Andonov A, Robbins M, Borlang J, et al. Rat hepatitis E virus linked to severe acute hepatitis in an immunocompetent patient.

Hepatology. 2020 Jan 20. doi: 10.1002/hep.31138. [Epub ahead of print]; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31960460\n\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground and aims: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants causing human infection predominantly belong to HEV species A (HEV-A). HEV species C genotype 1 (HEV-C1) circulates in rats and is highly divergent from HEV-A. It was previously considered unable to infect humans, but the 1st case of human HEV-C1 infection was recently discovered in Hong Kong. The aim of this study is to further describe the features of this novel zoonosis in Hong Kong.\n\nApproach and results: We conducted a territory-wide prospective screening study for HEV-C1 infection over a 31-month period. Blood samples from 2860 patients with abnormal liver function (n = 2201) or immunosuppressive conditions (n = 659) were screened for HEV-C1 RNA. In addition, 186 captured commensal rats were screened for HEV-C1 RNA. Sequences of human-derived and rat-derived HEV-C1 isolates were compared. Epidemiological and clinical features of HEV-C1 infection were analyzed. HEV-C1 RNA was detected in 6 of 2201 (0.27%) patients with hepatitis and 1 of 659 (0.15%) immunocompromised persons. Including the previously reported case, 8 HEV-C1 infections were identified, including 5 in immunosuppressed patients. Three patients had acute hepatitis, 4 had persistent hepatitis, while 1 had subclinical infection without hepatitis. One patient died of meningoencephalitis, and HEV-C1 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. HEV-C1 hepatitis was generally milder than HEV-A hepatitis. Seven of 186 (3.76%) rats tested positive for HEV-C1. One HEV-C1 isolate obtained from a rat captured near the residences of patients was closely related to the major outbreak strain.\n\nConclusions: HEV-C1 is a cause of hepatitis E in humans in Hong Kong. Immunosuppressed individuals are susceptible to persistent HEV-C1 infection and extrahepatic manifestations. Subclinical HEV-C1 infection threatens blood safety. Tests for HEV-C1 are required in clinical laboratories.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nHong Kong: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198]", "summary": "Three patients had acute hepatitis, 4 had persistent hepatitis, while 1 had subclinical infection without hepatitis.

The man is among 4000 Namibian men, mostly from Windhoek's informal settlements, battling the virus.\n\n'I could not sleep at night, as my body was in intense pain. And you cannot sleep on one side for long, as the body aches. I could also not sit, as my lower back was in pain,' he narrated to New Era from his home at Ehambo dhaNehale close to the Havana informal settlement. 'I went to Black Chain clinic, and a nurse drew my blood and gave me feedback that I tested positive for hepatitis E virus. They injected me and gave me tablets that I took 3 times a day for a week.' [There is no specific treatment for HEV. - Mod.LL]. Like many local people, he has expressed grave concern over the outbreak of the epidemic, which has since spread to other regions, including Omusati.\n\nThe outbreak of hepatitis E in the country, according to the latest report issued in December 2019, indicated that a majority of the cases are males, with 4167 men testing positive, compared with 2896 women. The least affected are children under one year, representing 0.11%. The report also shows that most of those affected are between the ages of 20 and 39. 'Males are more likely to eat food from street vendors than females. Males are also less likely to wash their hands before eating,' read the report.\n\nCumulatively, up to 29 Dec 2019, a total of 7063 hepatitis E virus cases were reported since the outbreak began. This includes 1731 laboratory confirmed, 4345 epi-linked, and 987 suspected cases. A total of 59 deaths have been reported nationally, and among those are 24 maternal deaths. The virus cases have been reported mainly from informal settlements such as Havana, Goreangab in Windhoek, DRC in Swakopmund and similar settings in other regions where access to potable water, sanitation and hygiene is a serious challenge.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest official report on the outbreak indicated that during the period of 16-29 Dec 2019, a total of 82 hepatitis E virus cases were reported countrywide, compared to 63 cases reported during 2-15 Dec 2019. 'The outbreak has become protracted and continues to spread to other regions with ongoing active transmission of the virus. Inadequate washing intervention in some informal settlements still persists.' The health ministry declared the virus outbreak on 14 Dec 2017 in Khomas, and it spread to other regions around April 2018.\n\n[byline: Selma Ikela]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology.

The references can be seen at the original URL.\n\n'Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infects 20 million humans worldwide annually (1). HEV-infected persons usually have self-limiting acute hepatitis. However, persistent hepatitis can occur in HEV-infected immunocompromised patients who acquire infection by eating undercooked pork, rabbit, deer, camel, or boar meat (2-6). HEV transmission through blood product transfusion also has been described (7).\n\nThe diverse _Hepeviridae_ family, which incorporates all HEV variants, includes members whose primary host species are terrestrial mammals (genus _Orthohepevirus_) and fish (genus _Piscihepevirus_) (8). The _Orthohepevirus_ genus is classified into 4 species; HEV variants that have been reported to infect humans belong to _Orthohepevirus_ A (HEV-A). A total of 5 genotypes within HEV-A (HEV-1-4 and HEV-7) cause hepatitis in humans, and 3 genotypes (HEV-3, -4, and -7) can cause chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients after foodborne zoonotic transmission (2,6,9,10).\n\nIn addition to HEV-A, the _Orthohepevirus_ genus includes 3 other species: _Orthohepevirus B_ circulates in chickens, _Orthohepevirus C_ (HEV-C) in rats and ferrets, and _Orthohepevirus D_ in bats. HEV-C, also known as rat hepatitis E virus, shares only 50% to 60% nt [nucleotide] identity with HEV-A (8). The zoonotic potential of HEV-C is unknown; cases of clinical infection have not been reported. The substantial phylogenetic divergence between HEV-A and HEV-C, especially in critical receptor binding domains, forms a theoretical species barrier (11). Serologic and molecular tests for HEV are designed primarily to detect HEV-A, and they might miss HEV-C infections. Therefore, the threat to human health, including blood and organ supply safety, from HEV-C is unknown. We aimed to prove definitively that HEV-C can infect humans and describe the clinical, epidemiologic, genomic, and serologic features of this new zoonosis.'\n\nAdditionally, a case was reported from Canada in 2019: Andonov A, Robbins M, Borlang J, et al.

HEV species C genotype 1 (HEV-C1) circulates in rats and is highly divergent from HEV-A. It was previously considered unable to infect humans, but the 1st case of human HEV-C1 infection was recently discovered in Hong Kong. The aim of this study is to further describe the features of this novel zoonosis in Hong Kong.\n\nApproach and results: We conducted a territory-wide prospective screening study for HEV-C1 infection over a 31-month period. Blood samples from 2860 patients with abnormal liver function (n = 2201) or immunosuppressive conditions (n = 659) were screened for HEV-C1 RNA. In addition, 186 captured commensal rats were screened for HEV-C1 RNA. Sequences of human-derived and rat-derived HEV-C1 isolates were compared. Epidemiological and clinical features of HEV-C1 infection were analyzed. HEV-C1 RNA was detected in 6 of 2201 (0.27%) patients with hepatitis and 1 of 659 (0.15%) immunocompromised persons. Including the previously reported case, 8 HEV-C1 infections were identified, including 5 in immunosuppressed patients. Three patients had acute hepatitis, 4 had persistent hepatitis, while one had subclinical infection without hepatitis. One patient died of meningoencephalitis, and HEV-C1 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. HEV-C1 hepatitis was generally milder than HEV-A hepatitis. Seven of 186 (3.76%) rats tested positive for HEV-C1. One HEV-C1 isolate obtained from a rat captured near the residences of patients was closely related to the major outbreak strain.\n\nConclusions: HEV-C1 is a cause of hepatitis E in humans in Hong Kong. Immunosuppressed individuals are susceptible to persistent HEV-C1 infection and extrahepatic manifestations. Subclinical HEV-C1 infection threatens blood safety.

According to the study, '40 percent of U.S. slaughterhouse pigs (sampled) were seropositive for HEV (hepatitis E virus), indicating prior HEV infection of the pigs on the farms, which was consistent with prior estimates for farmed U.S. pigs.' This means hepatitis E could enter our food chain.\n\nThe scientists took 23 000 samples from pigs in 25 slaughterhouses around the USA. 'We previously showed that HEV-3 is present in U.S. swine herds and that a small proportion of commercial pork products, such as liver and chitterlings, from American grocery stores contain infectious HEV.'\n\nScientists do not have a vaccine available for hepatitis E, and the CDC reports that symptoms can take up to 60 days to develop after exposure. Scientists report that while the entry point to the food chain 'remains unknown,' the possibility is there.\n\nSome symptoms of hepatitis E include fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and jaundice.\n\n[Byline: Eliza Erskine]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[While genotypes 1 and 2 of HEV cause outbreaks of the disease mostly from contaminated water in the developing world, genotypes 3-7 are zoonotic. GT 3 is primarily spread from swine and can cause chronic infection in immunosuppressed individuals and can be transmitted via blood transfusion. The following is an excellent paper regarding zoonotic HEV in the UK:\n\nSaid B, Usdin M, Warburton F, et al.

Epub 2017 Jul 31; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28756783\n---------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\n'Since 2010, human hepatitis E infections have increased in England and Wales. Most cases are locally acquired and caused by hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV G3). HEV G3 is linked to the consumption of pork products. The increase is associated with the emergence of a new phylotype, HEV G3-group 2 (G3-2, also known as G3abcdhij). 60 individuals with confirmed hepatitis E infection and no history of travel outside the UK were recruited: 19 were infected with HEV G3-group 1 (G3-1 or G3efg) and 41 with G3-2. Epidemiological data relating to usual shopping habits and consumption of ham and sausages were analysed together with typing data to identify any associations with HEV phylotype. Study participants who purchased ham and/or sausage from a major supermarket were more likely to have HEV G3-2 infection (relative risks 1.85, P = 0\u00b706, CI 0\u00b797-3\u00b753). The HEV G3-2 phylotype has not been detected in indigenous UK pigs and it is suggested that human infections could be the result of consumption of products made from pork originating outside the UK. This does not infer blame on the supermarket, but the epidemiology of HEV is dynamic and reflects complex animal husbandry practices which need to be explored further.'\n\nThis report underscores the importance of zoonotic hepatitis E (primarily genotype 3) as the cause of hepatitis E emergence in Europe. There are currently 7 genotypes of HEV, and genotypes 1 and 2 are not zoonotic and cause most of the HEV infections in Africa and Asia. It is these genotypes that cause increased morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

Most of the zoonotic hepatitis E cases have been recognized in the developed world, are associated with foodborne disease (usually undercooked pork products), and are caused by genotype 3. Pork products associated with human infection caused by an emerging phylotype of hepatitis E virus in England and Wales. According to the study, '40 percent of U.S. slaughterhouse pigs (sampled) were seropositive for HEV (hepatitis E virus), indicating prior HEV infection of the pigs on the farms, which was consistent with prior estimates for farmed U.S. pigs.' 60 individuals with confirmed hepatitis E infection and no history of travel outside the UK were recruited: 19 were infected with HEV G3-group 1 (G3-1 or G3efg) and 41 with G3-2. Study participants who purchased ham and/or sausage from a major supermarket were more likely to have HEV G3-2 infection (relative risks 1.85, P = 0\u00b706, CI 0\u00b797-3\u00b753). The statistics noted in the summary give a relative risk of 1.85, which supports an increased risk of almost 2 times, but the p value of 0.06 and a confidence interval overlapping 1.0 both do not reach statistical significance, so 'more likely' is better than 'significantly associated.' In addition, infection with genotype 3 when occurring in immunocompromised hosts (especially solid organ transplant recipients) can cause chronic infection which can progress to cirrhosis. The HEV G3-2 phylotype has not been detected in indigenous UK pigs and it is suggested that human infections could be the result of consumption of products made from pork originating outside the UK. There are currently 7 genotypes of HEV, and genotypes 1 and 2 are not zoonotic and cause most of the HEV infections in Africa and Asia. \n\n\nThe CDC found that hepatitis E is an 'emerging foodborne pathogen' that is transmitted to humans through raw or undercooked pork products. \n'Since 2010, human hepatitis E infections have increased in England and Wales.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2017-03-25 00:00:00", "2010-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Wales", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "England", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7988324", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - Burkina Faso", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7988324", "date": "2020-12-02 19:53:39", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - BURKINA FASO\n**************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 27 Nov 2020\nSource: World Health Organization (WHO) [abridged, edited]\nhttps://www.who.int/csr/don/27-november-2020-hepatitis-e-burkina_faso/en/\n\n\nAcute hepatitis E - Burkina Faso\n--------------------------------\nBetween 8 Sep 2020 and 24 Nov 2020, the North-Central region of Burkina Faso reported a cumulative total of 442 cases of febrile jaundice. The vast majority of cases (87.5%) were reported from Barsalogho health district with 387 cases and 16 deaths, representing a case-fatality rate of 4.1% (see Figures 1 and 2 [for figures, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). A total of 15 out of 16 deaths were reported in pregnant or postpartum women.\n\nA total of 10 cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as hepatitis E. Currently 38 patients are being followed up at the Barsalogho medical center, 10 of which are in hospital. Case descriptions according to individual characteristics show that 67% of cases were less than 30 years old (mean age is 25 +/- 12 years); 54% of febrile jaundice cases were female; and nearly 5% of cases were less than 5 years old.\n\nAs early as 11 Sep 2020, WHO advised the Ministry of Health that the cause could be hepatitis E given the following contexts:\n\n- 14 samples were collected and sent to the National Reference Laboratory for Viral Hemorrhagic Fever [NRL-VHF]; one sample came back positive for yellow fever positive by IgM (collected during the survey) (1st batch). The sample was then sent to Dakar for additional yellow fever and differential testing.\n\n- 9 samples (out of the 14 collected during the survey) were sent to Lapeyronie Hospital, Montpellier, France for hepatitis E testing: 8 of the 9 samples were IgM positive for hepatitis E (results shared on 25 Sep 2020). Genotyping of 8 samples for viral hepatitis E showed that the virus was genotype 2; therefore, no zoonotic infection was detected.\n\n- A 2nd batch of 43 samples was sent for testing to the [NRL-VHF] (Muraz Center, Bobo Dioulasso) resulting in 2 IgM positive cases for yellow fever by IgM and one undetermined.\n\n- The 2 probable and one indeterminate sample from the 2nd batch along with the one probable sample from the 1st batch (total 4 samples) were sent on 30 Sep 2020 to the Pasteur Institute of Dakar (IP Dakar) for additional yellow fever and differential tests. Two of the 4 samples tested positive for hepatitis E by PCR; none tested positive for yellow fever by PCR (results shared on 20 Oct 2020). These same 4 samples were then tested and came back positive for yellow fever by serum neutralization, but with low titers (results shared on 26 Oct 2020) and are therefore not interpreted as acute yellow fever infection in this context.\n\n- To date, a total of 349 samples (out of 387 suspect cases) have been collected, of which 163 have been analyzed at the [NRL-VHF] for yellow fever.\n\nThere are many internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the region, most of them with host families and some living in camps. In addition, the North-Central region is affected by the closure of health facilities due to insecurity resulting from regular attacks by Unidentified Armed Men (HANI). In the Health District of Barsalogho, 3 out of 4 communes are heavily affected by these attacks resulting in displacement of the population. A total of 40% of the country's IDPs are registered in the North-Central region, but only 6 out of 15 health facilities are in operation. Burkina Faso is affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, and as of 23 Nov 2020, 2757 cases and 68 deaths have been reported. The context of the COVID-19 pandemic further complicates the response.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nHepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is common in countries with limited access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services, or in areas of humanitarian emergencies.\n\nThe hepatitis E virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, mainly through contaminated water. The risk factors for hepatitis E are related to poor sanitation conditions, allowing the viruses excreted in the feces of infected subjects to reach water intended for human consumption. In general, the infection heals spontaneously in 2-6 weeks with a lethality of 0.5-4%. Fulminant hepatitis is more common when hepatitis E occurs during pregnancy. Pregnant women, especially in their 2nd and 3rd trimester, are at increased risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss, and mortality. The case-fatality rate can be as high as 20-25% in women in the last trimester of pregnancy.\n\nPrevention is the most effective approach against this disease. At the population level, the most important interventions to reduce the transmission of HEV and the number of hepatitis E cases are provision of safe drinking water, quality standards for public water supplies, and the provision of adequate sanitation. At the individual level, infectious risks can be reduced by maintaining hygienic practices such as washing hands with clean water and soap -- especially before handling food, avoiding consumption of water and/or ice of unknown purity, and following WHO hygiene practices for food safety.\n\nTo prevent the spread of acute hepatitis E, WHO recommends improving access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. The quality of drinking water should be regularly monitored in neighborhoods affected by this epidemic. Coverage of latrines and drinking water sources should be increased to prevent open defecation and to ensure hand hygiene. Health promotion and prevention activities, as well as ensuring early, appropriate, and equitable healthcare services to combat hepatitis E epidemics, can help improve public health outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Since the incubation period for hepatitis E ranges from 2 to 10 weeks, cases may continue to occur up to the 10th week (maximum incubation period) even after measures to ensure safe water, sanitation and hygiene promotion have been adopted.\n\nThe intervention must continue to target vulnerable populations by establishing or strengthening antenatal diagnosis for pregnant women with symptoms, improving the population's hygiene conditions, strengthening national capacities for diagnosis and clinical case management, and cross-border collaboration with neighboring countries.\n\nTo date, a hepatitis E vaccine has been developed for commercialization and licensed in China and Pakistan. While WHO does not recommend the introduction of the vaccine as part of national routine population immunization programs, WHO recommends that national authorities may decide to use the vaccine in outbreak settings, including in populations at high risk, such as pregnant women. Vaccine use should therefore be considered to mitigate or prevent an outbreak of hepatitis E, as well as to reduce the effects of an outbreak in high-risk individuals, such as pregnant women.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology, including genotypes that are zoonotic.

The country's emergency response plan for hepatitis E needs to be strengthened, said Gassama.

Coordination also needs to be strengthened, Gassama said.\n\nGassama feels that dealing with the outbreak of the disease should not be left to the Ministry of Health and Social Services alone, as all ministries can contribute in bringing the disease under control. 'Emergencies are not a government show alone. We don't have to relax,' noted Gassama. He said the communities are not fully doing their part to fight the disease. There is a need for community leaders to arise from within the affected communities in order to share the message of maintaining cleanliness in order to fight the disease.\n\n'There is a need for human resource capacity to engage communities in their settings. There are not many people on the ground from the community and yet that is the way for this epidemic,' said Gassama. He further stressed the need to address sanitation, especially in the DRC [Democratic Resettlement Community] settlement in Swakopmund. There are mobile toilets but they are not regularly emptied, Gassama said. He also observed that cultural practices whereby an entire family wash their hands in one basin of water and dry their hands with one towel should be discouraged as germs will continue to spread. 'We need to promote handwashing with soap and running water. This is very important because once that is done transmission will be a thing of the past,' he added.\n\nStatistics from the Ministry of Health and Social Services from last week [week of 15 Oct 2018] show that there are 3630 cases of hepatitis E in 7 of the country's 14 regions. Windhoek and Swakopmund are hardest hit by the disease. 'The biggest asset I found here is the political commitment from the leadership. A lot of activities went on when hepatitis E was declared an outbreak in December 2017. The government and partners are really committed to this.

Most of these are thought to be indigenously acquired _Orthohepevirus A_ genotype 3 (HEV G3), which has been linked to pork production and consumption.

Rodents, brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_) in particular, have been shown to carry HEV, both the swine HEV G3 genotype and _Orthohepevirus C_, genotype C1 (rat HEV). To investigate the prevalence of HEV in British rodents, liver tissue was taken from 307 rodents collected from pig farms (n = 12) and other locations (n = 10). The RNA from these samples was extracted and tested using a pan-HEV nested RT-PCR. Limited histopathology was also performed. In this study, 8/61 (13%, 95% CI, 5-21) of brown rat livers were positive for HEV RNA.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said on Tuesday night [14 May 2019] it was investigating 3 separate cases, each involving an elderly man with underlying liver function issue. The men lived in different districts, with one each in Kowloon City, Southern, and Tuen Mun.\n\nKowloon City is beside Wong Tai Sin, where the 1st 2 cases of the infection were reported in Hong Kong in 2018. The other districts are well apart from these 2 areas. The 2 cases in 2018 were also the 1st reported in the world. Health experts called the latest incidents 'very significant', showing transmission occurred from time to time in different parts of the city. One expert believed rat-to-human transmission was more likely than from person to person.\n\nSo far, the investigation has not been able to track down the source of the infections, but health chiefs ordered rat control measures to be stepped up in the districts. In the latest incidents, the 1st tw2o cases involved men, aged 81 and 67, who developed liver-related problems. Neither required admission to hospital. The 67-year-old traveled to Taiwan and South Korea during the incubation period. A 3rd man, 74, also developed liver problems. He was hospitalized over an unspecified underlying illness and died on 4 May 2019.\n\n'Based on the available epidemiological information, the source and the route of infection could not be determined [in the 3 cases]. The CHP's investigation is ongoing,' a spokesman said. The centre urged the public to be vigilant against hepatitis E and 'strictly observe good personal, food and environmental hygiene'.\n\nIn September 2018, Hong Kong reported the world's 1st case of a human infected with the rat hepatitis E virus. The patient was a 56-year-old man living in Choi Wan Estate in Wong Tai Sin. He had undergone liver transplant surgery in May 2017 and developed persistent abnormal liver function 2 months later. In November 1018, a 70-year-old woman, who lived just 3 km (1.9 miles) away in the same district, was found to be carrying the virus.\n\nDr Siddharth Sridhar, clinical assistant professor from the University of Hong Kong's department of microbiology, said the latest cases were 'very significant. The discoveries ... show the 2-case cluster in Wong Tai Sin was not a one-off transmission event but occurs from time to time in different parts of Hong Kong.' Individuals with underlying illnesses should maintain high standards of personal, food and environmental hygiene, Sridhar said, adding people should avoid rodents and contact authorities if they spot an infestation.\n\nProfessor Yuen Kwok-yung, a leading microbiologist from HKU [University of Hong Kong], said human infection by the rat hepatitis E virus was 'likely to be much more common than originally expected.' He said personal hygiene may have been less than optimal in the 3 latest cases as they were elderly men. Also, all 3 had underlying illness. Both factors may predispose them to the infection. Yuen called for more investigations on the route of transmission, though he believed the virus jumping from a rat to a human was more likely than between 2 people.\n\nA spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department said its staff would work with the Housing Department and management companies to carry out a joint operation to step up cleansing of public places and rat control in the districts where the patients lived. Those who disposed of waste improperly would be prosecuted. The teams would provide professional advice and instructions on rat control to those involved in managing housing estates and buildings. The department would also work with district councillors on inspections of black spots and publicity campaigns.\n\n[Byline: Danny Lee, Elizabeth Cheung]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The following is the introduction from a report of one of the 2018 cases\n(Sridhar S, Yip CCY, Wu S, et al.

Therefore, the threat to human health, including blood and organ supply safety, from HEV-C is unknown. We aimed to prove definitively that HEV-C can infect humans and describe the clinical, epidemiologic, genomic, and serologic features of this new zoonosis.\n\n[For Material and Methods, see original URL - Mod.LL]\n\nResults\n-------\nHepatitis E incidence in transplant recipient cohort\nOf 518 patients, 52 (10.2%) had persistent hepatitis (table 1 [For Tables and Figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). A total of 5 (9.6%) patients with hepatitis tested positive for HEV IgM; 4 of these were kidney transplant recipients, and 1 was a liver transplant recipient. Together with reactivation of chronic HBV infection, HEV was the 3rd most common cause of viral hepatitis in the local transplant population. Of the 5 patients, plasma HEV-A qRT-PCR of 3 renal transplant recipients was positive; another renal transplant recipient tested negative for HEV RNA. We have previously reported the clinical details of the 3 HEV-A-infected patients (9). Rat-derived HEV-C infection was diagnosed in the liver transplant recipient, which accounted for 1.9% (1/52) of persistent hepatitis in our cohort.\n\nPatient history\nA 56 year old man underwent deceased-donor liver transplant on [14 May 2017], because of hepatocellular carcinoma complicating chronic HBV carriage. He received 1000 mg hydrocortisone and 20 mg basiliximab (anti-interleukin-2 receptor mAb) as intraoperative antirejection prophylaxis and 4 units of platelets (derived from 4 separate blood donors) during the operation. His liver function tests (LFTs) reverted to normal, and he was discharged on posttransplant day 11. He was taking mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and prednisolone as antirejection prophylaxis. He was also taking entecavir for HBV suppression; serum HBsAg was negative 6 weeks after the transplant.\n\nRoutine phlebotomy on [12 July 2017] (day 59 posttransplant) revealed mild derangement of ALT to 74 U/L (reference 8-58 U/L). Other LFTs were normal. One week later, there was further derangement of parenchymal liver enzymes: ALT was 138 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase was elevated to 65 U/L (reference 15-38 U/L), gamma-glutamyltransferase was 124 U/L (reference 11-62 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase was within reference limits at 70 U/L (reference 42-110 U/L). Complete blood count showed lymphopenia, although total leukocyte count was within reference levels.\n\nThe patient was empirically managed for acute graft rejection with increased immunosuppression using a 3-day course of methylprednisolone. Valganciclovir was prescribed for a low-level whole blood CMV viremia. However, LFTs continued to deteriorate despite clearance of CMV viremia and increased immunosuppression. Liver biopsy showed nonspecific mild to moderate inflammatory infiltrate comprising small lymphocytes in the portal tracts. There were no viral inclusion bodies, and immunohistochemical staining for CMV and hepatitis B core antigens was negative. Results of testing for HBsAg in serum, HBV DNA in plasma, HCV antibody in serum, HAV IgM in serum, and HAV RNA in plasma and feces were all negative. HEV IgM was detected in serum collected on [22 Aug 2018] (day 100 posttransplant). Because of the serology result and ongoing LFT derangement, persistent HEV infection was suspected. A qRT-PCR targeting HEV-A was performed on patient fecal and plasma specimens; HEV-A RNA was not detected in either specimen. An RT-PCR capable of detecting all species within the _Orthohepevirus_ genus detected amplicons (Technical Appendix Figure 1) in plasma, feces, and liver tissue. Sequencing confirmed that the products clustered with rat HEV-C strains.\n\nViral RNA kinetics and effect of ribavirin therapy\nThe patient's archived serum, saliva, urine, feces, and nonfixed liver tissue samples were retrieved for HEV-C RNA load testing using HEV-C qRT-PCR (figure 1, panel A). Two pretransplant serum samples and 1 serum sample collected on day 17 after transplant did not contain HEV-C RNA. The 1st specimen with detectable HEV-C RNA was a serum sample collected 43 days after transplant, which contained an RNA load of 948 copies/mL; this result preceded onset of LFT derangement by 3 weeks. After heightened immunosuppression in July and August, the HEV-C RNA load in blood steadily rose along with ALT (figure 1, panel B). Variation in ALT correlated with the HEV-C RNA viral load by linear regression. HEV-C RNA was also detected in feces, saliva, and liver tissue (figure 1, panel A); feces contained the highest RNA load.\n\nImmunosuppressant dosages were decreased after confirmation of HEV infection. However, ALT and HEV-C RNA loads continued to increase despite reduction of plasma tacrolimus levels by 55% and rebound of lymphocyte count. Therefore, oral ribavirin 400 mg twice daily was started on [7 Sep 2017]. ALT decreased within the 1st week after start of therapy and normalized within 1 month after starting ribavirin (figure 1, panel B). HEV-C RNA loads also decreased to undetectable levels in plasma obtained on [13 Feb 2018]. Ribavirin was stopped in April 2018, and HEV-C RNA in serum remained undetectable as of [21 Aug 2018], confirming sustained virologic response.\n\nSerologic analysis\nWe retrospectively tested all available patient serum and plasma samples for HEV IgG and IgM ELISA using the Wantai ELISA kit. The patient's serum before transplant was HEV IgG positive and IgM negative. HEV IgG and IgM optical density rose sharply from [27 Jun 2017], when HEV-C RNA was 1st detectable in blood, to [25 Jul 2017], when clinical hepatitis began (Technical appendix figure 2). Despite high IgG levels, HEV-C RNA continued to rise until ribavirin was started.\n\nTo characterize the serologic response, Western blot using purified HEV-A and HEV-C recombinant proteins (figure 2, panel A) was performed. Two mAbs raised against HEV-A were used: 1 produced a band in HEV-A IgG blot but not in the HEV-C blot (lane 8; figure 2, panels B, C) confirming specificity, and the other was cross-reactive against HEV-A and HEV-C (lane 9; figure 2, panels B, C). Polyclonal serum raised in mice inoculated with HEV-C protein reacted in both blots, showing that the serum was cross-reactive (lane 7). Patient serum collected on day 100 after transplant (lane 1) was tested against HEV-A and HEV-C recombinant proteins. The serum specimen showed reactivity in both Western blots.\n\nTwo patient serum samples, one obtained 3 months before transplant and the other obtained on day 100 after transplant, were tested in IgG ELISAs using HEV-A and HEV-C protein-coated plates. The pretransplant serum (figure 2, panel D) had cross-reactive antibodies against both HEV-A and HEV-C proteins (less than 2-fold difference in titer using OD cutoff of 0.3). However, the posttransplant serum (figure 2, panel E) showed more than 16-fold rise in HEV-A IgG titer and markedly higher reactivity against HEV-A than against HEV-C (more than 4-fold difference in titer using a cutoff OD of 0.3).\n\nLiver histologic and immunohistochemical analyses\nSerial liver biopsies showed progressively worsening hepatocyte ballooning and degenerative changes (figure 3, panels A, B). Apoptotic hepatocytes were identified in the biopsy obtained on day 98 posttransplant (figure 3, panel B). Immunohistochemical staining with the cross-reactive mAb showed positive perinuclear cytoplasmic signals (figure 3, panel C), and negative control with bovine serum albumin instead of mAb showed no signals (figure 3, panel D).\n\nGenomic description\nComplete genome sequencing of the patient's fecal HEV isolate (LCK-3110) showed that the genome was 6942 bp long (GenBank accession no. MG813927). Phylogenetic trees of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 of HEV strains showed that LCK-3110 is most closely related to the Vietnam-105 strain (figure 4; Technical appendix figure 3, panels A, B), sharing 93.7% nt identity. Because no phylogenetic incongruence was found on comparison of trees of the 3 genomic segments, recombination was unlikely (table 2; Technical appendix). To determine whether commonly used RT-PCRs for HEV nucleic acid amplification could detect HEV-C, we aligned published primer/probe sequences of HEV RT-PCRs (19-22) with complete genome sequences of HEV-A (genotype 1 reference strain) and HEV-C (strains LCK-3110, Vietnam-105, and LA-B350) using ClustalX 2.0 (http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/). Alignment revealed significant lack of homology with HEV-C at the 3 prime end of either the forward or reverse primer for the assays described by Jothikumar et al. and Rolfe et al. (Technical appendix figure 4, panels A, B) (20,21). Our in-house HEV-A qRT-PCR is based on the primer/probe design of Jothikumar et al. and was unable to detect HEV-C in patient specimens (20). For the assays described by Mansuy et al. and Colson et al. (19,22), there was significant lack of matching of probe sequence (40%-45% mismatch) to HEV-C genomes (Technical appendix figure 4, panels C, D), which most likely would result in failure to detect any amplified nucleic acid.\n\nVirus culture\nWe detected HEV-C RNA in supernatants from all 3 cell lines (figure 5, panel A) inoculated with patient's feces at steady levels from day 3 to day 7 after inoculation. RNA loads in cell lysates were about 1 log higher than concomitantly harvested supernatants, suggesting successful viral cell entry. Immunohistochemical staining (figure 5, panels B, C) of A549 cell monolayers and immunofluorescence staining of infected Huh-7 and Caco-2 cells (Technical appendix figure 5) confirmed the presence of cytoplasmic HEV ORF2 antigen when stained with antiserum against HEV-C. These findings suggested abortive viral replication of HEV-C in human cell lines.\n\nEpidemiologic investigation\nThe 1st clinical sample with detectable HEV-C RNA was obtained 43 days after transplant. HEV-C was not detected in serum samples obtained before transplant. Serum samples from the organ donor and all 4 platelet donors tested negative by IgM Western blot against HEV-C recombinant protein (figure 2, panel C, lanes 2-6) and HEV-C qRT-PCR.\n\nThe patient's house unit was located adjacent to a refuse chute. He had noticed rodent droppings but had never seen rats inside his home. A site visit to the housing estate was conducted on [22 Nov 2017]. Rodent droppings were found around refuse collection bins on the ground floor and the floor where the patient lived. A total of 12 rodent fecal specimens, 2 swab samples from the drain, and 2 swab samples from the refuse room floor tested negative for HEV-C RNA. To expand the investigation, we retrieved archived rodent samples collected from the area around the patient's housing estate (about a 2.5 km radius) as part of preexisting pathogen surveillance programs. Spleen, kidney, liver, and rectal swab specimens from 27 rats were tested by qRT-PCR. The internal organs of 1 street rat (_Rattus norvegicus_) collected in 2012 tested positive for HEV-C RNA (strain name SRN-02). The ORF2 aa [amino acid] sequence of this isolate had 90.9% identity to LCK-3110.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nDiscovered in Germany in 2010, rat HEV variants have been detected in rodent samples in Asia, Europe, and North America (23-26). Because of high divergence from human-pathogenic HEV, rat HEV has been classified into a separate species, _Orthohepevirus C_, within the family _Hepeviridae_ (27). The zoonotic potential of HEV-C is controversial. Virus-like protein ELISAs show possible subclinical infection among forestry workers in Germany and febrile inpatients in Vietnam, although interpretation of such studies is difficult because of serologic cross-reactivity between HEV-A and HEV-C (15,28). Immunocompetent rhesus macaques do not appear to be susceptible to experimental infection with a North America HEV-C isolate (23).\n\nIn this study, we detected HEV-C RNA in multiple specimens from a transplant recipient. The HEV-C infection manifested as persistent hepatitis, as shown by temporal correlation between blood HEV-C RNA detection and hepatitis onset, presence of HEV-C RNA in liver tissue, and normalization of liver function tests with viral clearance. These findings prove that HEV-C can infect humans to cause clinically significant illness and signal a need to reevaluate the importance of HEV-C as a human zoonosis among both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology.\n\nThe patient reported here acquired HEV-C infection despite having HEV IgG. Interpreted in parallel with the finding by Sanford et al. that inoculating pigs with HEV-C ORF2 protein did not protect them from HEV-A infection and low amino acid homology between HEV-A and HEV-C in critical immunogenic domains (29), our data suggest that HEV-A antibodies do not protect against HEV-C infection. The patient's postinfection serum showed significantly higher reactivity in an HEV-A-specific ELISA than in an HEV-C ELISA; the humoral immune responses of persons with past HEV-A infection to de novo HEV-C infection are worthy of further study to identify whether anamnestic responses are mounted.\n\nThe patient's HEV isolate had high nucleotide similarity to the HEV-C Vietnam-105 strain. It shared less homology with the North America LA-B350 strain, especially in the ORF3 domain, which is important for viral egress (30). Interspecies transmission could not be attributed to specific viral mutations. Future studies will need to include differences in zoonotic potential between HEV-C strains from Asia and the Americas.\n\nThe patient's immunosuppression possibly enabled the virus to surmount the species barrier, as described previously for avian influenza (31,32). HEV-C infections may go undiagnosed because of amplification failure in RT-PCRs, which are designed based on HEV-A sequences (Technical appendix figure 3). The Wantai ELISA, based on HEV-A genotype 1, was able to detect IgM in this patient, but whether the assay is sensitive for HEV-C infection or was detecting only HEV-A-specific antibodies is uncertain. Therefore, we believe that specific RT-PCR is the most reliable method to diagnose HEV-C infections.\n\nOur findings are also relevant to blood and organ donation safety. Because of the inability of commonly used RT-PCRs to detect HEV-C, transmission from asymptomatically infected immunocompetent donors may occur, even in countries that screen donated blood for HEV. Studies examining frequency of HEV-C contamination in blood products are needed to quantify this threat.\n\nThe patient lived in a housing estate with evidence of rat infestation in the refuse bins outside his home. We identified HEV-C in street rodents from the area, but the isolate was not closely related to the patient's isolate. The route of transmission is unclear; we postulate that contamination of food by infected rat droppings in the food supply is possible. Other possibilities include reactivation of a subclinical infection in the patient posttransplant or a donor-derived infection from residual HEV-C in the transplanted organ. However, we found no serologic or virologic evidence of HEV-C infection in donor and recipient serum before transplant. An occult infection in the donated liver, which reactivated after transplant as described previously for HEV-A, cannot be completely excluded. Detailed studies are needed to ascertain the route of HEV-C infection in humans.\n\n[For references, see original URL. - Mod.LL]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report contains the description of the evaluation of the 1st case as well as a new media report of a 2nd.

To evaluate the risk for HEV-C1 infection in humans, paired sera of 208 hospitalized febrile patients collected from 2001 to 2003 in Hanoi, Viet Nam, were examined for IgG antibodies to HEV-C1 and genotype 1 HEV (HEV-1), which is common in humans. IgG antibodies to virus-like particles (VLPs) of HEV-C1 and/or HEV-1 were detected from 99 of the 208 convalescent sera in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IgG antibody titers to HEV-C1 antigen in 3 of the 99 sera were more than 8-fold higher than those to HEV-1 antigen. IgM antibodies to HEV-C1 antigen were detected in acute sera from 2 of the 3 patients in ELISA and Western blotting. However, no HEV genome was detected. Clinical information was available for 1 of the 2 patients. Hepatic enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, were mildly elevated (156 IU/l and 68 IU/l, respectively), and hepatomegaly was detected by ultrasonography.

HUMAN, RAT VIRUS, FIRST AND SECOND REPORTS\n********************************************************************************\n Together with reactivation of chronic HBV infection, HEV was the 3rd most common cause of viral hepatitis in the local transplant population. According to <on.cc>, the 2nd case involves an elderly female patient who was living in Choi Hung, in the same area as the 1st patient but not in the same housing estate. One week later, there was further derangement of parenchymal liver enzymes: ALT was 138 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase was elevated to 65 U/L (reference 15-38 U/L), gamma-glutamyltransferase was 124 U/L (reference 11-62 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase was within reference limits at 70 U/L (reference 42-110 U/L). \n\nRoutine phlebotomy on [12 July 2017] (day 59 posttransplant) revealed mild derangement of ALT to 74 U/L (reference 8-58 U/L).

The case emerged when the patient, who had undergone a liver transplant on 14 May 2017 at HKU's teaching hospital Queen Mary and was on immunosuppressant drugs, showed persistently abnormal liver function tests results. This indicated problems with his liver graft.\n\nFurther tests showed he was carrying a species of hepatitis virus that until then was known to be present only in rats and was 'highly divergent' from the strain that affects humans. The man lived in a housing estate 'with evidence of rat infestation in the refuse bins outside his home', HKU researchers who studied the case said. 'We postulate that contamination of food by infected rat droppings in the food supply is possible,' they said in a report, although they noted that the route of transmission of the virus remained unclear.\n\nThe man, a Choi Wan Estate resident, had noticed rodent droppings but had not seen rats inside his home, according to the report. Tests on rodent droppings, swab samples from the drain and floor from the refuse room, and even rats in the area, tested negative for rat hepatitis E. But frozen samples from a rat collected by food and environmental hygiene authorities in the district in 2012 were found to have the virus. The patient was treated with an oral medication known as ribavirin and is recovering.\n\nHong Kong has experienced rodent infestations during its hot and humid summers, and hygiene authorities have for the last 18 years produced a rodent infestation index on areas they manage. In 2017, the rodent infestation rate (RIR) for June to December for the city as a whole was 3.5 per cent, down from 4 per cent in the same period a year earlier. But officials admitted that the RIR might not fully reflect the situation in individual districts.\n\nBefore this case, there had been no previous evidence that rat hepatitis E, one of the variants of the virus that affects mammals, could be transmitted to humans. About 20 million people worldwide suffer from a strain of hepatitis E known to be transmitted via food or water contaminated by feces containing the pathogens. Patients have also got the virus from eating undercooked meat from infected animals and through blood transfusions from infected donors. Symptoms of hepatitis E viral infection include fever, reduced appetite, abdominal pain, and jaundice. In rare cases, it could lead to acute liver failure and death.\n\nDetails of the study, led by Professor Yuen Kwok-yung and Dr Siddharth Sridhar from the university's department of microbiology, will be published in the medical journal Emerging Infectious Diseases in December 2018. HKU will hold a press briefing on Friday afternoon, 28 Sep 2018, to reveal more about the case.\n\nEarlier in the summer of 2018, Hong Kong faced a rampant rodent problem, with control officers reporting double-digit growth in demand for their services over the past few months.

More than 800 people are suspected of having contracted hepatitis, while 5 people have died from the disease.\n\nThe outbreak was 1st reported in October 2017. Of the 5 who have died, 3 were women in the post-partum period. The outbreak is concentrated in the informal settlements of Havana, Goreangab, Hakahana, Greenwell Matongo, Ombili, and the broader Katutura. A majority of the patients are from the informal settlements of Havana and Goreangab.\n\nHepatitis E is a liver infection spread either by direct contact with an infected person's feces or by indirect fecal contamination of food or water. Infection is more severe among pregnant women as they are at greater risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss and death. The outbreak is fueled mainly by a lack of clean water, poor sanitation and poor personal hygiene.\n\nSince the outbreak, the Ministry of Health and Social Services has carried out assessments in 2500 households in the affected areas, where an average household consists of 4 people. The assessment showed that 68 per cent of households defecate in the open, 92 per cent of them collect water from communal taps, while 2 per cent collect water from open/unsafe water sources. Only 6 per cent have household taps.\n\nThe President, Hage Geingob, visited the affected areas in Havana informal settlement in February 2018 and emphasized the importance of basic sanitation, as hepatitis E is not an inherited disease like cancer and other ailments but spread through poor hygiene. He also urged communities to stop vandalizing public toilets and to take care of them, as they belong to them.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This article MAY provide some important potential insight into why there is a substantially increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus:\n\nKmush BL, Labrique A, Li W, et al.

In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except one seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study.'\n\nOf the 7 genotypes of HEV, it seems that GT 1 and 2 are the ones that are associated with this increased mortality during gestation. Those genotypes appear to be transmitted from humans, whereas the others, most notably GT 3, are zoonotic infections spread usually by undercooked pork products. - Mod.LL\n\nMaps of Namibia: http://www.mapsofworld.com/namibia/maps/namibia-political-map.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63834.]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This article MAY provide some important potential insight into why there is a substantially increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus:\n\nKmush BL, Labrique A, Li W, et al.

In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. The association of cytokines and micronutrients with hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period in rural Bangladesh. \n\nOf the 7 genotypes of HEV, it seems that GT 1 and 2 are the ones that are associated with this increased mortality during gestation. The outbreak is fueled mainly by a lack of clean water, poor sanitation and poor personal hygiene. \n\n--\n Infection is more severe among pregnant women as they are at greater risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss and death. Since the outbreak, the Ministry of Health and Social Services has carried out assessments in 2500 households in the affected areas, where an average household consists of 4 people. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. HEPATITIS E - NAMIBIA (06): (KHOMAS) FATAL\n More than 800 people are suspected of having contracted hepatitis, while 5 people have died from the disease. \n\nThe outbreak was 1st reported in October 2017. Those genotypes appear to be transmitted from humans, whereas the others, most notably GT 3, are zoonotic infections spread usually by undercooked pork products. Of the 5 who have died, 3 were women in the post-partum period. \n\n\nUNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, UNICEF and WHO are assisting the Namibian government in the fight against an outbreak of hepatitis E on the outskirts of the national capital, Windhoek.

The outbreak has since spread from the capital to other administrative regions of the country. However, the cases are largely confined to 5 informal settlements in the Katutura local government area of Windhoek.\n\nSpeaking during an assessment tour of emergency responses in the affected settlements, US ambassador to Namibia Lisa Johnson said Washington will help Namibia fight the hepatitis E outbreak. 'We are seeing that there are still new cases in the areas of Windhoek every week, and that's actually not unexpected; it does take months to get the hepatitis E outbreak under control. We will continue to assist, and I think by mid-July 2018, the National Health Emergency National Committee will have some sort of 6 months response review to see how we are doing altogether and what needs to be done next,' Johnson said.\n\nThe US embassy in Windhoek is negotiating with the Namibian health ministry to weigh the possibility of deploying a 2nd team of epidemiologists from the CDC to provide Namibia with medical and technical assistance.\n\nHepatitis E is a liver infection that is spread through direct contact with fecal material from an infected person or by indirect fecal contamination of food or water sources.

For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1. Control of the outbreaks is not rocket science; providing clean water is the answer.\n\nThe following regarding hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy is extracted from: Chaudhry SA, Verma N, Koren G. Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy. Can Fam Physician. 2015;61: 607-608:\n\n'Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and in the 3rd trimester, especially with genotype 1, is associated with more severe infection and might lead to fulminant hepatic failure and maternal death (11-13). Although the mechanism of liver injury is not yet clear, it is possible that interplay of hormonal and immunologic changes during pregnancy, along with a high viral load of HEV, renders the woman more vulnerable (14). Immunologic changes during pregnancy promote the maintenance of the fetus in the maternal environment by suppression of T cell-mediated immunity, rendering pregnant women more susceptible to viral infections like HEV infection. During pregnancy, levels of progesterone, estrogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin increase as pregnancy advances. These hormones play a considerable role in altering immune regulation and increasing viral replications (15).\n\nHepatitis E infection with genotype 1 during the 3rd trimester can lead to maternal mortality in up to 15 per cent to 25 per cent of cases (16). Most of the studies showing high maternal mortality are from India, where infection occurs in epidemics. There is a very high risk of vertical transmission of HEV from the mother to the fetus. During a Delhi epidemic, a hospital-based study revealed that HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in 56 per cent of infants (6). One recent study highlights that HEV infection might be responsible for 2400 to 3000 stillbirths each year in developing countries, with many additional fetal deaths linked to antenatal maternal deaths (11). There is a very high risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with HEV infection, with poor neonatal survival rates (11,17). In 2 separate studies from India, 15 per cent to 50 per cent of live-born infants of mothers with HEV infection died within 1 week of birth (11,18). During an outbreak in Sudan in 2010 to 2011, among 39 pregnant women with HEV infection there were 14 intrauterine deaths and 9 premature deliveries (19).'\n\nReferences:\n-----------\n6.

Researchers from Hamburg and Hannover in Germany collaborating on these studies have demonstrated that HEV infections can be fatal in immunocompromised, and in some cases, immune-competent individuals. They also demonstrated that blood products are an important source of infection in those who are immunosuppressed.\n\nHepatitis E virus infection is one of the leading causes of acute viral hepatitis worldwide, with 2 main genotypes (genotypes 1 and 3) affecting humans. Genotype 1 predominates in low-income countries and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, while genotype 3 predominates in high-income countries and has been linked to the consumption of contaminated pork or shellfish products. The reported incidence of HEV infection has been increasing steadily across Europe, with more than 21 000 cases reported in a recently evaluated decade (2005-2015).\n\nIn a large observational study presented this week [10-14 Apr 2018] in Paris, 150 HEV RNA-positive individuals were identified retrospectively from the records of 2 tertiary referral hospitals and transplant centers in Northern Germany. Of the 69 immune-competent individuals identified, 37 (53 percent) were hospitalized for a total of 74 days, and 2 of these individuals who had preexisting liver disease died after developing acute-on-chronic liver failure. 8 (10 percent) immunosuppressed patients died within 5 years of being diagnosed with HEV infection, with 3 of these deaths considered to be related to the HEV infection.\n\n'We have shown in this study that HEV infection can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and that a severe disease course is not limited to those who are immunocompromised', said Dr Sven Pischke from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany.

As a result, the country has limited capacity for hepatitis E laboratory diagnosis. Additionally, the majority of hepatitis E cases have been reported from informal settlements within the capital district, Windhoek, where living conditions are poor. These areas are overcrowded, and have limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. Moreover, the holiday season will likely increase the movement of people within the country. All of these could be major contributing factors to this outbreak.\n\nAdditionally, during the rainy season, people often use rainwater or other surface water for drinking and domestic uses. This likely increases the risk of hepatitis E infection. Therefore, the above-mentioned factors might lead to the propagation of the cases from this area to other informal settlements and its distribution to other towns or districts, with similar poor environmental health conditions. Thus, the overall risk is assessed as high at the national level and low at regional and global levels.\n\nWHO advice\n------------\nWHO recommends the improvement of access to safe water and proper sanitation through different methods, including at-home water purification techniques. The water quality should be regularly monitored in the affected areas. The number of latrines in different settlements should be increased to address the issue of open defecation. In addition, the waste management and the overall hygiene practices should be improved.\n\nFurthermore, the ongoing interventions should target at-risk population through the establishment of antenatal counseling for pregnant women, improving housing conditions for those living in these informal settlements and supporting the improvement of health facilities and patients care. The local and national reference laboratory capacities should be improved for timely confirmation of suspected cases.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Namibia on the basis of the information available on the current event. The implementation of general hygiene practices and other preventive measures listed above should be sufficient to prevent the disease.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology.

Sporadic transmission of HEV genotypes 3 and 4 in high-income countries has been associated with exposure to blood and animal contact. The objective of the study was to identify the risk factors for hepatitis E and the genotype(s) causing sporadic hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We selected, from a diagnostic center in Dhaka between November 2008 and November 2009, cases presenting with jaundice and anti-HEV IgM antibodies and age-matched controls were defined as those with no history of jaundice and normal blood test results. Serum samples were tested for HEV RNA using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction followed by a sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.\n\nA total of 109 cases and 109 controls were enrolled. The cases were more likely to be male (adjusted matched odds ratios [mOR] 2.2, 95 percent CI: 1.2-3.9; P = 0.01), or have reported contact with another person's blood or blood product, or contact with blood-contaminated sharp instruments (adjusted mOR 2.1, 95 percent CI: 1.1-4.1; P = 0.03) than controls. There were no significant differences between the cases and the controls in terms of reported high-risk sexual intercourse, consumption of undercooked meat, or contact or drinking fecally-contaminated water. The sera from 3 cases carried HEV RNA, all belonging to genotype 1. Findings from this study suggest that contact with human blood and sharing sharp instruments may transmit sporadic hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Efforts to prevent the transmission of blood-borne pathogens may also prevent sporadic HEV transmission in this endemic setting.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-SoAs\n<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>\n\n[There has been increased interest, especially in Europe, of assessing the risk of HEV transmission via blood transfusion in order to assess the need for routine screening. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis E is generally self-limited without a chronic phase but it is clear, especially with genotype 3 that chronic infection may occur.

Experts traced the shopping habits of 60 infected people to a form of own-brand sausages from a retailer known only as 'supermarket X'. The British government has declined to name the specific shop, but multiple sources reportedly told The Sunday Times that it was Tesco.\n\nThe strain, hepatitis E, is typically found in pork products imported into the UK from Europe. According to the PHE website, signs of the disease in humans vary from no symptoms to liver failure. In rare cases, it can prove fatal, particularly in pregnant women. This week (20 Aug 2017), the Sunday Times reported that research completed back in 2016 was withheld from publication until now over alleged 'sensitivity'.\n\nScientists believe that imported pork products infect 150 000-200 000 British citizens a year. The paper said: 'The implicated products are pork sausages, which require cooking prior to consumption, and ready-to-eat pre-packed sliced ham.' It noted that 'Only supermarket X, especially own brand, was significantly associated with [the virus].'\n\nTesco has not commented on the findings, but told The Sunday Times that it had already started a conversation with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) about how to minimize the spread of such viruses. 'The association with the supermarket does not infer any blame,' PHE said.\n\nOne scientist, professor Richard Tedder of the government's National Infection Service agency, agreed. 'Something appears to have changed in animal husbandry so too many pigs are infected at slaughter. This is a problem for meat producers and all retailers, not just one.'\n\nPerson to person transmission of the virus is very rare, however it has been known to pass on via blood transfusions, PHE has said. The numbers of confirmed hepatitis E cases and infections increased significantly between 2010 and 2016, it warned. According to a report on PigWorld [http://tinyurl.com/yd4fd34r], a spokesperson from the National Pig Association (NPA) acknowledged the sudden spike in cases but said that 'further research and surveillance' was required to 'determine the true cause of the rise in hepatitis E cases in the UK.' The statement continued: 'NPA recommends that consumers follow the advice from the Food Standards Agency that pork and sausages should be cooked thoroughly until steaming hot throughout, with no pink or red in the center, to greatly reduce the risk of infection.'\n\n[byline: Jason Murdock]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The publication cited is:\nSaid B, Usdin M, Warburton F, et al.

Epub 2017 Jul 31; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28756783\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\n'Since 2010, human hepatitis E infections have increased in England and Wales. Most cases are locally acquired and caused by hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV G3). HEV G3 is linked to the consumption of pork products. The increase is associated with the emergence of a new phylotype, HEV G3-group 2 (G3-2, also known as G3abcdhij). 60 individuals with confirmed hepatitis E infection and no history of travel outside the UK were recruited: 19 were infected with HEV G3-group 1 (G3-1 or G3efg) and 41 with G3-2. Epidemiological data relating to usual shopping habits and consumption of ham and sausages were analysed together with typing data to identify any associations with HEV phylotype. Study participants who purchased ham and/or sausage from a major supermarket were more likely to have HEV G3-2 infection (relative risks 1.85, P = 0\u00b706, CI 0\u00b797-3\u00b753). The HEV G3-2 phylotype has not been detected in indigenous UK pigs and it is suggested that human infections could be the result of consumption of products made from pork originating outside the UK. This does not infer blame on the supermarket but the epidemiology of HEV is dynamic and reflects complex animal husbandry practices which need to be explored further.'\n\nThis report underscores the importance of zoonotic hepatitis E (primarily genotype 3) as the cause of hepatitis E emergence in Europe. There are currently 7 genotypes of HEV and genotypes 1 and 2 are not zoonotic and cause most of the HEV infections in Africa and Asia. It is these genotypes that cause increased morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. Most of the zoonotic hepatitis E cases have been recognized in the developed world, are associated with foodborne disease (usually undercooked pork products) and are caused by genotype 3. In addition, infection with genotype 3 when occurring in immunocompromised hosts (especially solid organ transplant recipients) can cause chronic infection which can progress to cirrhosis. Ribavirin has been used to treat such individuals with chronic infection.\n\nThe author's summary of their work states 'Study participants who purchased ham and/or sausage from a major supermarket were more likely to have HEV G3-2 infection (Relative risks 1.85, P = 0\u00b706, CI 0\u00b797-3\u00b753)' although the posting above quotes the paper (?in the full text which is not available to this moderator) as 'Only supermarket X, especially own brand, was significantly associated with [the virus].' The statistics noted in the summary gives a relative risk of 1.85 which supports an increased risk of almost 2 times but the p value of 0.06 and a confidence interval overlapping 1.0 both do not reach statistical significance so 'more likely' is better than 'significantly associated'. Be that as it may, there is no doubt that acquisition of zoonotic HEV in Europe is clearly linked to ingestion of undercooked pork products that was carrying the virus. Adequate cooking and appropriate kitchen practices to avoid cross-contamination will minimize, if not erase totally, this risk. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40.]", "summary": "\n\n[byline: Jason Murdock]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The publication cited is:\nSaid B, Usdin M, Warburton F, et al.

'When it rains, the whole camp gets covered in mud and dirty water.

Since the declaration of the epidemic by the Health authorities on the [Wed 19 Apr] 2017, a total of 1987 cases have been declared with 38 deaths recorded. Up to [Tue 25 Apr 2017] the mortality rate was 29 percent dropping to 1.91 percent by [Thu 12 Oct 2017]. Analysis of reported cases reveal that women and people aged 15 and over are the most likely affected.\n\nPersonnel from the Health authorities and partners from the Humanitarian sector are working jointly to ensure an effective response to those in need.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The dramatic drop in the case fatality rate of this outbreak of hepatitis E suggests that most of the cases are not occurring in pregnant women. Much of the mortality in hepatitis E occurs in women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nThe following regarding hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy is extracted from: Chaudhry SA, Verma N and Koren G: Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy. Can Fam Physician. 2015; 6(7)1: 607-608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4501603/.\n\n'Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and in the 3rd trimester, especially with genotype 1, is associated with more severe infection and might lead to fulminant hepatic failure and maternal death (11-13). Although the mechanism of liver injury is not yet clear, it is possible that interplay of hormonal and immunologic changes during pregnancy, along with a high viral load of HEV, renders the woman more vulnerable (14). Immunologic changes during pregnancy promote the maintenance of the fetus in the maternal environment by suppression of T cell-mediated immunity, rendering pregnant women more susceptible to viral infections like HEV infection. During pregnancy, levels of progesterone, estrogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin increase as pregnancy advances. These hormones play a considerable role in altering immune regulation and increasing viral replications (15).\n\n'Hepatitis E infection with genotype 1 during the 3rd trimester can lead to maternal mortality in up to 15 percent to 25 percent of cases (16). Most of the studies showing high maternal mortality are from India, where infection occurs in epidemics. There is a very high risk of vertical transmission of HEV from the mother to the fetus. During a Delhi epidemic, a hospital-based study revealed that HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in 56 percent of infants (6). One recent study highlights that HEV infection might be responsible for 2400 to 3000 stillbirths each year in developing countries, with many additional fetal deaths linked to antenatal maternal deaths (11). There is a very high risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with HEV infection, with poor neonatal survival rates (11,17). In 2 separate studies from India, 15 percent to 50 percent of live-born infants of mothers with HEV infection died within one week of birth (11,18). During an outbreak in Sudan in 2010 to 2011, among 39 pregnant women with HEV infection there were 14 intrauterine deaths and 9 premature deliveries (19).'\n\nReferences\n----------\n6.

The 1st case was detected on 3 May 2017 in Damasak, a locality at the border with the Republic of the Niger. Samples were collected from the case and sent to laboratory for confirmation. Cases were later reported in Ngala, one of the local government areas in Borno State that borders Cameroon. As of 2 Jul 2017, 146 confirmed and suspected cases were reported including 21 confirmed cases.\n\nIn Ngala, 25 infected pregnant women (21 percent) were reported, including 2 deaths (case fatality rate = 8 percent). Cases were reported from 3 local government areas: Ngala (112), Mobbar (19), and Monguno (14). The number of hepatitis E cases is highest in Ngala with 29 cases reported from 19 Jun to 2 Jul 2017. 27 samples were shipped to the virology laboratory in Lagos for further diagnosis. Among the samples collected and tested, 21 tested positive (10 in Ngala, 7 in Mobbar, 4 in Monguno) and 6 tested negative. 23 samples have been collected and are pending laboratory tests.\n\nThis hepatitis E outbreak can propagate rapidly due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region, which arises from the volatile security situation in north-eastern Nigeria and continues to persist. This crisis in Nigeria has been ongoing for 8 years and as a result 1.9 million people are internally displaced. The region has been facing intense movements of population coming from refugee camps or displaced populations in the areas bordering Chad and Niger. In addition, the fresh wave of returnees from neighbouring countries is overwhelming the current humanitarian capacity. Returnees began entering the town in January 2017 and so far the town has an estimated population of 90 000, according to International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and immigration officials. The town has one unofficial camp hosting returnees considered as strangers or people not affiliated to any of the indigenous communities who have settled in the town. As a result there is overcrowding which is overwhelming the already weak systems in place. Lack of access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services may lead to propagation of this disease at a very rapid rate.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nCoordinating partners in this response include WHO, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Oxfam (representing the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sector), M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), FHI 360, ICRC (working with Nigerian Red Cross), and North East Regional Initiative (NERI). Response activities for this outbreak include the following:\n- WHO and MSF are supporting case management at no cost to patients and this includes hospitalization of those in need, availability of drugs, and health personnel. Symptomatic case management is supported by MSF at the district level;\n- epidemiological surveillance system at health facilities exists with the support of local partners;\n- technical support is being provided from WHO and other partners;\n- as of 15 Jun 2017, WASH assessed and mapped the current water sources and established contacts for a rapid response in the chlorination of water;\n- a multisectoral approach needs to be emphasized and coordinated between the State Ministry of Health, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, and Ministries of Water and Environment;\n- public health awareness through sensitizations and announcements in mosques and other public places by local government area health educators is taking place. In addition, local health personnel are being sensitized, 8 Volunteer Community Mobilizers (VCMs), the health care staff, MSF, UNICEF, and FHI 360.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nNigeria shares an international border with 4 countries: Chad and Cameroon in the east, Republic of the Niger to the north, and Republic of Benin on the west. The areas of insecurity are located in north-eastern Nigeria, bordering Republic of the Niger, Cameroon, and Chad. The hepatitis E outbreak is taking place in this same area.\n\nThis area is characterized by a hepatitis E outbreak in neighboring Chad and in Republic of the Niger. The ongoing humanitarian crisis and insecurity, high numbers of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) and refugees, and poor access to safe water leads to the spread of disease. There are also an increasing number of displaced persons moving back to the region post occupation. In addition, the potential cross-border contamination and subsequent increased risk of spread from Republic of the Niger and other neighboring countries should be considered. There are a number of refugee and IDP camps that are overcrowded and have poor sanitation conditions thereby increasing the risk of hepatitis E. Therefore the observed risk at the national level is high.\n\nThe risk at regional level is moderate especially in the countries around the humanitarian crisis in north-eastern Nigeria. The risk at global level is low.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nWHO recommends the improvement of the quality and access to safe drinking water, through different methods including the use of at home water purification techniques. The quality of water should be regularly monitored in the affected areas.\n\nIn addition, WHO recommends the improvement of sanitation by treating and dispensing of human waste correctly as well as improving personal hygiene and the preparation of safe and clean food. The number of latrines in different camps should be increased to address open defecation.\n\nThe ongoing interventions should target at risk populations through establishment of antenatal counselling for pregnant women, improving housing conditions for refugees and IDPs, and supporting partners in improving health facilities and care.\n\nThe local and national reference laboratory capacities should be improved for timely confirmation of suspected cases. Cross-border interventions should be strengthened through the Lake Chad sub-regional approach for the management of the current outbreak.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on the current event.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 1 and 2 are the major waterborne forms of HEV and they tend to occur in the developing world, especially Africa and Asia.

Even more troubling, the virus seems to be circulating among displaced populations who frequently uproot and migrate, making it that much harder to contain.\n\nFollowing a recent visit to northeast Nigeria, Dr Philippa Easterbrook, a senior scientist for the WHO's global hepatitis program, spoke to Devex about a recently-developed WHO response plan created to reduce the number of new cases of the virus and provide training to local health workers as a means of improving case management and diagnosis.\n\nThis water-borne infection was 1st reported in August 2016 in Chad's Samalat region, to the country's southeast. As of July 2017, the country had reported more than 1600 suspected or confirmed cases, and 18 deaths. The virus then surfaced in neighboring Niger in January 2017, in the Diffa region, an area near the Chad and Nigeria borders. Hepatitis E cases here spiked dramatically in mid-April 2017, and decreased before then increasing again. Now approximately 1450 people are suspected to have been infected, more than half of those women, with 38 fatalities.\n\nWith the frequent movement of internally displaced populations, the infection eventually arrived in Nigeria in May 2017, in Damasak, a town near the Niger border, and has since seen 696 cases total, mostly at the Ngala internally displaced people's camp, near the Cameroon border in Borno state.\n\nCurrently, all cases of hepatitis E in the Lake Chad region have been among displaced persons and refugees, Easterbrook explained. 'This led us to the working hypothesis that these outbreaks are all linked and related to large population movements,' she said.\n\nWithout immediate attention, humanitarians are concerned that the virus could spread even further within impacted countries and even into unaffected areas, such as neighboring Cameroon or the Central African Republic. Even more so, this outbreak is highlighting the unsanitary water conditions affecting those impacted by conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nHepatitis E is most dangerous in pregnant women, and has an incubation period of 2 to 10 weeks where the infection remains asymptomatic and undetected in most people. Usually symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as: Low-grade fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and most notably jaundice. Because the virus carries symptoms also seen in hepatitis A, yellow fever and malaria cases, diagnosing patients and managing cases can be a challenge. Roughly 5 percent of cases develop more serious complications, according to Easterbrook, however the biggest risk is developing acute liver failure, or in pregnant women, post-partum hemorrhaging which can be fatal.\n\nThe most pressing agenda in the response plan is the improvement of water and sanitation hygiene in the region. As the virus spreads via contaminated water, Easterbrook cited that the improvement of WASH conditions would not only support the reduction in new hepatitis E cases, but could also reduce the prevalence of other infectious diseases, namely hepatitis A, cholera, and typhoid.\n\nTo date, roughly 200 restrooms and 100 showers have been constructed in Ngala camp. WHO has also worked with local partners to rehabilitate water points and distribute hygiene kits, which include items such as sanitary napkins and water purification tablets, to women and households. However, cultural barriers impede the progress of these initiatives.\n\n'Some people would rather have low-level restroom facilities rather than walk some distance to a more modernized latrine,' Easterbrook explained.\n\n[Byline: Christin Roby]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 1 and 2 are the major waterborne forms of HEV and they tend to occur in the developing world, especially Africa and Asia.

Four out of 9 biological samples obtained from the initial cases tested positive for hepatitis E virus at a virology laboratory in Lagos, thus confirming the outbreak.\n\nThe current hepatitis E outbreak in the north-east Borno State of Nigeria is taking place within the context of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the northern part of the country. The outbreak is occurring in the aftermath of increasing population movements within the Lake Chad basin, following the gradually improving security situation.

Although the mechanism of liver injury is not yet clear, it is possible that interplay of hormonal and immunologic changes during pregnancy, along with a high viral load of HEV, renders the woman more vulnerable (14). Immunologic changes during pregnancy promote the maintenance of the fetus in the maternal environment by suppression of T cell-mediated immunity, rendering pregnant women more susceptible to viral infections like HEV infection. During pregnancy, levels of progesterone, estrogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin increase as pregnancy advances. These hormones play a considerable role in altering immune regulation and increasing viral replications (15).\n\n'Hepatitis E infection with genotype 1 during the 3rd trimester can lead to maternal mortality in up to 15 percent to 25 percent of cases (16). Most of the studies showing high maternal mortality are from India, where infection occurs in epidemics. There is a very high risk of vertical transmission of HEV from the mother to the fetus. During a Delhi epidemic, a hospital-based study revealed that HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in 56 percent of infants (6). One recent study highlights that HEV infection might be responsible for 2400 to 3000 stillbirths each year in developing countries, with many additional fetal deaths linked to antenatal maternal deaths (11). There is a very high risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with HEV infection, with poor neonatal survival rates (11,17). In 2 separate studies from India, 15 percent to 50 percent of live-born infants of mothers with HEV infection died within 1 week of birth (11,18). During an outbreak in Sudan in 2010 to 2011, among 39 pregnant women with HEV infection there were 14 intrauterine deaths and 9 premature deliveries (19).'\n\nReferences\n----------\n6.

Of the 186 women admitted to the main maternal and pediatric health centre in the town of Diffa [from 2 Jan 2017 to 11 Jun 2017], 34 died of severe complications related to the disease. Of the 876 cases of hepatitis E reported by [11 Jun 2017], the majority are displaced people and refugees, 247 900 according to the authorities. As the disease spreads mainly through contaminated water, the current outbreak highlights poor water and sanitation conditions and the lack of adequate sanitation facilities among these people, already affected by the violence of the ongoing conflict between Boko Haram and the armies of the region.\n\nInstability and lack of infrastructure\n--------------------------------------\nIn Diffa, where access to healthcare has been hampered in particular by insecurity, the lack of adequate water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure has an even greater impact on the health situation. Several sites within the displaced camps and communities do not have an adequate supply of drinking water, leaving some of the needs of the most vulnerable populations unmet. In addition, there is a lack of latrines, and those that are in place are in poor conditions.\n\nFrom the experience of other hepatitis E outbreaks in Africa, the Diffa one could last for several more months. The number of suspected cases may increase further in the near future, with the arrival of the rainy season, usually from June to September. 'Given the scarcity of water for the most vulnerable populations, the risk is that alternative sources that can spread the outbreak will be used, such as the supply from streams and other natural water points formed by accumulated rain water. These collection points are considered as potential vectors of the disease', explains Audace Ntezukobagira, emergency coordinator for MSF in Diffa. 'It is also important to take into account that these people do not have the material or financial means to stock up on wood or gas, to boil the water in order to make it suitable for consumption.'\n\nWater, hygiene and sanitation\n-----------------------------\nTo respond to the outbreak, one of the priorities is the strengthening of water and sanitation activities. However, the current response has not yet reached the standard required due to insufficient resources and coordination between humanitarian actors.\n\nAt certain sites, for example, it can be seen that jerry cans which are unsuitable for transporting water are not systematically collected when they are replaced. 'This provokes a clear problem in terms of the risk of spreading the disease, as well as creating confusion as new jerry cans could be distributed several times in the same place', says Sabiou Mansour, logistics manager for the MSF emergency team in Diffa. 'It is deplorable, considering the efforts already provided in the region and the magnitude of the needs.'\n\nSince April 2017, MSF has strengthened its capacity to deploy emergency sanitation and hygiene measures at 11 sites. The teams working on more than 130 functional water points ensured that more than 6300 cubic-meters of water was chlorinated, 127 300 jerry cans were washed, nearly 3400 old ones were replaced with new ones, and cleaning kits, including more than 36 800 soaps, were distributed.\n\nFor Sani Toubomrabo, a Nigerian community leader based in Garin Wazam, 'the chlorinated water we bring home is useful to avoid getting sick, which is why we collaborate with the health agents present at the water points.'\n\nPatient treatment\n-----------------\nThe response to the outbreak also includes free management of patients in health facilities at the community level and referral to hospital for those patients who develop complications.\n\nIn this respect, MSF teams are supporting the health authorities with human and material resources that have been deployed to deal with the situation. In addition to medical treatment, patients with hepatitis E receive psychological support. The organization also provides technical support for health staff in the structures in which it operates in order to ensure free and high-quality care for patients. A decrease in mortality was also observed among women with severe complications related to the disease admitted to the main maternal and paediatric health centre in the town of Diffa.\n\nAwareness-raising in the heart of the community\n-----------------------------------------------\nHealth promotion activities in the health facilities and the community have also been set up by MSF. To date [Tue 20 Jun 2017], nearly 32 000 people have been informed, including patients and their families. At the same time, MSF is actively looking for cases in villages, which has already led to the referral of more than 400 people to health centres.\n\nMSF in Diffa\n------------\nSince the end of 2014, MSF has been working in the Diffa region to help those fleeing violence related to the presence of the Boko Haram group and military intervention in the region. MSF provides free medical and psychological assistance in 7 health centres in the region. In addition, the organization supports the supply of drinking water supply, the construction of latrines and the distribution of essential items in several villages and places where refugees, returnees and displaced people have gathered.\n\nIn addition, MSF is supporting the Ministry of Health in 2 hospitals: the Nguigmi Hospital and the main maternal and child health centre in the Diffa town. In both hospitals, MSF is working in reproductive and pediatric health units, and provides mental health support. At the hospital in Nguigmi, the team also treats children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Much of the mortality in hepatitis E occurs in woman in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nThe following regarding hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy is extracted from: Chaudhry SA, Verma N and Koren G: Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy.

These types can cause significant outbreaks (as what is occurring currently in Niger) with acute hepatitis deaths especially in 2nd and 3rd trimester pregnant women. Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic with swine being a major reservoir and tend to be seen in the developed world. Type 3 in particular can cause chronic infection, especially in the immunocompromised host.\n\nGenotypes 5, 6 and 7 are rarely mentioned in clinical reports on human HEV [hepatitis E virus] infection; 5 and 6 have been isolated from wild boar only and 7 from camels and a single human. Regarding the genotypes, the following is extracted from Lhomme S, Marion O, Abravanel F, Chapuy-Regaud S, Kamar N and Izopet J: Hepatitis E pathogenesis. Viruses. 2016 Aug; 8(8): 212:\n\n'The increasing number of HEV strains identified in various hosts has led to a taxonomic scheme that divides the family _Hepeviridae_ into 2 genera: _Piscihepevirus_ (cutthroat trout virus) and _Orthohepevirus_ (mammalian and avian strains) [10,11]. This last genus has been divided into 4 species, _Orthohepevirus A_, _Orthohepevirus B_ (infecting birds), _Orthohepevirus C_ (infecting rodents, soricomorphs, and carnivores), and _Orthohepevirus D_ (infecting bats). The largest species, _Orthohepevirus A_, includes 7 genotypes that infect humans (HEV1, 2, 3, 4, and 7), pigs (HEV3 and 4), rabbits (HEV3), wild boar (HEV3, 4, 5, and 6), mongooses (HEV3), deer (HEV3), yaks (HEV4) and camels (HEV7). Among the 4 major genotypes, HEV1 and HEV2 are restricted to humans and are found in developing countries. HEV3 is widely distributed around the world and HEV4 is found mainly in Asia. The HEV3 and HEV4 genotypes are transmitted zoonotically from pigs, wild boars, deer, and mongooses [12]. Rabbit strains that are closed to HEV3 have recently been described in humans [13].

The figures were communicated today, 3 Jun 2017, in the latest report of the UN Office of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which points out that the main focus of the epidemic is in the city of Diffa, capital of the province of the same name, where there are 230 cases. Women are particularly affected, accounting for 61 percent of cases compared to 39 percent of men [see updated numbers from UN OCHA in the comment below].\n\nIn order to fight against the epidemic, Diffa health workers and workers of humanitarian agencies carry out constant prevention campaigns, particularly hygiene habits, and improvement of access points to drinking water and sanitation systems. In the refugee camps (mostly Nigerian), which are plentiful in the Diffa region, drums of 20 liters of drinking water are being distributed and latrines and lavatories are being built to reduce the risk of contagion linked to human promiscuity, explained a humanitarian agent in Diffa.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-ESP\n<promed-esp@promedmail.org>\n\n[The UN Office of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) report on the hepatitis E epidemic in Diffa region of Niger (in French, available at http://bit.ly/2swRm2m) indicates that as of 3 Jun 2017, 800 cases including 33 deaths had been reported. Of these, 308 cases (38 percent) and 1 death (a 12-year-old boy) were reported among men and 492 cases (62 percent) and 32 deaths among women.\n\nMaps of Niger can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Niger.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32620.\n\nAlthough not stated in this post, much of the mortality in hepatitis E occurs in woman in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nThe following regarding hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy is extracted from: Chaudhry SA, Verma N, Koren G: Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy. Can Fam Physician. 2015; 6(7)1: 607-608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4501603/.\n\n'Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and in the 3rd trimester, especially with genotype 1, is associated with more severe infection and might lead to fulminant hepatic failure and maternal death (11-13). Although the mechanism of liver injury is not yet clear, it is possible that interplay of hormonal and immunologic changes during pregnancy, along with a high viral load of HEV, renders the woman more vulnerable (14). Immunologic changes during pregnancy promote the maintenance of the fetus in the maternal environment by suppression of T cell-mediated immunity, rendering pregnant women more susceptible to viral infections like HEV infection. During pregnancy, levels of progesterone, estrogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin increase as pregnancy advances. These hormones play a considerable role in altering immune regulation and increasing viral replications (15).\n\nHepatitis E infection with genotype 1 during the 3rd trimester can lead to maternal mortality in up to 15 per cent to 25 per cent of cases (16). Most of the studies showing high maternal mortality are from India, where infection occurs in epidemics. There is a very high risk of vertical transmission of HEV from the mother to the fetus. During a Delhi epidemic, a hospital-based study revealed that HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in 56 per cent of infants (6). One recent study highlights that HEV infection might be responsible for 2400 to 3000 stillbirths each year in developing countries, with many additional fetal deaths linked to antenatal maternal deaths (11). There is a very high risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with HEV infection, with poor neonatal survival rates (11,17). In 2 separate studies from India, 15 per cent to 50 per cent of live-born infants of mothers with HEV infection died within 1 week of birth (11,18). During an outbreak in Sudan in 2010 to 2011, among 39 pregnant women with HEV infection there were 14 intrauterine deaths and 9 premature deliveries (19).'\n\nReferences\n----------\n6.

In the field, NGOs are working to improve access to drinking water and a 'response plan' to the USD 9 million epidemic has been prepared. Elmounzer Ag Jiddou, MSF's head of mission in Niger, urged the country's authorities and all organizations to 'ensure adequate water supply and sanitation'.\n\nTo curb the scourge, the Nigerian Ministry of Health regularly calls 'populations to vigilance' and to go to a health center as soon as symptoms appear. Fever, headache, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dark urine are the main signs of hepatitis E, a liver disease caused by a virus that is transmitted fecally-orally, mainly via contaminated water.\n\nThe Diffa region, which has suffered attacks from Boko Haram since 2015, is home to more than 300 000 refugees and displaced persons, thousands of whom live at the expense of a very poor local population, according to the UN.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-FRA\n<promed-fra@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Niger can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Niger.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32620.\n\nThe following regarding hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy is extracted from: Chaudhry SA, Verma N, Koren G.

Most of the studies showing high maternal mortality are from India, where infection occurs in epidemics. There is a very high risk of vertical transmission of HEV from the mother to the fetus. During a Delhi epidemic, a hospital-based study revealed that HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in 56 per cent of infants (6). One recent study highlights that HEV infection might be responsible for 2400 to 3000 stillbirths each year in developing countries, with many additional fetal deaths linked to antenatal maternal deaths (11). There is a very high risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with HEV infection, with poor neonatal survival rates (11,17). In 2 separate studies from India, 15 per cent to 50 per cent of live-born infants of mothers with HEV infection died within 1 week of birth (11,18). During an outbreak in Sudan in 2010 to 2011, among 39 pregnant women with HEV infection there were 14 intrauterine deaths and 9 premature deliveries (19).'\n\nReferences\n----------\n6.

HEV genotype 3 predominates in high-income countries, including those in Europe. Transmission of this genotype is usually zoonotic and has been linked to the consumption of pork products, and in some instances, shellfish [1-3]. Infection, which is most often asymptomatic, may cause an acute self-limiting hepatitis, with symptomatic infection more commonly reported among men older than 50 years of age [4,5]. Reports of chronic infection among immunocompromised people or those with pre-existing liver disease have been described [4].\n\nThere is evidence that HEV is an under-recognized pathogen in high-income countries, and that the incidence of confirmed cases has been steadily increasing over the last decade [6-10]. Although population studies have shown stable or decreasing seroprevalence rates [11,12], some countries have reported a consistently high seroprevalence and proportion of HEV-RNA-positive blood donors [13-16]. A systematic review conducted by the WHO reported HEV seroprevalence (as denoted by presence of IgG antibody) to range from 0.03 percent to 52 percent among the general population and blood donors in the WHO European Region, with the highest prevalence reported from studies in blood donors from France and the Netherlands [17]. Evidence of current HEV infection in up to 77 percent of patients presenting with symptomatic acute hepatitis suggests that the virus could be a considerable cause of liver morbidity in European countries [17]. However, the use of different serological test systems significantly influences the estimates of seroprevalence [18].\n\nEurope-wide surveillance is not in place for hepatitis E, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has launched a number of activities that aim to better understand the current epidemiology, as well as the national monitoring systems for HEV infection within European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. A recent study involving HEV experts from 17 countries documented an increase in reported cases in nearly all EU/EEA countries that provided data, with France, Germany, England and Wales, and the Netherlands reporting more hepatitis E than hepatitis A notifications. The study also highlighted a lack of consistency in the reporting of cases, and wide variation in surveillance activity and case definitions [7]. The current study builds on this work to conduct a wider assessment of testing, diagnosis, surveillance activities and confirmed cases of HEV infection in the EU/EEA in order to inform the Europe-wide response to this emerging infection.\n\nMethods\n-------\nA semi-structured survey of EU/EEA countries was conducted during 2015/16. The survey was divided into 4 sections (surveillance, testing and diagnosis, data on diagnosed cases, and transfusion-associated HEV infections) to allow separate country-level respondents for each topic area with a total of 24 open and closed questions [19]. A pilot survey was conducted at a meeting of the ECDC HEV expert group in December 2015, and a revised survey was subsequently circulated by email to nominated representatives of ECDC's networks, the National Focal Points for Food- and Waterborne Diseases and Zoonoses as well as for Microbiology and Surveillance, in February 2016. Respondents were given 3 weeks to complete the survey (which could be completed electronically), and email and phone reminders were used to follow up with those who had not responded.\n\nReturned survey data were manually extracted into Excel and double-checked. Any unclear responses were checked by email communication with the respective experts. Analyses were conducted in Excel and STATA version 13. The United Kingdom (UK) provided 3 separate responses (from England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland) which were considered as a single country response for all quantitative analyses and listed separately for qualitative analyses. A descriptive analysis was performed. The proportion of hospitalized cases was calculated using data exclusively from countries reporting hospital data, with the number of total cases as denominator. The Eurostat population database from 2015 was used as source of population denominator data [20].\n\nResults\n-------\nAll EU/EEA countries with the exception of Liechtenstein responded to the survey, giving a response rate of 30 out of 31. The data provided from countries that conduct surveillance was comprehensive, detailed and of high quality.\n\nHepatitis E surveillance systems:\nOf 30 responding countries, 20 had specific surveillance systems for HEV infection. The remaining 10 countries had more generic viral hepatitis syndromic surveillance with no plans to develop any specific surveillance for HEV infection. Of the 20 EU/EEA countries with specific systems for HEV infection, 15 had national surveillance systems, 3 had laboratory surveillance through national reference laboratories with unknown coverage, 1 had blood service surveillance with unknown coverage, and 1 had a sentinel surveillance system covering approximately half of the population.\n\nA total of 13 of 20 surveillance systems specific for HEV infection had a case definition for confirmed cases. There was wide variation in the type of case definition used: 7 used laboratory and clinical definitions, and 6 used a laboratory definition only (Figure 1 - for Figures and Tables, see original URL - Mod. LL0. Most surveillance systems collected demographic information as well as the date of notification and onset of disease, whereas morbidity and mortality data were collected less frequently (Table 1). Two countries' surveillance systems (Ireland and the UK (England and Wales)) differentiated between acute and chronic HEV infection: acute infection was defined as both HEV-IgM-positive and IgG-positive, or HEV-RNA-positive, and chronic infection was defined as HEV RNA persisting for at least 3 months.\n\nHepatitis E testing and diagnosis\n---------------------------------\nA total of 26 countries conducted HEV testing in their own countries, with 2 countries sending samples abroad for testing and 2 reporting their testing availability as unknown. In 12 countries, there were less than 5 laboratories able to conduct diagnostic tests for HEV. Laboratories in 20 countries used more than one type of test (Table 2). For HEV antibody testing in acute cases, IgM ELISA was used in 21 countries and IgM Western Blot in 11. Of the 22 countries using any IgM antibody test, 20 also used IgG ELISA and nine IgG Western Blot for the detection of IgG antibodies. Up to 19 countries reported that they were able to conduct HEV RNA testing; all used serum/plasma and 12 also used stool specimens. Up to 17 countries reported that HEV sequencing was conducted for epidemiological investigations (15 countries), for research purposes (14 countries) or as routine practice (10 countries). Ten countries provided information on why a laboratory might conduct a test for HEV. Two countries had a laboratory policy on testing for HEV: (i) UK (Scotland), where some laboratories automatically test for HEV if alanine transaminase (ALT)\u2009was \u2265\u2009100 U/L, and (ii) Ireland, where an HEV test is automatically conducted if a test for hepatitis A virus (HAV) is requested. The remaining countries reported that HEV testing was conducted only at the request of a clinician.\n\nConfirmed cases of hepatitis E virus infection\n----------------------------------------------\nA total of 22 countries covering 469 million people (i.e. 91 percent of the EU/EEA population of 514 million people) provided data on confirmed cases of hepatitis E (Figure 2). The total number of reported cases increased from 514 cases in 2005 to 5617 cases in 2015, with 21 018 cases overall during the 11-year period studied (Figure 2). A total of 93 percent (19 531/21 018) of cases were accounted for by countries that have had hepatitis E-specific surveillance since at least 2005, and 80 percent (16 810/21 018) of cases were reported from just 3 countries (Germany, France, and the UK), which comprise 41 percent of the EU/EEA population. In 16 countries providing data on the age of reported cases, the overall proportion of those aged more than 50 years increased from 30-47 percent during 2005-2008 to 60-61 percent during 2013-2015. In 17 countries providing data on the sex of reported cases, the proportion of male cases remained stable over 2005-2015, ranging from 61 percent in 2005 and 2015 to 69 percent in 2006.\n\nSeverity associated with hepatitis E virus infection\n----------------------------------------------------\nData from 14 countries reporting on the total number of hospitalizations related to HEV infection showed an increase from 85 hospitalized cases in 2005 to 1115 in 2015 (Figure 3). Most of this increase could be accounted for by 4 of the 5 countries that have conducted reporting on hospitalization status since at least 2005. Over the same time period, the proportion of cases being hospitalized has decreased from 80 percent (85/106 cases) to 55 percent (1115/2023 cases). Up to 12 countries provided data on deaths associated with HEV infection, with 5 countries recording these data since 2005. In total, 28 fatal cases were reported by 5 countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Italy), increasing from 0-2 cases per year during 2005-2011 to 4-8 cases per year during 2012-2015.\n\nTravel history of diagnosed cases\n---------------------------------\nUp to 15 countries provided data on travel history. Of hepatitis E cases reported in these countries during the period 2005-2015, 87 percent (13 511/15 525) were autochthonous (defined as locally acquired within the reporting country). The proportion of known autochthonous cases increased from 45-73 percent per year during 2006-2011 to 89-97 percent per year during 2012-2015. This suggests that the considerable increase in confirmed cases observed after 2011 (Figures 2 and 4) can largely be accounted for by locally acquired infection. A very small number of cases per year (9-36 cases) were known to be associated with travel outside of the EU/EEA.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThis study assessed testing policy and practice, laboratory diagnosis, and surveillance systems and activities for HEV infection in 31 EU/EEA countries. Up to 30 of the countries responded to the survey, providing the most comprehensive picture to date of HEV as an emerging infection among humans in Europe. The 10-fold increase in the number of cases reported between 2005 and 2015, more than 21 000 confirmed cases overall and a total of 28 deaths, underline the relevance and emerging nature of this zoonotic infection in Europe.\n\nThe survey findings demonstrate a varied response to hepatitis E across EU/EEA countries; while 2 3rds of countries have established surveillance systems, a 3rd of countries have no specific surveillance and no plans to develop any. For those with existing surveillance, nearly one 3rd do not apply a case definition for HEV infection nationally. Only 19 countries reported that they were able to conduct HEV RNA testing in-country, although there may be testing within hospitals or private settings that the national public health institutes or survey respondents are unaware of. In most countries, it was not possible to ascertain the criteria for referral or for HEV test requests. While there may be an increasing awareness of locally acquired HEV infections, there is still concern that within parts of the clinical community, HEV is not considered as a possible cause of hepatitis unless there is a recent history of travel. It is therefore likely that the infection remains under-diagnosed. There also appears to be a gap in knowledge around the testing protocols used in outpatient and hospital settings within countries, which should be investigated further to understand when, who, and why patients are tested for HEV.\n\nUp to 22 countries (comprising more than\u200990 percent of the total EU/EEA population) were able to provide data on confirmed cases for at least some of the period 2005-2015. These data demonstrate that the number of reported cases has been increasing year-on-year, with a more than threefold increase between 2011 and 2015. The majority of cases were reported by 3 countries (the UK, France and Germany) that have had surveillance systems in place since at least 2005. A small number of countries reported changes to surveillance systems during the study period; for example, Belgium created a national reference centre for HEV in 2011 and Portugal commenced web-based notification in 2014. However, there were no changes that could have contributed substantially to the increase in the number of confirmed cases. A greater awareness of and increased testing for HEV, particularly of patients presenting with acute hepatitis by general practitioners in outpatient settings, is likely to be one of the contributing factors e.g. through the inclusion of HEV in some standard diagnostic protocols. The rise in the number of symptomatic cases might also be related to the switch in virus subtypes that has been observed in some EU/EEA countries [7,21].\nThe concurrent increase in number of hospitalizations (a measure of increased HEV infection severity) and gradual decrease in proportion of total cases hospitalized between 2005 and 2015 may suggest better outpatient diagnosis and an increase in the sensitivity of the diagnostic system, i.e. a change in testing practice from hospitals to community settings. For cases where clinical information was recorded, every second case was admitted to hospital and there were 2 to 8 deaths associated with HEV infection annually during 2011-2015. These figures appear high for a disease that has previously been considered to be a mild self-limiting infection [22]. However, a testing bias and overestimation of the hospitalization rate can be assumed because of a higher likelihood that cases of severe liver disease or other comorbidities are tested for HEV. Notably, only 4 countries were able to provide data on morbidity status since 2005 and only 5 were able to provide data on case fatality since 2005, although nearly half of the EU/EEA countries indicated that they are able to collect this information as of 2015. More data are needed to address the lack of knowledge in this area.\n\nAs our results show, the number and proportion of autochthonous HEV infections has been increasing since 2005. Only a very small number of cases were known to be related to travel outside of the EU/EEA. Although genotype data were not requested from countries, it is known that autochthonous cases tend to be due to HEV genotype 3, the same genotype present in European pigs and consumed pork products; travel-related cases would be expected to be infected with genotype 1 or 4 [2-5]. Lately, there appears to have been a change in circulating subtypes in Europe. For example, the number of subtype 3c recently exceeded the numbers of subtypes 3e, f and g in humans in England and Wales [21]. Such changes may be contributing to the emergence of HEV as an important infection in humans. Changes in the pattern of food preparation and consumption may also be implicated. A case-control study in England and Wales identified pork sausages and ham purchased in supermarkets as possible sources of infection, raising concerns about whether current practice in preparing these products is sufficient to prevent HEV infection [23]. More studies among humans, animal populations and on food are essential to informing on possible sources of HEV infection.\n\nThe main limitations of this study are the variation in the denominator data for reported cases of hepatitis E (most countries were only able to provide a subset of demographic information or a limited number of years of data) and the merging of data on reported cases of hepatitis E despite the different case definitions and testing approaches used by EU/EEA countries. These limitations have in part been addressed by showing data by year of surveillance introduction and by limiting the denominator to cases where the relevant information was known. The varying number of countries providing data inconsistently over the study period prompted us not to perform any trend analysis to avoid further introduction of bias. In the future these limitations could be addressed by standardization of surveillance systems for HEV infection, harmonization of the case definition as well as testing algorithms across EU/EEA countries. This would enable better assessment of the burden of disease due to HEV in Europe and facilitate a better understanding of the actual number of performed tests or population coverage as a denominator, thus avoiding diagnostic and surveillance artefacts.\n\nIn summary, EU/EEA countries are at different stages in their surveillance and testing capacity for HEV, and there is no standardized European case definition. For the time period 2005-2015, at least 22 countries were able to report on cases infected with HEV, either through formal surveillance or existing systems of laboratory notifications. WHO's global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis asks countries to establish surveillance for viral hepatitis, particularly in blood donors [24]. Our study describes the availability of general hepatitis E surveillance in most EU/EEA countries. These data demonstrate a Europe-wide increase in reported cases, as well as a high number of reported HEV-related hospitalizations and a total of 28 deaths, between 2005 and 2015. They also provide a better understanding of the epidemiology and burden of HEV as an emerging cause of liver-related morbidity in EU/EEA countries.\n\nReferences [see original URL - Mod.LL]\n\n[Authors: Aspinall EJ, Couturier E, Faber M, et al]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This important study clearly underscores the importance of zoonotic hepatitis E (primarily genotype 3) as the cause of hepatitis E emergence in Europe. There are currently 7 genotypes of HEV and genotypes 1 and 2 are not zoonotic and cause most of the HEV infections in Africa and Asia. It is these genotypes that cause increased morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. Most of the zoonotic hepatitis E cases have been recognized in the developed world, are associated with foodborne disease (usually undercooked pork products) and are caused by genotype 3. Additionally, infection with genotype 3 when occurring in immunocompromised hosts (especially solid organ transplant recipients) can cause chronic infection which can progress to cirrhosis. Ribavirin has been used to treat such individuals with chronic infection. - Mod.LL\n\n\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6010.]", "summary": "\n\nThe main limitations of this study are the variation in the denominator data for reported cases of hepatitis E (most countries were only able to provide a subset of demographic information or a limited number of years of data) and the merging of data on reported cases of hepatitis E despite the different case definitions and testing approaches used by EU/EEA countries.

The 10-fold increase in the number of cases reported between 2005 and 2015, more than 21 000 confirmed cases overall and a total of 28 deaths, underline the relevance and emerging nature of this zoonotic infection in Europe. \n\nUp to 22 countries (comprising more than\u200990 percent of the total EU/EEA population) were able to provide data on confirmed cases for at least some of the period 2005-2015. \n\nHepatitis E surveillance systems:\nOf 30 responding countries, 20 had specific surveillance systems for HEV infection. In 16 countries providing data on the age of reported cases, the overall proportion of those aged more than 50 years increased from 30-47 percent during 2005-2008 to 60-61 percent during 2013-2015. The proportion of hospitalized cases was calculated using data exclusively from countries reporting hospital data, with the number of total cases as denominator. Two countries' surveillance systems (Ireland and the UK (England and Wales)) differentiated between acute and chronic HEV infection: acute infection was defined as both HEV-IgM-positive and IgG-positive, or HEV-RNA-positive, and chronic infection was defined as HEV RNA persisting for at least 3 months. Source: Eurosurveillance, Volume 22, Issue 26 [edited]\nhttp://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22824\n\n\nHepatitis E virus infection in Europe: surveillance and descriptive epidemiology of confirmed cases, 2005 to 2015\n Up to 12 countries provided data on deaths associated with HEV infection, with 5 countries recording these data since 2005. The concurrent increase in number of hospitalizations (a measure of increased HEV infection severity) and gradual decrease in proportion of total cases hospitalized between 2005 and 2015 may suggest better outpatient diagnosis and an increase in the sensitivity of the diagnostic system, i.e. a change in testing practice from hospitals to community settings. Of hepatitis E cases reported in these countries during the period 2005-2015, 87 percent (13 511/15 525) were autochthonous (defined as locally acquired within the reporting country). A total of 22 countries covering 469 million people (i.e. 91 percent of the EU/EEA population of 514 million people) provided data on confirmed cases of hepatitis E (Figure 2). \n\nEurope-wide surveillance is not in place for hepatitis E, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has launched a number of activities that aim to better understand the current epidemiology, as well as the national monitoring systems for HEV infection within European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. For the time period 2005-2015, at least 22 countries were able to report on cases infected with HEV, either through formal surveillance or existing systems of laboratory notifications. These data demonstrate a Europe-wide increase in reported cases, as well as a high number of reported HEV-related hospitalizations and a total of 28 deaths, between 2005 and 2015. The current study builds on this work to conduct a wider assessment of testing, diagnosis, surveillance activities and confirmed cases of HEV infection in the EU/EEA in order to inform the Europe-wide response to this emerging infection. The majority of cases were reported by 3 countries (the UK, France and Germany) that have had surveillance systems in place since at least 2005. Over the same time period, the proportion of cases being hospitalized has decreased from 80 percent (85/106 cases) to 55 percent (1115/2023 cases). The remaining 10 countries had more generic viral hepatitis syndromic surveillance with no plans to develop any specific surveillance for HEV infection. The survey was divided into 4 sections (surveillance, testing and diagnosis, data on diagnosed cases, and transfusion-associated HEV infections) to allow separate country-level respondents for each topic area with a total of 24 open and closed questions [19]. This study assessed testing policy and practice, laboratory diagnosis, and surveillance systems and activities for HEV infection in 31 EU/EEA countries. A small number of countries reported changes to surveillance systems during the study period; for example, Belgium created a national reference centre for HEV in 2011 and Portugal commenced web-based notification in 2014. Evidence of current HEV infection in up to 77 percent of patients presenting with symptomatic acute hepatitis suggests that the virus could be a considerable cause of liver morbidity in European countries [17]. In the future these limitations could be addressed by standardization of surveillance systems for HEV infection, harmonization of the case definition as well as testing algorithms across EU/EEA countries. A total of 13 of 20 surveillance systems specific for HEV infection had a case definition for confirmed cases. These data demonstrate that the number of reported cases has been increasing year-on-year, with a more than threefold increase between 2011 and 2015. Only 19 countries reported that they were able to conduct HEV RNA testing in-country, although there may be testing within hospitals or private settings that the national public health institutes or survey respondents are unaware of. \n\nConfirmed cases of hepatitis E virus infection\n Two countries had a laboratory policy on testing for HEV: (i) UK (Scotland), where some laboratories automatically test for HEV if alanine transaminase (ALT)\u2009was \u2265\u2009100 U/L, and (ii) Ireland, where an HEV test is automatically conducted if a test for hepatitis A virus (HAV) is requested. \n\nThere is evidence that HEV is an under-recognized pathogen in high-income countries, and that the incidence of confirmed cases has been steadily increasing over the last decade [6-10]. WHO's global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis asks countries to establish surveillance for viral hepatitis, particularly in blood donors [24]. For cases where clinical information was recorded, every second case was admitted to hospital and there were 2 to 8 deaths associated with HEV infection annually during 2011-2015. The proportion of known autochthonous cases increased from 45-73 percent per year during 2006-2011 to 89-97 percent per year during 2012-2015. The rise in the number of symptomatic cases might also be related to the switch in virus subtypes that has been observed in some EU/EEA countries [7,21]. A very small number of cases per year (9-36 cases) were known to be associated with travel outside of the EU/EEA. For HEV antibody testing in acute cases, IgM ELISA was used in 21 countries and IgM Western Blot in 11. Infection, which is most often asymptomatic, may cause an acute self-limiting hepatitis, with symptomatic infection more commonly reported among men older than 50 years of age [4,5]. This suggests that the considerable increase in confirmed cases observed after 2011 (Figures 2 and 4) can largely be accounted for by locally acquired infection.

Jaundice, which causes a yellowing of the skin and eyes, is one of the most common symptoms of hepatitis E. Many of these cases were pregnant women admitted to the main mother and child health centre in Diffa town, where MSF works alongside the Ministry of Health; 25 of them subsequently died due to acute liver failure. Hepatitis E was finally confirmed by laboratory analysis in mid-April 2017 and the outbreak was declared by the Nigerien authorities last week [week 17 to 23 Apr 2017]. The disease is caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) [ribavirin has been used in chronic HEV infection - Mod.LL] and can lead to liver failure and death, with pregnant women particularly at risk. There is no specific treatment for the disease, which spreads mainly through contaminated water.\n\n'Water and sanitation activities in Diffa are clearly insufficient to meet people's needs, as we've been warning for months,' says Elmounzer Ag Jiddou, MSF's head of mission in Niger. 'MSF is calling on the authorities and all humanitarian organisations working in Diffa to rapidly and significantly increase their response and ensure an adequate water supply and sanitation conditions.'\n\nIn recent weeks, MSF teams have been working in coordination with the Ministry of Health to contain the outbreak. MSF has been helping to train health staff and providing resources and extra staff in health centres, hospitals and in the community, in order to detect new cases of the disease as early as possible, refer patients to health facilities and provide them with care. At the same time, MSF teams are conducting awareness campaigns on basic hygiene measures, such as handwashing.\n\nSome 240 000 displaced people and refugees are sheltering in the Diffa region, according to official figures. These people are particularly vulnerable after years suffering the consequences of the conflict between Boko Haram and the armies of the wider region. Of these, some 135 000 have settled in the Kitchendi, Garin Wazan and Toumour areas, where MSF teams are carrying out water and sanitation activities. So far, they have treated 105 700 litres of water to make it safe for drinking. Teams are also distributing water chlorination tablets, soap and new jerrycans to 16 800 families in these locations, and cleaning old jerrycans to make them safe for use and prevent the disease from spreading further.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This article provides some important potential insight into why there is a substantially increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus:\n\nKmush BL, Labrique A, Li W, et al: The association of cytokines and micronutrients with hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period in rural Bangladesh.

It is the first confirmed case of the hepatitis E virus being transferred through blood donated in Australia. Hepatitis E, also known as HEV, has been known to cause cirrhosis, or permanent liver damage in liver transplant patients. Most people recover within 6 weeks, and many won't have any symptoms, but HEV can be severe for pregnant women and people with pre-existing liver conditions or compromised immune systems.\n\nThe boy contracted the virus from donated plasma used during a liver transplant operation in 2014 but it was not detected until early 2015 - about 6 months later. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service tested archived samples of all 18 blood donations the boy received and discovered 1 of them was positive. It emerged that before giving blood, the donor - who had no symptoms - had eaten pork in the south of France, which is known to have prevalence of HEV.\n\nThe boy was treated with an antiviral medication called ribavirin for 3 months. After this time his liver enzyme levels returned to normal and the virus could no longer be detected. The case has been reported in a Medical Journal of Australia report co-written by staff from the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, PathWest Laboratory, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth, and the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne.\n\n'...While the risk in Australia is low compared with other countries, we report the 1st confirmed Australian case of transmission by transfusion,' wrote the authors, lead by the blood service's Veronica Hoad. 'Chronic infection can occur in immunocompromised individuals and may lead to cirrhosis; however, early recognition and treatment generally results in viral clearance. Clinicians should remain alert to the possibility of HEV infection.'\n\nThe blood service has launched a large national HEV prevalence study in blood donors to determine whether they need to change their risk management protocols. A preliminary study has revealed HEV was present at a rate of about 1 in 14 799 Australian donations, the authors reported. It is typically found in developing countries, in the faeces of infected people and animals and is spread by eating or drinking contaminated food or water. It can be contracted by eating undercooked meat, particularly pork liver, venison and wild boar.\n\nThe 1st known outbreak of hepatitis E in Australia was in 2013 and 2014 when 17 people fell ill after eating pork liver pate at the same NSW [New South Wales] restaurant. There were 41 notified cases nationally in both 2015 and 2016, government surveillance data shows, and 14 cases so far in 2017. Most reported cases involved an Australian contracting HEV overseas. However, the authors of the report wrote the true infection burden in Australian 'remains unknown,' as many infected don't have symptoms. A spokesman for the Blood Service said Australia's blood supply continued to be one of the safest in the world. He said there had been no other blood donor transmissions of HEV since this 1st reported case.\n\n'This is due to the low prevalence of hepatitis E in the Australian population combined with our strict donor eligibility guidelines,' the spokesman said. 'In the wake of this incident, the Blood Service reviewed all available evidence and concluded that the ongoing risk to the blood supply remains very low, and does not warrant the introduction of any further testing of donated blood.'\n\n[Byline: Rania Spooner]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Of the 4 genotypes of the hepatitis E virus, genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic, often associated with swine and related to eating undercooked pork products.\n\nThe report cited is: Hoad VC, Gibbs T, Ravikumara M, et al: First confirmed case of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E in Australia. Med J Aust 2017;206(7): 289-290.\n\nThe following is in part derived from Pavio N, Meng XJ and Renou C: Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks. Vet Res. 2010;41(6):46. doi: 10.1051/vetres/2010018 (available at: http://www.vetres.org/articles/vetres/abs/2010/06/v09559/v09559.html):\n\n'The particularity of HEV is that, among all known major hepatitis viruses (A, B, C and D), HEV is the only one with certain genotypes (3 and 4) with animal reservoirs. Swine HEV was 1st isolated and genetically characterized from pigs in the USA in 1997, even though HEV antibodies and RNA were reportedly detected from pigs in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal but the identity of the virus infecting the Nepalese pigs was not determined in that study. More recently, an avian HEV was identified and characterized from chickens with Hepatitis-Splenomegaly (HS) syndrome in 2001 in the USA as well. Besides swine and chickens, recently strains of HEV have been genetically identified from deer, mongooses, rabbits and rats.\n\n'Accumulating evidence indicates that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine (and likely other animal species) are reservoirs. Swine and human strains of HEV are genetically closely related and, in some cases, indistinguishable, and direct transmissions through the consumption of contaminated food products such as pork have been reported in Japan. Thus, zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E raises an important public health concern over food safety and zoonotic risk.

HEV is a member of the family _Hepeviridae_. HEV strains that infect humans (HEV1, HEV2, HEV3, HEV4, and HEV7) belong to the genus _Orthohepevirus_ (1). In industrialized countries, HEV transmission is mainly zoonotic, and the most prevalent genotype is HEV3. This genotype is transmitted mainly by direct contact with infected pigs, eating contaminated food products, or the environment (2). Genotype 3 includes 3 clades, 2 (3-efg and 3-abchij) of which are found in humans and pigs and 1 (3-ra) of which is found in rabbits (3). HEV3-ra has a 93-nt insertion in the X domain of the genome (4). This virus has been identified in both farmed and wild rabbits worldwide (4) and a pet rabbit (5).\n\nHEV3 infections are generally asymptomatic and self-limiting, but symptomatic acute hepatitis develops in some patients, mostly older men. Fulminant hepatitis can occur in patients with underlying liver disease, and HEV3 infections can become chronic in immunocompromised patients, such as recipients of solid-organ transplants, persons with hematologic diseases, and patients infected with HIV (2). Although only 1 case of infection with human HEV3-ra has been identified (6), the contribution of HEV3-ra to human infection remains uncertain.\n\nThe Study\n---------\nThe French National Reference Center for HEV (Paris, France) analyzed 919 HEV strains obtained from patients in France infected during 2015-2016. Strains were obtained in hospitals (90 percent) or private medical laboratories (10 percent). A total of 20 percent of the strains were obtained from immunocompromised patients.\n\nWe detected HEV RNA by using a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) 15189 accredited by the International Organization of Standardization (Geneva, Switzerland) (7). We used a nested RT-PCR to amplify a 345-nt sequence within HEV open reading frame 2 as described (8). To amplify a 365-nt fragment within the X domain, we performed a nested RT-PCR with outer primers 2600-DOM-X-S (5\u2032-TAYCGRGARACYTGYTCCCG-3\u2032) and 3050-DOM-X-AS (5\u2032-ACATCRACATCCCCCTGYTGTATRGA-3\u2032) and inner primers 2685-DOM-X-S (5\u2032-AGYTTTGAYGCCTGGG-3\u2032) and 3050-DOM-X-AS. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by using neighbor-joining methods, a bootstrap of 1000 replicates, and MEGA version 7.0 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/).\n\nAmong the 919 patients, 904 were infected with a genotype 3 strain. The subtype infecting 75 (8.1 percent) of these HEV3-infected patients could not be determined; 302 (32.9 percent) patients were infected with clade HEV3-abchij, 522 (56.8 percent) were infected with clade HEV3-efg, and 5 (0.5 percent) were infected with clade HEV3-ra (GenBank accession nos. KY611812-KY611816) (Figure [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]). All 5 HEV3-ra strains had an insertion in the X domain of the genome (GenBank accession nos. KY825957-KY825961).\n\nAll 5 infected patients were men (median age 52 years, range 38-64 years). None of these men had epidemiologic links to HEV or had traveled abroad; 2 lived in northern France, and 3 lived in southern France. One infected patient was immunocompetent and 4 were immunocompromised. The immunocompetent patient had alcoholic cirrhosis and decompensation of his cirrhosis because of the HEV infection. He cleared the HEV infection spontaneously.\n\nAll 4 immunocompromised patients were asymptomatic: 2 were solid-organ transplant recipients, and 2 had hematologic malignancies that were being treated with chemotherapy. Levels of alanine aminotransferase for these 4 patients were persistently high, and plasma HEV RNA was still detected 3 months after the initial evaluation, which indicated a chronic infection (9). A total of 3 patients were given ribavirin therapy for 3 months. The patients with hematologic malignancies eliminated the virus, but the kidney transplant recipient had a relapse when treatment was stopped.\n\nThe source of infection was unclear because all 5 patients reported they had no direct contact with rabbits. Although 3 patients lived in rural areas, none recalled any contact with wild or farmed animals. None of them was a hunter. Also, 2 patients reported they had eaten rabbit products, but the products were always well-cooked. All patients regularly ate various pork products, and 3 frequently ate raw shellfish (oysters, mussels, or scallops). Two drank tap water, and 3 drank only bottled water. One patient had a vegetable garden (Table [for Table, see original URL - Mod.LL]).\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nHEV3-ra can infect humans and its pathogenesis is similar to that of other HEV3 subtypes. There have been frequent reports of autochthonous HEV3 infections in several industrialized countries, particularly France (10). The HEV3 subtypes responsible are usually similar to those found in swine. These subtypes belong to clades 3-efg and 3-abchij (11,12). Their distribution among 919 symptomatic cases (3c, 26.7 percent; 3e, 2 percent; and 3f, 47 percent) in our study was similar to that reported for asymptomatic blood donors in France (13). However, HEV3-ra strains were not detected in blood donors, probably because of a small sample size.\n\nThe rarity of HEV3-ra infections in humans could be the result of fewer persons eating rabbit than pork products (14). In addition, we found that 80 percent of the HEV3-ra strains were obtained from immunocompromised patients. However, this population represents only 20 percent of the HEV-infected patients characterized by our laboratory. This HEV3 subtype could be less infectious than other subtypes for humans, but additional studies are needed to verify this hypothesis.\n\nWe could not identify the route by which our patients became infected with HEV3-ra. None had any direct contact with rabbits; 2 had eaten well-cooked rabbit. Data from a recent nationwide study in France suggested that waterborne transmission might play a role in HEV epidemiology (14). This type of transmission might be the way the patients in our study became infected because we have detected HEV3-ra in environmental samples (F. Abravanel, unpub. data).\n\nTo our knowledge, clinical manifestations associated with HEV3-ra have not been reported. We found that HEV3-ra infections caused severe decompensation in a patient with alcoholic cirrhosis. Chronic infections developed in the 4 immunocompromised patients. Patients in industrialized countries infected with other HEV3 subtypes also showed similar clinical findings (1). We also found that ribavirin had an antiviral effect on HEV3-ra. Ribavirin eliminated the virus in 2 of the 3 patients given this drug. This finding is consistent with that of a multicenter study, which reported that 78 percent of persons with chronic HEV3 infections were successfully treated with this drug (15).\n\nOur findings emphasize the zoonotic risk for HEV3-ra and expand the spectrum of potential sources of human infection. The route by which HEV3-ra is transmitted to humans needs to be investigated. Longitudinal study of HEV diversity is also needed to assess trends over time.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Regarding the genotypes, the following is extracted from Lhomme S, Marion O, Abravanel F, Chapuy-Regaud S, Kamar N and Izopet J: Hepatitis E pathogenesis. Viruses. 2016 Aug; 8(8): 212:\n\n'The increasing number of HEV strains identified in various hosts has led to a taxonomic scheme that divides the family _Hepeviridae_ into 2 genera: _Piscihepevirus_ (cutthroat trout virus) and _Orthohepevirus_ (mammalian and avian strains) [10,11]. This last genus has been divided into 4 species, _Orthohepevirus A_, _Orthohepevirus B_ (infecting birds), _Orthohepevirus C_ (infecting rodents, soricomorphs, and carnivores), and _Orthohepevirus D_ (infecting bats). The largest species, _Orthohepevirus A_, includes 7 genotypes that infect humans (HEV1, 2, 3, 4, & 7), pigs (HEV3 & 4), rabbits (HEV3), wild boar (HEV3, 4, 5, & 6), mongooses (HEV3), deer (HEV3), yaks (HEV4) and camels (HEV7). Among the 4 major genotypes, HEV1 and HEV2 are restricted to humans and are found in developing countries. HEV3 is widely distributed around the world and HEV4 is found mainly in Asia. The HEV3 and HEV4 genotypes are transmitted zoonotically from pigs, wild boars, deer, and mongooses [12]. Rabbit strains that are closed to HEV3 have recently been described in humans [13]. A liver transplant recipient who had consumed camel meat and milk was found to harbor camel HEV [14]. The transmission of HEV from ferrets, rats, bats, birds, or trout to humans has not yet been demonstrated [12].\n\n10.

The aim of this retrospective, multicenter case series was to assess the effects of ribavirin as monotherapy for solid-organ transplant recipients with prolonged HEV viremia.\nMETHODS: We examined the records of 59 patients who had received a solid-organ transplant (37 kidney-transplant recipients, 10 liver-transplant recipients, 5 heart-transplant recipients, 5 kidney and pancreas-transplant recipients, and 2 lung-transplant recipients). Ribavirin therapy was initiated a median of 9 months (range, 1 to 82) after the diagnosis of HEV infection at a median dose of 600 mg per day (range, 29 to 1200), which was equivalent to 8.1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day (range, 0.6 to 16.3). Patients received ribavirin for a median of 3 months (range, 1 to 18); 66 percent of the patients received ribavirin for 3 months or less.\nRESULTS: All the patients had HEV viremia when ribavirin was initiated (all 54 in whom genotyping was performed had HEV genotype 3). At the end of therapy, HEV clearance was observed in 95 percent of the patients. A recurrence of HEV replication occurred in 10 patients after ribavirin was stopped. A sustained virologic response, defined as an undetectable serum HEV RNA level at least 6 months after cessation of ribavirin therapy, occurred in 46 of the 59 patients (78 percent). A sustained virologic response was also observed in 4 patients who had a recurrence and were re-treated for a longer period. A higher lymphocyte count when ribavirin therapy was initiated was associated with a greater likelihood of a sustained virologic response. Anemia was the main identified side effect and required a reduction in ribavirin dose in 29 percent of the patients, the use of erythropoietin in 54 percent, and blood transfusions in 12 percent.\nCONCLUSIONS: This retrospective, multicenter study showed that ribavirin as monotherapy may be effective in the treatment of chronic HEV infection; a 3-month course seemed to be an appropriate duration of therapy for most patients.'\n- Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100.]", "summary": "\nMETHODS: We examined the records of 59 patients who had received a solid-organ transplant (37 kidney-transplant recipients, 10 liver-transplant recipients, 5 heart-transplant recipients, 5 kidney and pancreas-transplant recipients, and 2 lung-transplant recipients).

In total, at the end of epidemiological week 2 [9 to 15 Jan 2017], a total of 126 HEV RDT have been performed, of them 57 (45.2 per cent ) were positive, while 69 (54.8 per cent ) tested negative for hepatitis E. A total of 18 (31.6 per cent ) of the 57 patients that tested positive using the HEV RDT, also had a positive malaria test, and 20 (29 per cent ) out of 69 patients that tested negative using the HEV RDT also had a positive malaria test. Since September 2016, 11 deaths have been reported among the hospitalized cases but the total case fatality might be underestimated.\n\nAs of 13 Jan 2017, 16 pregnant women presenting with AJS have been hospitalized and tested for hepatitis E; 12 (75 per cent ) of them tested positive using the HEV RDT. Of the pregnant women presenting with AJS, 4 have reportedly died (3 had tested positive for hepatitis E).\n\nApproximately 90 per cent of the AJS cases were reported from Am Timan which appears to be the epicentre of the ongoing outbreak, and most of the cases are identified through active case findings. As of 13 Jan 2017, AJS cases have been reported from 59 different quartiers in and surrounding Am Timan.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nIn response to the ongoing outbreak and event response, WHO and the Ministry of Public Health are carrying out investigations in the whole region in order to describe the extent of the outbreak. Moreover, WHO country office is also supporting passive and active surveillance strengthening outside of Am Timan, developing case definition, surveillance tools, simple case management protocols and testing algorithm, defining criteria for case hospitalization and carrying out needs assessment in and outside the town of Am Timan. WHO is also actively looking for partnerships to address the needs in terms of water and sanitation in Am Timan.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nBased on the available information, there appears to be a plateau in the number of cases reported in the past 5 weeks from the affected area with an average of 70 cases reported weekly where only a minor proportion (7.2 per cent ) requiring hospitalization. The infectious risk seems confined to Am Timan and immediate surroundings. However, the event remains under close monitoring at all levels of WHO. The current level of risk for further spread remains as moderate to high and at local level, and the limited capacity to respond to date calls for additional immediate support, especially in terms of water and sanitation and social mobilization.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nWHO recommends the continuation of the investigations with a specific case definition as to describe the time, place and person characteristics of the outbreak and identify the source. It is important to identify the source of contamination of the surface water and, in the meantime, to ensure water safety by chlorination at the point of use by the population. Travelers to Chad should follow standard hygiene recommendations in terms of water and food safety for travellers. These should protect them against hepatitis E, as the risk of person to person transmission is very low.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.\n\nThe highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 per cent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 per cent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 per cent are common in some age groups.

The bug has been dubbed the 'Brexit virus' as it is believed to come from pig farms in France, Holland, Germany and Denmark.\n\nMore than 60 000 people in Britain are reportedly experiencing flu-like symptoms each year after being infected with a new strain of the virus, which led to serious illness for 3 times as many people in 2016 than in 2010. [It is unclear where the 60 000 number is derived from - Mod.LL]. Data from Public Health England shows 368 people in 2010 contracted the liver disease, which can cause vomiting, jaundice and fever - jumping to 1244 in 2016.\n\nAccording to the Food Standards Agency, 93 percent of British pig herds are now infected with hepatitis E, with 6 percent producing the virus in levels high enough to infect humans, reported The Sunday Times.\n\nA 61-year-old from Falmouth in Cornwall, told the newspaper he had been left partially paralyzed by a serious case of the disease, which attacked nerves in his armpits and diaphragm. 'Doctors traced the strain to salami, probably from Holland. It is cured, not cooked, and the virus survives in the fatty bits,' he said.\n\nAndrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, told The Independent hepatitis E can 'have a devastating effect, especially for people in poor health or with existing liver conditions. We know that it does exist in meat products. It's not the same sort of virus as hepatitis C or B, but it's still something we should be really worried about, particularly regarding how we cook our meat, making sure pork products are being cooked properly to kill the virus.'\n\nGastroenterologist Dr Harry Dalton told a conference last week [week of Sun 14 May 2017] hepatitis E has become a major threat, according to The Sunday Times.\n\nThe liver disease is widespread in the developing world and can be passed from person to person in places with poor sanitation. Experts have warned the virus is present in one in 10 sausages and processed pork meat products sold in England and Wales, recommending sausages be cooked for 20 minutes and reach 70C [158 F] internally.\n\n[Byline: Katie Forster]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Of the 4 recognized genotypes of hepatitis E, types 3 and 4 are zoonotic pathogens.

Swine HEV was 1st isolated and genetically characterized from pigs in the USA in 1997, even though HEV antibodies and RNA were reportedly detected from pigs in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, but the identity of the virus infecting the Nepalese pigs was not determined in that study. More recently, an avian HEV was identified and characterized from chickens with Hepatitis-Splenomegaly (HS) syndrome in 2001 in the USA as well. Besides swine and chickens, recently strains of HEV have been genetically identified from deer, mongooses, rabbits, and rats.\n\nAccumulating evidence indicates that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine (and likely other animal species) are reservoirs. Swine and human strains of HEV are genetically closely related and, in some cases, indistinguishable, and direct transmissions through the consumption of contaminated food products such as pork have been reported in Japan. Thus, zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E raises an important public health concern over food safety and zoonotic risk.\n\nExtra hepatic complications of HEV infection include acute pancreatitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, hemolytic anemia due to glucose phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, severe thrombocytopenia, glomerulonephritis, and mixed cryoglobulinemia. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Of the 4 recognized genotypes of hepatitis E, types 3 and 4 are zoonotic pathogens. \n\nMore than 60 000 people in Britain are reportedly experiencing flu-like symptoms each year after being infected with a new strain of the virus, which led to serious illness for 3 times as many people in 2016 than in 2010.

On [Wed 19 Apr 2017], the outbreak was officially declared by the Minister of Health.\n\nSince [Mon 9 Jan 2017], an increase in cases of jaundice was noted at the Centre Mere-Enfant de Diffa (Mother and Child Center) among pregnant women. Initially, the cases presented with headache, vomiting, fever, conjunctivitis, pelvic pain, and memory loss.\n\nYellow fever was initially suspected as the cause of this outbreak. However, considering a number of cases among pregnant women reporting to the Mother and Child Center in Diffa and the HEV outbreak in neighboring Chad, HEV was also considered as a potential cause of signs and symptoms. Samples were collected and sent to Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD) for laboratory testing. Of the 29 samples tested so far, all tested negative for yellow fever and 15 tested positive for hepatitis E by PCR.\n\nAs of [Wed 3 May 2017], a total of 282 suspected cases including 27 deaths have been reported. All reported deaths except for one death are among pregnant women (mortality ratio: 9.6 per cent). To date, 5 of the 6 districts in the Diffa region have reported cases, and 188 cases are from the Diffa and N'Guigmi districts. The Diffa region is a region affected by the Lake Chad basin crisis and there is frequent movement across the border.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nOn [Thu 6 Apr 2017], the Ministry of Health convened an emergency meeting to review and better understand the situation of the suspected outbreak. The following activities have been initiated in response to the outbreak:\n- The contingency plan was activated and weekly coordination meetings are being held to coordinate outbreak response activities.\n- A preliminary outbreak investigation has been carried out in Diffa during which biological samples were obtained. In line with the 'One Health' approach, preparations for an in-depth investigation are under way.\n- Case management, at no cost to patients, is being implemented, mainly with support from WHO and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\n- Surveillance for hepatitis E is being strengthened by the inclusion of hepatitis E to the list of mandatory reported diseases.\n- Community engagement to encourage 'early care seeking' is being strengthened, particularly among pregnant women.\n- Cross border collaborations with neighboring countries are also being strengthened through regular information sharing.\n- A comprehensive outbreak response plan is being prepared and will be used to mobilize the required resources.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nCases are also reported among displaced or refugee populations, impending cross-border spread to Lake Chad basin countries, especially neighboring areas in Nigeria, Chad and Northern Cameron cannot be ruled out. In addition, the source and scale of the outbreak in Niger needs to be established.\n\nThis is the 1st confirmed hepatitis E outbreak in Niger. It is important to note that this event has occurred in a region where vulnerable populations are in a precarious situation following displacement due to insecurity. Currently, Diffa region is the main area affected.\n\nTo better understand the magnitude of the outbreak, active case finding is being conducted in different health centers in the region and at community level. The reinforcement of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions will support breaking the transmission of the virus and the prevention of new cases. It will be important to keep the cross border communication ongoing so that experiences on management of hepatitis E outbreaks can be exchanged.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nWHO strongly recommends an in-depth investigation of the current HEV outbreak in order to ascertain the magnitude of the event and sources of infection. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments as new information becomes available. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Niger based on the current information available.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[The following regarding hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy is extracted from: Chaudhry SA, Verma N, Koren G. Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy. Can Fam Physician. 2015;61: 607-608:\n\n'Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and in the 3rd trimester, especially with genotype 1, is associated with more severe infection and might lead to fulminant hepatic failure and maternal death (11-13). Although the mechanism of liver injury is not yet clear, it is possible that interplay of hormonal and immunologic changes during pregnancy, along with a high viral load of HEV, renders the woman more vulnerable (14). Immunologic changes during pregnancy promote the maintenance of the fetus in the maternal environment by suppression of T cell-mediated immunity, rendering pregnant women more susceptible to viral infections like HEV infection. During pregnancy, levels of progesterone, estrogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin increase as pregnancy advances. These hormones play a considerable role in altering immune regulation and increasing viral replications (15).\n\nHepatitis E infection with genotype 1 during the 3rd trimester can lead to maternal mortality in up to 15 per cent to 25 per cent of cases (16). Most of the studies showing high maternal mortality are from India, where infection occurs in epidemics. There is a very high risk of vertical transmission of HEV from the mother to the fetus. During a Delhi epidemic, a hospital-based study revealed that HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in 56 per cent of infants (6). One recent study highlights that HEV infection might be responsible for 2400 to 3000 stillbirths each year in developing countries, with many additional fetal deaths linked to antenatal maternal deaths (11). There is a very high risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with HEV infection, with poor neonatal survival rates (11,17). In 2 separate studies from India, 15 per cent to 50 per cent of live-born infants of mothers with HEV infection died within 1 week of birth (11,18). During an outbreak in Sudan in 2010 to 2011, among 39 pregnant women with HEV infection there were 14 intrauterine deaths and 9 premature deliveries (19).'\n\nReferences:\n-----------\n6.

Of 4 major HEV genotypes which infect humans, genotypes 1 and 2 are endemic and responsible for waterborne epidemics. Genotypes 3 and 4 are associated with zoonotic HEV infections transmitted to humans through consumption of raw or undercooked infectious pork and game products, and very rarely shellfish, or by contact with infected animals. The thermal resistance of HEV is relatively high in food products. The virus is successfully inactivated at food internal temperatures\u2009over\u200971\u2009C [160 F] for at least 20 min [1]. Some people are unaware that gammon, sausages and salami may be cured but not cooked and therefore fall into the category of uncooked meat. Transmissions of HEV through transfusion and transplantation have also been reported [2,3].\n\nA substantial increase of locally acquired HEV cases is observed across Europe where HEV genotype 3 infections, originating from animal reservoirs, are predominant and have become a common cause of acute viral hepatitis [4,5]. To analyse the trend in the incidence and prevalence of HEV infection in Europe, there is a need for harmonized case definition, surveillance system and testing algorithms [5]. HEV genotype 3 infection is commonly asymptomatic or mild and self-limiting without chronic sequelae [6]. Acute phase viremia typically persists for 6 to 8 weeks, and because most cases are asymptomatic, it is possible for infected blood donors to donate while viremic. A high frequency of viremic donations, of up to 1:726 [7], has been detected in several European countries using nucleic acid testing (NAT). The number of notified transfusion-transmitted HEV (TT-HEV) infections has until now been very low, probably due to under-reporting and under-recognition mainly because of asymptomatic infections in transfusion recipients. All types of blood components including solvent-detergent (SD) treated plasma have been implicated in transmission. One United Kingdom (UK) study [8] retrospectively screened blood donations in pools of 24 samples and showed that one in 2830 blood donations was HEV RNA positive. Follow-up of transfused HEV RNA positive blood components showed a 42.0% transmission rate, with transmission probability linked to viral load and absence of anti-HEV antibodies. Although HEV RNA was detected in plasma fractionation pools from Europe, Asia and North America, HEV transmission through plasma-derived medicinal products has not been observed [9]. The European Medicines Agency published a reflection paper on viral safety of plasma derived medicinal products with respect to HEV [10].\n\nHEV genotype 3-related severe cases of hepatitis and chronic liver disease, occasionally leading to cirrhosis, have been reported in immunosuppressed transplant recipients, patients with hematological disorders and patients with underlying liver disease. Such patients are exposed to HEV primarily via daily dietary sources. Exposure to HEV through blood components is lower than dietary exposure in patients who have limited transfusion needs, but the risk of transmission through transfusion rises in the multi-transfused. One model estimates that receiving blood components from 13 donors carries a similar risk to 1 year of dietary exposure [11]. Prolonged viremia and chronic liver injury can often be resolved by administration of ribavirin or reducing the level of immunosuppression [12]. The latter is challenging in hematological patients suffering from graft vs host disease and requiring more aggressive immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nThe European Pharmacopoeia requires HEV RNA screening of plasma pools for the production of SD plasma [13]. In response to a threat posed by HEV to transfusion safety and related public, political and reputational concerns, Ireland and the UK respectively have also implemented universal or selective (screening of donations for immunosuppressed recipients) screening of blood donations for the presence of HEV RNA, and others are considering doing so. Hepatitis E infection is not currently reportable under the provisions of European Union (EU) legislation [5].\n\nHere we summarize the epidemiology of HEV infections among blood donors, along with that of reported cases of hepatitis E among patients, and also outline any strategies to prevent TT HEV, in 11 European countries (in alphabetical order) that were discussed during a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) expert meeting in Lisbon, Portugal in May 2016.\n\nHepatitis E virus and blood donations in selected European countries\n----------------\nDenmark:\n----------\nDenmark has a large pig-farming industry and associated production of pig products. An investigation among pig herds in 2010 found HEV genotype 3 in the stools of more than 50% of herds investigated [14]. In 2013, a seroprevalence study among Danish blood donors showed 10% to 20% anti-HEV IgG positivity, depending on the assay used, and found an increase with age. Compared with seroprevalence studies of samples from Danish donors in 2003 and 1983, the authors found a declining prevalence corresponding to a birth cohort phenomenon [15].\nIn a Danish nationwide investigation, about 25 000 donations from 2015 were screened for HEV RNA by Single Donation nucleic acid testing (NAT) (Grifols). The prevalence of HEV RNA positive donations was 1:2331 (0.04%) [16], consistent with data from other northern European countries (Table [for table, see original URI - Mod. LL]). Positive donations had a median viral load of 13 IU/mL in a range from unquantifiable to 920 IU/mL [16]. Look-back studies of living recipients found no evidence of TT HEV infections [16]. Based on these data, the Danish Society of Clinical Immunology does not recommend the screening of blood donations for HEV in Denmark [17].\n\nFrance:\n--------\nHEV RNA NAT screening (pools of 96 samples) of plasma donations for subsequent solvent-detergent treatment in the period 2012/13 showed an HEV RNA positive detection rate of 0.04% (24/53 234) or 1:2218 donations [18]. Most samples (22/24) from viraemic donors were negative for anti-HEV IgG and IgM. HEV genotype 3 was detected with viral loads from 468 to 5.1 106 IU/mL. Recent data obtained from plasma donations screened by minipools (6 samples) indicate a higher rate of positive donations (about 1:1000). A seroprevalence study of 10 569 blood donations collected in mainland France and 3 overseas territories gave overall IgG (Wantai) prevalence 22.4% (range 8.0% to 86.4%) [19]. Significant geographical difference and hyperendemic areas in the southern part of France were found. IgG HEV seropositivity was associated with increasing age, eating pork meat, pork liver sausages, game meat, offal, and oysters, while drinking bottled water appeared protective. IgM seroprevalence was 1% (0-4.6%) [19]. Between 2006 and 2013, 16 cases of TT HEV genotype 3 were reported, mostly in immunocompromised solid organ transplant recipients as well as patients with haematologic malignancies under chemotherapy treatment, and confirmed by viral strain comparison. All types of blood components, including plasma treated by amotosalen and ultraviolet illumination, were implicated in transmission events [20]. 5 cases of chronic HEV infection required ribavirin treatment [21]. Since 2013 the fraction of plasma collected by the French Blood Service that is intended for use in high-risk patients is screened for HEV RNA. NAT screening of blood donations is under consideration by the French health authorities.\n\nGermany:\n----------\nThere has been a marked increase of notified cases, from 670 in 2014 to 1267 in 2015 [22]. The reason for this increase is unknown, but could be due to growing awareness and testing by physicians. Studies in Germany found from 1:679 to 1:4252 blood donations to be HEV RNA positive [23-25]. So far, 5 TT HEV infections have been reported in the German hemovigilance database, 2 in 2013 and 3 in 2014 [26]. 4 cases were asymptomatic. In 1 case, HEV-infection was considered a co-factor leading to serious complications in a hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient suffering from severe graft vs host disease [27]. An analysis of transfusion-associated cases from 2015 has not been finalized, but 3 probable or confirmed TT cases were reported. One lymphoma patient receiving HEV RNA-positive transfusions after transplantation developed chronic hepatitis E. 2 cases were asymptomatic. One additional case is still being investigated. Monitoring of immunocompromised patients, especially transplant recipients, for HEV infection is recommended by the German Advisory Committee Blood (Arbeitskreis Blut) [28]. Screening of blood donors has not been recommended but is under discussion [28]. As of December 2016, 6 blood establishments in Germany notified the German Competent Authority that they have commenced voluntary screening of blood donations for HEV RNA.\n\nGreece:\n--------\nIn a recent study [29], archived blood samples from 1835 blood donors, and recent samples from 249 thalassemic patients from 9 Greek regions were examined for anti-HEV antibodies using commercial ELISA and immunochromatographic tests. HEV RNA was tested for using the Procleix HEV (Grifols) assay in 1813 blood samples from 1670 blood donors and 143 thalassemic patients. HEV IgG antibodies were present in 2.9% of blood donors. Seroprevalence was higher in older donors (5.9% in those aged\u2009over\u200950 years vs 1.8% in younger donors). The highest seroprevalence of 13.3% among male blood donors was found in Heraklion, Crete. Seroprevalence in thalassaemic patients was 3.6%. Results of HEV RNA testing among donors are not yet available. The data showed that the current seroprevalence of HEV in blood donors was lower in comparison to other European regions but showed an increasing trend. Donors' age and sex were significant factors affecting the prevalence estimates. Most of the cases were imported from endemic countries outside Europe although the local acquisition of HEV requires further investigation in Heraklion.\n\nIreland:\n-------\nIreland implemented universal HEV individual-donation nucleic acid test (ID-NAT) screening of blood donations for an initial 3-year period from January 2016. By the end of April 2016, 47 229 donations had been screened using the Procleix HEV assay (Grifols). There were 27 initially reactive donations (0.057%), of which 16 (0.034%) were repeat reactive (RR) and 11 non-repeat reactive (NRR; 0.023%). Of the 16 RRs, 15 were confirmed using PCR testing (RealStar RT-PCR kit, Altona) and/or by serology (Wantai IgM and IgG assays). One RR sample was negative by PCR and serology but on follow-up 34 days later was PCR and IgM reactive. Overall, the majority of donors (11/15) were viremic and seronegative at index donation. Results of genotyping are available so far for 2 confirmed cases which are genotype 3, phylogenetic group 2. Of the 11 NRRs, one donation was confirmed as an HEV case who subsequently seroconverted 70 days later with IgM and IgG reactivity. Eight NRRs have been confirmed as false positives, and 2 were awaiting follow-up testing at the time of writing this report. Of the 17 confirmed cases that occurred randomly across Ireland, 15 were male, and 2 were female. Episodic periods of reactivity with high levels of confirmed cases in January, early February, and mid-April were observed. The HEV RNA prevalence in Irish donations is currently 1:2778, which is higher than expected from the previous study (anti-HEV IgG positive 5.3% in 2012 and an HEV RNA positivity of 1 in 5000 donations in the period from December 2013 to June 2014 [30].\n\nItaly:\n-----\nThe seroprevalence of hepatitis E in the Italian general population was analysed in 6 of 20 Italian regions and ranged from 1.5% to 2.9% [31-37]. Most of these studies were conducted before 1999. From 2007 to 2016, 144 cases of acute hepatitis E were notified to the Italian Surveillance System for Acute Viral Hepatitis [38]. Among 144 cases, 122 (84.7%) were male with a mean age of 40 years, 81 (56.6%) were Italian. The virological surveillance of 139 acute non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis (cases negative for hepatitis A, B and C) from 2004 to 2016 showed that 48 (34.5%) cases were due to HEV. Genotyping of HEV RNA-positive samples revealed that 55% (22/40) of patients were infected with genotype 1 and 45% (18/40) with genotype 3. The prevalence of HEV antibodies in blood donors from Abruzzo and Lazio, 2 regions of central Italy, was 48.9% (153/313) and 9.0% (9/100) respectively in 2014 [39]. In Lazio, the seroprevalence of 9.0% in the donor population in 2014 is significantly higher than previously reported in the general population (2.6% in 1996 and 2.9% in 2007), which strongly suggests an increasing trend of HEV infection in the general population over almost 2 decades. The very high HEV IgG prevalence in blood donors from Abruzzo indicates that HEV infection is commonly acquired in this area. Seroprevalence increased with age and was associated with consumption of raw dried pork liver sausages. Among the IgG positive blood donors (n\u2009=\u2009153) from Abruzzo, 2 (1.3%) were positive for IgM, and 2 (1.3%) were positive for HEV RNA; genotype 3 (subtype 3c) [39]. A national survey in 2016-2017 will evaluate the prevalence of HEV infection in 10 000 blood donations in Italy (270 Blood Transfusion Centres from 20 Italian regions). The results of the survey will be considered in developing HEV prevention strategy.\n\nThe Netherlands:\n-------------------\nSince 2012, between 2000 and 4000 Dutch plasma donations have been screened each month by PCR on pools of 96 donations for the presence of HEV. Overall 79/101,793 or 1:1289 donations were confirmed HEV RNA positive. HEV RNA sequencing shows HEV genotype 3 subtypes is present in Dutch hepatitis E patients and Dutch pigs [7]. This silent outbreak of HEV appears to be strikingly benign (i.e. lack of morbidity in neonates/infants up to the age of 12 months, children, and pregnant women). Cases of chronic hepatitis E have been reported in hematological and organ transplant patients. The dietary routes of HEV transmission in the Netherlands have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Recently, 43 of 55 liver sausages and 12 of 15 liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 samples were found to be positive for HEV RNA by PCR [40]. The Dutch Food Safety Authority has confirmed these findings, and hematological and organ transplant patients are advised to avoid these food items [40]. Although blood and blood components are probably a minor source of HEV infection in the Netherlands compared with dietary exposure, the presence of HEV-positive donations in the blood supply has given rise to the expression of concerns about the safety profile of Dutch blood banking, such as indicated by the request of one academic hospital for the supply of HEV RNA-screened blood.\n\nHEV RNA screening of all Dutch blood donations is planned to start in July 2017. To provide HEV-screened blood for at-risk patients, 40% of Dutch donations must be screened. Considering the costs and the complicated IT and logistical consequences of partial donor screening, universal HEV RNA donor screening is being considered as more feasible.\n\nPortugal:\n----------\nHEV studies in Portugal are part of the HEPeCONTROL project (60DT2) under European Economic Area (EEA) grants funding [41]. Sera from a representative cohort of the Portuguese population (n\u2009=\u20091656) distributed by geographic location (all 20 districts in Portugal), and 5-year age group (ranging from 0 to 99 years of age) were collected between July 2015 and February 2016, and tested for the presence of anti-HEV IgG by EIA (recomWell HEV IgG, Mikrogen) [42]. An overall HEV IgG seroprevalence in the Portuguese population of 16% was found with seropositivity significantly increasing with age (p\u2009under\u20090.05). Also, plasma samples from blood donors (n\u2009=\u20092115) to a Blood Transfusion Service in Portugal collected between July 2015 and January 2016 were tested individually for both anti-HEV IgM (recomWell HEV IgM, version 2015, Mikrogen) and HEV RNA, using 2 commercial real-time RT-PCR kits (ampliCube HEV 2.0, Mikrogen and RealStar HEV 1.0, Altona).\n\nAmong the 2115 plasma samples, 7 (0.3%) were found to be positive for anti-HEV IgM but no RNA HEV was detected in any of the blood donors' samples. HEPeCONTROL project has given a sufficient picture of HEV infection in Portuguese general population and blood donors necessary for a decision on the implementation of a HEV national prevention strategy in the future.\n\nSpain:\n------\nIn 2013, the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG among 1082 blood donors from Catalonia was found to be 19.9% (Wantai) and 10.7% (Mikrogen). Screening of 9,998 samples by HEV ID-NAT yielded 3 real-time PCR-confirmed and IgM and IgG anti-HEV-positive donations with viral loads of 250, 564, and 2755\u2009IU/mL. The donation with highest viral load was genotype 3f. HEV RNA positivity rate was 1:3333 donations (0.03%).\n\nThe 1st symptomatic TT HEV case in Spain was reported in 2015. The immunocompetent patient developed clinical and laboratory signs of acute hepatitis more than one month after transfusion of 8 red cell units during and after surgery. Investigation showed that one transfused RBC unit was positive for HEV RNA with 100% identity with the recipient HEV RNA sequences. The implicated donor had occupational exposure in a sausage factory. Platelets from the same infected donation were transfused to a Hodgkin lymphoma patient who died shortly after transfusion [43]. Selective HEV screening of blood donations is under consideration taking into account logistical challenges. Blood banks from central and northern Spain plan to study HEV incidence.\n\nSwitzerland:\n-------------\nA study of 550 donors from canton of Vaud in western Switzerland using 3 different HEV IgG EIAs (MP Diagnostics, Dia.Pro and Fortress) showed prevalences of 4.9%, 4.2% and 21.8% respectively [44]. An overall anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence of 8.9% (Mikrogen Diagnostic) in 1484 donors was determined in the canton of Z\u00fcrich in eastern Switzerland [45]. A 3rd study analysed 3609 blood donors from all over Switzerland [46]. The HEV IgG (Wantai) prevalence ranged from 12.8% (24/188) to 33.6% (116/345), depending on the geographical region. In the northern regions and within the Alps, seroprevalence seems to be quite similar (range: 12.8-24.8%) (24/188 to 69/278). In Ticino, a southern region of Switzerland, prevalence is higher with an average of 33.6% (116/345). In some smaller localities in Ticino, a prevalence bordering on 50% (13/27) was observed. Unfortunately, to date, no incidence data for the Swiss general population or the blood donor population have been collected.\n\nAvoidance of potentially contaminated food is recommended to protect at-risk patients from dietary HEV infections. It is also proposed to screen blood donations for HEV RNA on pools of 96 samples and monitor at-risk patients. Clinicians will also be informed of these specific measures in order to draw attention to future HEV infections in at-risk patients.\n\nUnited Kingdom:\n-------------------\nSeroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG in 2015/2016 was found to be 11% (n\u2009=\u200913 042) in England and 6% (n\u2009=\u20091700) in Scotland. There has been a steady increase in the incidence of acute cases since 2010 associated with the emergence of a dominant clade (G3c). An increased anti-HEV IgG positivity in younger donors was observed in 2015/16. Surveillance data indicate a sudden increase in reported possible TT HEV cases in 2012 followed by a sustained rise from 2015 onwards. Such growth probably resulted from a heightened clinical awareness, following the formation of an HEV working group of the Advisory Committee on Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO). Reported cases of possible TT HEV were acute clinical hepatitis in immunocompetent individuals and silent infection in immunosuppressed haematopoietic stem cell and solid-organ transplant patients. A proportion of investigated cases were shown not to be transfusion-associated. SaBTO recommended the provision of HEV-screened blood components for recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplants and solid organ transplants [47]; the blood services additionally provide HEV-screened components for neonates/infants up to the age of 12 months. A minimum of 30% of the blood supply is tested to meet current demand. As of May 2016, with blood donation screening using NAT RNA HEV test (pools of 24 samples), the number of confirmed RNA-positive samples was 83 of 113 306 (1:1365) tested in England, 10 of 12 504 (1:1250) tested in Scotland, and 2 of 4560 (1:2280) in Wales. Look-back investigations are performed when blood donors are reported with acute HEV infection, but the donor HEV infection must be substantiated. The immediate previous donation of HEV RNA positive platelet donors is also subject to look-back. As of November 2016, the SaBTO has completed a review of HEV screening and its cost-effectiveness and has recommended extending the use of screened components to other recipient groups and a change to universal screening of blood donations from April 2017 [48]. The principal drivers for this decision were technical complexity and costs of a double inventory that was needed in selective screening.\n\nDiscussion\n------------\nThe public health implications of HEV in Europe have changed recently due to the increasing numbers of hepatitis E cases and reports of chronic, persistent HEV infections associated with progression to cirrhosis in immunosuppressed patients. The main infectious risks for such immunosuppressed patients are dietary exposure to pork products and transfusion. In the last decade, an increasing number of HEV genotype 3-positive donations have been documented in several European countries (Table [for table, see original URL - Mod.LL]). Such growth probably resulted from a heightened clinical awareness, and following on from national blood safety discussions and measures in some countries.\n\nTaking into account the prevalence of HEV infection in pigs and pork meat consumption in the EU [49,50] on the one hand and the incidence of HEV viraemic blood donations (Table) on the other, it seems that for the general population, the risk of HEV transmission via food products is considerably higher than through blood transfusion. Therefore, from a public health perspective, eliminating the dietary risk of HEV transmission is the most effective intervention and would also improve blood safety. Until and unless the dietary risk is eliminated, TT HEV infection in immunosuppressed patients represents a preventable cause of serious morbidity and mortality and as such indicates a need to improve transfusion safety.\n\nApproaches to increase blood safety for HEV are currently limited. Potential measures include: pathogen inactivation of blood components, which may not yet be sufficiently effective for certain non-enveloped viruses such as HEV; immunisation of patients at risk, which is not yet available and is unproven against intravenous challenge; and screening of blood donations, which is an available intervention but not widely implemented because of effectiveness constraints and costs. In the absence of the implementation of such measures, individuals at risk of developing severe consequences remain exposed to the risk of TT HEV infection.\n\nUniversal screening of blood donations has been implemented in Ireland and selective screening implemented in the UK in 2016. The majority of the other European countries assessed here, 8 of 11, were at the time of the meeting investigating or considering the need to screen blood donations for the presence of HEV RNA. The UK and the Netherlands have, since the meeting, decided to implement universal screening in 2017, as the most cost-effective way of ensuring provision of HEV screened blood components for the recommended patient groups. Denmark has decided not to screen (Table).\n\nThe rationale for donation screening for any pathogen is particularly strong when there are specific recipient groups at risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. The population currently recognised to be at risk of TT HEV (recipients of solid organ and haematopoietic stem cell transplants, and other immunosuppressed patients) is relatively small in number (Table) but may receive substantial number of transfusions, which increases the probability of exposure and thus the risk of infection.\n\nJustification of blood donation screening for HEV RNA becomes contentious if the risk from exposure of transfusion recipients to dietary sources is not eliminated. Equally, some TT infections which cause disease in the immunosuppressed, such as parvovirus B19, remain tolerated and unscreened. In transfusion practice, however, laboratory screening of some pathogens (i.e. cytomegalovirus) has been implemented, despite a sustained community exposure of transfusion recipients. Thus, it seems that the risk of non-transfusion exposure to HEV might not be critical for a decision to implement HEV RNA screening of blood donations.\n\nIf implemented, screening may be selective, performed on blood donations intended for transfusion to patients at risk, or universally applied to all blood donations and subject to continuing review. Selective screening might be technically demanding especially with the management of the blood component inventory and is not necessarily less costly.\n\nThe decision to screen blood donations should be based on an assessment of the risk of TT HEV in the susceptible population, as determined by the background prevalence of transmissible infection in the donor population and the susceptibility of recipients. Further, to assess the absolute benefit of screening, detailed knowledge about the incidence of hepatitis E in patients receiving HEV-negative blood components and those who receive unscreened blood components is required. The costs as well as the benefits also need to be taken into account. Defining the appropriate sensitivity level of NAT testing (pool size) is one of the key issues with an impact on the cost-effectiveness of routine screening.\n\nDespite the uncertainties in the epidemiology of HEV, screening of blood donations for the presence of HEV RNA is clearly under consideration in several countries and has been currently implemented in 2 of those reviewed here. However, given what is known about the risks of dietary transmission of HEV infection, if implemented, the screening of blood donations should go hand in hand with raising clinicians' awareness and strict dietary recommendation for patients at risk. Validation of NAT findings by seroconversion, sequencing of viral RNA genome using common sequence database, and follow-up of HEV cases among blood donors and patients may help to define the relative contributions of different routes of HEV infection in Europe. Ultimately, addressing the root cause for viremic pigs entering the human food chain will be required to achieve control of this zoonosis.\n\n[For references, see original URL. - Mod.LL]\n\n[Authors: Domanovi\u0107 D, Tedder R , Bl\u00fcmel J, et al]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Clearly, the risk of transfusion-related hepatitis E requires continued scrutiny.

Also, plasma samples from blood donors (n\u2009=\u20092115) to a Blood Transfusion Service in Portugal collected between July 2015 and January 2016 were tested individually for both anti-HEV IgM (recomWell HEV IgM, version 2015, Mikrogen) and HEV RNA, using 2 commercial real-time RT-PCR kits (ampliCube HEV 2.0, Mikrogen and RealStar HEV 1.0, Altona). Potential measures include: pathogen inactivation of blood components, which may not yet be sufficiently effective for certain non-enveloped viruses such as HEV; immunisation of patients at risk, which is not yet available and is unproven against intravenous challenge; and screening of blood donations, which is an available intervention but not widely implemented because of effectiveness constraints and costs. One United Kingdom (UK) study [8] retrospectively screened blood donations in pools of 24 samples and showed that one in 2830 blood donations was HEV RNA positive. In response to a threat posed by HEV to transfusion safety and related public, political and reputational concerns, Ireland and the UK respectively have also implemented universal or selective (screening of donations for immunosuppressed recipients) screening of blood donations for the presence of HEV RNA, and others are considering doing so. Most samples (22/24) from viraemic donors were negative for anti-HEV IgG and IgM. HEV genotype 3 was detected with viral loads from 468 to 5.1 106 IU/mL. Recent data obtained from plasma donations screened by minipools (6 samples) indicate a higher rate of positive donations (about 1:1000). A national survey in 2016-2017 will evaluate the prevalence of HEV infection in 10 000 blood donations in Italy (270 Blood Transfusion Centres from 20 Italian regions). However, given what is known about the risks of dietary transmission of HEV infection, if implemented, the screening of blood donations should go hand in hand with raising clinicians' awareness and strict dietary recommendation for patients at risk. In a recent study [29], archived blood samples from 1835 blood donors, and recent samples from 249 thalassemic patients from 9 Greek regions were examined for anti-HEV antibodies using commercial ELISA and immunochromatographic tests. \n\nHere we summarize the epidemiology of HEV infections among blood donors, along with that of reported cases of hepatitis E among patients, and also outline any strategies to prevent TT HEV, in 11 European countries (in alphabetical order) that were discussed during a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) expert meeting in Lisbon, Portugal in May 2016. Further, to assess the absolute benefit of screening, detailed knowledge about the incidence of hepatitis E in patients receiving HEV-negative blood components and those who receive unscreened blood components is required. Among the IgG positive blood donors (n\u2009=\u2009153) from Abruzzo, 2 (1.3%) were positive for IgM, and 2 (1.3%) were positive for HEV RNA; genotype 3 (subtype 3c) SaBTO recommended the provision of HEV-screened blood components for recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplants and solid organ transplants [47]; the blood services additionally provide HEV-screened components for neonates/infants up to the age of 12 months. -------\nIreland implemented universal HEV individual-donation nucleic acid test (ID-NAT) screening of blood donations for an initial 3-year period from January 2016. --------\nHEV RNA NAT screening (pools of 96 samples) of plasma donations for subsequent solvent-detergent treatment in the period 2012/13 showed an HEV RNA positive detection rate of 0.04% (24/53 234) or 1:2218 donations [18]. \n\nHEV genotype 3-related severe cases of hepatitis and chronic liver disease, occasionally leading to cirrhosis, have been reported in immunosuppressed transplant recipients, patients with hematological disorders and patients with underlying liver disease. As of November 2016, the SaBTO has completed a review of HEV screening and its cost-effectiveness and has recommended extending the use of screened components to other recipient groups and a change to universal screening of blood donations from April 2017 As of May 2016, with blood donation screening using NAT RNA HEV test (pools of 24 samples), the number of confirmed RNA-positive samples was 83 of 113 306 (1:1365) tested in England, 10 of 12 504 (1:1250) tested in Scotland, and 2 of 4560 (1:2280) in Wales. As of December 2016, 6 blood establishments in Germany notified the German Competent Authority that they have commenced voluntary screening of blood donations for HEV RNA. The decision to screen blood donations should be based on an assessment of the risk of TT HEV in the susceptible population, as determined by the background prevalence of transmissible infection in the donor population and the susceptibility of recipients. HEV RNA was tested for using the Procleix HEV (Grifols) assay in 1813 blood samples from 1670 blood donors and 143 thalassemic patients.

Validation of NAT findings by seroconversion, sequencing of viral RNA genome using common sequence database, and follow-up of HEV cases among blood donors and patients may help to define the relative contributions of different routes of HEV infection in Europe. Among the 2115 plasma samples, 7 (0.3%) were found to be positive for anti-HEV IgM but no RNA HEV was detected in any of the blood donors' samples. It is also proposed to screen blood donations for HEV RNA on pools of 96 samples and monitor at-risk patients. Despite the uncertainties in the epidemiology of HEV, screening of blood donations for the presence of HEV RNA is clearly under consideration in several countries and has been currently implemented in 2 of those reviewed here. To provide HEV-screened blood for at-risk patients, 40% of Dutch donations must be screened. In 2013, a seroprevalence study among Danish blood donors showed 10% to 20% anti-HEV IgG positivity, depending on the assay used, and found an increase with age. Screening of 9,998 samples by HEV ID-NAT yielded 3 real-time PCR-confirmed and IgM and IgG anti-HEV-positive donations with viral loads of 250, 564, and 2755\u2009IU/mL. The HEV RNA prevalence in Irish donations is currently 1:2778, which is higher than expected from the previous study (anti-HEV IgG positive 5.3% in 2012 and an HEV RNA positivity of 1 in 5000 donations in the period from December 2013 to June 2014 [30]. A seroprevalence study of 10 569 blood donations collected in mainland France and 3 overseas territories gave overall IgG (Wantai) prevalence 22.4% (range 8.0% to 86.4%) The population currently recognised to be at risk of TT HEV (recipients of solid organ and haematopoietic stem cell transplants, and other immunosuppressed patients) is relatively small in number (Table) but may receive substantial number of transfusions, which increases the probability of exposure and thus the risk of infection. One model estimates that receiving blood components from 13 donors carries a similar risk to 1 year of dietary exposure [11]. Follow-up of transfused HEV RNA positive blood components showed a 42.0% transmission rate, with transmission probability linked to viral load and absence of anti-HEV antibodies. Look-back investigations are performed when blood donors are reported with acute HEV infection, but the donor HEV infection must be substantiated. -------------------\nSeroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG in 2015/2016 was found to be 11% (n\u2009=\u200913 042) in England and 6% (n\u2009=\u20091700) in Scotland. HEPATITIS E - EUROPE: BLOOD DONATION SCREENING\n********************************************* Since 2013 the fraction of plasma collected by the French Blood Service that is intended for use in high-risk patients is screened for HEV RNA. The UK and the Netherlands have, since the meeting, decided to implement universal screening in 2017, as the most cost-effective way of ensuring provision of HEV screened blood components for the recommended patient groups. Between 2006 and 2013, 16 cases of TT HEV genotype 3 were reported, mostly in immunocompromised solid organ transplant recipients as well as patients with haematologic malignancies under chemotherapy treatment, and confirmed by viral strain comparison. HEPeCONTROL project has given a sufficient picture of HEV infection in Portuguese general population and blood donors necessary for a decision on the implementation of a HEV national prevention strategy in the future. Acute phase viremia typically persists for 6 to 8 weeks, and because most cases are asymptomatic, it is possible for infected blood donors to donate while viremic. The majority of the other European countries assessed here, 8 of 11, were at the time of the meeting investigating or considering the need to screen blood donations for the presence of HEV RNA. Based on these data, the Danish Society of Clinical Immunology does not recommend the screening of blood donations for HEV in Denmark [17]. Selective HEV screening of blood donations is under consideration taking into account logistical challenges. Reported cases of possible TT HEV were acute clinical hepatitis in immunocompetent individuals and silent infection in immunosuppressed haematopoietic stem cell and solid-organ transplant patients. \n\nA substantial increase of locally acquired HEV cases is observed across Europe where HEV genotype 3 infections, originating from animal reservoirs, are predominant and have become a common cause of acute viral hepatitis [4,5]. The data showed that the current seroprevalence of HEV in blood donors was lower in comparison to other European regions but showed an increasing trend. The prevalence of HEV antibodies in blood donors from Abruzzo and Lazio, 2 regions of central Italy, was 48.9% (153/313) and 9.0% (9/100) respectively in 2014 [39]. Studies in Germany found from 1:679 to 1:4252 blood donations to be HEV RNA positive HEV RNA screening of all Dutch blood donations is planned to start in July 2017. NAT screening of blood donations is under consideration by the French health authorities. \n\nThe rationale for donation screening for any pathogen is particularly strong when there are specific recipient groups at risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. Sera from a representative cohort of the Portuguese population (n\u2009=\u20091656) distributed by geographic location (all 20 districts in Portugal), and 5-year age group (ranging from 0 to 99 years of age) were collected between July 2015 and February 2016, and tested for the presence of anti-HEV IgG by EIA (recomWell HEV IgG, Mikrogen) Monitoring of immunocompromised patients, especially transplant recipients, for HEV infection is recommended by the German Advisory Committee Blood (Arbeitskreis Blut) The very high HEV IgG prevalence in blood donors from Abruzzo indicates that HEV infection is commonly acquired in this area. In 2013, the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG among 1082 blood donors from Catalonia was found to be 19.9% (Wantai) and 10.7% (Mikrogen). In Lazio, the seroprevalence of 9.0% in the donor population in 2014 is significantly higher than previously reported in the general population (2.6% in 1996 and 2.9% in 2007), which strongly suggests an increasing trend of HEV infection in the general population over almost 2 decades. Screening of blood donors has not been recommended but is under discussion [28]. Until and unless the dietary risk is eliminated, TT HEV infection in immunosuppressed patients represents a preventable cause of serious morbidity and mortality and as such indicates a need to improve transfusion safety. The virological surveillance of 139 acute non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis (cases negative for hepatitis A, B and C) from 2004 to 2016 showed that 48 (34.5%) cases were due to HEV. Therefore, from a public health perspective, eliminating the dietary risk of HEV transmission is the most effective intervention and would also improve blood safety. Since 2012, between 2000 and 4000 Dutch plasma donations have been screened each month by PCR on pools of 96 donations for the presence of HEV. \nHepatitis E is a liver disease caused by infection with a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus known as hepatitis E virus (HEV). The highest seroprevalence of 13.3% among male blood donors was found in Heraklion, Crete. Genotyping of HEV RNA-positive samples revealed that 55% (22/40) of patients were infected with genotype 1 and 45% (18/40) with genotype 3.

The overcrowded site near the Unamid [United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur] base in Sortony hosts more than 21 000 people who were displaced from Jebel Marra following hostilities earlier in 2016. 7 samples sent for analysis tested positive for hepatitis E virus. The North Darfur Health Ministry has declared an outbreak of hepatitis E in Sortony, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its latest weekly bulletin [https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Sudan/Reports/OCHA_Sudan_Weekly_Humanitarian_Bulletin_Issue_31_(25_-_31_July_2016).pdf].\n\nHepatitis E is an epidemic-prone, waterborne disease transmitted by the fecal-oral route through contaminated water.

The current rainy season is likely to contribute to the unsanitary conditions.\n\nEfforts by the state Health Ministry and humanitarian health, water, and sanitation partners aim at containing the outbreak. They include health promotion-related activities and improving the water quality through chlorination. In addition, water quality surveillance and vector control activities have been strengthened, and active case finding is ongoing.\n\nDrugs and medical supplies to cover 2 months were provided to health clinics run by MSF-E and Anhar organization, with support from WHO, the UN Children's Fund (Unicef), and the ministry.\n\nDuring the 1st 7 months of 2016, close to 81 000 people were newly displaced across Darfur, according to the UN and partners. Up to an additional 170 000 people were also reportedly displaced, of whom 50 000 have reportedly returned, but the UN and partners are unable to verify these figures due to a lack of access to the relevant locations.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology.

She seems surprised when, unexpectedly, the outline of a baby appears on the monitor, and her expression quickly turns to relief as the translator confirms that the unborn child is progressing well. The woman is one of 44 patients with hepatitis E who have been admitted to Am Timan hospital in Chad since September 2016. More than 320 other potential cases have been identified.\n\nThe 1st cases of hepatitis E were diagnosed at Am Timan hospital in late August 2016. Like cholera, hepatitis E is transmitted from one person to another, mainly through contaminated drinking water, and rapidly spreads in places where hygiene and sanitary conditions are poor.\n\nIt is estimated that 1 in 25 patients with hepatitis E is at risk of death, but for pregnant women in their 3rd trimester, the risks of maternal and fetal mortality are higher. Among the 9 patients who have died in the past few months, 3 were pregnant women with jaundice.\n\nVeronica Siebenkotten-Branca, an MSF gynaecologist in Am Timan, explains that hepatitis E has no cure and is particularly dangerous for pregnant women. 'Depending on how severe the hepatitis E infection is during pregnancy, it can potentially lead to serious consequences for maternal and fetal health. Abortion, post-partum haemorrhage, and premature or still birth are among the worst situations a mother can face.'\n\nSince the 1st cases of hepatitis E were identified, more than 600 MSF staff have been working to test for new cases, treat patients, and improve water supplies and sanitation. Many staff are community health workers whose main role is to talk to people about the early signs and symptoms of hepatitis E and to share information about hygiene practices. Most people in Am Timan had not previously heard of hepatitis E, and as a result, staff are working to address fear and suspicion about the 'sick people with yellow eyes'. This work includes meeting with local chiefs, leaders, and officials, to hear their concerns, identify needs and encourage them to talk to their community about the urgency of responding to hepatitis E. In the last 4 weeks, they have also distributed more than 11 000 hygiene kits containing bars of soap and buckets. In many cases, hepatitis E patients have been seen as a threat to the community, leading to both stigmatisation and shame for those who are diagnosed. But with support from community outreach workers, this is changing.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It appears as though there has been significant ongoing transmission of HEV in Chad during the past year (2016).

In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except one seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study.'\n\nOf the 4 genotypes of HEV, it seems that GT 1 and 2 are the ones that are associated with this increased mortality during gestation.\n\nMaps of Chad can be seen at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/chad.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25728.

Those infected in childhood do not often experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are rare.\n\nBecause of this, the cause of this outbreak could be the other food/waterborne form of viral hepatitis, hepatitis E. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Large HEV outbreaks have been documented in crowded settings that have poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E. Antibody assays should easily distinguish between the infections.\n\nA recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in people aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses have been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown.

Hepatitis E illness is usually self-limiting, and severe, prolonged infections are unusual except in immunocompromised patients. We describe HEV infection in a previously healthy man in France who received massive transfusions of blood, plasma, and platelets after a traumatic skiing accident.\n\nAt hospital admission, the patient was in hemorrhagic shock caused by severe blunt splenic injury. He underwent an immediate splenectomy with massive transfusion: 9 packed red blood cells units, 7 fresh frozen plasma units, and 1 whole blood platelet pool. Because of hemopneumothorax, multiple rib fractures, and pulmonary contusions, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome developed, and the patient was treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 3 days. The patient received another whole blood platelet pool transfusion at day 5 posttrauma and was treated with renal replacement therapy for 6 weeks.\n\nOn day 15 posttrauma, the patient had icterus, and liver blood tests revealed cholestasis; ultrasound findings showed acalculous cholecystitis. Because bile drainage via percutaneous cholecystectomy was insufficient and led to septic shock (day 18), the patient underwent open cholecystectomy. The diagnosis of ulcerated cholecystitis was confirmed by histologic examination; _Enterococcus faecium_ was isolated from blood and bile samples. Cholestasis, icterus, and cytolysis gradually resolved over the next week postoperatively; however, liver blood test results did not return to normal. Histological examination of the liver tissue from the biopsy performed during cholecystectomy gave normal results, and there was no evidence of drug-induced toxicity.\n\nAt day 40, liver blood tests indicated a renewed increase in cholestasis and cytolysis. Meanwhile, the patient's clinical condition had improved, renal function had recovered, and the tracheal tube was removed. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen showed normal findings. Viral serologic tests were negative for Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, HIV, and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. However, reverse transcription PCR testing revealed HEV positivity, with HEV viremia reaching 180 000 copies/mL. Serologic tests for HEV IgM (ASSURE HEV IgM Rapid Test; MP Biomedicals, Singapore) and IgG (HEV IgG ELISA; Wantai, Coutaboeuf, France) were negative at that time, but a blood sample taken on day 75 posttrauma showed HEV IgM.\n\nThe patient was not considered to be immunocompromised. Serologic tests for HIV were negative, leukocyte counts were within reference ranges, and no steroids were given to treat trauma. Neither the patient nor his family reported recent travel to HEV endemic areas or intake of uncooked or poorly cooked pork or game meat in the 3 months before the accident. All transfused blood products were retrospectively tested for HEV, and the blood platelet pool transfused at day 5 was identified as coming from an HEV-infected donor, who had viremia reaching 290 copies/mL. Evidence of direct blood contamination was provided by genotyping, which showed the virus in the donor and blood platelet pool were identical. HEV from the patient and the contaminated platelet pool were both HEV subtype 3f, and a phylogenetic study of the open reading frame 2 coding region by neighbor-joining cluster analysis confirmed the homology.\n\nBecause the patient was at high risk for severe acute HEV infection, treatment with 800 mg/day of ribavirin was initiated on day 45; the patient experienced severe nausea and vomiting but had no anemia. The course of the HEV infection reflected a slow response to the treatment. At 80 days posttrauma, the patient was still icteric with unchanged liver blood test results; HEV viremia was higher than before (23 400 000). After 2 months on ribavirin treatment (day 110), HEV viremia started to decrease, but 3 months of treatment were needed for viremia levels to reach under 100 copies/mL (day 135).\n\nThe potential for HEV transmission by contaminated blood product transfusion, attributable to the high prevalence of HEV infection in asymptomatic blood donors, has been reported (1). Prevalence of HEV infection is about 1/1500 blood donations in Europe, and an HEV transmission rate as high as 42% was observed in immunocompromised patients given HEV-positive blood products (2). Chronic liver infections have developed in immunosuppressed patients (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients, patients with HIV infection, and patients with hematological disease) given HEV genotype 3-contaminated products (3,4). A few cases of prolonged HEV viremia in immunocompetent patients have been described (5,6), but none were transfusion-induced HEV infections in patients after trauma.\n\nSuccessful treatments with ribavirin have been reported for transplant patients and patients with leukemia or HIV, including those at high risk for severe HEV infection (7). Treatment with ribavirin is usually characterized by rapid viral clearance (8) and ribavirin-induced anemia. Ribavirin could act by direct inhibition of viral replication or an immunomodulatory effect (9).\n\nThis case describes HEV infection acquired by an immunocompetent patient through transfusion of a contaminated blood product. Clinicians should consider the risk for HEV infection in trauma patients who receive large transfusions.\n\n[Authors: Loyrion E, Trouve-Buisson T, Pouzol P, et al]\n\nReferences\n---------\n1.

In Europe, the vast majority of autochthonous HEV infections are caused by HEV genotype 3 (gt-3) and are linked to the consumption of contaminated food. In general, HEV gt-3 infection remains asymptomatic or presents as mild self-limited acute hepatitis [5]. HEV IgG seroprevalence in Europe ranges from 17 percent in Germany to 26 percent in France among the general population, indicating widespread contact with HEV [6,7]. A HEV IgG seroprevalence of 6.8 percent was determined among German blood donors in 2011, and HEV RNA was detected in 0.08 percent of donations [8,9]. Juhl et al. reported an HEV IgG incidence in donors of 0.35 percent per year [9]. A total of 7.4 million blood products were administered in Germany in 2013, and between 1600 and 5900 HEV RNA-positive blood donations could be occurring in Germany per year [8,10]. In the Netherlands, 1 HEV-positive donation per day was reported, which implies that transmission by transfusion could be a likely event in both countries [11].\n\nAn estimated 30-40 percent of blood products in Germany were transfused to immunocompromised patients and these patients are at risk of developing chronic HEV gt-3 infection with increased mortality [5]. Sequence analysis of HEV strains from the Czech Republic, Germany and the Netherlands showed close homology indicating a geographically confined circulation [8]. This is supported by the high degree of sequence identity of our and recent Czech and Dutch sequences. Zoonotic transmission from pigs to humans seems to be the major mode of infection, but occupational exposure to pigs was not reported in our case [6].\n\nTwo important observations were made in this study. Firstly, we could show that the infectious dose required for HEV infection seems to be low, that is, HEV RNA concentrations close to the limit of detection of the real-time RT-PCR. Low levels of HEV RNA in asymptomatic donors have already been reported but without evidence for transmission [8,9]. Interestingly, Juhl et al speculated that viremia of around 125 IU/mL in the presence of anti-HEV IgM was not sufficient for transfusion-associated infection [9]. However, it is not clear if HEV antibodies can prevent infection. A recent study showed that infectious HEV could be propagated in cell culture in the presence of HEV-specific antibodies, suggesting that they do not efficiently reduce virus infectivity [12]. In addition, a clinical study demonstrated that anti-HEV IgG did not uniformly protect against re-infection [13].\n\nSecondly, the duration of viremia in our asymptomatic donor did not exceed 45 days, based on the time interval between the last and the first HEV RNA-negative donation. The interval of 14 days between 1st and last HEV RNA-positive donation was even shorter than the 27 to 58 days reported by Slot et al., but could be due to the shorter sampling interval in our study [11]. From our and previously published data it is obvious that highly sensitive methods would be required if screening for HEV RNA were to be considered for blood products.\n\nTo conclude, we could demonstrate that transmission of HEV by asymptomatic donors with low-level viremia is possible. Current German guidelines in transfusion medicine do not recommend testing for HEV. Importantly, with regard to the possible severe consequences of transfusion-associated transmission of HEV, especially in immunocompromised patients, the necessity of screening for HEV RNA needs to be discussed in countries with a high HEV prevalence. However, more data regarding the HEV disease burden due to blood transfusions are needed before recommendations can be made.\n\nReferences\n----------\n2.

Genotypes 1 and 2 are hyperendemic in developing countries, restricted to humans, and transmission occurs by the fecal-oral route [2,3]. In industrialized countries, genotypes 3 and 4 are responsible for sporadic cases of HEV infection. However, the incidence of non-travel-associated HEV infections has increased, and hepatitis E is now recognized as an emerging and often undiagnosed disease [1,4,5]. The genetic similarity of strains isolated from humans and other mammalian species suggests zoonotic or food-borne transmission [6,7].\n\nHepatitis E presents asymptomatically or symptomatically. Symptomatic infection presents as an acute, mostly self-limiting hepatitis with clinical characteristics similar to hepatitis A [2]. Clinical manifestations of HEV infections caused by the different genotypes are indistinguishable. Genotype 3 and 4 patients are usually middle-aged and elderly men, whereas genotypes 1 and 2 also cause acute hepatitis in healthy children and adolescents [8]. The pathogenic impact of genotype 1 and 2 and genotype 3 and 4 differ considerably. HEV genotype 1 and 2 infections lead to a high mortality among pregnant women in developing countries (8-20% [9,10]) while no serious infections among pregnant women with genotypes 3 and 4 were described in industrialized countries. HEV genotype 3 and 4 infection proceed asymptomatically in immunocompetent individuals [8], but severe or fatal HEV infections have been observed in individuals with chronic liver disease [11,12], in transplant patients [13,14] and in immunosuppressed individuals [8]. Asymptomatic HEV infection has often been observed in blood donors [15-17], with reported prevalence rates of HEV RNA-positive donors of 1:2848 (England [18]), 1:1240 (Germany [17]) and 1:1761 (the Netherlands [19]).\n\nThe progression of viremia and the serological course of anti-HEV antibodies during clinically apparent HEV infection is well characterized [2,20,21], but so far little is known about the progression of infection in asymptomatic individuals, in whom HEV infection usually remains undetected. Therefore, we conducted a prospective study to characterize the duration of viremia, the antibody response (IgA, IgM and IgG), and the progression of liver-specific enzymes in 10 HEV genotype 3-infected German blood donors [17].\n\nMethods\n-------\nSpecimens:\nFrom July to September 2011, a total of 16 125 individual German blood donors were routinely screened for the presence of HEV RNA by the Uni.Blutspendedienst Ostwestfalen-Lippe. Their geographical origins were North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Hesse; 57.5 per cent (n = 9271) were male, with a median age of 33 years (range: 18-72), and 42.5 per cent were female (n = 6867), with a median age of 32 years (range: 18-71) [17]. The screening recovered 13 HEV RNA-positive donors. Retrospectively, residual plasma samples of one donation preceding and several donations following the initial HEV RNA-positive donation, taken within a short time distance from each other, (Table 1 [for tables and figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]) were available for 10 donors (D1 to D10, all male). The day of the detection of HEV RNA by PCR screening was defined as day 0, but HEV infection is most likely to have occurred before the beginning of our study period. This aspect limits the exact calculation of the diagnostic window between the detection of HEV RNA and anti-HEV antibodies. In addition, the period of detectability of antibodies may have started before the 1st positive sample and lasted beyond the last positive sample. To take this into account, we calculated 2 intervals of HEV-RNA positivity: Interval 1 started on the day of the 1st positive and ended on the day of the last positive sample, whereas interval 2 started at half of the interval between the last negative and 1st positive sample and lasted until half of the interval between the last positive and 1st negative sample. The duration of anti-HEV seropositivity was calculated according to interval 2.\n\nAll HEV-infected donors underwent pre-donation medical examination and negated current diseases or any known risk factors for viral infection. Post-donation questionnaires to elucidate risk factors for HEV infection were returned by six donors. The study protocol followed the ethical guidelines of the Ruhr University, Bochum, and was approved by the institutional review board. All donors provided informed consent.\n\nRNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR [see original URL - Mod.LL]\n\nSerological testing and measurement of liver-specific parameters: [see original URL - Mod.LL]\n\nResults\n-------\nProgression of hepatitis E virus RNA and anti-hepatitis E virus antibodies:\nThe progression of RNA concentration in follow-up samples from infected patients is shown in Figure panel A, and the key observations of HEV RNA progression are summarised in Table 1. HEV viremia persisted up to 52 days (D2 and D8, interval 1) with considerably different RNA concentrations in individual donors, ranging from 1.86--101 to 2.19--105 IU/mL. High RNA concentrations were observed in the window period ranging from 1.36--103 to 2.19--105 IU/mL. Taking the 2nd interval into account, the duration of viraemia was as long as 20 to 80 days. The maximum viremia was observed after 20 days, with a mean duration of 29 days for interval 1 and 49 days for interval 2 (Table 1).\n\nThe day of the detection of HEV RNA by PCR screening was defined as day 0. Grey-shaded areas (panels B-D): cut-off values of the different serological assays as described in the Methods section. Solid horizontal line (panel E): reference range of 0-50 U/L. Days in brackets after donor legend: time period were samples were taken. Ratio: extinction sample/calibrator.\n\nFigure panels B-D show the course of anti-HEV IgM, anti-HEV IgG (only results determined by the Mikrogen assay) and anti-HEV IgA. In samples of donor D3, HEV RNA and IgM antibodies were detectable in parallel. Likewise, HEV RNA, IgA and IgG antibodies were detected in parallel in samples of donor D5. This was probably due the fact that HEV infection occurred before the beginning of our HEV screening study period. The progression of anti-HEV IgA and IgM antibodies was virtually equal (Figure, panels B and D). Donor D8 did not have IgA antibodies at any time, and had a very limited increase of IgM antibodies that was only detectable on day 32 after the 1st detection of HEV RNA. In addition, IgA and IgM antibodies were not detectable in donors D9 and D10, but no samples were available between day 10 and 50 for donor D9 and between day 20 and 60 for donor D10, most probably including the time point where IgA/IgM seroconversion occurred. For the remaining donors, IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies were 1st detected between days 8 and 42 for IgA and IgM and between days 13 and 59 for IgG (Table 2, results Mikrogen assays).\n\nIn 4 donors (D1, D3, D7 and D8), IgM levels increased before IgG levels, and four donors (D2, D4, D5 and D6) showed a parallel increase of IgA, IgM and IgG. Detection of IgA before IgM was not observed, but IgA antibodies were detectable until the end of the observation period in donor D2 in the absence of IgM antibodies. In contrast, the detection period for anti-HEV IgM was longer than for IgA in donor D1 and donor D3. Three donors had detectable IgM (D3, D4 and D6) or IgA antibodies (D2, D4 and D6) more than 150 days after 1st detection of HEV RNA. The progression of IgG antibodies in donors D2 and D4 showed an almost equal rapid increase to high values of more than 100 U/mL 35 days after the 1st detection of HEV RNA (Figure, panel C). Donor D6 demonstrated a prolonged constant IgG increase to values higher than 100 U/mL, while the other donors showed a continuous moderate antibody increase (D1, D7, D8, D9 and D10) or a constant antibody titre (D5). A continuous decrease of anti-HEV IgG antibodies was observed in samples of donor D3.\n\nTable 2 further summarises the key observations on the progression of anti-HEV IgA, IgM and IgG. Here we concentrate on the Mikrogen anti-HEV IgM/IgG results; the Wantai results will be described further down. The diagnostic window before the detection of HEV-specific antibodies was up to 42 days for IgA and IgM (D4) and up to 59 days for IgG (D10); the mean values including all donors were 31 days for IgA and IgM and 34 days for IgG. The mean duration of seropositivity was 80 days for IgA antibodies and 69 days for IgM antibodies. The maximum IgM and IgG titres differed considerably between different donors (IgM mean: 71.83 U/mL, range: 26.23-123.9; IgG mean: 108.20 U/mL, range: 47.74-167.64).\n\nProgression of liver specific enzymes:\nElevated values of ALT were observed only for 5 donors (D1, D2, D7, D8 and D10). The ALT values showed a 2- to 4-fold (D1, D7, D8, D10) and an 11-fold (D2) increase compared with the reference value of 50 U/L. In donor D1, ALT levels showed 2 peaks, 1st on day 5, in the period when HEV RNA was detectable, and a 2nd minor peak on day 55 in the absence of detectable HEV RNA. The three donors D2, D7 and D8 had elevated ALT values within the 1st 40 days after 1st HEV-RNA detection, with HEV RNA detected at the same time. AST and GLDH values followed the progression of ALT in these three donors, all other donors had normal AST and GLDH values (Figure and data not shown). Total bilirubin was within the reference range for all donors (data not shown).\n\nComparison of the diagnostic window using different serological assays:\nWe further compared the timing of the 1st detection of different antibody classes during the window period when only HEV RNA was detectable and the duration of seropositivity of HEV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies using two different serological assays (Table 2). For IgM and IgG antibodies, the diagnostic window differed depending on the assay used (Table 2), with a mean of 31 days (IgM) and 34 days (IgG) for the Mikrogen assay and a mean of 30 days (IgM) and 32 days (IgG) for the Wantai assay. In addition, the duration of IgM seropositivity depended on the serological assay: the Mikrogen assay had a longer detection period than the Wantai assay (mean: 69 days and 63 days, respectively) with a range of with 23 to 130 days (Wantai) vs 7 to 159 days (Mikrogen). Overall, the Wantai assay showed a higher sensitivity than the Mikrogen assay and often detected IgM or IgG seropositivity at least one sampling point earlier (IgM: D8, IgG: D1, D3 and D7, Table 2).\n\nSamples taken at the 1st positive IgM and/or IgG detection by the two different assays and up to two consecutive samples were further analyzed by immunoblot (Table 3). Borderline results were counted as positive. The Mikrogen ELISA, Wantai ELISA and immunoblot revealed concordant IgM results for 12 samples and concordant IgG results for 15 samples. For 2 IgM and 2 IgG samples, only the Wantai ELISA gave positive results. In 8 IgM samples and 5 IgG samples, both ELISAs gave positive results but the interpretation of the immunoblot was negative\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nHEV viremia in symptomatic cases usually lasts from 4 to 6 weeks but can remain more than 100 days in some cases [23]. Liver enzyme values reach a peak about 6 weeks post exposure before decreasing towards normal levels by week 10 [20]. The typical serological course of an HEV infection shows an initial rise in short-lived anti-HEV IgM after 3 to 4 weeks that decline to baseline levels within 3 to 6 months, followed by an increase of IgG which remains detectable for up to 15 years [2,20,21]. However, the knowledge about the natural course of HEV infection in asymptomatic HEV-infected individuals is limited.\n\nThe clinically asymptomatic cases analyzed in this study represent the preselection of apparently healthy individuals voluntarily donating blood and lacking physically detectable symptoms of infection. The retrospective character of this study limited the availability of consecutive samples from the same donor taken less than 30 days apart and the accuracy of the calculated durations (viremia, seropositivity). The observed differences in the sensitivity of the serological assays further influenced the calculation of the diagnostic window. For example, it has been shown that the performance of anti-HEV IgG assays strongly influences the estimation of hepatitis E seroprevalence [24]. The progression of HEV RNA in a Japanese cohort of 15 patients with acute symptomatic hepatitis E was largely comparable with what we observed in our study [25]. In contrast to our results, anti-HEV IgA and IgM (1st detection: day 8-42) and IgG antibodies (1st detection: day 13-59) in the Japanese cohort were detectable in symptomatic cases in parallel to the presence of HEV RNA at 1st sampling [25], pointing towards an earlier onset of viremia in the patients without symptoms. Accordingly, anti-HEV IgA and IgM remained detectable until the end of the observation period in symptomatic cases in the Japanese cohort while two different progressions were observed in the asymptomatic cases in our study. Antibodies in some asymptomatic cases showed the same persistence as in symptomatic cases, whereas antibody levels in other asymptomatic cases continuously decreased and reached undetectable levels. Furthermore, we observed IgM positivity for a significantly longer period compared with the Japanese cohort with seropositivity (longer than 100 days in D3, D4 and D6). However, these differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases could be related to the performance of the ELISAs used. There is no consensus on whether immunoblot assays (rather than ELISAs) are needed in order to detect anti-HEV antibodies accurately. The immunoblot results in our study did not add informative value; the immunoblot provided negative results for samples with divergent results in the 2 different ELISAs, most probably because of inferior sensitivity.\n\nUnexpectedly, anti-HEV IgG antibodies declined under detectable levels in samples from donor D3. Previous studies have shown that the period when anti-HEV IgG remains detectable can vary individually from 6 months to 14 years, but HEV IgG antibodies have also been shown to disappear [26-28]. Remarkably, a rise in liver-specific enzymes was observed only in four of 10 asymptomatic individuals, although high viral loads were detected in plasma. The elevation of ALT may have been missed in donors D9 and D10 because of the long delay of 42 and 38 days between 2 samples, respectively, but for the other 8 donors, samples within the 1st 50 days after detection of HEV viremia were taken at average intervals of less than 10 days.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate about HEV genotype 3 and 4 infection and blood safety. Published reports of HEV infections transmitted by contaminated blood products [29,30] and of the detection of HEV genotypes 3 and 4 in plasma fractionation pools [31] and blood donors [15-17] suggest that transfusion transmission of HEV is probably not uncommon, with many undiagnosed subclinical infections [15,16]. In a recent study by Hewitt and colleagues, transmission of HEV genotype 3 via contaminated blood was demonstrated in 42 per cent of transfusion recipients [18]. The clinical course (asymptomatic, mild hepatitis or acute liver failure) and severity of HEV infection in transfusion recipients are variable, most probably depending on predisposition or immune status. The vast majority of HEV genotype 3 and 4 infections are most likely to result in an asymptomatic course [32] but, for instance, chronic manifestations of HEV genotype 3 infection in immunosuppressed persons can become important in industrialized countries [33]. Feray et al. concluded that transfusion of blood products not screened for HEV RNA is associated with the risk of chronic infection in immunocompromised patients [34]. Nevertheless, the clinical relevance of transfusion-associated HEV infection is insufficiently understood and more data are needed regarding the duration of viraemia, the infective dose, the role of anti-HEV in the recipient and the frequency of clinically apparent transfusion-transmitted HEV infection [35]. Our results on the progression of HEV viremia illuminate at least one of these questions. To our knowledge, neither the length of HEV window periods nor the course of HEV viraemia during window periods in blood donors have been studied so far. The observed high level viremia during window period infection could represent an underestimated risk of HEV transmission.\n\nPost-donation questionnaires returned by 6 donors did not reveal a potential source of HEV infection. None of the infected donors had traveled within 2 months before the HEV-positive donation. The consumption of pork meat was described by 5 of the 6 donors. The number of returned questionnaires in our study is too small for a statistically significant analysis. We currently perform routine HEV blood donor screening and ask those with positive results to answer a questionnaire.\n\nConclusion\n----------\nHEV viremia in symptomatic cases usually lasts from 4-6 weeks but can remain more than 100 days in some cases [23].

Asymptomatic HEV infection make NAT screening methods necessary to detect infection and avoid transfusion of contaminated blood donations. However, the majority of infections are transmitted via the zoonotic or food-borne route. It is therefore important to focus public health measures both on blood safety and also on other infection routes for patients at risk, including immunosuppressed patients.\n\n[authors: Vollmer T, Diekmann T, Eberhardt M, Knabbe C, Dreier J]\n\n[references are available at the URL above. - Mod.SH]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This study of hepatitis E genotype 3 infections in asymptomatic German individuals contributes a substantial amount of information about the timelines of infection, the risk of transfusion-related infection, and the number of cases with no rise in aminotransferases. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/101.]", "summary": "SH]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This study of hepatitis E genotype 3 infections in asymptomatic German individuals contributes a substantial amount of information about the timelines of infection, the risk of transfusion-related infection, and the number of cases with no rise in aminotransferases.

To take this into account, we calculated 2 intervals of HEV-RNA positivity: Interval 1 started on the day of the 1st positive and ended on the day of the last positive sample, whereas interval 2 started at half of the interval between the last negative and 1st positive sample and lasted until half of the interval between the last positive and 1st negative sample.

HEV viremia persisted up to 52 days (D2 and D8, interval 1) with considerably different RNA concentrations in individual donors, ranging from 1.86--101 to 2.19--105 IU/mL. High RNA concentrations were observed in the window period ranging from 1.36--103 to 2.19--105 IU/mL. Taking the 2nd interval into account, the duration of viraemia was as long as 20 to 80 days. For IgM and IgG antibodies, the diagnostic window differed depending on the assay used (Table 2), with a mean of 31 days (IgM) and 34 days (IgG) for the Mikrogen assay and a mean of 30 days (IgM) and 32 days (IgG) for the Wantai assay.

The maximum viremia was observed after 20 days, with a mean duration of 29 days for interval 1 and 49 days for interval 2 (Table 1). Asymptomatic HEV infection has often been observed in blood donors [15-17], with reported prevalence rates of HEV RNA-positive donors of 1:2848 (England [18]), 1:1240 (Germany [17]) and 1:1761 (the Netherlands [19]). We further compared the timing of the 1st detection of different antibody classes during the window period when only HEV RNA was detectable and the duration of seropositivity of HEV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies using two different serological assays (Table 2). The vast majority of HEV genotype 3 and 4 infections are most likely to result in an asymptomatic course [32] but, for instance, chronic manifestations of HEV genotype 3 infection in immunosuppressed persons can become important in industrialized countries [33].

HEV genotype 3 and 4 infection proceed asymptomatically in immunocompetent individuals [8], but severe or fatal HEV infections have been observed in individuals with chronic liver disease [11,12], in transplant patients [13,14] and in immunosuppressed individuals [8]. Accordingly, anti-HEV IgA and IgM remained detectable until the end of the observation period in symptomatic cases in the Japanese cohort while two different progressions were observed in the asymptomatic cases in our study. Therefore, we conducted a prospective study to characterize the duration of viremia, the antibody response (IgA, IgM and IgG), and the progression of liver-specific enzymes in 10 HEV genotype 3-infected German blood donors [17]. The progression of IgG antibodies in donors D2 and D4 showed an almost equal rapid increase to high values of more than 100 U/mL 35 days after the 1st detection of HEV RNA (Figure, panel C). Antibodies in some asymptomatic cases showed the same persistence as in symptomatic cases, whereas antibody levels in other asymptomatic cases continuously decreased and reached undetectable levels.

But scientists have not known, until now, what public health measures might help expectant mothers resist hepatitis E. The liver disease, spread by feces-contaminated water, is believed to be responsible for as many as 10 percent of all maternal deaths in Southeast Asia. 'For decades, we've been asking why pregnant women who get hepatitis E die at an alarming rate,' says Alain Labrique, associate professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health. 'This research suggests that pre-existing differences could be the key we've been seeking. These findings could pave the road for stepped-up nutritional monitoring of pregnant women in this part of the world and lead to recommendations for nutritional supplements.'\n\nThe study, published in the journal American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, identified anemia in 27.5 percent of women who became infected, compared with 10 percent of those in a control group of similar pregnant women who didn't become sick. 45 percent of hepatitis E-infected pregnant women were underweight, compared with a quarter of the control group. Women who were deficient in vitamin D and had lower levels of zinc also were more likely to be infected.\n\nThe study, conducted at the Bloomberg School's flagship JiVitA Research Project in Bangladesh, also found that the women who became infected tended to have higher levels of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, important to immune system functioning. This suggests that pre-existing immune dysfunction may also increase the risk of getting hepatitis E or other infectious diseases. For the study, researchers collected blood samples from 1100 women living in northern Bangladesh: once early in pregnancy, again in the 3rd trimester, and a 3rd time 3 months after birth. 40 women became infected with the hepatitis E virus over the course of the study. The control group comprised non-infected pregnant women who, because of their ages and where they lived, were believed to have similar exposure to the virus or other external risk factors.\n\nRoughly 20 million people are infected each year with hepatitis E, resulting in an estimated 70 000 deaths and 3000 stillbirths annually in developing countries.\n\n'Our research group estimates that hepatitis E causes about 10 500 maternal deaths every year just in Southeast Asia, and the nearly 30 percent fatality rate among pregnant women is as high as Ebola's during some outbreaks,' says lead author Brittany Kmush, a doctoral student in international health.\n\n'Most of the current knowledge about how hepatitis E affects pregnant women comes from studies looking at women who are already infected,' Labrique says. 'This population-based study was able to look at the health status of pregnant women before they became infected. If we can better understand what predisposes pregnant women to infection, we could also develop better programs that prevent infection from ever occurring.'\n\n[Posted by Brandon Howard]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This newly published paper provides some important potential insight into why there is a substantial increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus.\n\nKmush BL, Labrique A, Li W, et al: The association of cytokines and micronutrients with hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period in rural Bangladesh.

To save the 58-year-old retired plumber from northern Germany, doctors replaced his blood plasma with donated plasma lacking the antibodies that targeted the donor organ. It worked, but 3 years later, it's clear that he received something else in the bargain: the hepatitis E virus (HEV).\n\nIt's a pathogen that most people get rid of easily without even getting sick. But the man was taking drugs that dampen his immune system to prevent another rejection of his heart. As a result, he can't clear the virus; it has been quietly replicating in his liver ever since. 'If that is not resolved, it leads to liver fibrosis, then liver cirrhosis, then death,' Sven Pischke, his doctor at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, says matter-of-factly. 'That was a shock, of course,' the patient says.\n\nPatients like him are a new challenge for European physicians. Until a few years ago, no one even knew they existed. Hepatitis E was seen as an exotic disease that travelers from India or Africa sometimes brought home. Now, it's clear that there's a silent epidemic of the virus at home, with an estimated 300 000 people infected annually in Germany alone. Most appear to catch it from eating pork, with blood and plasma transfusions playing a smaller role. The virus occurs in other developed countries as well -- including the USA, Japan, and Australia -- though infections appear to be much rarer there.\n\nScientists are still scrambling to understand the epidemiology of hepatitis E, but they know that in Europe, infection rates rival those for other major hepatitis pathogens (A, B, and C). Two questions are looming large: Should blood donations be screened for the virus? And what can be done to eliminate it from swine herds?\n\nResearchers suspected a new form of hepatitis in 1978, when hundreds of people in Jammu and Kashmir, in northern India, got sick -- and 4 men and 6 pregnant women died -- from what appeared to be a waterborne hepatitis virus. Similar but larger outbreaks followed in India, Pakistan, and China, killing thousands of people, many of them pregnant women. It wasn't until 1983 that Russian scientist Mikhail Balayan isolated the virus from his own stool after a gutsy self-experiment: He drank a cocktail of yogurt and stool samples from Soviet soldiers infected in Afghanistan. Hepatitis E became known as an important waterborne pathogen in Asia and Africa; 2 strains, named genotype 1 and 2, together kill an estimated 58 000 people per year.\n\nBut in 1997, scientists discovered that pigs in the American Midwest carried a new strain of the virus, which they named genotype 3. It was soon identified in European pigs as well, and surveys showed that many Europeans had antibodies to it, a sign they had been infected at some point in their lives. Genotype 3 was very different from its relatives: Pork, not dirty water, appeared to be its main transmission route, and it seemed not to cause any symptoms. 'Hepatitis E does not exist,' says Hans Zaaijer, who heads the department of bloodborne infections at Sanquin, a nonprofit blood transfusion service in Amsterdam. 'These are 2 completely distinct diseases.' (It's not clear whether genotype 3 might also spread in developing countries, hiding in the shadow of its more obvious relatives.)\n\nAlas, the new strain wasn't as innocuous as it seemed. In 2008, French researchers reported that in a group of 300 recent transplant patients, 14 had an acute hepatitis E infection. Six got rid of the virus quickly, but 8 couldn't seem to shake it. At Hannover Medical School in Germany, hepatitis specialist Heiner Wedemeyer couldn't believe it at first. 'We are one of the largest transplantation centers in Europe,' he remembers thinking. 'We would have seen that.' But when he started screening patients he soon found some that were chronically infected with hepatitis E, as did other clinics all over Europe. Patients had one thing in common: a weakened immune system.\n\nThere's not much doctors can do to help them. For transplant patients, one option is lowering the doses of immunosuppressive drugs to allow the immune system to regenerate, but this increases the risk of organ rejection. Doctors also use ribavirin, a drug approved for hepatitis C and several other viral infections. But there hasn't been a controlled trial yet, and ribavirin has serious side effects.\n\nThese patients are the visible part of a much wider epidemic. Surveys have shown that 17% of adults in Germany have antibodies against the virus, meaning they became infected at some point; so do 14% in Austria, 4% in southern Italy, and 27% in the Netherlands. One Dutch study found that antibody levels in people aged 18 to 21 dropped from almost 20% in 1995 to less than 5% in 2000, then rose again to 13% in 2011, which suggests the infection is re-emerging, says Zaaijer, a co-author on the study.\n\nBlood and blood products account for at least some of the new infections. One study suggested that 1200 blood components containing the virus are transfused each year in the United Kingdom, and roughly one in 1000 blood donors in the Netherlands carries the virus. (By contrast, a recent U.S. study found the virus's genetic material in just one donor per 9500.)\n\nA much bigger risk factor is the consumption of sausages and other pork products. Hepatitis E has been shown to be ubiquitous in swine herds in many European countries. Most animals become infected without getting sick between 3 and 6 months after birth, when antibodies inherited from their mothers start to wane. And there's strong evidence that the virus is passed on to humans through pork. In one study, Wim van der Poel, a veterinary virologist at Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands, analyzed hepatitis E sequences found in Dutch blood donors between 2010 and 2015. 'When we looked for the closest sequence ever found, [it] was always a swine sequence from the same region,' he says.\n\nWhat's unclear is which pork products carry the highest risk. In one region in the south of France, infections have been linked to consumption of figatellu, a pig liver sausage that's often eaten raw. Scientists are still trying to pinpoint which other products contain the virus. It's difficult to culture the virus from meat products, and looking directly for viral RNA is technically complicated; moreover, finding RNA does not mean the food contains intact virus that can infect a consumer. Meanwhile, some studies have also shown a risk from eating shellfish or fruit.\n\nIn the United States, in contrast, hepatitis E 'is very rare even in transplant patients and the immunosuppressed,' says Jay Hoofnagle of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. One theory is that U.S. residents eat less raw or undercooked pork. Another theory: Pigs in Europe may suffer from immune deficiencies because of some other infection. 'An HIV-like agent may cause pigs or wild boar to develop chronic HEV infection,' Hoofnagle says.\n\nWith so many unknowns, controlling this silent epidemic is a challenge. Ireland already screens blood products for hepatitis E, and other countries are debating doing so. Like everything else involving the blood supply, 'it's a touchy subject,' Pischke says. Screening is costly and may not make sense for the general population, which has little to fear from HEV, says Rainer Seitz, head of transfusion medicine at the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Langen, Germany, a federal institute responsible for blood safety. But he supports screening blood products before use in immunocompromised patients. The virus's apparent ubiquity in pork products and elsewhere in the environment also makes general blood screening questionable, Zaaijer says. 'It's like screening donors for flu in times of flu. The blood is safe, but the air isn't,' he says. It's far more important to make food and water free of hepatitis E, he adds.\n\nOne way to do that would be to vaccinate pigs. A human vaccine has already been approved in China, and scientists think a swine vaccine is feasible as well. But getting pig farmers to adopt it would be difficult, Van der Poel predicts, because their animals don't get sick. And you'd have to be careful to vaccinate every last animal in a herd, Zaaijer adds; otherwise, the virus might just spread slowly, meaning that animals would get infected later in life, closer to slaughter, which might increase the risk in meat.\n\nReimar Johne, who studies hepatitis E at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, is trying to find out how the virus can be inactivated in food. 20 minutes at 70 C [158 F] destroys it, but what about drying, smoking, or curing meat? To find out, Johne has started to make sausages in the lab himself. After adding a strain of hepatitis E, he can process the meat any way he wants and check whether viable virus survives. 'It's a bit artificial,' he says. 'But for the moment, it's all we have.'\n\n[Byline: Kai Kupferschmidt]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is an excellent posting on the zoonotic genotype 3 strain of HEV. - Mod.LL]", "summary": "Researchers suspected a new form of hepatitis in 1978, when hundreds of people in Jammu and Kashmir, in northern India, got sick -- and 4 men and 6 pregnant women died -- from what appeared to be a waterborne hepatitis virus. One study suggested that 1200 blood components containing the virus are transfused each year in the United Kingdom, and roughly one in 1000 blood donors in the Netherlands carries the virus.

It's difficult to culture the virus from meat products, and looking directly for viral RNA is technically complicated; moreover, finding RNA does not mean the food contains intact virus that can infect a consumer. \n\nBlood and blood products account for at least some of the new infections. And you'd have to be careful to vaccinate every last animal in a herd, Zaaijer adds; otherwise, the virus might just spread slowly, meaning that animals would get infected later in life, closer to slaughter, which might increase the risk in meat. One Dutch study found that antibody levels in people aged 18 to 21 dropped from almost 20% in 1995 to less than 5% in 2000, then rose again to 13% in 2011, which suggests the infection is re-emerging, says Zaaijer, a co-author on the study. Hepatitis E does not exist,' says Hans Zaaijer, who heads the department of bloodborne infections at Sanquin, a nonprofit blood transfusion service in Amsterdam. ' It worked, but 3 years later, it's clear that he received something else in the bargain: the hepatitis E virus (HEV). \n\n[Byline: Kai Kupferschmidt]\n\n--\n Now, it's clear that there's a silent epidemic of the virus at home, with an estimated 300 000 people infected annually in Germany alone. But in 1997, scientists discovered that pigs in the American Midwest carried a new strain of the virus, which they named genotype 3. After adding a strain of hepatitis E, he can process the meat any way he wants and check whether viable virus survives. ' Hepatitis E became known as an important waterborne pathogen in Asia and Africa; 2 strains, named genotype 1 and 2, together kill an estimated 58 000 people per year. In one study, Wim van der Poel, a veterinary virologist at Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands, analyzed hepatitis E sequences found in Dutch blood donors between 2010 and 2015. Surveys have shown that 17% of adults in Germany have antibodies against the virus, meaning they became infected at some point; so do 14% in Austria, 4% in southern Italy, and 27% in the Netherlands. The virus occurs in other developed countries as well -- including the USA, Japan, and Australia -- though infections appear to be much rarer there. Screening is costly and may not make sense for the general population, which has little to fear from HEV, says Rainer Seitz, head of transfusion medicine at the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Langen, Germany, a federal institute responsible for blood safety. To save the 58-year-old retired plumber from northern Germany, doctors replaced his blood plasma with donated plasma lacking the antibodies that targeted the donor organ. Scientists are still scrambling to understand the epidemiology of hepatitis E, but they know that in Europe, infection rates rival those for other major hepatitis pathogens (A, B, and C). \n\nA much bigger risk factor is the consumption of sausages and other pork products. It wasn't until 1983 that Russian scientist Mikhail Balayan isolated the virus from his own stool after a gutsy self-experiment: He drank a cocktail of yogurt and stool samples from Soviet soldiers infected in Afghanistan. \n\nReimar Johne, who studies hepatitis E at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, But when he started screening patients he soon found some that were chronically infected with hepatitis E, as did other clinics all over Europe. Ireland already screens blood products for hepatitis E, and other countries are debating doing so. In the United States, in contrast, hepatitis E 'is very rare even in transplant patients and the immunosuppressed,' says Jay Hoofnagle of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\nWhat's unclear is which pork products carry the highest risk. Two questions are looming large: Should blood donations be screened for the virus?

'Results of the epidemiological and veterinary investigations suggest that this outbreak was due to contaminated spit-roasted piglet,' the researchers wrote. 'In industrialized countries, acute [hepatitis E virus (HEV)] infections are an emerging concern and clusters of cases linked to HEV foodborne transmission remain rare and small. To our knowledge, only 4 previously published investigations revealed clinical HEV strains homologous to strains recovered from food leftovers.'\n\nIn December 2013, 3 cases of HEV on a coastal island in France were reported to the country's public health surveillance. The cases were\ndetected in serum samples using reverse transcription-PCR, with all strains belonging to the same sequence subtype. Those infected reported attending a wedding where a spit-roasted piglet stuffed with a raw stuffing -- composed of minced liver and heart, vegetables and wheat semolina -- was served.\n\nThe researchers also interviewed 111 other attendees via telephone to determine demographics, symptoms, associated medical attention and exposures to food and drink served. Attendees were encouraged to discuss or receive testing with their general practitioners, creating a cohort of 38 sampled participants with no evidence of past HEV infection. Positive cases were compared with the outbreak strain by phylogenetic analysis, as well as with identified samples from the piglet's herd and from wastewater collected from plants on the island.\n\nAlong with the 3 confirmed index cases, public health surveillance identified 14 new cases of potential HEV infection. The median age of these patients was 52 years, 82.4 percent were female, 2 were hospitalized and all but 1 were from the island where the incident occurred. Only 5 of the cases showed symptoms, implying that 70.6 percent of identified cases were asymptomatic.\n\nPiglet stuffing was consumed by more than half of identified cases, and consumption was independently associated with acute HEV infection (RR = 1.69; 95 percent CI, 1.04-2.73). All 9 samples collected from the farm where the piglet was reared were positive for HEV, and HEV RNA was detected in wastewater samples collected at 2 treatment stations 6 days after the wedding. Phylogenetic analysis of strains collected from the farm and the wastewater were 100 percent identical and 99-99.6 percent similar to the 3 clinical strains recovered from index cases.\n\n'Our investigation attributed the outbreak to the consumption of undercooked stuffing partly made from a piglet's liver.

More recently, an avian HEV was identified and characterized from chickens with Hepatitis-Splenomegaly (HS) syndrome in 2001 in the USA as well. Besides swine and chickens, recently strains of HEV have been genetically identified from deer, mongooses, rabbits, and rats.'\n\nAccumulating evidence indicates that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine (and likely other animal species) are reservoirs. Swine and human strains of HEV are genetically closely related and, in some cases, indistinguishable, and direct transmission through the consumption of contaminated food products such as pork have been reported in Japan.

The incidence of hepatitis by HEV was detected in this work to 7.2 cases per 100 patients per year. This is a prospective work done in 698 HIV-infected patients without antibodies in the blood of HEV, who were followed for 1 year. The study described the clinical manifestations of acute hepatitis E in patients infected with HIV, whose form of presentation was primarily a febrile syndrome with or without elevated liver enzymes. In the study, led by Antonio Rivero Juarez, researcher of the study group of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (GeSIDA), a higher incidence of hepatitis E was noted in the rural areas (17.4 cases per 100 patients per year), and no relationship was found between hepatitis E and other possible risk factors associated with HIV or coinfection with hepatitis B or C.\n\nDeveloped at the Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research of Cordoba by a team of scientific experts in infectious diseases, the study was presented at the Congress on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), the most important scientific meeting of the world on this matter, held last week in Seattle (Washington state, USA).\n\nHEV is an RNA virus that has been described with 4 genotypes of different epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Genotypes 1 and 2 are transmitted primarily by contaminated drinking water, and to a lesser extent by person-to-person contact, affecting exclusively humans in the form of disease outbreaks. On the contrary, genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic infections and endemic, whose reservoirs are pigs, wild boars and other animals living free, being transmitted by direct contact or consumption of meat from infected animals. Recent studies in slaughterhouses and chains of European food production suggest that the high presence of HEV genotype 3 in animal products for human consumption, and the spread of the HEV genotype 3 to humans through this track could become important.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-ESP\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is in part derived from Pavio N, Meng X-J, Renou C: Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks.

More recently, an avian HEV was identified and characterized from chickens with hepatitis-splenomegaly (HS) syndrome in 2001 in the USA as well. Besides swine and chickens, recently strains of HEV have been genetically identified from deer, mongooses, rabbits, and rats.\n\nAccumulating evidence indicates that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine (and likely other animal species) are reservoirs. Swine and human strains of HEV are genetically closely related and, in some cases, indistinguishable, and direct transmissions through the consumption of contaminated food products such as pork have been reported in Japan.

The virus is spread by fecal-oral transmission. Hepatitis A is closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage contaminated- or inadequately treated water.\n\nIn developing countries [where sanitary conditions are poor], most children experience infection in early childhood.

There has been an 'abrupt rise' in the number of cases in England and Wales as people do not realize the risk, scientists advising the government say. Sausages should be cooked for 20 minutes at 70 C [158 F] to kill the virus, they said.\n\nAlthough serious cases are rare, HEV can cause significant liver damage or be fatal.

There were 461 cases in the 1st 6 months of 2014.\n\nProfessor Richard Tedder, at University College London (UCL), said HEV was 'very common' in the UK; not all cases are noticed or recorded. 'This virus is taking off within the pig herds from which this country sources its processed pig meat in sausages and pork pies,' he said.\n\nProf Tedder said sausages needed to be 'caramelized' -- cooked thoroughly -- before eating to make sure they did not pose a health risk. 'It's a question of getting people to change,' he said. 'Everybody knows you can get salmonellosis from chicken.'\n\nHe said the virus occurred in the animal and in the blood system and warned it would continue unless there was a 'big change' in animal practices, such as introducing different hygiene measures.\n\nDr Richard Bendall, at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust, said HEV was found in 10 per cent of sausages and processed pork meat. This estimate comes from a study that looked at the pork production chain in the UK.\n\nDr Harry Dalton, also at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust, said the virus was not just confined to pigs; people had caught it from strawberries irrigated with infected water.

NSW Health, in collaboration with the NSW Food Authority and the Department of Primary Industries, is investigating the cases which were recorded over the past few days.\n\nDr Jeremy McAnulty, the Director of Health Protection with NSW Health, said 3 individuals have likely contracted the illness after consuming either pork liver or pork liver sausages that may not have been properly cooked at home. 'Hepatitis E virus has previously been identified in Australian pig herds but until recently there has been no evidence that humans have acquired the virus from pork products in Australia,' Dr McAnulty said.\n\n'Hepatitis E is common in developing countries where there is poor sanitation and little access to clean drinking water. Although infections have been linked to the consumption of pork products in other developed countries, this has not been seen in Australia before.\n\n'In 2010 there were 14 notifications of Hepatitis E in NSW, in 2011 there were 21 notifications and in 2012 there were 10 notifications - all of which were thought to have been acquired overseas. In 2013, there were 19 notifications of the virus across the State and for the 1st time included a small number which were acquired locally. So far in 2014, there have been 27 notifications, many without a history of overseas travel but with a history of eating pork particularly pork liver during the time they were likely exposed to the virus.'\n\nDr Lisa Szabo, Chief Scientist NSW Food Authority, said any raw food product has an element of food safety risk unless it is correctly handled and prepared. 'Undercooking pork livers and poor handling of them can be dangerous,' Dr Szabo said. 'Cooking livers all the way through will reduce the risk of contracting Hepatitis E virus or other organisms.'\n\nPotentially harmful viruses and bacteria that may be associated with pork livers are all destroyed by thorough cooking and proper handling.\nPork livers need to be cooked all the way through to kill any organisms that may be present, lightly searing the surface is not enough.\n\nCook to 75\u00b0C at the center of the thickest part for at least 2 minutes as measured using a digital probe meat thermometer before removing meat from the heat source. Allow livers to rest for at least three minutes before consuming.\n\nIt is also important to handle pork livers in a way to avoid cross-contamination. To avoid cross-contamination (where particles from raw food come into contact with ready-to-eat foods), it is very important to:\n-wash your hands in hot soapy water and dry thoroughly before preparing food and after touching raw meat;\n-make sure juices from raw meat do not come into contact with other foods\n-thoroughly clean all utensils, equipment and surfaces after preparing raw meat and before contact with other foods;\n-if possible use a separate cutting board and knife specifically for raw meat;\n-store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge so juices can't drip onto other foods; and\n-keep uncooked raw meat away from other ready-to-eat foods that will not be cooked.\n\nDr Jeremy McAnulty said the symptoms of hepatitis E vary dramatically. 'Someone infected with Hepatitis E can experience no symptoms, a mild illness lasting a couple of weeks or a severe disease which may be fatal,' he said. 'If symptoms occur, they can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, dark urine and yellowing of the skin and eyeballs (jaundice).\n\n'Hepatitis E virus infection is most serious in pregnant women (especially during the third trimester of a pregnancy), and in people who have pre-existing chronic liver disease.\n\n'Most people will clear the virus and recover completely.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is in part derived from Pavio N, Meng X-J, Renou C: Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks.

Almost half of the reported cases were identified in South Darfur's Kalma camp for the displaced. In Blue Nile state, more than 80 cases have been reported, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan reports in its latest weekly bulletin released today, 25 Sep 2014.\n\nAccording to the WHO, as of 17 Sep 2014, a total of 84 hepatitis E cases, with 3 deaths, have been reported in the area of Madina 10, Geissan locality, Blue Nile state. The actual number of people infected with the hepatitis virus may be much higher, as this is an area with a large population and most of the cases go unreported as people make use of traditional treatments.\n\nIn response, the Blue Nile state's Ministry of Health, with the support of Unicef, and the government's Water and Sanitation Department, is implementing controlling measures including active case searching, soap and chlorine tablet distribution, as well as health education and community awareness activities. WHO is supporting the Health Ministry in coordination, surveillance, active case finding, appropriate case management, and water quality monitoring and testing.\n\nAccording to WHO, 628 people are suffering from hepatitis E in South Darfur. The number of patients in El Salam and Kalma camps is gradually declining, owing to treatment by humanitarian organisations. Cases have increased, however, in El Sareif camp, Nyala locality, during the last 3 weeks, OCHA reported.\n\nApart from treatment, humanitarian organizations have organised health education activities focusing on preventative measures. Jerry cans, soap and hygiene kits have been distributed, water points and storage containers were cleaned, new latrines constructed, the water quality tested, and infected water points disinfected.\n\nThe humanitarian organizations operating in South Darfur still face challenges and constraints, including insufficient ground water supplies and a lack of funding. There is also a significant shortage in the number of latrines available for use. Oxfam-USA has constructed 100 new latrines; however, this is well short of the 2000 latrines required.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Both South Darfur and Blue Nile states are in southern Sudan bordering the nation of South Sudan, where hepatitis E is also occurring.\n\nThe following discussion (with the citations removed) regarding various strains is from Kamar N, Bendall R, Florence Legrand-Abravanel F, et al: Hepatitis E. Lancet 2012;379: 2477-2488:\n\n'Molecular characterization of various HEV [hepatitis E virus] strains circulating among human beings and animals has led to the recognition of 4 major genotypes, representing a single serotype. HEV1 and HEV2 are restricted to human beings and transmitted via contaminated water in developing countries. HEV1 occurs mainly in Asia, and HEV2 in Africa and Mexico. HEV3 and HEV4 infect human beings, pigs, and other mammalian species and are responsible for sporadic cases of autochthonous hepatitis E in both developing and developed countries. HEV3 has a worldwide distribution. By contrast, HEV4 mostly occurs in southeast Asia, but has recently been isolated in European pigs. Although HEV3 and HEV4 infections have been linked to the consumption of raw or undercooked pork or game meat, the full range of species that are reservoirs for HEV is still unknown. On the basis of full-length genome-sequence analyses, HEV genotypes have recently been characterized in rats in Germany, wild boars in Japan, and farmed rabbits in China. HEV1 can be classified into 5 subgenotypes, HEV2 into 2, HEV3 into 3, and HEV4 into 7. Phylogenetic analyses show that HEV subgenotypes circulating in human beings and animals in the same area are closely related, supporting zoonotic transmission.

At least 4 people have died at Lakes state's Mingkaman internally displaced camp, OCHA said in its latest bulletin.\n\nJohn Parach, a local administrator, told Sudan Tribune that the disease has affected both the host population and those displaced, forcing them to flee from the area. He said poor sanitation and regular flooding caused by rainwater that destroyed toilets have accelerated the spread of the viral disease. 'This place is lowland, and many of the toilets built in February 2014 were not good enough. Most of them went down when heavy rains started; feces went randomly with the water, contaminating people around; this increased the level of infection,' Parach said by phone. Those affected, he said, are being handled by Medicines San Frontiers (MSF) at its health center in Mingkaman, with women and children said to be the most affected.

Hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver, is commonly caused by viral infection. According to WHO, hepatitis E is included among the most concerning iterations of the disease (types A, B, C, D and E) because of its epidemic potential.\n\nThe humanitarian affairs officer for the IDP, Essa Salih, told Sudan Tribune on Wednesday [3 Sep 2014] that 150 people, mostly children, pregnant women and elderly, [have] died, while 500 others have been infected with hepatitis due to rapid spread of the disease in the past 2 months [Jul-Sep 2014]. He added that the proliferation of the disease was caused by malnutrition and lack of adequate health services inside the camp, pointing out that most of the infected people died at Nyala Teaching Hospital.\n\nSaleh noted the disease became the biggest threat to IDP in South Darfur state following expulsion of foreign aid groups in 2009. Immediately after the 1st arrest warrant of the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Sudan's president Omer Hassan al-Bashir in March 2009, Sudan expelled 13 aid groups from Darfur, accusing it of collaborating with the war crime courts. Saleh called for the urgent intervention of the health ministry and aid groups to contain the disease in Kalma camp, warning against its spread to other IDP camps. He also pointed to the growing malnutrition diseases among children and elderly in the camps.\n\nThe health minister in South Darfur state, Omer Suleiman, for his part confirmed existence of hepatitis E cases, saying he hasn't yet received precise numbers, stressing ongoing efforts to remedy the situation.\n\nNyala Teaching Hospital suffers from a severe shortage of doctors, particularly specialists, following resignations of significant numbers of them due to government's failure to pay their salary arrears for years.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nTony Ellam\nretired consultant in communicable disease control\n<tonypj@meadlane.freeserve.co.uk>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Tony Ellam for this contribution.\n\nHepatitis E has been a significant issue in Darfur.

Emerg Infect Dis 2014; 20(11) [date cited]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe number of sporadic autochthonous cases of acute hepatitis E is increasing in many industrialized countries (1). These cases involve hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 3 and 4, which are zoonotic. Although risk for foodborne transmission from pork is now recognized, we report here direct HEV transmission through ingestion of raw pig liver sausages (figatellu [plural: figatelli]) in southeastern France.\n\nThe index case-patient was a 45-year-old woman from Hyeres ([a commune in the Var department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur regionin] southeastern France) who had no underlying medical condition. She visited her general practitioner on 17 Dec 2013, reporting 3 days of weakness. Acute hepatitis was diagnosed 2 days later on the basis of elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase 1265 IU/L [reference less than 35 IU/L]) and bilirubin (65 micromol/L [reference less than 17 micromol/L]). Serum markers for acute hepatitis A, B, and C; cytomegalovirus; and Epstein-Barr virus were negative. Jaundice appeared on 19 Dec 2013 and the patient was referred to the Medical Unit of Hyeres for additional investigations. A serum sample collected on 20 Dec 2013 tested positive for HEV RNA; viral load was 3.3 log10 IU/mL (Ceeram, La Chapelle sur Erdre, France), and IgM and IgG against HEV were found (Wantai, Beijing, China), which led to the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E. The HEV genotype was 3f, as determined from the phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the open reading frame (ORF) 2 (2). The index case-patient recovered by the end of January 2014. HEV viremia was undetectable on 17 Jan 2014.\n\nThe index case-patient and her family regularly ate figatelli (raw pork liver sausages) made in Corsica. The patient had most recently eaten figatelli at a lunch with 8 family members on 28 Oct 2013, 7 weeks before illness onset. After receiving informed consent, we conducted laboratory investigations of samples from the other family members; tests included HEV serology and HEV RNA detection in serum and fecal samples. Samples were obtained from family members during January 8-21 Jan 2014 (41-54 days after the lunch). Positive HEV IgM and detectable HEV RNA were found in the serum of the index case-patient's daughter, who was asymptomatic. Because the sample was tested 10 weeks after the family lunch, the daughter's HEV viral load was too low to enable sequence characterization and clustering of HEV strains. 3 other family members were IgG positive for HEV, indicating previous HEV infection. Leftover sausages had been kept frozen and were available for HEV testing.\n\nHEV RNA was detectable from the leftover sausages, and HEV sequences were amplified in 2 different genomic regions (ORF1: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and ORF2), as described previously (2). Comparison with the index case-patient's sequences showed 100 percent identity for both regions (Figure - for figure, see source URL above - Mod.LL). Samples of food and samples from the index case-patient were analyzed in 2 independent laboratories to avoid any cross-contamination. The level of contamination of the figatellu was 48 000 copies of HEV RNA/g of sausage (3).\n\nFigatellu, a dried sausage, contains 30 percent pork liver and no heating step occurs during its manufacture. Usually deep cooking is recommended on the package, but consumers might not follow the cooking recommendation; also, figatelli can be sold in small local shops with no label. In the instance reported here, the figatellu was sold without any warning label and was eaten raw.\n\nThat HEV was transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food is supported by the following evidence:\n- 3 case reports have provided direct evidence of HEV transmission through ingestion of contaminated animal food products with identical or near identical sequences between the patients and the contaminated food they ate. 2 cases occurred in the early 2000s in Japan through consumption of grilled wild boar (4) or sashimi of Sika deer (5); the 3rd, reported recently in Spain, was transmitted through ingestion of pig meat (6).\n- HEV widely infects domestic pigs and wild boar (7).\n- Swine and human HEV strains have genetic similarities and, in some cases, are indistinguishable (1).\n- In Marseille, France, a case-control study identified ingestion of figatellu as a risk factor for HEV infection. Genetic similarities were found between sequences isolated from patients with autochthonous hepatitis E and nonrelated figatelli purchased in the same region (8). Finally, infectious virus, replicating in a 3-dimensional culture system, was identified in a HEV RNA-positive figatellu (9).\n\nIn the present study, the homology between sequences recovered from the index case-patient and those recovered from leftovers of figatellu provides additional proof of HEV foodborne transmission in a Western country. In France, information about the risk for HEV transmission through the ingestion of such delicatessen was published by French authorities in 2010 (10), but the present case demonstrates that public education and warning, or larger and more explicit labels on the package, must be improved to reduce the risk for HEV exposure.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The index case-patient and her family regularly ate figatelli (raw pork liver sausages) made in Corsica. 2 cases occurred in the early 2000s in Japan through consumption of grilled wild boar (4) or sashimi of Sika deer (5); the 3rd, reported recently in Spain, was transmitted through ingestion of pig meat (6). Berto A, Grierson S, Hakze-van der Honing R, et al: Hepatitis E virus in pork liver sausage, France. Acute hepatitis was diagnosed 2 days later on the basis of elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase 1265 IU/L [reference less than 35 IU/L]) and bilirubin (65 micromol/L [reference less than 17 micromol/L]).

Pig liver sausage as a source of hepatitis E virus transmission to humans. Samples of food and samples from the index case-patient were analyzed in 2 independent laboratories to avoid any cross-contamination. Thus, zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E raises an important public health concern over food safety and zoonotic risk. These cases involve hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 3 and 4, which are zoonotic. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is in part derived from Pavio N, Meng X-J, Renou C: Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks. \n\nAccumulating evidence indicates that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine (and likely other animal species) are reservoirs. Swine and human strains of HEV are genetically closely related and, in some cases, indistinguishable, and direct transmissions through the consumption of contaminated food products such as pork have been reported in Japan. The patient had most recently eaten figatelli at a lunch with 8 family members on 28 Oct 2013, 7 weeks before illness onset. \n- Swine and human HEV strains have genetic similarities and, in some cases, are indistinguishable (1). \n\nHEV RNA was detectable from the leftover sausages, and HEV sequences were amplified in 2 different genomic regions (ORF1: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and ORF2), as described previously (2).

Swine HEV was first isolated and genetically characterized from pigs in the USA in 1997, even though HEV antibodies and RNA were reportedly detected from pigs in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal but the identity of the virus infecting the Nepalese pigs was not determined in that study. Comparison with the index case-patient's sequences showed 100 percent identity for both regions (Figure - for figure, see source URL above - Mod.LL). Genetic similarities were found between sequences isolated from patients with autochthonous hepatitis E and nonrelated figatelli purchased in the same region (8). Finally, infectious virus, replicating in a 3-dimensional culture system, was identified in a HEV RNA-positive figatellu (9).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis a", "hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2012-03-25 00:00:00", "5153-09-25 00:00:00", "2013-03-25 00:00:00", "1997-03-25 00:00:00", "1265-03-25 00:00:00", "2014-03-25 00:00:00", "1374-08-25 00:00:00", "2046-03-25 00:00:00", "2001-03-25 00:00:00", "2003-03-25 00:00:00", "2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2014-01-17 00:00:00", "2021-09-17 00:00:00", "2005-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Marseille", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Borentain P", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Erdre", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Vet Res", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hepatol", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hyeres", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Spain", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tei S", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2474830", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - Nepal (02): (MO)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2474830", "date": "2014-05-15 16:35:00", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - NEPAL (02): (MORANG)\n**********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 14 May 2014\nSource: eKantipur [edited]\nhttp://www.ekantipur.com/2014/05/14/top-story/jaundice-outbreak-spreads-to-district-prison/389531.html\n\n\nThe deadly outbreak of jaundice [previously reported as hepatitis E - Mod.LL] in Biratnagar [Morang District], which has already claimed 10 lives, has now spread in the Morang District Prison located in the town.

Ethiopia is home to 247 554 South Sudanese refugees, including more than 185 000 who have fled since fighting broke out in mid-December 2013.\n\nAccording to data from The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), since April [2014], there have been 367 cases of hepatitis E in Leichuor, Kule, and Tierkidi camps, which are all located in the Gambella region of western Ethiopia, bordering South Sudan. Laboratories in Addis Ababa and Nairobi confirmed that the virus is related to the hepatitis E outbreak reported in neighboring South Sudan. 6 more cases were reported in the refugee hosting communities of Itang and Nyin-yan. There has been 13 fatalities reported.\n\nThe UN agency is working with the Ethiopians on containing the viral outbreak. This includes providing safe drinking water, promoting hygiene, distribution of soap, and the building of latrines.\n\nHepatitis E has been the cause of several outbreaks and sporadic cases over large geographical regions. The hepatitis E virus is contracted and spread through consuming contaminated water. However, people can also contract the virus through contaminated food, transmission from animals to humans, blood transfusions, and from pregnant women to their newborn.\n\nThe clinical course of hepatitis E is similar to that of hepatitis A [except in immune suppressed patients - Mod.LL] without a chronic form of the disease. Jaundice, fever, loss of appetite and lethargy are common symptoms.\n\nThe fatality rate is low with the exception of pregnant women where it can reach 20 percent among those infected in the 3rd trimester. Liver failure is a frequent outcome with pregnant women. There is no treatment for acute hepatitis E, therefore, prevention is key.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nand Ota Masaki <Otam@jata.or.jp>\n\n[As noted in the posting, a hallmark of epidemic hepatitis E is a high case fatality rate in pregnant women (especially in the last trimester).

HEV3 has a worldwide distribution. By contrast, HEV4 mostly occurs in southeast Asia, but has recently been isolated in European pigs. Although HEV3 and HEV4 infections have been linked to the consumption of raw or undercooked pork or game meat, the full range of species that are reservoirs for HEV is still unknown. On the basis of full-length genome-sequence analyses, HEV genotypes have recently been characterized in rats in Germany, wild boars in Japan, and farmed rabbits in China. HEV1 can be classified into 5 subgenotypes, HEV2 into 2, HEV3 into 3, and HEV4 into 7. Phylogenetic analyses show that HEV subgenotypes circulating in human beings and animals in the same area are closely related, supporting zoonotic transmission.

Sunday Monitor has learned that 1000 have been infected with the deadly viral infection since the breakout in the district in mid-2013. Dr James Lemukol, the district health director, said majority of the dead were pregnant mothers.\n\nHe said the transmission of the disease in the community is still high yet some development partners who had been supporting the district to fight the epidemic through community mobilization on hygiene have slowed down their efforts due to lack of money. He said the increasing number of infected people proves there's no improvement. The most affected areas are Lorengechora and Iriiri, the highly populated sub-counties in Napak.\n\n'The disease situation has gone up and I am worried it might double since some of the instrumental developmental partners are running short of funds,' Dr Lemukol said. 'The low coverage of pit-latrines in the district which stands at 22 percent and few clean water sources, are the major challenges hindering the fight against hepatitis E in Napak,' he added.\n\nA source at the Ministry of Health told this newspaper that the minister, Dr Ruhakana Rugunda, has called a meeting in Kampala to discuss ways to tame the epidemic.\n\n[Byline: Steven Ariong]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The current outbreak of the fecal-oral transmitted hepatitis E virus in the Karamoja subregion of northern Uganda continues with a mortality most prominent in pregnant women. This association has been found with the virus and pregnant women since the initial descriptions of HEV several decades ago.\n\nIn rare cases, hepatitis E can result in acute liver failure and death. Overall population mortality rates from hepatitis E range from 0.5 to 4.0 percent. Fulminant hepatitis does occur more frequently during pregnancy. Pregnant women are at greater risk of both obstetrical complications and mortality from hepatitis E, which can induce a mortality rate of 20 percent among pregnant women in the 3rd trimester, especially in outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent and Africa.\n\nAs discussed in Navaneethan U, Al Mohajer M, Shata MT: Hepatitis E and pregnancy: understanding the pathogenesis.\nLiver Int. 2008;28:1190-1199, the high mortality rate in pregnancy has been thought to be secondary to the associated hormonal (estrogen and progesterone) changes during pregnancy and consequent immunological changes. These immunological changes include downregulation of the p65 component of nuclear factor (NF-kappaB) with a predominant T-helper type 2 (Th2) bias in the T-cell response along with host susceptibility factors, mediated by human leucocyte antigen expression.

Retrospective analysis identified the event as the 1st transfusion-associated hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in the country. Here, we report baseline virological data on the case.\n\nCase description\n----------------\nThe patient (recipient 1), an immunocompromised man in his 40s, was positive for anti-HEV IgM and IgG using a recomLine HEV assay (Mikrogen, Munich, Germany), and HEV RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany). Retrospective analysis showed that he had been chronically infected with HEV since 24 Jul 2013, when HEV RNA was detected for the 1st time. When reviewing the medical charts it was noticed that the patient had received apheresis platelets from a single donor on 4 Jul 2013.\n\nA lookback procedure was initiated and 2 viremic donations of this donor were identified. The donor was a man in his 40s and asymptomatic around the time of the blood donations. He donated blood regularly every 14 days. The 1st viremic donation (donation 1, day 0) was from 1 Jul 2013 and contained 120 IU HEV RNA/mL plasma, and the second donation (donation 2, day 14) was from 15 Jul 2013 and contained 495 IU HEV RNA/mL plasma (Figure 1 [for figures and table, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). This corresponds to an infectious dose of 7056-8892 IU HEV RNA in a total volume of 196-247 mL apheresis platelets transfused for donation 1 (assuming a residual plasma volume of 0.33 mL per 1 mL apheresis platelets). For donation 2, an infectious dose of 30 888-37 273 IU HEV RNA was calculated. Real-time RT-PCR results were confirmed using a nested RT-PCR protocol [1]. All other donations (n=4) of this donor before and after donations 1 and 2 tested negative by real-time RT-PCR and by nested RT-PCR (Figure 1).\n\nThe HEV nucleotide sequence of a 242 bp fragment of the ORF1 region was amplified and sequenced from donations 1 and 2 and from recipient 1 [1]. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the samples clustered together and were closely related to HEV genotype 3f, which is prevalent in Germany (Figure 2). The nearly complete nucleotide sequence (6688 nt, GenBank accession number KJ873911) of the HEV isolate from recipient 1 was determined and compared to sequences from donation 2 (4251 nt, KJ873912). The nucleotide sequences were 100 percent identical proving transfusion-associated transmission.\n\nIn donation 1 and 2, anti-HEV IgG and IgM were not detected using 2 different serological HEV assays (recomLine HEV and recomWell HEV, Mikrogen, Munich, Germany). Seroconversion of the donor was observed 14 days after donation 2 (Figure 1). Levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase were within normal range from days -28 to 42 relative to the 1st HEV RNA-positive donation. Detailed anamnestic exploration of possible risk factors for HEV infection (such as occupational exposure to pigs) remained inconclusive and the travel history was negative.\n\nAnother 4 recipients were identified, who had received apheresis platelets from donations 1 or 2 (Table). An immunocompetent child with a history of congenital heart disease tested positive for anti-HEV IgG and borderline for anti-HEV IgM (recomLine HEV and recomWell HEV) in a single sample eight months after receiving apheresis platelets from donation 1. Real-time RT-PCR from this sample was negative (Table). Clinical symptoms suggestive of acute HEV infection were not reported. The available samples from the remaining recipients were all negative for HEV markers (Table). 2 patients died for reasons other than HEV infection.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nHEV recently emerged as a transfusion-transmissible pathogen, with reports from France, the UK, and Japan [2-4]. In Europe, the vast majority of autochthonous HEV infections are caused by HEV genotype 3 (gt-3) and are linked to the consumption of contaminated food. In general, HEV gt-3 infection remains asymptomatic or presents as mild self-limited acute hepatitis [5]. HEV IgG seroprevalence in Europe ranges from 17 percent in Germany to 26 percent in France among the general population, indicating widespread contact with HEV [6,7]. A HEV IgG seroprevalence of 6.8 percent was determined among German blood donors in 2011, and HEV RNA was detected in 0.08 percent of donations [8,9]. Juhl et al. reported an HEV IgG incidence in donors of 0.35 percent per year [9]. A total of 7.4 million blood products were administered in Germany in 2013, and between 1600 and 5900 HEV RNA-positive blood donations could be occurring in Germany per year [8,10]. In the Netherlands, 1 HEV-positive donation per day was reported, which implies that transmission by transfusion could be a likely event in both countries [11].\n\nAn estimated 30-40 percent of blood products in Germany were transfused to immunocompromised patients and these patients are at risk of developing chronic HEV gt-3 infection with increased mortality [5]. Sequence analysis of HEV strains from the Czech Republic, Germany and the Netherlands showed close homology indicating a geographically confined circulation [8]. This is supported by the high degree of sequence identity of our and recent Czech and Dutch sequences. Zoonotic transmission from pigs to humans seems to be the major mode of infection, but occupational exposure to pigs was not reported in our case [6].\n\nTwo important observations were made in this study. Firstly, we could show that the infectious dose required for HEV infection seems to be low, that is, HEV RNA concentrations close to the limit of detection of the real-time RT-PCR. Low levels of HEV RNA in asymptomatic donors have already been reported but without evidence for transmission [8,9]. Interestingly, Juhl et al speculated that viremia of around 125 IU/mL in the presence of anti-HEV IgM was not sufficient for transfusion-associated infection [9]. However, it is not clear if HEV antibodies can prevent infection. A recent study showed that infectious HEV could be propagated in cell culture in the presence of HEV-specific antibodies, suggesting that they do not efficiently reduce virus infectivity [12]. In addition, a clinical study demonstrated that anti-HEV IgG did not uniformly protect against re-infection [13].\n\nSecondly, the duration of viremia in our asymptomatic donor did not exceed 45 days, based on the time interval between the last and the first HEV RNA-negative donation. The interval of 14 days between first and last HEV RNA-positive donation was even shorter than the 27 to 58 days reported by Slot et al., but could be due to the shorter sampling interval in our study [11]. From our and previously published data it is obvious that highly sensitive methods would be required if screening for HEV RNA were to be considered for blood products.\n\nThe 2nd HEV transfusion-associated transmission possibly occurred in a child. However, we were not able to definitely prove transmission since only a single sample was available. In light of the very low HEV seroprevalence among children in Germany it seems probable that this child was infected by donation 1 [14]. It remains unclear why transfusion of donation 2 with a fourfold higher HEV RNA concentration did not result in infection, but this could be related to host factors.\n\nTo conclude, we could demonstrate that transmission of HEV by asymptomatic donors with low-level viremia is possible. Current German guidelines in transfusion medicine do not recommend testing for HEV. Importantly, with regard to the possible severe consequences of transfusion-associated transmission of HEV, especially in immunocompromised patients, the necessity of screening for HEV RNA needs to be discussed in countries with a high HEV prevalence. However, more data regarding the HEV disease burden due to blood transfusions are needed before recommendations can be made.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

HEV1 and HEV2 are restricted to human beings and transmitted via contaminated water in developing countries. HEV1 occurs mainly in Asia, and HEV2 in Africa and Mexico. HEV3 and HEV4 infect human beings, pigs, and other mammalian species and are responsible for sporadic cases of autochthonous hepatitis E in both developing and developed countries. HEV3 has a worldwide distribution. By contrast, HEV4 mostly occurs in southeast Asia, but has recently been isolated in European pigs. Although HEV3 and HEV4 infections have been linked to the consumption of raw or undercooked pork or game meat, the full range of species that are reservoirs for HEV is still unknown. On the basis of full-length genome-sequence analyses, HEV genotypes have recently been characterized in rats in Germany, wild boars in Japan, and farmed rabbits in China. HEV1 can be classified into 5 subgenotypes, HEV2 into 2, HEV3 into 3, and HEV4 into 7. Phylogenetic analyses show that HEV subgenotypes circulating in human beings and animals in the same area are closely related, supporting zoonotic transmission. Studies of the evolutionary history and population dynamics of HEV show that HEV has evolved through a series of steps, in which the ancestors of HEV might have adapted to a succession of animal hosts leading to human beings.'\n\nAlthough generally considered to cause only acute infection, the review article also discusses chronic hepatitis E, which is defined by persisting HEV RNA in serum or stools for 6 months or more, in immunosuppressed patients. Most cases have occurred in solid-organ-transplant recipients. Additionally, a few cases have been reported in individuals with HIV and patients with hematological disorders receiving chemotherapy. Chronic infection with HEV1 or HEV2 has not been reported. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/101.]", "summary": "The 1st viremic donation (donation 1, day 0) was from 1 Jul 2013 and contained 120 IU HEV RNA/mL plasma, and the second donation (donation 2, day 14) was from 15 Jul 2013 and contained 495 IU HEV RNA/mL plasma (Figure 1 [for figures and table, see source URL above.

A HEV IgG seroprevalence of 6.8 percent was determined among German blood donors in 2011, and HEV RNA was detected in 0.08 percent of donations [8,9]. \n\nA lookback procedure was initiated and 2 viremic donations of this donor were identified. Secondly, the duration of viremia in our asymptomatic donor did not exceed 45 days, based on the time interval between the last and the first HEV RNA-negative donation. \n\n'Molecular characterization of various HEV strains circulating among human beings and animals has led to the recognition of 4 major genotypes, representing a single serotype. \n\nCase description\n Kamar N, Bendall R, Legrand-Abravanel F, et al: Hepatitis E.

The WHO said arrangements are ongoing for molecular characterisation tests and genotyping.\n\nBetween 20 Aug 2013 and 29 Oct 2013, the region's Buhigwe District experienced 690 acute febrile illness cases with no deaths. Most patients presented with vomiting, loss of appetite, generalized body weakness, abdominal pain, high fever, and headache. A small proportion of the cases experienced diarrhoea and jaundice. There was a delay in detection and confirmation of the outbreak because most of the initial cases were treated as malaria, due to similar clinical symptoms. Approximately 61 percent of reported cases occurred in individuals below the age of 15 years. Approximately 54 percent of the cases occurred in females.\n\nAfter the hepatitis E outbreak was confirmed, Tanzania's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare began conducting further field investigations to determine the magnitude, source, and risk factors for the outbreak. Prevention and control measures are ongoing.\n\nThe WHO did not recommend any trade or travel restrictions be applied to Tanzania with respect to the recent event.\n\n[Byline: Paul Tinder]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\na correspondent who has requested anonymity\n\n[This report is posted in response to ProMED-mail's request for information of 23 Nov 2013, entitled 'Undiagnosed febrile illness - Niger, Tanzania: RFI' archive no 20131123.2069748. It is likely, but not confirmed here, that the outbreak of a the febrile disease in Nigeria is likewise the result of hepatitis E virus infection.\n\nHepatitis E is usually self-limiting but may develop into fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure). Hepatitis E virus is transmitted via the faecal-oral route, principally via contaminated water. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.\n\nThe highest seroprevalence rates are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups.\n\nThere is no available treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis. Prevention is the most effective approach against the disease. As hepatitis E is usually self-limiting, hospitalization is generally not required. However, hospitalization is required for people with fulminant hepatitis and should also be considered for infected pregnant women. The risk of infection and transmission can be reduced by maintaining quality standards for public water supplies and establishing proper disposal systems to eliminate sanitary waste.

They are concerned that rising numbers of Britons are being struck down with hepatitis E after eating contaminated pork. The infection was once considered very rare, but cases have risen by nearly 40 per cent in a year, and there were 657 in 2012.\n\nThe virus usually causes only relatively mild symptoms such as sickness, a temperature and muscle pain, which clear up by themselves within a month. But it can be fatal for the elderly, cancer victims, pregnant women and others with existing liver problems. Around one in 50 of those infected will die, rising to one in 5 pregnant women, according to statistics.\n\nExperts say sausages have to be cooked at 70 C (158 F) for at least 20 minutes to kill the virus, but they say that most Britons do not leave them in the oven for this long. Tests have showed that it can survive at 60 C after an hour. A report published last week by the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs says 10 per cent of sausages recently sampled were found to contain the virus. It states that there is increasing evidence that hepatitis E, which is common in the developing world, where it is usually transmitted through contaminated water, is a food-borne infection and adds that it is increasingly being recognised as a major disease.\n\nAll forms of hepatitis cause swelling of the liver, which in severe cases can cause severe damage to the organ, liver cancer and death. More than half of those infected with hepatitis E are men over 50, who are more susceptible as they tend to drink more and their livers are weaker. The virus is particularly harmful for pregnant women who catch it in the final 3 months of their pregnancy because it can lead to acute liver failure, and one in 5 expectant mothers who catch the virus will die.\n\nDr Harry Dalton, a consultant at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro and one of Britain's leading experts on hepatitis E, said: 'This is emerging as a serious problem. About 85 per cent of British pigs carry the virus, which is quite hardy. Sausages have to be cooked at 70 C for 20 minutes to kill it, and that is longer than most sausages ever get cooked. Anyone cooking with sausages or other pork products should take stringent hygiene precautions including washing their hands and cleaning work surfaces.'\n\nSausages are regarded as the most dangerous product, as they often contain liver meat and traces of pig's blood as well as a casing from the animal's intestine.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is the DEFRA statement entitled: 'Hepatitis E and detection in pork and pork products,' http://www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla-en/files/pub-survrep-p0312.pdf, referred to in the above press report.\n\n'There has been recent publicity about hepatitis E infection in humans. This relates to an increase in 2010-11 in the proportion of cases of hepatitis E diagnosed where there is no history of travel by the affected person. A recent publication (Berto and others, 2012) reported PCR detection of hepatitis E virus in 13 percent of pig faeces and 3 percent of pig livers at slaughter and 10 percent of pork sausages at retail. Whether virus is infective at these different stages was not established. The report of an extensive case control study in humans is expected in 2013 and may identify risk factors and assist in determining whether there is evidence to support the putative link with consumption of pork and pork products. In the meantime, a multi-agency, joint-funded abattoir survey of pigs, expected to be conducted in early 2013, will seek to establish the prevalence of infection in slaughter pigs in the UK. This is highlighted here as an issue which may cause adverse publicity for the pig industry at what is already a difficult time.'

Hepatitis E virus is transmitted usually mainly through contaminated drinking water. It is usually a self-limiting infection and resolves within 4-6 weeks. Occasionally, a fulminant form of hepatitis develops (acute liver failure), which can lead to death. The hepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route due to faecal contamination of drinking water. Other transmission routes have been identified, which include: foodborne transmission from ingestion of products derived from infected animals, transfusion of infected blood products, and vertical transmission from a pregnant woman to her fetus. The incubation period following exposure to the hepatitis E virus ranges from 3-8 weeks, with a mean of 40 days. The period of communicability is unknown. Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include: jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and sclera of the eyes, dark urine and pale stools, anorexia (loss of appetite), an enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly), abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and vomiting.\n\nOverall population mortality rates from hepatitis E range from 0.5 to 4.0 percent. Fulminant hepatitis occurs more frequently during pregnancy. Pregnant women are at greater risk of obstetrical complications and mortality from hepatitis E, which can induce a mortality rate of 20 percent among pregnant women in their 3rd trimester. Cases of chronic hepatitis E infection have been reported in immunosuppressed people. Reactivation of hepatitis E infection has also been reported in immunocompromised people.

At Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands (abstract not available at time of posting).\n\nGuillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. The 1st symptoms of this disorder include varying degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs. In many instances, the symmetrical weakness and abnormal sensations spread to the arms and upper body. These symptoms can increase in intensity until certain muscles cannot be used at all, and, when severe, the person is almost totally paralyzed. In these cases, the disorder is life threatening -- potentially interfering with breathing and, at times, with blood pressure or heart rate -- and is considered a medical emergency. Such an individual is often put on a ventilator to assist with breathing and is watched closely for problems such as an abnormal heart beat, infections, blood clots, and high or low blood pressure. Most individuals, however, recover from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, although some continue to have a certain degree of weakness.\n\nGuillain-Barre syndrome can affect anybody. It can strike at any age, and both sexes are equally prone to the disorder. The syndrome is rare, however, afflicting only about one person in 100 000. Usually Guillain-Barre occurs a few days or weeks after the patient has had symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection. Occasionally, surgery will trigger the syndrome. In rare instances, vaccinations may increase the risk of GBS. After the 1st clinical manifestations of the disease, the symptoms can progress over the course of hours, days, or weeks. Most people reach the stage of greatest weakness within the 1st 2 weeks after symptoms appear, and by the 3rd week of the illness, 90 percent of all patients are at their weakest.\n\nGuillain-Barre -- which is not contagious -- strikes some people and not others. It is not known what induces the condition or why there may be an association between hepatitis E virus infection and GBS. When GBS is preceded by a viral or bacterial infection, it is possible that the virus has changed the nature of cells in the nervous system so that the immune system treats them as foreign cells. It is also possible that the virus makes the immune system itself less discriminating about what cells it recognizes as its own, allowing some of the immune cells, such as certain kinds of lymphocytes and macrophages, to attack the myelin. Sensitized T lymphocytes cooperate with B lymphocytes to produce antibodies against components of the myelin sheath and may contribute to destruction of the myelin.\n\nIn 2 forms of GBS, axons are attacked by antibodies against the bacteria _Campylobacter jejuni_, which react with proteins of the peripheral nerves. Acute motor axonal neuropathy is particularly common in Chinese children. Scientists are investigating these and other possibilities to find out why the immune system goes awry in Guillain-Barre syndrome and other autoimmune diseases. The cause and course of Guillain-Barre syndrome is an active area of neurological investigation, incorporating the cooperative efforts of neurological scientists, immunologists, and virologists.\n\nIt remains to be established whether hepatitis E virus infection is more likely to precipitate this type of reaction. What is known is that that the body's immune system begins to attack the body itself, causing what is known as an autoimmune disease. Usually, the cells of the immune system attack only foreign material and invading organisms. In Guillain-Barre syndrome, however, the immune system starts to destroy the myelin sheath that surrounds the axons of many peripheral nerves, or even the axons themselves (axons are long, thin extensions of the nerve cells; they carry nerve signals). The myelin sheath surrounding the axon speeds up the transmission of nerve signals and allows the transmission of signals over long distances.\n\n(In part extracted from: The Guillain-Barre Syndrome Fact Sheet, http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/gbs/detail_gbs.htm#184613139). - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1yvE, http://healthmap.org/r/1yvE.]", "summary": "Communicated on behalf of the authors by:\nCorine GeurtsvanKessel,\nViroscience Lab,\nErasmus Medical Centre,\nRotterdam,\nThe Netherlands\n<c.geurtsvankessel@erasmusmc.nl>\n\n[The journal reference is: Clin Infect Dis.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has sent essential medical supplies to the affected areas.\n\nAccording to the North Darfur State Ministry of Health, 2572 cases have been reported, with 34 deaths, in El Sareif locality from January 2013 to date. The most affected areas are the villages of Abuseniena and Umjamina, where displaced people have settled. Most of these people were displaced from the Jebel Amir area following conflict between the Rizeigat and Beni Hussein tribes in January 2013, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its Humanitarian Bulletin of 3-9 Feb 2014.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, the WHO sent essential medical supplies for 59 000 people in the area. Furthermore, WHO conducted trainings for health workers on outbreak investigation, response, and case management. In addition, an estimated 1900 people received health education sessions, and cleaning campaigns, water testing, and water chlorination activities took place. Finally, WHO provided financial support to cover the running costs of the area's health facilities.\n\nSouth Darfur:\n----------\nIn South Darfur, the international NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres-Belgium (MSF-B) reported on 5 Feb 2014 that since January 2014, 51 suspected cases of acute jaundice syndrome had been registered in El Sareif camp for the displaced in Nyala locality. Eight cases were confirmed, while 6 cases were diagnosed as hepatitis E.\n\nTwo more cases of acute jaundice syndrome were reported from Kalma camp, Nyala locality by the international organisation Merlin. The national organisation Patients Helping Fund-Sudan also reported a further case of acute jaundice syndrome in El Dereig camp, Nyala locality. The State Ministry of Health has requested all health partners working in the camps for the displaced to intensify efforts in identifying and reporting cases of acute jaundice syndrome.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E has been a significant issue in Darfur. The following is from the WHO regarding the disease http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/:\n\nHepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.\n\nThe highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus.

We report here on a patient with HEV genotype 3a infection complicated by Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in Portugal in December 2012. We draw attention to the diagnosis of autochthonous HEV infection and to its rare, but important, neurological complications.\n\n[Readers are referred to the original text via the source URL above for a detailed description of the clinical features of this case. - Mod.CP]\n\nSerological analysis to detect hepatitis viruses was negative for all except HEV, being positive for anti-HEV IgM and negative for anti-HEV IgG, suggesting an acute infection with HEV. Serological markers for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -- EBV nuclear antigen and viral capsid antigen IgG -- were positive, but EBV IgM was negative. The diagnosis of HEV infection was confirmed by the presence of HEV RNA in the serum sample taken the day the patient was admitted to the referring hospital. CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] and stool samples were not available at that time for testing. HEV RNA in serum was detected using a nested broad-spectrum reverse transcription PCR with amplification within the open reading frame (ORF) 1 region of HEV genome.\n\nThe amplicon obtained (330 bp) was sequenced and compared with reference HEV strains, using a neighbor-joining method based on the Jukes-Cantor model for ORF 1 nucleotide sequences of selected HEV isolates representing genotypes 1-4. This phylogenetic analysis revealed that the amplicon clustered with HEV genotype 3, specifically subgenotype 3a.\n\nIn a routine visit to the hospital 2 months after being discharged, analysis of a blood sample collected at that time showed that HEV RNA was undetectable, anti-HEV IgM was negative and anti-HEV IgG was positive.\n\nBackground\n----------\nIn recent years, an increasing number of autochthonous infections with HEV have been reported in Europe and in United States. Most of these autochthonous cases have been caused by HEV genotype 3 (HEV3) and less frequently by genotype 4. Seroprevalence studies also show that HEV infection in the population of industrialised countries is higher than previously thought. HEV3 infections have been associated with the consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked pork, deer and wild boar and to direct contact with infected swine.\n\nAutochthonous HEV infection is usually subclinical or runs a mild course and is self-limiting, but chronic autochthonous infection has been identified among immunocompromised persons, including organ transplant recipients, patients receiving cancer chemotherapy and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\nA broad set of symptoms of autochthonous HEV disease has been seen as well as increasing recognition of its extra-hepatic manifestations. Both acute and chronic HEV infections have been reported to be associated with muscular weakness, neurological disorders including polyradiculopathy, GBS, bilateral brachial neuritis, encephalitis or proximal myopathy. Although neurological disorders associated with HEV3 are rare, some data are emerging in literature. In recent years, a number of GBS cases associated with HEV infections have been described. GBS is an acute, acquired, autoimmune disorder of peripheral nerves that develops in susceptible individuals after infection and, in rare cases, after vaccination. In about 60 percent of cases, GBS is preceded by an infection, most frequently by _Campylobacter jejuni_, but other pathogens, such as viruses from family _Herpesviridae_ (cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus) or bacterial agents (_Haemophilus influenzae_, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_) can be responsible.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nExhaustive tests to detect the agents mostly frequently associated with GBS, other than _Campylobacter_, gave negative results in samples from our patient. _Campylobacter_ was not tested for because of the patient's symptoms. Given the serological results, EBV was not considered likely as the causative agent. Detection of both IgM anti-HEV and HEV RNA in the patient's serum confirmed acute hepatitis E.\n\nThe actual incidence of GBS associated with HEV infection is unknown because autochthonous hepatitis E is still underdiagnosed in many industrialised countries. This is in part due to the fact that frequently HEV infection is subclinical and because the neurological findings surpass the liver injuries and hepatitis is not suspected. Hence, HEV infection should be considered in neurological diseases associated with abnormal levels of liver enzymes.\n\nSince the patient reported no travel history, it seems likely that the HEV infection was locally acquired. We consider it most probably resulted from consumption of pork or pork products, as there is a strong tradition of pork consumption among Portuguese people and HEV3 has been detected in domestic pigs from several farms in Portugal.\n\nInterestingly, the patient was in his late 50s. It is known that middle-aged and elderly men are more vulnerable to severe HEV3 infection, which can ultimately lead to hospitalisation and possibly death.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st report of a neurological disorder associated with an autochthonous HEV3 infection in a Portuguese patient. Considering the GBS-HEV cases reported, we recommend that testing for HEV should be included routinely in the diagnostic algorithm of GBS when liver function is altered.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In recent years, an increasing number of autochthonous infections with hepatitis E virus (HEV) have been reported in Europe and the United States.

We studied the presence of silent HEV infection among Dutch blood donors. Using donations collected throughout the Netherlands in 2011 and 2012, 40 176 donations were tested for HEV RNA in 459 pools of 48 or 480 donations. Deconstruction of the reactive pools identified 13 viraemic donors. In addition, 5239 donors were tested for presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM and for HEV RNA when IgM-positive. Of the 5239 donations, 1401 (27 percent) tested repeat-positive for HEV IgG, of which 49 (3.5 percent) also tested positive for anti-HEV IgM; 4 of the HEV IgM-positive donors tested positive for HEV RNA. HEV IgG seroprevalence ranged from 13 percent among donors younger than 30 years to 43 percent in donors older than 60 years. The finding of 17 HEV RNA-positive donations among 45 415 donations corresponds to one HEV-positive blood donation per day in the Netherlands. For 16 of the 17 HEV RNA-positive donors, genotyping succeeded, revealing HEV genotype 3, which is circulating among Dutch pigs. Apparently, silent HEV infection is common in the Netherlands, which possibly applies to larger parts of Europe.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nHepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped RNA virus, classified into 4 genotypes. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 have been found only in humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 have also been found in animals. The clinical features of hepatitis E are similar to those of viral hepatitis caused by other hepatotropic [having a special affinity for the liver] viruses. In Europe and North America, hepatitis E is known as an acute disease in travellers returning from tropical countries, but an endemic source of hepatitis E has always been suspected. Recently it became clear that genotype 3 of hepatitis E virus (HEV gt-3) is widely spread among pigs in Europe, North America and Japan. Surprisingly, infection of humans by HEV gt-3 seems to cause disease mainly in immunosuppressed persons, such as patients who have received organ transplants, who may develop chronic hepatitis E. Blood donors can be silently infected with HEV, as indicated by plasma pools testing positive for HEV RNA and by a high prevalence of antibodies to HEV among blood donors in the south west of France]. Cases of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E have been reported. The dynamics of HEV gt-3 infection and its implications for public health and the safety of blood are largely unknown. Which part of the population has signs of resolved or active infection? To estimate the infection pressure of HEV in the Netherlands, we determined the presence of HEV RNA and HEV antibodies in a large number of recent blood donations, collected throughout the country.\n\n[Interested readers should consult the original text via the source URL to view the methodology, results, graphical presentation of the data obtained by the authors, and the references cited. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe detection of HEV viraemia in 17 of 45 415 recent Dutch blood donations demonstrates a high incidence of HEV infection in the Netherlands. Our serological screening suggested that roughly one quarter of the Dutch adult population has experienced HEV infection. This proportion compares with the 16 percent of 500 donors in the south-west of Britain, and the 53 percent of 512 donors in the south-west of France, who recently tested positive for IgG anti-HEV, using the same antibody assay as employed in this study. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard for HEV antibody testing. A recent study reports an HEV IgG seroprevalence of only 2.6 percent in 7072 Dutch samples, collected in 2006 and 2007, employing another brand of HEV antibody assay (MP/Genelabs). The Wantai assay used in the present study may suffer from a high level of non-specific reactivity. However, studies comparing the performance of the Wantai and the MP/Genelabs assay demonstrate a higher sensitivity and detection of more sera from PCR-proven cases by the Wantai assay. Classical anti-HEV serology probably lacks sensitivity and seems unsuitable to confirm Wantai EIA test results. In addition, the frequent finding of HEV RNA-positive donors, a striking age-related increase of HEV IgG seroprevalence, and the fact that already in 2005, HEV was found to circulate on 53 of 97 Dutch pig farms, suggest that the high seroprevalence as detected by the Wantai assay may be correct.\n\nUnfortunately, seroprevalence data for persons under the age of 18 are not available. The striking age-related seroprevalence (Figure 2) is difficult to interpret. The age-dependent seroprevalence may simply reflect a long-standing, stable situation, in which people are evenly exposed to HEV in the course of their life. In that scenario, the current high number of viraemic and seroconverting donors may reflect a temporary elevation of HEV infection pressure. If endemic HEV infection were a recent phenomenon, the age-dependent seroprevalence could only be explained by age-dependent exposure or age-dependent susceptibility, which is difficult to imagine for a food-borne pathogen. Alternatively, the seroprevalence curve could reflect an age-cohort effect, caused by transient exposure of older generations in the past. Such a cohort effect has been described in England. The HEV incidence found in this study of 1 percent per year, as well as the high number of HEV RNA-positive blood donors, seem to contradict transient exposure to HEV in the past; but endemic HEV may have returned after a long period of absence.\n\nHEV transmission by blood transfusion has been reported in Saudi Arabia, Japan, France and the United Kingdom. Our results suggest roughly one HEV viraemic donation per day in the Netherlands. This may be an underestimation, considering that the serological screening of 5239 donors only detected antibody-positive donors in a later stage of infection, while the screening for HEV RNA of 40 176 pooled (diluted) donations detected donors in an early stage of infection, with high levels of HEV RNA and low or absent HEV antibodies. HEV RNA-positive blood may pose a threat to immunosuppressed blood recipients, such as recipients of organ transplants and patients with haematological malignancies; and possibly to pregnant women. Because blood transfusion is only a minor source of HEV infection, the routine screening of blood donations for the presence of HEV does not yet seem warranted. Each immunosuppressed patient with unexplained elevated liver enzymes should be tested for the presence of HEV RNA, irrespective of exposure to blood products. Fortunately, it appears that chronic HEV infection in immunosuppressed patients can be cured by a temporary reduction of immunosuppression, or by antiviral treatment using ribavirin.\n\nThe source and transmission routes of HEV gt-3 infection have not yet been uncovered. In contrast to the Midi-Pyrenees region of France, where an association of HEV seropositivity with rural residence was found, the level of urbanisation and the vicinity of pig farms do not play a role in the Netherlands. Until recently, little was known of HEV transmission dynamics in European pig populations. Berto et al. describe the presence of HEV in 8 to 73 percent of stool samples collected from pig farms between 2007 and 2011 throughout Europe, and the presence of HEV in fattening pigs. It is unclear whether pigs are the source of the current HEV infections. Intensive pig farming may have become the major amplifier of the virus, considering that millions of pigs are being reared in the Netherlands each year, of which each year again a large part probably acquires and sheds HEV. Subsequently, HEV may be spread via contaminated meat or via faecally contaminated water used for irrigation. Studies are needed to identify the transmission routes of HEV gt-3 to humans, so that appropriate measures can be taken. It seems likely that at this moment other Western countries also experience extensive, silent HEV infection.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV): a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.

In addition, the frequent finding of HEV RNA-positive donors, a striking age-related increase of HEV IgG seroprevalence, and the fact that already in 2005, HEV was found to circulate on 53 of 97 Dutch pig farms, suggest that the high seroprevalence as detected by the Wantai assay may be correct. The HEV incidence found in this study of 1 percent per year, as well as the high number of HEV RNA-positive blood donors, seem to contradict transient exposure to HEV in the past; but endemic HEV may have returned after a long period of absence. http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20550\n\n\nSilent hepatitis E virus infection in Dutch blood donors, 2011 to 2012\n The authors estimate that the finding of 17 HEV RNA-positive donations among 45 415 donations corresponds to one HEV-positive blood donation per day in the Netherlands.

Because blood transfusion is only a minor source of HEV infection, the routine screening of blood donations for the presence of HEV does not yet seem warranted. If endemic HEV infection were a recent phenomenon, the age-dependent seroprevalence could only be explained by age-dependent exposure or age-dependent susceptibility, which is difficult to imagine for a food-borne pathogen. HEPATITIS E - NETHERLANDS: BLOOD DONORS\n***************************************\n To estimate the infection pressure of HEV in the Netherlands, we determined the presence of HEV RNA and HEV antibodies in a large number of recent blood donations, collected throughout the country. HEV IgG seroprevalence ranged from 13 percent among donors younger than 30 years to 43 percent in donors older than 60 years. The detection of HEV viraemia in 17 of 45 415 recent Dutch blood donations demonstrates a high incidence of HEV infection in the Netherlands. The authors have studied the presence of silent HEV infection among Dutch blood donors. Genotyping of 16 of the 17 HEV RNA-positive donors revealed the presence of HEV genotype 3, which is circulating among Dutch pigs. We studied the presence of silent HEV infection among Dutch blood donors. HEV RNA-positive blood may pose a threat to immunosuppressed blood recipients, such as recipients of organ transplants and patients with haematological malignancies; and possibly to pregnant women. For 16 of the 17 HEV RNA-positive donors, genotyping succeeded, revealing HEV genotype 3, which is circulating among Dutch pigs. In that scenario, the current high number of viraemic and seroconverting donors may reflect a temporary elevation of HEV infection pressure. \nHepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped RNA virus, classified into 4 genotypes. In addition, 5239 donors were tested for presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM and for HEV RNA when IgM-positive. Using donations collected throughout the Netherlands in 2011 and 2012, 40 176 donations were tested for HEV RNA in 459 pools of 48 or 480 donations.

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2013; Epub ahead of print]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nSeronegative hepatitis -- non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis -- is poorly characterized but strongly associated with serious complications. We collected 92 sera specimens from patients with non-A-E hepatitis in Chongqing, China between 1999 and 2007. 10 sera pools were screened by Solexa deep sequencing. We discovered a 3780-bp contig present in all 10 pools that yielded BLASTx E [basic local alignment search tool] scores of 7e-05-0.008 against parvoviruses. The complete sequence of the in silico-assembled 3780-bp contig was confirmed by gene amplification of overlapping regions over almost the entire genome, and the virus was provisionally designated NIH-CQV. Further analysis revealed that the contig was composed of 2 major ORFs [open reading frames]. By protein BLAST, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to the replication-associated protein of bat circovirus and the capsid protein of porcine parvovirus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NIH-CQV is located at the interface of _Parvoviridae_ and _Circoviridae_. Prevalence of NIH-CQV in patients was determined by quantitative PCR. 63 of 90 patient samples (70 per cent) were positive, but all those from 45 healthy controls were negative. Average virus titer in the patient specimens was 1.05 e4 copies/microL. Specific antibodies against NIH-CQV were sought by immunoblotting. 84 per cent of patients were positive for IgG, and 31 per cent were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78 per cent of healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM. Although more work is needed to determine the etiologic role of NIH-CQV in human disease, our data indicate that a parvovirus-like virus is highly prevalent in a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis.\n\nMost viral hepatitis are secondary to infection by known hepatotropic viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis delta virus (HDV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Other hepatitis-associated viruses, including CMV [cytomegalovirus], Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, human herpesvirus 6, human parvovirus B19V (B19V), and adenoviruses, may cause liver injury, ranging from mild and transient elevation of aminotransferases to acute hepatitis and occasionally acute liver failure. Despite the number of hepatitis viruses and hepatitis-associated viruses, etiology cannot be determined in 10-20 per cent of the cases of acute hepatitis, in 30 per cent of cases of cryptogenic chronic liver diseases, in hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, and in a large proportion of cases of acute liver failure. Patients with acute seronegative hepatitis have fewer parenteral risk factors, more severe bilirubin and transaminase elevations, and worse hepatocellular synthetic function than patients with hepatitis C. Moreover, seronegative hepatitis is more strongly associated with serious complications, especially bone marrow failure and childhood fulminant hepatitis.\n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has had an increasing impact on biological research and clinical diagnosis, because it provides high-resolution genome-scale data rapidly and reliably. The 1st application of NGS for pathogen discovery in a patient who died of a febrile illness after solid-organ transplantation led to the identification of an arenavirus. NGS based platforms, such as 454 and Solexa deep sequencing, have been applied successfully to the investigation of emerging human pathogens, resulting in major discoveries of new human viruses.\n\nIn the present study, we established an experimental and analytic procedure for identifying virus identification in human specimens based on Solexa deep sequencing. We applied the method to screen for potential viral infection in human sera specimens and discovered a human virus in Chinese patients who had seronegative hepatitis. From its genome organization and phylogeny, the virus is unusual, because it is evolutionarily at the interface of the parvovirus and circovirus families, perhaps having emerged from interfamilial recombination. The virus was highly prevalent in a patient population, and active infection in seronegative hepatitis cases was suggested by the presence of viral DNA in the blood and serology. However, more work is needed to establish a firm disease association.\n\n[Interested readers should access the original text at the source URL above to view the data, figures, and references. Only the Discussion is reproduced here.- Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nWe report the identification of a virus, NIH-CQV, in patients with non-A-E hepatitis. Phylogenetically NIH-CQV appears to lie at the interface of parvoviruses and circoviruses. The genome of NIH-CQV has no homology to any known viruses in GenBank.\n\nAlthough comparative analysis revealed that the Rep and CP proteins of NIH-CQV have limited homologies with circoviruses and parvoviruses, respectively, the overall genome organization of NIH-CQV has the basic characteristics of viruses in _Parvoviridae_.\n\nNIH-CQV has a small, compact linear DNA genome with 2 tandemly arranged major ORFs encoding Rep and CP proteins, respectively, and a pair of ITRs [inverted terminal repeats] at the left and right ends of the genome. In silico promoter prediction suggested that transcription of the rep and cp was regulated by a single promoter upstream of the rep, because there was no apparent promoter sequence immediately upstream of cp. A pre-mRNA encoded by a single promoter that is processed by alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation to generate multiple mRNAs had been reported for other parvoviruses, such as B19V and Aleutian mink disease virus. By amino acid sequence analysis, CP protein of NIH-CQV is minimally homologous to porcine and goose parvovirus VP1. The homologous region is mainly in the N terminus of CP and contains the conserved PLA2-like motif, which is present in the N-terminal extension of the VP1 unique region of members of _Parvoviridae_. The phylogenetic tree constructed using amino acid sequences of CP of NIH-CQV and VP1 of other representative viruses in _Parvoviridae_ showed that NIH-CQV represents a deeply rooted lineage between 2 groups: (i) human and animal parvoviruses and (ii) insect parvoviruses. Thus, NIH-CQV appears to be a parvovirus-like virus.\n\nHowever, NIH-CQV also has features shared by members of the _Circoviridae_ family. First, a BLASTp search revealed that the Rep of NIH-CQV is more related to circoviral Rep than to those of other viruses. Second, NIH-CQV appears to have an ambisense genome because there are bidirectional putative promoters in the intergenic region between the rep and 15-kDa protein and because rep and 15-kDa protein arranged head-to-head flank the intergenic region, which is a feature of circoviruses. Finally, sequencing and alignment of the inverse PCR products indicated the existence of the circular genome of NIH-CQV in the clinical samples. The circular form of NIH-CQV genome might represent a subviral DNA or an intermediate structure of viral replication, as reported for other parvoviruses.\n\nTherefore, NIH-CQV appears to be a 'hybrid' virus, perhaps formed by interfamilial recombination between a parvovirus and a circovirus. This idea was supported further by whole-proteome phylogenetic analysis, which showed NIH-CQV located between _Parvoviridae_ and _Circoviridae_.\n\nBoth recombination and a high mutation rate are often cited as key in evolutionary innovation. For many viruses, recombination allows single-step acquisition of multiple genetic changes, and a high mutation rate enhances adaptation to new hosts. These processes are critical driving forces in viral evolution and lead to viral emergence, host-switching, and adaptation, which often result in disease outbreaks. Recent studies had demonstrated that small eukaryotic ssDNA [single stranded DNA] viruses have high rates of nucleotide substitutions and genetic recombination, which may surpass rates seen in RNA viruses. These observations may explain the extensive diversity seen in ssDNA viruses. Parvoviruses (family _Parvoviridae_) and circoviruses (family _Circoviridae_) are both ssDNA viruses that infect a wide variety of animal species, including mammals, birds, and insects. Although horizontal gene transfer and high mutation rates have been documented in these viruses, cross-species viral transfers resulting from interfamilial recombination and leading to a infection in the new host species are not common.\n\nA high rate of viral evolution has been reported for emerging parvoviruses. Canine parvovirus (CPV) is one well-characterized example. CPV emerged from feline panleukopenia parvovirus or a closely related virus, differing at several amino acid residues. Sequences of the viruses collected at time points before and after host-switching suggest that the emergence of CPV was dependent on a high mutation rate and positive selection of the major capsid gene. Our deep-sequencing data showed that NIH-CQV has a high substitution mutation rate throughout its genome. However, the impact of selective pressures, as measured by the Ka/Ks ratio, appeared to vary depending on location. The cp gene contained three regions in which the Ka/Ks ratio exceeded 1, suggesting positive selection. These substitutions would be presumed to enhance fitness. In contrast, selective pressure on the rep of NIH-CQV appeared to be dominated by purifying selection, because the average Ka/Ks ratio for the rep from 14 patients was only 0.42. The Ka/Ks ratios for the regions encoding the PLA2 motif in the CP protein or P-loop nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) in the Rep proteins were lower than in other regions, as is consistent with strong purifying selection and functional importance of this region in viral replication.\n\nNIH-CQV exhibited remarkable genetic heterogeneity within patients, indicating the presence of closely related variants or quasispecies in NIH-CQV-infected individuals. The Ka/Ks ratios of both viral cp and rep were greater in patients classified as having chronic hepatitis than in those with acute hepatitis, suggesting greater variation or more diversity of quasispecies of NIH-CQV over time. For hepatitis viruses C and E, diversification of quasispecies during infection is driven by the interaction between the viruses and host immune response and may be associated with different clinical outcomes. With a limited number of serial samples from a single individual, we were unable to conclude whether quasispecies dynamics of NIH-CQV in patients correlated with disease.\n\nDespite technological advances in molecular biology, an etiology cannot be determined in as many as 20 per cent of hepatitis cases. As of yet, no causative agent may be defined in a significant proportion of patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, whose disease therefore is characterized as 'cryptogenic'. Additional hepatitis agents have been suspected. Over several decades, several human viruses, such as GB virus C, Torque teno virus, and SEN virus, have been putatively claimed to be hepatitis viruses, but subsequent investigation revealed no conclusive association between these viruses and liver disease. Therefore, the etiology of non-A-E hepatitis remains unresolved. In this study, we applied NGS methodology to virus discovery and identified a parvovirus-like virus in the sera samples collected from a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis. Our results showed that 28 per cent of patients were positive for both NIH-CQV-specific IgM and viral DNA, suggesting recent infection in patients. Most patients and healthy controls were positive for virus-specific IgG, suggesting that exposure was common in the population studied. The patients who yielded positive specimens suffered from symptoms of hepatitis with a wide range of liver dysfunction, including acute and chronic hepatitis. There was no difference between patients diagnosed with acute versus or chronic hepatitis with respect to detection of NIH-CQV DNA, but viral DNA was not detected in healthy controls.\n\nAlthough these findings are suggestive of an etiologic relationship, our study has limitations. By electron microscopy, we observed virus-like particles in NIH-CQV qPCR [quantitative PCR]-positive sera which cosedimented with viral DNA, but we were unable to confirm their identity by immunogold labeling with our antisera. In addition, because of the limited availability of samples, we had insufficient material for viral propagation and isolation in cell culture, and efforts are in progress to detect viral proteins in a few liver biopsy tissue blocks. Additionally, with the limited number of samples available, we cannot exclude the possibility of reactivation of a latent virus in the course of liver inflammation.\n\nIn general, parvoviruses cause systemic infection, but clinical manifestations of the infection are varied and may depend on specific tissue tropisms as well as on host immunologic competency. For 2 human pathogenic parvoviruses, B19V and HBoV, clinical symptoms range from none to acute systemic manifestations involving skin and joints to subtle persistence of infection; in immunocompromised populations, B19V chronic infection causes pure red cell aplasia. In addition, coinfection of parvoviruses with other viruses, especially related DNA viruses, can lead to synergy and more severe clinical symptoms in the affected host. Because of the complexity of disease associations, more comprehensive epidemiology and in vitro studies are needed to establish a pathogenic role of NIH-CQV in hepatitis.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The authors report the identification of a virus, designated NIH-CQV, in patients with non-A/B/C/D/E hepatitis. Phylogenetically this virus appears to lie at the interface of parvoviruses and circoviruses. The genome of NIH-CQV has no homology to any known hepatitis viruses. NIH-CQV has a small, compact linear DNA genome with 2 tandemly arranged major ORFs encoding Rep and CP proteins, respectively, and a pair of ITRs at the left and right ends of the genome. NIH-CQV represents a deeply rooted lineage between 2 groups: the human and animal parvoviruses and the insect parvoviruses. Thus, NIH-CQV appears to be a parvovirus-like virus.\n\nHowever, NIH-CQV also has features shared by members of the _Circoviridae_ family. NIH-CQV exhibits ambisense encoding of sequences a feature shared with members of the _Circoviridae_ family. Therefore, NIH-CQV appears to be a 'hybrid' virus, perhaps formed by interfamilial recombination between a parvovirus and a circovirus. This idea is supported further by whole-proteome phylogenetic analysis, which showed NIH-CQV located between the families _Parvoviridae_ and _Circoviridae_. Parvoviruses (family _Parvoviridae_) and circoviruses (family _Circoviridae_) are both ssDNA viruses that infect a wide variety of animal species, including mammals, birds, and insects. However, although horizontal gene transfer and high mutation rates have been documented in these viruses, cross-species viral transfers resulting from interfamilial recombination and leading to a infection in the new host species are not common.\n\nFurthermore NIH-CQV exhibited remarkable genetic heterogeneity within patients, indicating the presence of closely related variants or quasispecies in NIH-CQV-infected individuals. For hepatitis viruses C and E, diversification of quasispecies during infection is driven by the interaction between the viruses and host immune response and may be associated with different clinical outcomes. With a limited number of serial samples from a single individual, the authors were unable to conclude whether quasispecies dynamics of NIH-CQV in patients correlated with disease.\n\nThe authors are aware that over the years several human viruses, such as GB virus C, Torque teno virus, and SEN virus, have been claimed to be hepatitis viruses, but subsequent investigation revealed no conclusive association between these viruses and liver disease. Therefore, the etiology of non-A/B/C/D/E hepatitis remains unsolved. In this study, the authors applied NGS methodology to virus discovery and identified a parvovirus-like virus in sera samples collected from a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis.

Other hepatitis-associated viruses, including CMV [cytomegalovirus], Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, human herpesvirus 6, human parvovirus B19V (B19V), and adenoviruses, may cause liver injury, ranging from mild and transient elevation of aminotransferases to acute hepatitis and occasionally acute liver failure. Despite the number of hepatitis viruses and hepatitis-associated viruses, etiology cannot be determined in 10-20 per cent of the cases of acute hepatitis, in 30 per cent of cases of cryptogenic chronic liver diseases, in hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, and in a large proportion of cases of acute liver failure. The authors are aware that over the years several human viruses, such as GB virus C, Torque teno virus, and SEN virus, have been claimed to be hepatitis viruses, but subsequent investigation revealed no conclusive association between these viruses and liver disease. Over several decades, several human viruses, such as GB virus C, Torque teno virus, and SEN virus, have been putatively claimed to be hepatitis viruses, but subsequent investigation revealed no conclusive association between these viruses and liver disease. 84 per cent of patients were positive for IgG, and 31 per cent were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78 per cent of healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM. Although more work is needed to determine the etiologic role of NIH-CQV in human disease, our data indicate that a parvovirus-like virus is highly prevalent in a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis. Patients with acute seronegative hepatitis have fewer parenteral risk factors, more severe bilirubin and transaminase elevations, and worse hepatocellular synthetic function than patients with hepatitis C. Moreover, seronegative hepatitis is more strongly associated with serious complications, especially bone marrow failure and childhood fulminant hepatitis. In this study, the authors applied NGS methodology to virus discovery and identified a parvovirus-like virus in sera samples collected from a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis. In this study, we applied NGS methodology to virus discovery and identified a parvovirus-like virus in the sera samples collected from a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis. We applied the method to screen for potential viral infection in human sera specimens and discovered a human virus in Chinese patients who had seronegative hepatitis. Seronegative hepatitis -- non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis -- is poorly characterized but strongly associated with serious complications. The Ka/Ks ratios of both viral cp and rep were greater in patients classified as having chronic hepatitis than in those with acute hepatitis, suggesting greater variation or more diversity of quasispecies of NIH-CQV over time.

However, although horizontal gene transfer and high mutation rates have been documented in these viruses, cross-species viral transfers resulting from interfamilial recombination and leading to a infection in the new host species are not common. [The authors report the identification of a virus, designated NIH-CQV, in patients with non-A/B/C/D/E hepatitis. We report the identification of a virus, NIH-CQV, in patients with non-A-E hepatitis. Recent studies had demonstrated that small eukaryotic ssDNA [single stranded DNA] viruses have high rates of nucleotide substitutions and genetic recombination, which may surpass rates seen in RNA viruses. There was no difference between patients diagnosed with acute versus or chronic hepatitis with respect to detection of NIH-CQV DNA, but viral DNA was not detected in healthy controls. \n\nNIH-CQV has a small, compact linear DNA genome with 2 tandemly arranged major ORFs encoding Rep and CP proteins, respectively, and a pair of ITRs [inverted terminal repeats] at the left and right ends of the genome. Although comparative analysis revealed that the Rep and CP proteins of NIH-CQV have limited homologies with circoviruses and parvoviruses, respectively, the overall genome organization of NIH-CQV has the basic characteristics of viruses in _Parvoviridae_. In addition, coinfection of parvoviruses with other viruses, especially related DNA viruses, can lead to synergy and more severe clinical symptoms in the affected host. Our results showed that 28 per cent of patients were positive for both NIH-CQV-specific IgM and viral DNA, suggesting recent infection in patients. For 2 human pathogenic parvoviruses, B19V and HBoV, clinical symptoms range from none to acute systemic manifestations involving skin and joints to subtle persistence of infection; in immunocompromised populations, B19V chronic infection causes pure red cell aplasia. From its genome organization and phylogeny, the virus is unusual, because it is evolutionarily at the interface of the parvovirus and circovirus families, perhaps having emerged from interfamilial recombination. Sequences of the viruses collected at time points before and after host-switching suggest that the emergence of CPV was dependent on a high mutation rate and positive selection of the major capsid gene.

The northern part is entirely desert. To the south, there is slightly more rainfall with the eastern side being plains with low sandy hills, while the volcanic Marrah Mountains occupy most of the western side of the south. In the southern portion, the most important crops are millet, maize and peanuts. The area has been afflicted by civil strife over many years. Hepatitis E virus infection is prevalent throughout both Sudan and South Sudan.\n\nHepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. It is usually a self-limiting infection and resolves within 4-6 weeks. Occasionally, a fulminant form of hepatitis develops causing acute liver failure, which can lead to death. Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. Genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 70 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. The highest seroprevalence rates are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus.\n\nThe incubation period following exposure to the hepatitis E virus ranges from 3-8 weeks, with a mean of 40 days. The period of communicability is unknown. Hepatitis E virus causes acute sporadic and epidemic viral hepatitis. Symptomatic infection is most common in young adults aged 15-40 years. Although infection is frequent in children, the disease is mostly asymptomatic or causes a very mild illness without jaundice (anicteric) that goes undiagnosed. These symptoms are largely indistinguishable from those experienced during any acute phase of any hepatic illness and typically last for one to 2 weeks. In rare cases, acute hepatitis E can result in fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) and death. Fulminant hepatitis occurs more frequently during pregnancy. Pregnant women are at greater risk of obstetrical complications and mortality from hepatitis E, which can induce a mortality rate of 20 percent among pregnant women in their 3rd trimester (see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html).\n\nThere is no specific treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis. Prevention is the most effective approach against the disease.

All were reported to have yellow eyes before death. During [27 Jul 2012 to 3 Aug 2012], 3 adult males with acute onset jaundice were admitted to the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) hospital in Jamam camp; 2 died within 4 days of admission. The Republic of South Sudan Ministry of Health, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), CDC, and humanitarian organizations responded through enhanced case surveillance, a serosurvey investigation, and targeted prevention efforts. As of 27 Jan 2013, a total of 5080 acute jaundice syndrome (AJS) cases had been reported from all 4 Maban County refugee camps (Doro, Gendrassa, Jamam, and Yusuf Batil). Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection was confirmed in a convenience sample of cases in each camp. A cross-sectional serosurvey conducted in Jamam camp in November 2012 indicated that 54.3 per cent of the population was susceptible to HEV infection. Across all camps, an AJS case fatality rate (CFR) of 10.4 per cent was observed among pregnant women. The outbreak response has focused on improving safe drinking water availability, improving sanitation and hygiene, conducting active case finding, and optimizing clinical care, especially among pregnant women. Sustaining these improvements, along with strengthening community outreach, is needed to improve outbreak control. Further investigation of the potential role for the newly developed HEV vaccine in outbreak control also is needed.\n\nAnalysis\n--------\nRefugees began fleeing armed violence in Blue Nile State, Sudan, in late 2011, initially settling in Doro, the oldest camp. By July 2012, the Maban County refugee camp population surged to 110 000, coinciding with the onset of heavy rains and flooding. Flooding disproportionately affected large sections of Jamam camp, forcing refugee relocation to Gendrassa camp, 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. Yusuf Batil camp, 2 miles (3 kilometers) from Gendrassa, also was rapidly settled during the 2012 population displacement. An acute humanitarian emergency ensued, with crude mortality rates exceeding the emergency threshold of one per 10 000 per day in July and August [2012]; diarrheal disease was a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.\n\nUNHCR and World Health Organization consider AJS to be a priority syndrome for communicable disease surveillance in humanitarian emergencies. The South Sudan Ministry of Health case definition for AJS is acute onset of jaundice and severe illness in any person. The etiologies and outcomes of AJS are varied and represent multiple diseases of outbreak potential, including HEV. HEV is endemic in Sudan and South Sudan; however, the extent of immunity is unknown. Transmission is fecal-oral, with an incubation period of 2-8 weeks. Globally, the overall CFR for HEV has been reported to range from 0.2 per cent to 4 per cent; mortality in pregnant women can be as high as 10-25 per cent (3). No unique clinical manifestations of hepatitis E distinguish it from other viral AJS etiologies, such as hepatitis A or yellow fever.\n\nFollowing the initial cluster of AJS cases in July 2012, active surveillance was implemented in each camp by training community health workers on detection and referral of jaundiced patients to MSF health facilities. Clinician-confirmed AJS cases were documented using standardized line lists. No diagnostic testing for HEV was available at the field level. The etiologic cause of the outbreak was confirmed as HEV in August 2012 by the CDC-Kenya Medical Research Institute laboratory in Nairobi, Kenya, after 6 of 8 initial AJS cases from Jamam camp were positive by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) for HEV. Blood specimens were tested for alternative acute infectious hepatitis etiologies, specifically yellow fever and viral hemorrhagic fevers. All 8 were negative for these alternative etiologies. Subsequent AJS cases from the 3 other camps also were confirmed as HEV positive by rt-PCR. After alternate etiologies were excluded and HEV was confirmed in each camp (38 of 62 [61.3 per cent] AJS cases tested were rt-PCR positive for HEV), cases of AJS recognized clinically were considered probable cases of HEV. Dipstick testing for bilirubinuria was used as a diagnostic adjunct when a finding of yellow eyes was in doubt.\n\nAs of 27 Jan 2013, a total of 5080 AJS cases were reported: 3291 in Yusuf Batil, 1261 in Jamam, 474 in Gendrassa, and 54 in Doro. During the 1st weeks of 2013, a large increase in cases was reported from Yusuf Batil, with a 2nd peak observed in Jamam and Gendrassa. The initial peak had occurred in August 2012. Possible explanations for this 2nd peak include: 1) less than optimal water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions, both at the community and household levels; 2) the long incubation period of HEV, resulting in an increase of cases well after control measures had been put in place; and 3) alternative modes of transmission, including person-to-person transmission. Median patient age was 25 years, and 52.5 percent were female. Among pregnant women, 211 AJS cases and 22 deaths were reported (CFR = 10.4 per cent). UNHCR population estimates were used to calculate age-specific attack rates and risk ratios for AJS death among pregnant women. Approximately 2027 women (3 per cent of the total Jamam, Yusuf Batil, and Gendrassa population) were estimated to be pregnant, based on an assumed crude birth rate of 39 per 1000. The risk for death from AJS among pregnant women was estimated to be 4.8 times that for nonpregnant women aged 18-59 years in the 3 most affected camps (Jamam, Gendrassa, and Yusuf Batil). The overall attack rate in the 3 most affected camps was 7.4 per cent; persons aged 18-59 years had the highest attack rates. As of 27 Jan 2013, a total of 576 (11.3 per cent) AJS patients identified by surveillance had been hospitalized in the 3 most affected camps, with a cumulative hospital CFR of 17.5 per cent. Of the 101 hospitalized patients who died, 51.5 per cent were female; the median age was 29 years. Hospital data for Doro patients were limited.\n\nThe surge of AJS patients required a sustained medical response in challenging field conditions. MSF's clinical response focused on supportive management. In addition to individual symptom management, all outpatients received multivitamins, supplemental nutrition, soap, and hygiene education. A concerted effort to improve community outreach was implemented. Outpatients were reassessed every 7 days until symptoms resolved. Patients with severe fever, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, agitation, or coma were admitted, as were patients with a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test, hypoglycemia, or pregnancy. A low-threshold approach to hospitalization was taken, including admission of all jaundiced pregnant women for observation, because of challenges in predicting clinical course.\n\nCritically ill patients had confusion, agitation, coma, hypoglycemia, or suspected electrolyte imbalances. These patients required intensive care in a resource-limited setting to manage fluid balance and complications of hepatic encephalopathy [occurrence of confusion, altered level of consciousness, and coma as a result of liver failure]. Initial treatment included antibiotics and intravenous fluids. Metronidazole was administered if the mental status changed, and ceftriaxone was administered if fever or suspected bacterial infection was present. Intravenous dextrose and saline fluid were alternated to prevent hypoglycemia and hyponatremia [an electrolyte disturbance in which the sodium ion concentration in the serum is lower than normal], respectively, when enteral feeding was not feasible. Adjunctive haloperidol for agitation and vitamin K for coagulopathy [blood clotting disorder] were provided.\n\nA cross-sectional serosurvey was conducted in Jamam camp during 6-10 Nov 2012, to estimate population susceptibility and understand potential outbreak evolution. A total of 443 randomly selected persons aged 3 years and up from households sampled by simple and systematic random sampling provided consent for anti-HEV antibody testing. The CDC-Kenya Medical Research Institute laboratory used enzyme immunosorbent assay kits to detect anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and anti-HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) among participants. Serology results were weighted for age, based on UNHCR population data, to be representative of the Jamam population at the time of the survey. Overall, 21.7 per cent (CI = 17.6-25.7) had IgM anti-HEV, representing recent exposure to HEV, and 54.3 per cent (CI = 49.2-59.3) had no serologic evidence of recent or prior HEV infection (that is, both IgM and IgG negative).\n\nMMWR comment editorial note\n---------------------------\nRecent large outbreaks have occurred among displaced persons in Sudan, Chad, and Uganda. The 1st such outbreak documented in Africa occurred among Angolan refugees in Namibia in 1983. The current outbreak in South Sudan shares similar epidemiologic characteristics with other HEV outbreaks. Similar to a 2007 outbreak in northern Uganda, this outbreak started during the rainy season and has had high attack rates among young adults and high mortality among pregnant women (8). The serosurvey conducted during this outbreak showed that more than half of Jamam camp residents had no evidence of recent or past HEV infection, suggesting that these persons remained uninfected and were still susceptible to HEV infection 3 months after the implementation of control measures.\n\nSince the South Sudan Ministry of Health declared the HEV outbreak in September 2012, efforts to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions have been ongoing. Health and hygiene promoters have been trained on HEV prevention and active case finding. HEV preventive hygiene education has been conducted during household visits, at health facilities, and in community forums. UNHCR and partner agencies have scaled up water, sanitation, and hygiene activities, including increasing the availability of treated drinking water, increasing latrine coverage, distributing soap and water storage vessels, installing handwashing stations, and expanding hygiene promotion activities. Further water, sanitation, and hygiene improvements are needed to address ongoing transmission.\n\nA recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine is available but has not yet been prequalified by the World Health Organization. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in persons aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses has been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia. Several questions regarding duration of immunity and prevention of subclinical infection remain. The effectiveness and implementation logistics of a 3-dose vaccine in an outbreak setting, particularly a challenging setting such as a displaced persons camp, also needs investigation. Genotype testing on serum samples collected for the cross-sectional serosurvey has not been performed to date.\n\nLarge HEV outbreaks have occurred among crowded displaced populations. These outbreaks result in appreciable morbidity and mortality, particularly among pregnant women. Despite enhancing water, sanitation, and hygiene control measures, outbreaks often are prolonged and necessitate a sustained prevention and control response. The role of vaccination in the context of outbreak control urgently needs to be examined.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Large HEV outbreaks have been documented in crowded settings that have poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E.\n\nThe hepatitis E outbreak in South Sudan has demonstrated ongoing transmission, possibly including person-to-person transmission, among refugees in crowded living conditions with poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Following the initial peak, 54.3 per cent of the Jamam camp population remained susceptible to HEV infection, despite having traveled from a region where HEV is believed to be endemic. The outbreak has strained existing local and humanitarian relief health facilities, and additional resources are needed.\n\nA recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine is available now but has not yet been prequalified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in persons aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses has been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia. The genotype of the outbreak strain in South Sudan has not yet been determined.\n\nA map of South Sudan showing the location of Jamam can be accessed at http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4e43cb466.html. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/3Kei.]", "summary": "Possible explanations for this 2nd peak include: 1) less than optimal water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions, both at the community and household levels; 2) the long incubation period of HEV, resulting in an increase of cases well after control measures had been put in place; and 3) alternative modes of transmission, including person-to-person transmission. Globally, the overall CFR for HEV has been reported to range from 0.2 per cent to 4 per cent; mortality in pregnant women can be as high as 10-25 per cent (3). The serosurvey conducted during this outbreak showed that more than half of Jamam camp residents had no evidence of recent or past HEV infection, suggesting that these persons remained uninfected and were still susceptible to HEV infection 3 months after the implementation of control measures. The outbreak response has focused on improving safe drinking water availability, improving sanitation and hygiene, conducting active case finding, and optimizing clinical care, especially among pregnant women.

During the week of 2 Jul 2012, the deaths of 2 pregnant women and one child were reported by household mortality surveillance in Jamam refugee camp, Maban County, Upper Nile State, South Sudan. Similar to a 2007 outbreak in northern Uganda, this outbreak started during the rainy season and has had high attack rates among young adults and high mortality among pregnant women (8). The etiologic cause of the outbreak was confirmed as HEV in August 2012 by the CDC-Kenya Medical Research Institute laboratory in Nairobi, Kenya, after 6 of 8 initial AJS cases from Jamam camp were positive by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) for HEV. UNHCR and partner agencies have scaled up water, sanitation, and hygiene activities, including increasing the availability of treated drinking water, increasing latrine coverage, distributing soap and water storage vessels, installing handwashing stations, and expanding hygiene promotion activities. The risk for death from AJS among pregnant women was estimated to be 4.8 times that for nonpregnant women aged 18-59 years in the 3 most affected camps (Jamam, Gendrassa, and Yusuf Batil). As of 27 Jan 2013, a total of 576 (11.3 per cent) AJS patients identified by surveillance had been hospitalized in the 3 most affected camps, with a cumulative hospital CFR of 17.5 per cent. The effectiveness and implementation logistics of a 3-dose vaccine in an outbreak setting, particularly a challenging setting such as a displaced persons camp, also needs investigation. Following the initial cluster of AJS cases in July 2012, active surveillance was implemented in each camp by training community health workers on detection and referral of jaundiced patients to MSF health facilities. Approximately 2027 women (3 per cent of the total Jamam, Yusuf Batil, and Gendrassa population) were estimated to be pregnant, based on an assumed crude birth rate of 39 per 1000. A cross-sectional serosurvey conducted in Jamam camp in November 2012 indicated that 54.3 per cent of the population was susceptible to HEV infection. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses has been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses has been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The overall attack rate in the 3 most affected camps was 7.4 per cent; persons aged 18-59 years had the highest attack rates. \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Since the South Sudan Ministry of Health declared the HEV outbreak in September 2012, efforts to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions have been ongoing. Following the initial peak, 54.3 per cent of the Jamam camp population remained susceptible to HEV infection, despite having traveled from a region where HEV is believed to be endemic. Among pregnant women, 211 AJS cases and 22 deaths were reported (CFR = 10.4 per cent). Despite enhancing water, sanitation, and hygiene control measures, outbreaks often are prolonged and necessitate a sustained prevention and control response. HEPATITIS E - SOUTH SUDAN (04): (UPPER NILE) REFUGEES OUTBREAK\n**************************************************************\n Overall, 21.7 per cent (CI = 17.6-25.7) had IgM anti-HEV, representing recent exposure to HEV, and 54.3 per cent (CI = 49.2-59.3) had no serologic evidence of recent or prior HEV infection (that is, both IgM and IgG negative). Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E.\n\n An acute humanitarian emergency ensued, with crude mortality rates exceeding the emergency threshold of one per 10 000 per day in July and August [2012]; diarrheal disease was a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Yusuf Batil camp, 2 miles (3 kilometers) from Gendrassa, also was rapidly settled during the 2012 population displacement. As of 27 Jan 2013, a total of 5080 acute jaundice syndrome (AJS) cases had been reported from all 4 Maban County refugee camps (Doro, Gendrassa, Jamam, and Yusuf Batil). Across all camps, an AJS case fatality rate (CFR) of 10.4 per cent was observed among pregnant women.

To date, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has treated 3991 patients in its health facilities in the camps and has recorded 88 deaths, including 15 pregnant women. Hepatitis E [virus] causes a liver disease and can lead to acute liver failure and death. It is particularly dangerous for pregnant women. Like cholera, the virus spreads in environments with poor sanitation and contaminated water. There is no cure, but its symptoms are treatable.\n\n'We have been doing everything we can to care for people with hepatitis E [virus infection], but there is no treatment for the disease,' says Dr. Jose-Luis Dvorzak, MSF Medical Coordinator in Maban County. 'We suspect this outbreak is far from over, and many more people will die.'\n\nThe 1st cases appeared in June 2012. Three camps -- Jamam, then Gendrassa and Batil -- have seen the most cases so far. Numbers still have not peaked in Batil camp, where death rates have steadily risen from one or 2 per week in November [2012] to 10 per week in January [2013]. Over the past 2 weeks, MSF has identified a further 41 suspected hepatitis E cases in Doro camp, 2 of whom have died, meaning that none of the camps in Maban County is free of the virus.\n\nThis hepatitis E outbreak was able to take hold because of poor water and sanitation conditions, such as inadequate distribution of clean water, limited access to functioning latrines, and too few hand-washing points in the Maban refugee camps, which host more than 110 000 Sudanese refugees. 'The refugee camps should not only be a place of safety from conflict but also a place where refugees can stay alive and are safe from preventable diseases and outbreaks,' said Laurence Sailly, MSF Emergency Coordinator in Doro camp.\n\nBecause of Maban county's geographical location, it is a flood plain in the rainy season and a parched wasteland in the dry season. The refugees in these camps are completely reliant on humanitarian assistance for the food, water, and healthcare they need to survive. While continuing to concentrate on the extremely heavy medical workload of caring for hepatitis E patients and treating all the other patients with other pathologies who present in our field hospitals, MSF teams are also carrying out emergency gap-filling activities, such as pumping, treating, and distributing around 2.5 million liters of water per week in Doro camp.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. Genotypes 1 and 2 are usually seen in developing countries and cause community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 70 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. The highest seroprevalence rates are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for hepatitis E virus (see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html). The conditions in the refugee camps in South Sudan are such that, once established, the illness is difficult or impossible to control and eradicate, as described in the MSF statement above.\n\nHepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route due to faecal contamination of drinking water. Other transmission routes include foodborne transmission from ingestion of products derived from infected animals and vertical transmission from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Currently, there is no vaccine available for control of hepatitis E virus infection. Hepatitis E virus infection is self-limiting in normal conditions, and fulminant hepatitis is rare, with only pregnant women being at increased risk.

South Sudan's border region has been flooded with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing fighting in Sudan's South Kordofan and Blue Nile states.\n\nSouth Sudan's Ministry of Health has reported almost 400 cases of the virus since the outbreak was identified in July [2012]. 'Cases are rising day by day, thus placing immense pressure on the available heath services and resources. This is of grave humanitarian concern,' the ministry said in a joint statement with U.N. agencies. In Maban county, the area affected, 108 000 Sudanese refugees live in camps in dire conditions, aid officials say. Hepatitis E causes liver infections and is spread by drinking water contaminated with faeces. John Lagu, director of preparedness and response at the Ministry of Health, said the virus thrived in camps that are overcrowded and flooded.\n\n'The good thing is that the virus is not very aggressive ... and that cases of mortality are low. Few people die from it,' Lagu told Reuters by telephone.\n\nHowever, he warned that there was a risk the virus could spread to local people, who have less access to healthcare than those in the camps. 'It's just another indication of the very bad conditions that are there,' said Stefano Zannini at medical aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres. 'There is a lack of food, clean drinking water and the number of latrines is very low ... so you have all the right conditions for this type of outbreak to take place,' he said.

To date, 26 refugees have died in camps in Upper Nile. This is 10 more deaths since mid-September'\n\nStretched UNHCR faces difficulties containing hepatitis E outbreak\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] on Friday [9 Nov 2012] warned that its capacity to contain an outbreak of hepatitis E among the refugee population in South Sudan was increasingly stretched at a time when funding for its emergency operation was depleted. 'The risks will grow if, as currently anticipated, we see fresh inflows of refugees from South Kordofan and Blue Nile states in neighbouring Sudan,' spokesman Adrian Edwards added. Due to insecurity and worsening humanitarian conditions in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, UNHCR staff on the ground expect thousands of new refugees to cross in the next weeks as roads become passable after the rainy season. UNHCR and its partners, including South Sudan's national health authorities, are already fighting an outbreak of hepatitis E in Upper Nile and Unity states, 2 regions where the disease is endemic and where\n175 000 Sudanese refugees have found shelter.\n\n'We have seen 1050 cases of hepatitis E in the refugee camps,' said Edwards. 'To date, 26 refugees have died in camps in Upper Nile. This is 10 more deaths since mid-September,' he added. Hepatitis E virus is contracted and spread through consuming contaminated food and water. It damages the liver. Potentially fatal, the risk of infection is high in densely populated settings such as refugee camps. This is further exacerbated in the rainy season due to flooding and poor sanitation. Women and small children are the most vulnerable. Early diagnosis is also crucial for the survival of patients. Edwards said UNHCR was working with the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which has sent 6 staff to test water and blood samples and conduct house-to-house interviews on hygiene practices.\n\nTo counter the spread of the disease among the tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees in South Sudan, 'We are promoting better hygiene practices through hundreds of trained community workers. In all camps this community outreach exercise includes active case finding,' Edwards said. The refugee agency has also been working to improve the supply of clean water in the camps, as well as upgrade latrines and provide more washing stations and soap. These measures have helped to slow the spread of the disease. However, UNHCR is struggling to meet the minimum humanitarian standards such as the provision of 15 to 20 litres of safe drinking water per refugee per day or building enough latrines so that each unit is shared by no more than 20 refugees.\n\nEdwards stressed that UNHCR's South Sudan operation is seriously underfunded. 'UNHCR needs a minimum of USD 20 million until the end of the year to keep up basic life-saving activities. Of our revised appeal for USD 186 million, only 40 per cent has been received so far. International NGOs also need additional funding beyond that amount to ensure that all activities can be carried out as needed,' he stressed.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[South Sudan, officially the Republic of South Sudan, previously known as Southern Sudan, is a landlocked state in east-central Africa. South Sudan is bordered by Ethiopia to the east, Kenya to the southeast, Uganda to the south, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the southwest, the Central African Republic to the west, and Sudan to the north. South Sudan includes the vast swamp region known as the Sudd formed by the White Nile.\n\nThe modern states of South Sudan and Sudan were part of Egypt, later being governed as an Anglo-Egyptian protectorate until Sudanese independence was achieved in 1956. Following the First Sudanese Civil War, the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was formed in 1972 and lasted until 1983. A 2nd Sudanese civil war soon developed and ended with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005. Later that year, southern autonomy was restored when an Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan was formed. South Sudan became an independent state on 9 July 2011, and it is now a United Nations member state and a member state of the African Union, A map of South Sudan can be accessed at: http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4e43cb466.html.\n\nHepatitis E is found worldwide and different genotypes of hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. Genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community level outbreaks while genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 70 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. The highest seroprevalence rates are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for hepatitis E virus. [see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html.]\n\nHepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route due to faecal contamination of drinking water. Other transmission routes have been identified, which include foodborne transmission from ingestion of products derived from infected animals, and vertical transmission from a pregnant woman to her fetus. The risk factors for hepatitis E infection are related to poor sanitation in large areas of the world and shedding of hepatitis E virus in faeces. Currently there is no vaccine available for control of hepatitis E virus infection. Fortunately, hepatitis E virus infection is usually self-limiting. However, hospitalization is necessary for people with fulminant hepatitis, and desirable for infected pregnant women.\n\nLack of adequate sanitation for many of the inhabitants of South Sudan is responsible for the escalating outbreak. On 14 Sep 2012 ProMED-mail reported at least 400 cases and 16 deaths in 3 refugee camps in South Sudan.

In the past few years, several cases of zoonotic hepatitis E have been identified and the consumption of food products derived from pork liver has been associated with clusters of human cases. More specifically, raw or undercooked pork products have been incriminated. Few data on the effect of heating on HEV inactivation in food products are available. In the present study, the various times and temperatures that are used during industrial processing of pork products were applied to experimentally contaminated food preparations. After treatment, the presence of residual infectious virus particles was investigated using real-time reverse transcription-PCR and an in vivo experimental model in pigs. Results show that heating the food to an internal temperature of 71 deg C [160 deg F] for 20 min is necessary to completely inactivate HEV. These results are very important for determining processing methods to ensure food safety in regard to foodborne hepatitis E.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSukie Crandall\n<sukiec@optonline.net>\n\n[In the full text, the authors add:\n'In the model used here, intravenous inoculation was chosen to ensure the detection of all infectious particles. Oral infection in pigs has been shown to be less efficient; thus, the time/temperature scale identified for HEV inactivation in this study can be considered conservative. In conclusion, the study presented here confirms that heating efficiently inactivates HEV in food products derived from infected pork liver. Such products should be consumed after they have been cooked for at least 20 min to an internal temperature of 71 deg C [160 deg F].'\n\nThe communicator, Sukie Crandall, has forwarded the abstract above with the following accompanying comment: 'I got curious if cooking could have protected the ferrets in the Netherlands since many ferret owners there use raw feeding.'\n\nSounds plausible; feeding potentially HEV-contaminated raw feed of animal origin, such as pork, to pets -- including ferrets -- may infect them and expose their human contacts to infection.

Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the Internet]. 2012 Aug [date cited]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHuman hepatitis E is a major disease not only in developing countries but also in industrialized countries, and identification of animal strains of human hepatitis E virus [HEV] in pigs and deer and its zoonotic potential has raised considerable public health concerns. Recent reports suggest that other animals such as rats, mongooses, chickens, rabbits, and trout also may harbor HEVs. We used random PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate HEV sequences in ferrets (_Mustela putorius_) from the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2010, fecal samples were collected from ferrets in the Netherlands and stored at -80 deg C [-112 deg F]. Samples that were negative for ferret coronavirus were further characterized for other pathogens. Viral RNA was isolated and viral metagenomic libraries were constructed for 454 pyrosequencing and 248 840 sequence reads were generated from 7 fecal samples. We identified 289 sequence reads in one sample that were related to rat HEV and that could be assembled into 6 contigs covering approximately 50 percent of the ferret HEV (FRHEV) genome.\n\nWe then developed a set of nested PCR primers on the basis of obtained sequences to detect viral RNA. Total RNA extracted from 43 ferret fecal samples collected from 19 locations in the Netherlands was used to perform reverse transcription PCR amplification. Using this PCR, we detected viral RNA in 4 (9.3 percent) fecal samples tested from 4 locations (distance between each sampling location ranged from 25 km to 127 km [15.5 mi - 79 mi]). All amplicons were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. We have limited information regarding the clinical disease this virus may cause because these samples were obtained from household pet ferrets that did not show overt clinical signs. In addition, 4/16 animals from a single farm were IgG positive when tested for IgG against HEV by using recombinant human HEV protein.\n\n[For technical details pertaining to the characterization of the complete genome of this virus, subscribers are referred to the source URL above]. FRHEV full-genome sequences FRHEV4 and FRHEV20 showed 98.6 percent sequence identity and were deposited into GenBank under accession nos. JN998606 and JN998607, respectively.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes clearly showed that FRHEV was separated from genotype 1-4 HEVs and clustered with rat HEV. The phylogenetic distance between rat HEV and FRHEV is larger than the distance between genotype 1 and genotype 2 HEV.\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of sporadic cases of hepatitis E have been reported. Several observations suggest that autochthonous cases are caused by zoonotic spread of infection from wild or domestic animals. In addition, IgG anti-HEV seropositivity in the United States has been associated with several factors, including having a pet at home [see comment]. Further studies are needed to identify the zoonotic potential of FRHEV.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSukie Crandall\n<sukiec@optonline.net>\n\n[One of the references cited in the paper above (ref 1, see below) includes the following observations from the USA: 'Having a pet in the home and consuming liver or other organ meats more than once per month were significantly associated with increased odds of HEV seropositivity'. And: 'Exposure to HEV is common in the US population, although hepatitis E is rarely reported. Having pets and consuming organ meats may play a role in HEV transmission in the United States, but other mechanisms of transmission may also exist.

Co-infection with hepatitis A virus infection (HAV) was noted in 12 anti-HEV IgM+ patients,\nrepresenting 31% (12/39) of all hepatitis A patients seen and over half (12/22) of the hepatitis E cases.\n\nThe authors report that most of the patients with HEV were from the Capital District (i.e., Caracas area), followed by Miranda State -- both adjacent to Vargas State -- with one case each from Bolivar and Yaracuy States. A lack of recent travel in patient histories suggests these HEV cases were autochthonously acquired.\n\nThus, it would appear HEV is also a common cause of acute viral hepatitis in this region of Venezuela, and HAV-HEV co-infection may be frequent among both HAV and HEV cases coming to clinical attention.\n\nJoining hepatitis A and B, hepatitis E may now also be considered 'vaccine-preventable'. [3] An efficacious HEV vaccine (Hecolin, Xiamen Innovax Biotech) was approved by the Chinese government in the past year. This vaccine has not yet been tested or licensed for use outside China, nor have its safety and efficacy been specifically evaluated in pregnant women or children. However, this is the first time an HEV vaccine will enter the market, and the company claims to be pursuing pre-qualification with WHO in anticipation of international distribution [4]. Given the impact of HEV in developing countries (as well as in high-risk populations in industrialized countries) -- which is generally under-appreciated due to limited surveillance -- this is a welcome development, though much work remains to be done to ensure that new HEV vaccines (and water/sanitation interventions) reach populations most in need.

But, if the disease is spreading in the city, blame it on\n40-year-old sewerage pipelines, which contaminate drinking water.\nExperts said that around 60-65 percent youths are carriers of\nhepatitis E virus in the city and that one of the major reasons for\nthe spread of the disease is the contaminated [drinking] water\nsupplied through the pipeline. Also, pregnant women are easily\ninfected with the disease.\n\nThe former head of the department of gastroenterology at the Sawai\nMan Singh Hospital and former president of the Indian Society of\nGastroenterology, Dr Ramesh Roop Rai, said: 'In Jaipur, the number of\nhepatitis E patients [is] increasing and the reason could be water\ncontamination. Due to erosion in the water pipelines, sewer water\nenters the [fresh] water pipelines, which is why infected water enters\nevery house.'\n\nExplaining the contamination process, the expert said that through a\ncombination of old sewer pipelines, which are laid down [alongside]\nwater pipelines, overflow of the sewer lines, and breakage in the\ndrinking water pipelines, the drinking water gets mixed and is then\nsupplied to the houses. Many reports in the newspapers have already\nbeen published about water contamination.\n\nOut of every 100 adults infected with the disease, 95 of them develop\nencephalopathy, after which the patients become unconscious and\ncritical. Doctors claimed that the disease does not have a high\nmortality rate. 'Out of 1000 persons infected, only one could [die]\ndue to hepatitis E [virus infection], but it makes a bad impact on the\nbody,' Rai said.\n\nIn Sawai Man Singh Hospital, around 8-10 patients with hepatitis E\ncome in for treatment every now and then. SMS medical college\nprincipal and gastroenterologist Subhash Nepalia said: 'Around 10\npatients, mostly pregnant woman, with hepatitis E come to the hospital\nfor treatment regularly. The disease takes a fecal-oral transmission\nroute. So, it spreads through contaminated food and water.'\n\nAnother gastroenterologist, C S Sharma, said the disease has become\ncommon like hepatitis A. 'Both hepatitis A and hepatitis E have become\ncommon now. But, hepatitis A has a vaccine, which is administered to\nchildren 10 years after birth. But there is no vaccine for hepatitis E\nso far. Mostly, within 45 days, a patient recovers from the disease,\nbut there are chances that the case could become complicated, and the\npatient dies,' Sharma said.\n\nReacting on the project of replacing old sewer pipelines in the old\nWalled City area, a senior JMC official said: 'Since the project is\nworth more than Rs 300 crore [USD 300 million], a proposal has been\nsent to the state government for financial assistance.

There is no evidence for sexual transmission\nor for transmission by transfusion.\n\nThe highest rates of infection occur in regions where low standards\nof sanitation promote the transmission of the virus. Epidemics of\nhepatitis E have been reported in Central and South-East Asia, North\nand West Africa, and in Mexico, especially where faecal contamination\nof drinking water is common.

Occasionally, a fulminant form of\nhepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates\nranging between 0.5-4.0 percent. Fulminate hepatitis occurs more\nfrequently in pregnancy and regularly induces a mortality rate of 20\npercent among pregnant women in the 3rd trimester.\n\nHepatitis E virus causes acute sporadic and epidemic viral hepatitis.\nSymptomatic HEV infection is most common in young adults aged 15-40\nyears. Although HEV infection is frequent in children, it is mostly\nasymptomatic or causes a very mild illness without jaundice\n(anicteric) that goes undiagnosed. Typical signs and symptoms of\nhepatitis include jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and\nsclera of the eyes, dark urine and pale stools), anorexia (loss of\nappetite), an enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly), abdominal pain\nand tenderness, nausea and vomiting, and fever, although the disease\nmay range in severity from subclinical to fulminant.

Due to erosion in the water pipelines, sewer water\nenters the [fresh] water pipelines, which is why infected water enters\nevery house.' \n\nCertain features of the description of the outbreak in Jaipur are not\ntypical of hepatitis E virus infection, namely the 60-65 percent\ncarriage rate and the 95 percent encephalopathy rate. Out of 1000 persons infected, only one could [die]\ndue to hepatitis E [virus infection], but it makes a bad impact on the\nbody,' Rai said. The risk\nfactors for hepatitis E virus infection are related poor sanitation in\nlarge areas of the world, and shedding in faeces. \n\nOut of every 100 adults infected with the disease, 95 of them develop\nencephalopathy, after which the patients become unconscious and\ncritical. Fulminate hepatitis occurs more\nfrequently in pregnancy and regularly induces a mortality rate of 20\npercent among pregnant women in the 3rd trimester. Occasionally, a fulminant form of\nhepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates\nranging between 0.5-4.0 percent. It is likely\nthat other agents or factors are involved in this outbreak of\nwater-borne disease.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis a", "hepatitis d", "hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": [], "locations": [{"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rajasthan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Sawai", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Walled City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "symptomatic", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Centre", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Jaipur", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "North", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "753757", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Hepatitis E virus - Uganda: Karamoja", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=753757", "date": "2011-06-13 17:37:59", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E VIRUS - UGANDA: KARAMOJA\n************************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 8 Jun 2011\nSource: Outbreak News [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknews.com/2011/06/08/uganda-ministry-of-health-hepatitis-e-outbreak-in-three-districts/\n\n\nWith the [ebolavirus] issue appearing to be over, health authorities\nare battling at least one, maybe 2 different outbreaks [of hepatitis\nE] in Karamoja.\n\nThe Ministry of Health yesterday [7 Jun 2011] confirmed an outbreak\nof the viral liver disease where cases had been confirmed in Kaabong,\nMoroto, and Kotido districts of the Karamoja sub-region of Uganda.\n\nAccording to Kaabong district health officer Dr James Kisambu, a\ntotal of 908 cases of hepatitis E had been reported in the affected\ndistricts and were admitted at Kaabong Hospital.\n\nMedical teams have been dispatched to the region to provide support,\nand samples were taken from several suspected cases for testing at the\nUganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe.\n\nIn addition to the outbreak above, New Vision reports that the\nministry was also investigating reports of a suspected outbreak of\nyellow fever in Karamoja.\n\nThe clinical course of hepatitis E is similar to that of hepatitis A,\nwith no chronic form of the disease.

The 11\ncases were 10 men and a woman. Their age was 57 plus or minus 11\nyears. One patient died 2 months after the onset of hepatitis. None of\nthe cases traveled abroad during the three months before the disease\nonset. Consumption of pig liver sausage was documented in 6 of 9\npatients that could be interviewed. Noteworthy, anti-HEV IgM could be\ndetected in the serum from the wife of 2 of the cases that ate\nuncooked pig liver sausage. Both women ate the same sausage as their\nhusbands. In one of the women, ALT level was 165 UI/l; no clinical\nsymptom was noted.\n\nEight of these 11 hepatitis E cases occurred from 24 Feb 2011. From\nthis date, the number of hepatitis E cases diagnosed in our lab\nsignificantly increased. This was detected by EPIMIC, a home-made\nalert and surveillance epidemiologic tool that analyses in real-time\nthe number of clinical samples and positive diagnosis in our\nmicrobiology lab. The alert threshold is the mean value of historical\ndata plus 2 standard deviations (SD). Starting from 24 Feb 2011, the\nnumber of serum samples tested and of those testing positive for\nanti-HEV IgM were above the threshold. Indeed, 54 sera were tested\n(mean value, 22; 2 SD, 30), and at least 5 of them tested positive for\nanti-HEV IgM (Adaltis assay) (mean value, 1; 2 SD, 3). Concurrently,\nthe number of PCR-documented hepatitis E was between 1 and 3 per week,\nwhereas the mean value is 0.4 based on historical data.\n\nIn developed industrialized countries, it was thought until recently\nthat hepatitis E was related to travel in tropical or sub-tropical\ncountries, where HEV infection is hyper-endemic. Nevertheless, it\nturns out that most cases are autochthonous, occurring in patients who\nhave not traveled abroad over the last 2-9 weeks (incubation period of\nthe disease). In France, more than 200 indigenous cases are reported\neach year. Most of them were diagnosed in the southern region, where\nthe prevalence of anti-HEV IgG in blood donors is higher than in the\nNorth (8-16.6 percent versus 3.4 percent).\n\nIt has been clearly shown in developed industrialized countries that\npigs (and boars) are reservoirs of the virus. Acute hepatitis E has\nbeen diagnosed in our lab in persons who consumed uncooked pig liver\nsausages, which are widely eaten in southeastern France. These\nsausages are good candidates for the transmission of hepatitis E\nbecause they are made with pig liver (the site of viral\nmultiplication), are not cooked during the manufacturing process, and\nare often eaten uncooked. We reported in 2009 on 8 hepatitis E among\npatients who ate pig liver sausage [see: ProMED-mail post archived as:\nHepatitis E - France: (Marseille) pig liver sausage 20090917.3267]. A\ncase-control study conducted in 3 different families revealed that\nacute or recent hepatitis E were significantly associated with\nconsumption of uncooked pig liver sausage. In addition, genetic links\nwere found between viral sequences recovered from sausages and those\nrecovered from patients.\n\nSubsequently to the notification of these cases, French health\nauthorities compelled producers of pig liver sausages to indicate on\nthe label of the products that they need to be cooked thoroughly.\nIndeed, it was shown that cooking pieces of liver containing HEV\nlimits their infectivity.\n\nThe mortality of symptomatic cases of hepatitis E is 1 to 4 percent;\nfatal outcome occurs mostly among people who already have chronic\nliver disease. Moreover, it appears that the infection can progress\ntowards chronic hepatitis among severely immunocompromized persons, as\nobserved in kidney or liver transplant recipients and in persons\ninfected with HIV.

Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV),\na non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. HEV is\ntransmitted via the faecal-oral route.\n\n'Hepatitis E has been considered a waterborne disease, and\ncontaminated water or food supplies have been implicated in major\noutbreaks. Consumption of faecally contaminated drinking water has\ngiven rise to epidemics, and the ingestion of raw or uncooked\nshellfish has been the source of sporadic cases in endemic areas.\nThere is a possibility of zoonotic spread of the virus, since several\nnon-human primates, pigs, cows, sheep, goats and rodents are\nsusceptible to infection. The risk factors for HEV infection are\nrelated poor sanitation in large areas of the world, and HEV shedding\nin faeces. Person-to-person transmission is uncommon. There has been\nno evidence for sexual transmission or for transmission by\ntransfusion. The highest rates of infection occur in regions where low\nstandards of sanitation promote the transmission of the virus.\nEpidemics of hepatitis E have been reported in Central and South-East\nAsia, North and West Africa, and in Mexico, especially where faecal\ncontamination of drinking water is common. However, sporadic cases of\nhepatitis E have also been reported elsewhere and serological surveys\nsuggest a global distribution of strains of hepatitis E of low\npathogenicity. In general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral\ninfection followed by recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding\nare unusual and chronic infection does not occur.\n\n'The incubation period following exposure to HEV ranges from 3 to 8\nweeks, with a mean of 40 days. The period of communicability is\nunknown. There are no chronic infections reported.\n\n'Hepatitis E virus causes acute sporadic and epidemic viral\nhepatitis. Symptomatic HEV infection is most common in young adults\naged 15-40 years. Although HEV infection is frequent in children, it\nis mostly asymptomatic or causes a very mild illness without jaundice\n(anicteric) that goes undiagnosed.\n\n'Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include jaundice (yellow\ndiscoloration of the skin and sclera of the eyes, dark urine and pale\nstools), anorexia (loss of appetite), an enlarged, tender liver\n(hepatomegaly), abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and vomiting,\nand fever, although the disease may range in severity from subclinical\nto fulminant.\n\n'Since cases of hepatitis E are not clinically distinguishable from\nother types of acute viral hepatitis, diagnosis is made by blood tests\nwhich detect elevated antibody levels of specific antibodies to\nhepatitis E in the body or by or by reverse transcriptase polymerase\nchain reaction (RT-PCR).

The following 2 comments make it clear that\nthis information is incorrect. - Mod.CP]\n\n******\n[1]\nDate: Wed 27 Oct 2010\nFrom: Gregor Caspari <g.caspari@ladr.de>\n\n\nThere are several genotypes of hepatitis E virus [HEV]. Genotype 1\nand 2 infect humans, genotype 3 mainly swine. Infection with genotype\n3 among swine is worldwide, independent of prevalence of hepatitis E\nvirus infection in humans in the respective region. Transmission\nbetween swine is likely to be faecal-oral. Uninfected swine are\ninfected in the presence of infected swine within weeks. Prevalence\ndepends upon the region of the world and upon the age of swine.\nAntibody prevalence at the age of 4 months is 50 to 90 percent. RNA\nprevalence in serum and faeces is between 5 and 55 percent and is\nhighest at the age of 2 to 4 months.\n\nThis genotype 3 is the one which is found in so-called autochthonous\ntransmissions. How the virus is transmitted from swine to humans is\nnot clear. In France, a surgeon was infected who trained his surgical\ntechnique on swine (Colson et al. 2007). Some Japanese publications\nreported transmission by uncooked or undercooked liver or meat from\nswine, boar or venison (Matsuda et al. 2003, Tei et al. 2003, Yazaki\net al. 2003, Tamada et al. 2004, Masuda et al. 2005). Infection was\nconfirmed epidemiologically by disease of persons who ate or by\ndemonstration of virus in the meat not eaten (Tei et al. 2003, Li et\nal. 2005). Yazaki et al. (2003) found HEV RNA in 7 of 363 swine\nlivers bought in grocery stores, Feagins et al. 2007 in 14 of 127\nlivers bought in the US. Two out of 3 of these RNA positive livers\nwere infectious when fed to naive swine. Recently, an epidemic in\nItaly was published apparently caused by locally produced sausages.\n\nAs there is a viraemic phase in hepatitis E virus infection, the\nvirus may be transmitted by blood. There are at least 6 documented\ntransmissions by blood transfusion; there are, furthermore,\ndocumented transmissions by transplantation. The risk for plasma\nproducts is unclear as there is no reason to assume that the virus is\ninactivated by one of the current virus inactivation methods, i.e.\nthe solvent detergent procedure (the method acts on the virus\nenvelope, and hepatitis E virus is not enveloped).\n\nMost infections may go unnoticed because either HEV infection is not\nsuspected and not tested for and/or genotype 3 may cause a milder\nform of disease in humans. Seroprevalence studies with more recent\ntests show a seroprevalence around 10 percent and more.\n\n--\nPriv.-Doz. Dr. med. habil.

Epub 2010 May 25.\n\nAbstract: Hepatitis E is an infectious disease caused by the\nhepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is mainly a self-limiting\ntravel-associated disease without chronic evolution. In recent years,\nan increasing number of autochthonous HEV-infections has been\ndescribed in industrialized countries. HEV-infections frequently take\na mild clinical silent course of disease in immunocompetent\nindividuals, and thus HEV infection is largely under-diagnosed.\nTherefore, the anti-HEV-prevalence is much higher than anticipated\nwith 2-20 percent in Western Europe.\n\nHEV genotype 3 infections must be considered as zoonotic infections,\nwith several animals, including swine, serving as reservoirs. Cases\nof HEV-transmissions by blood transfusion were described not only in\nAsia but also in France and the UK. HEV-infections may take severe\ncourses in pregnant women and patients with chronic liver diseases,\nsometimes leading to acute liver failure. In addition, several\ncentres described cases of progressive chronic HEV-infection in organ\ntransplant recipients and HIV-positive patients during the last 2\nyears.

Infection was\nconfirmed epidemiologically by disease of persons who ate or by\ndemonstration of virus in the meat not eaten (Tei et al. \n\nMost infections may go unnoticed because either HEV infection is not\nsuspected and not tested for and/or genotype 3 may cause a milder\nform of disease in humans.

RNA\nprevalence in serum and faeces is between 5 and 55 percent and is\nhighest at the age of 2 to 4 months. There are at least 6 documented\ntransmissions by blood transfusion; there are, furthermore,\ndocumented transmissions by transplantation. HEV-infections may take severe\ncourses in pregnant women and patients with chronic liver diseases,\nsometimes leading to acute liver failure.

He said: 'Not only had the patients not\ntravelled abroad but they didn't fit the normal age range for the\nvirus. 'In other parts of the world it usually affects the young.\nHowever in the cases being seen in the UK, it is the middle aged and\nelderly, particularly men.' He believes that the main cause is\ncontact with raw pork and is now researching the link.\n\nPatients with liver problems admitted to hospital will be checked to\nsee if the problems had been caused by hepatitis E [virus infection].\nHowever a spokesman for the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said: 'The\nSouth West Peninsula HPA previously worked with Dr Harry Dalton,\nRoyal Cornwall Hospital Trust to investigate a number of hepatitis E\ncases from Dec 2009 to March 2010 in the Cornwall area. The team\nconcluded that there was no epidemiological link between the cases or\nan associated link with eating or handling pork. Although we are\naware of a number of hepatitis E cases in the UK the majority are\nacquired outside the UK or related to travel to endemic countries.'\nIt is acknowledged that pigs and pork can harbour [hepatitis E virus]\nand that this may be the cause of the disease in cases where there\nhas not been any foreign travel, according to the HPA website.\n\nDr Dalton said those with existing liver conditions are most at risk\nand advised people to take care when preparing pork. He added: 'The\nmessage is not to not eat pork, but to simply make sure it is cooked\nproperly and that hands are washed thoroughly after handling it raw.'\nDr Dalton believes hepatitis E could be affecting as many as 1200\npeople in the UK every year. He said: 'Victims become jaundiced and\nthis has resulted in patients being misdiagnosed as suffering [from]\nalcohol abuse.\n\nDr Dalton said there have been 3 deaths related to hepatitis E\ninfection over the last 7 years and around 60 cases of hepatitis E in\nCornwall and Devon between 1999-2010, the vast majority of whom have\nbeen seen since 2005. One victim of the disease, a 59-year-old man,\ncontracted hepatitis E and died in July 2006. His 63-year-old wife,\nfrom Newquay in Cornwall, said he started feeling ill while he was\nworking at a factory next door to a pig farm. Medics have told the\nfamily it is unclear whether he caught the virus because of exposure\nto the pig farm or through consuming infected pork.\n\nThe HPA website said there were 178 cases of hepatitis E in Britain\nin 2008 and 179 in 2009. Most people clear the infection without\ntreatment, however people with weakened immune systems or liver\ndisease may need closer observation, it said. There is no vaccine\nagainst hepatitis E [virus infection]. In 2008, 4 people in Britain\nfell ill with the virus after a world cruise. Infected shellfish were\nfound to be the cause.\n\n--\nCommunicated by a correspondent\nwho has requested anonymity\n\n[Hepatitis E was not recognized as a distinct human disease until\n1980. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus\n(HEV), a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.\nAlthough man is considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to\nHEV or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and\nseveral other animal species.\n\nHEV is transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis E is a mostly\na waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have\nbeen implicated in major outbreaks. Consumption of faecally\ncontaminated drinking water has given rise to epidemics, and the\ningestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has been the source of\nsporadic cases in endemic areas. There is a possibility of zoonotic\nspread of the virus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows,\nsheep, goats and rodents are susceptible to infection.\nPerson-to-person transmission is uncommon. There is no evidence for\nsexual transmission or for transmission by transfusion. The highest\nrates of infection occur in regions where low standards of\nsanitation. However, sporadic cases of hepatitis E have also been\nreported elsewhere.\n\nIn general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed\nby recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and\nchronic infection does not occur. Occasionally, a fulminant form of\nhepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates\nranging between 0.5 - 4.0 percent. The incubation period following\nexposure to HEV ranges from 3 to 8 weeks, with a mean of 40 days. The\nperiod of communicability is unknown. There are no chronic infections\nreported. Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include jaundice\n(yellow discoloration of the skin and sclera of the eyes, dark urine\nand pale stools), anorexia (loss of appetite), an enlarged, tender\nliver (hepatomegaly), abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and\nvomiting, and fever, although the disease may range in severity from\nsubclinical to fulminant.\n\nIt has recently been shown that HEV is present in both domestic pigs\nand wild boar in various parts of Europe and the high genetic\nsimilarity between HEV isolates from pigs and humans confirm previous\ninferences of possible zoonotic transmission of HEV.\n\nSee also: 'Detection and characterization of infectious Hepatitis E\nvirus from commercial pig livers sold in local grocery stores in the\nUSA'.

One of the cases was a 21-year-old woman who died during a\nliver transplant, the other a 44-year-old nurse's aide who suffered\nsome liver damage from the disease, the newspaper said.\n\n'We couldn't figure out how they acquired it,' Roger Sanchez, senior\nepidemiologist with Metro Health, said at a public health meeting in\nAustin recently. '[Neither] of them had any (foreign) travel history.\nThey were previously healthy. Which begs the question -- how did they\nget it?' Hepatitis E is usually spread through contaminated food or water.\n\nSerious outbreaks of hepatitis E have taken place in Mexico, Asia,\nand Africa. Some US researchers say hepatitis E is more common in the\nUnited States than previously thought. What remains a mystery, they\nsay, is why some people get sick from the virus but most don't. 'It\nappears to be a relatively common infection. But clinical symptoms\nfollowing infection appear to be quite rare,' Mark Kuniholm, an\nepidemiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E was not recognized as a distinct human disease until\n1980. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus\n(HEV), a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.\nAlthough man is considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to\nHEV or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and\nseveral other animal species.\n\nHEV is transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis E is a\nwaterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have been\nimplicated in major outbreaks. Consumption of faecally contaminated\ndrinking water has given rise to epidemics, and the ingestion of raw\nor uncooked shellfish has been the source of sporadic cases in\nendemic areas. There is a possibility of zoonotic spread of the\nvirus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows, sheep, goats,\nand rodents are susceptible to infection. The risk factors for HEV\ninfection are related to poor sanitation in large areas of the world,\nand HEV shedding in faeces. Person-to-person transmission is\nuncommon. There is no evidence for sexual transmission or for\ntransmission by transfusion.\n\nThe highest rates of infection occur in regions where low standards\nof sanitation promote the transmission of the virus. Epidemics of\nhepatitis E have been reported in Central and South-East Asia, North\nand West Africa, and in Mexico, especially where faecal contamination\nof drinking water is common. However, sporadic cases of hepatitis E\nhave also been reported elsewhere and serological surveys suggest a\nglobal distribution of strains of hepatitis E of low pathogenicity.\n\nFurther information can be obtained from the WHO fact sheet on hepatitis E at\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html>.\n\nIn general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed\nby recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and\nchronic infection does not occur. Occasionally, a fulminant form of\nhepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates\nranging between 0.5 percent-4.0 percent.

Reports at the hospital confirm that 28\npeople who have been admitted to the health unit, have been tested and\ndiscovered to have hepatitis E.\n\nThe nurses at the hospital, who preferred anonymity, said that 8 cases had\nfirst been registered but the numbers have since increased to 28. District\nleaders and health workers in Kaabong managed to fight diseases with good\nhygiene and sanitation unlike in Moroto where people are not using\npit-latrines, including market vendors who use a seasonal river, Nangololo\nin Moroto Municipality to ease themselves. Mr Eyura also attributed the\nsurge in hepatitis E cases to poor sanitation. 'The district health team is\nmoving door to door, surveilling and sensitising locals about the disease\nto help bring down the number of victims.\n\n'Hepatitis E is a viral disease that affects the liver and if it is not\ntreated well, it kills very fast,' he said, adding that most patients are\ncomplaining of headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite,\nabdominal pain, diarrhoea, jaundice, heartburn, dark urine, and pain, which\nare all symptoms of the disease.

Drinking faecally contaminated water has\ngiven rise to epidemics, and consumption of raw or half-cooked shellfish\nhas been the source of sporadic cases in endemic areas.\n\nMr Eyuru maintains that people most at risk of the disease are 15-40 year\nolds, including pregnant women and people living with HIV/AIDS. He adds\nthat the disease can be prevented if everyone disposes of their waste\nproperly, and appeals to local district leaders to play their role in\nhelping the health teams ensure that people are sensitised about the\ndisease to avoid further spread.\n\nThe deputy resident district commissioner, Mr Bob Opio, also urged the\nresidents to make use of pit latrines and observe hygiene and sanitation to\nsave their lives.

'We\nhave been hit by an increasing number of patients and deaths in the\ndistrict,' he said.\n\nHepatitis E is a viral infection that is transmitted through drinking\nwater or eating contaminated food. The virus is found in the stool of\ninfected persons or animals.\n\nIn 2007, there was an outbreak of hepatitis E in northern Uganda,\nkilling 169 people and infecting over 10 000. In Karamoja, the\ndisease was first diagnosed in Kaabong district in August 2009 with a\nfew cases in the town. However, the last few weeks have seen a\nspillover to neighbouring sub-counties due to poor sanitation. 'The\nmost affected sub-counties are Kaabong rural and Sidok, where the\nhealth authorities are registering at least 4 cases daily. Some are\ntreated and discharged,' said Lochiyo. He attributed the spread of\nthe disease to the local cultural belief, which discourages latrine usage.\n\n'The Karimojong [an ethnic group of agro-pastoral herders living\nmainly in the north-east of Uganda] defecate in river beds that are\nalso places where they scoop water to drink or for domestic use,' he\nsaid. The health officer noted that latrine coverage in Kaabong\ndistrict stands at only 2 percent. He urged residents to construct\nlatrines and use them since the disease is spread through contact\nwith feacal matter. Lochiyo advised people in the affected areas to\nboil water for drinking, wash their hands with soap after using the\ntoilet and remove children's faeces from homes.\n\n'The source of the disease is Sudan where there are no interventions\nto contain its spread,' Peter Opika Opoka, the Uganda Red Cross\ncoordinator in Kitgum, said recently.

Most\nwere reported in the village health centres of Lukung, Amida, Padibe,\nLayamu, and Kitgum town, according to Sylvester Opira, chairman of\nthe hepatitis E control taskforce in Kitgum.\n\n'New cases of infection are being received at health centres, with\nwomen and children ranking high,' Opira told IRIN in Kitgum. Poor\nsanitation in areas of return for IDPs and the rains had contributed\nto the spread of the disease. Few people, Opira said, had latrines in\ntheir homes while some were drinking water from unprotected sources,\nwhich could be contaminated. 'People with no latrines in their homes\nwill be arrested and forced to sink latrines,' he added.\n\nUp to 156 people have so far died of hepatitis E in Kitgum since 2007\nwhen the disease was first reported. Another 9912 people have been\ninfected. Tony Toolit, the Kitgum district secretary for health, told\nIRIN the main problem was lack of clean water for people returning to\nvillages. 'In some places, people are drinking water from ponds and\nstreams, [thus] spreading the infection,' he said. Toolit said safe\nwater and latrine coverage in Kitgum was only about 40 percent. There\nwas, therefore, a need to scale up prevention messages, provide clean\nwater and assist IDPs with latrine construction materials.\n\nHepatitis E is a viral disease spread [via] the faecal-oral route.\nOutbreaks tend to be linked to contaminated water or food supplies.\nMortality rates are generally low, ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 percent.\nBut among pregnant women in their 3rd trimester this rate can rise to\n20 percent.\n\nSee also: Hepatitis E outbreak on the rise in Kitgum at\n<http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=78844>.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Hepatitis E was not recognized as a distinct human disease until\n1980. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus, a\nnon-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Although\nman is considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to HEV or\nclosely related viruses have been detected in primates and several\nother animal species. Hepatitis E virus is transmitted via the\nfaecal-oral route. Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease, and\ncontaminated water or food supplies have been implicated in major\noutbreaks. There is a possibility also of zoonotic spread of the\nvirus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows, sheep, goats,\nand rodents are susceptible to infection. The risk factors for\nhepatitis E virus infection are related to poor sanitation in large\nareas of the world, and shedding of the virus in faeces.\nPerson-to-person transmission is uncommon. There is no evidence for\nsexual transmission or for transmission by transfusion. The highest\nrates of infection occur in regions where low standards of sanitation\npromote the transmission of the virus. However, sporadic cases of\nhepatitis E have also been reported elsewhere and serological surveys\nsuggest a global distribution of strains of hepatitis E of low\npathogenicity.

But as the\npublic waits for results, reports of this new attack bring into question\nsafety and measures instituted to prevent another possible epidemic,\nconsidering that since hepatitis E was first reported in Kitgum District in\nOctober last year [2007], it has claimed 150 lives and affected 9000 people.\n\nThe major focus in checking the spread of hepatitis, which according to the\nMinistry of Health originated from South Sudan and found its way to\nnorthern Uganda through the cross-border movements of the residents, lies\nin hygiene. The Ministry says hepatitis E was able to hibernate and develop\nbecause of the despicable sanitary conditions in most displaced people's\nand satellite camps in the north. Disposal of human waste in the open,\ncharacteristic of camps is the perfect breeding ground for this disease,\nnoting that it places water and food at great risk of contamination.\n\nWith high death figures in the past and new cases being reported, one would\nsuppose that all measures are being taken to avoid an escalation of the\nproblem in the north and now the west. But if the word of Dr Dawson\nMbulamberi, the assistant commissioner at the Ministry of Health is\nanything to go by, gloom awaits. He says improving sanitation in camps is a\ntough call, though he quips that the ministry is doing its best to better\nconditions.\n\nThe same view is supported by the Pader [district] deputy RDC [resident\ndistrict commissioner], Mr Charles Kurua, who observes that since residents\ncontinue to live in unhealthy conditions, they continue to be vulnerable to\ndiseases like hepatitis E and cholera. Dr Charles Oyoo, the officer in\ncharge of the Padibe health centre in Kitgum District, says travellers must\nbe checked if the disease is to be contained.\n\nHowever, when hepatitis E was reported in October last year [2007], it did\nnot spread beyond 5 districts in northern Uganda. Dr Oyoo says the\nsituation in Gulu has improved due to the sensitisation of the people.\n'Almost every member of the population has received adequate information\nabout hepatitis E but then the behavioural component is what is very\ndifficult to control. There is continued communal hand washing,[and]\nsharing food remains our biggest challenge,' he said.\n\nInertia or fear to change, Dr Oyoo notes, may jeopardise the quest to check\nspread of hepatitis E, which destroys the liver. 'There are still\nre-infections. This means whichever information they got, they have not put\nit in practice and yet these are adults. Isolation cannot work because by\nthe time the person develops the symptoms, she/he may have interacted many\npeople.' He adds, 'The sanitation standards are still poor. As people\nreturn home, we've emphasised that the 1st thing they should construct are\nlatrines. But that has not been adequately addressed.'\n\nThe private sector and NGOs have also jumped into the fray to help combat\nthe spread of the disease. According to the outgoing Oxfam public health\nmanager, Ms Julie Cailet, the agency has chlorinated more than 200\nboreholes, distributed up to 50 000 jerrycans, and constructed more than\n700 latrines in the north. Oxfam has also gone to 45 schools to preach on\nbehaviour change.\n\nTo ensure that the north is free of this latest hepatitis outbreak, Dr Oyoo\nsays authorities have discouraged storage of drinking water in pots,\nencouraged children to wash their hands after using the latrine, eating hot\nfood, digging soil and covering human waste. Just in case the disease\nreturns, health staffing may be a major undoing. Padibe health centre, for\nexample, which receives about 200 patients daily, has only 14 staff.\n\nActivists may also have to deal with the question of cultural practices.\nPeople have resorted to traditional healers and in some families; they\nprefer to hide patients for fear of stigmatisation. Bundibugyo can learn a\nlesson from northern Uganda, but even then, if the disease spreads,\nquestions still linger whether an epidemic can be contained.\n\n[byline: Edgar R Batte, Eve Mashoo]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These press reports suggest that the hepatitis E outbreak in the displaced\npeople's camps in the north of Uganda has spread to the Bundibugyo District\nfurther south and west.

This, however, is a reduction in the\ninfections from 90 cases reported the previous week. According to the\nMinistry of Health, the disease is receding. The ministry said the\ncumulative number of hepatitis [E] infections now stands at 8617.\n\nOnly one new death was reported in Lokung sub-county in the week,\nwhich brings the cumulative deaths to 127 in 41 weeks. 'On the whole,\nthe trend of the hepatitis E outbreak continues to recede in all the\nsub-counties of Kitgum district,' a statement from the ministry\nstated. Layamo sub-county had 15 of the new cases, while Agoro and\nPadibe reported 10 each. Kitgum Town Council had 6, Mucwini had 5,\nwhile Lagoro and Paloga reported 4 each. Madi Opei, Kitgum Matidi,\nand Namukora reported 2 cases each, while Lokung, Akwang, Omiya\nAnyima, and Amida reported one case each. The statement said Layamo,\nAgoro, Padibe, and Kitgum town council had registered the highest\nnumber of cases.\n\nThe disease, which is spread through consumption of food and fluids\ncontaminated with infected faecal matter, broke out in October last\nyear [2007]. The most affected were people living in camps for the\ninternally displaced and those returning to their villages after the\nLRA [Lord's Resistance Army] insurgency.\n\nThe disease's long incubation period had been responsible for its\nspread, according to the Minister of Health, Dr Stephen Mallinga. He\nsaid recently that the heavy rains in Kitgum had increased\ntransmission of the disease because people returning from camps had\nlimited safe drinking water. The problem was compounded by lack of\npit latrines, with people easing themselves in bushes from where the\nvirus found its way into the water sources. According to Mallinga,\nthere was need for the water ministry to sink more boreholes.

Hepatitis E has been ravaging parts of northern\nUganda since October 2007 and has so far killed 97, while the number\nof those infected has reached 5779, according to the latest update\nreport from the Ministry of Health.\n\nAccording to Health Minister Dr Stephen Mallinga, the majority of\nthose who have died are pregnant women. 'Because women have lower\nimmunity during pregnancy, cases of hepatitis E are severe and cause\nmore death among them,' he said, adding that the problem is\nexacerbated by some cultural beliefs that pregnant women should not\nuse latrines. As a result, most of the women will just dispose of\nfaeces in the open air, which is a good breeding ground for [i.e. the\nspread of] the hepatitis E virus.\n\nUnited Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) Country Representative Mr\nKeith McKenzie said the higher rate of death from hepatitis E among\npregnant women remains of grave concern. He said that most of the\npregnant women who succumb to hepatitis E are in their 3rd trimester;\nthis is usually the last phase of the pregnancy up to the time of\nbirth. 'This is double mortality because not only are the mothers\ndying but their unborn children too. We all need to play an active\nrole to contain the situation,' Mr McKenzie said. According to a\nWorld Health Organisation fact sheet on Hepatitis E\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/>, overall\nmortality rate from hepatitis E ranges between 0.5 to 4 percent, with\nmore cases registered among pregnant women. 'Fulminate hepatitis\noccurs more frequently in pregnancy and regularly induces a mortality\nrate of 20 percent among pregnant women in the 3rd trimester.'\n\nA person infected with hepatitis E develops fever, headache, general\nbody weakness, muscle pains and eventually develops yellow eyes and\npasses urine of a deep yellow colour.\n\nHepatitis E initially struck Kitgum District in October 2007, but has\nsince spread to the districts of Gulu, Pader and Yumbe.\n\nWhile it is not easy to get infected with hepatitis E, the appalling\nhygiene in the affected districts where many people displaced by the\nLord's Resistance Army insurgency live in squalid conditions in camps\nhas fueled the disease's spread. Dr Mallinga said in one camp for\ndisplaced people in Kitgum District, up to 15 000 people were sharing\none latrine of 6 stances. 'The major challenges are inadequate access\nto safe water, unhygienic disposal of faeces, poor personal and\ndomestic hygiene,' Dr Mallinga said, adding that bylaws should be\npassed at the district and subcounty levels to compel households to\ndig pit latrines.\n\nThe situation is made worse by the shortage of health workers,\ninadequate funding and limited participation of local authorities at\nthe grassroots level in enforcement of bylaws and ordinances that\npromote good health and sanitation. As a preventive measure, health\nexperts are urging pregnant women to attend antenatal services so\nthat early diagnosis can be made in case infection occurs.\n\nAn emergency plan to fight the hepatitis E epidemic in northern\nUganda has already been launched, and the Ministry of Health hopes it\nwill help eliminate the virus from the community. The UGX 10 billion\n[USD 6.2 million] will focus on teaching residents about proper\nhygiene, improvement of sanitation through construction of boreholes\nand pit latrines in internally displaced people's camps, and\nmonitoring infected people to ensure they are treated.

Another 6563 remain infected with the\ndeadly viral disease, which broke out in northern Uganda late last\nyear [2007]. Over the last week 9 people have died bringing the death\ntoll to 25 since 17 Jul 2008.\n\nThe WHO, which has been supporting the district's Hepatitis E Task\nForce, in its recent statements, said there is a drastic decline in\nthe infection rate in Kitgum, a report the authorities in the\ndistrict dispute. Authorities there say the district remains the\nworst-hit and the disease, which is spread by poor hygiene, has\nclaimed 50 lives in Madi Opei sub-county, Lamwo County, where the\noutbreak was first reported.\n\nThe director for Clinical Health Services in the Ministry of Health,\nDr Kenya Mugisha said the death toll now stands at 106. 'The cases of\ndeaths and new infections are almost half of what we have been\nregistering in the past and the situation is getting much better\nbecause of increased awareness, distribution of clean containers for\nwater collection and storage and other supplies, construction of more\npit latrines, among other interventions,' he said.\n\nKitgum chairman Komakech John Ogwok told journalists yesterday [12\nAug 2008] that the continued spread of hepatitis has forced the\ncouncil to enact bylaws aimed at controlling the disease. Some of\nthem include banning the use of water pots and drinking kwete, a\nlocal fermented drink believed to be a prime means of transmission.\n\nHepatitis E is an acute viral disease that can cause liver failure.\nThe virus is transmitted to humans through consumption of drink or\nfood contaminated with faecal matter. It can kill within a week if\nnot controlled in time.\n\nThe disease first struck Kitgum in October 2007, but has since spread\nto Gulu, Pader and Yumbe districts. Mr Ogwok, who is also the\nchairperson of the district Hepatitis Task Force, claimed jerricans\nand chlorine provided under the government/WHO emergency programme\nhave not helped to check the spread of the disease. The health\nworker-turned-politician also dismissed claims in the area that the\ndisease can spread through sexual intercourse. 'This disease has\nnothing to do with any one's sexual life,' he said. 'Having sex with\nan infected person does not lead to infection of the other person. It\nis a misconception by many people out there.' He warned that those\nwho resort to local herbs instead of going to health centres for\ntreatment risk succumbing to the disease.\n\nThe Ministry of Health recently allocated 25 million Ugandan\nshillings [approx. USD 15 325] to support sensitisation programmes in\nthe district but the money has not been sent to date, according to\nofficials. Meanwhile, the deputy RDC [resident district\ncommissioner], Mr Sylvester Opira, said efforts were under way to\narrest and prosecute residents who have refused to construct latrines\nin their homes. 'We are pleased that with the district-wide\nmobilisation carried out to fight the disease, a good number of homes\nnow have latrines though a few others are still hesitant to have\nthem. We shall soon start working on them,' said Mr Opira.\n\nAgoro border market, one of the busiest markets at the\nUganda-Southern Sudan border was closed recently due to lack of\nlatrines as a way of combating hepatitis E in the area.\n\n[Byline: James Eriku]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of fatalities has increased from 97 to 106 since 6 Aug\n2008 and the number of surviving cases from 5779 to 6563.

'More\ncases are being received in health units in villages and there is\nneed for urgent attention to check on the disease that is on the\nrise,' he told IRIN. Since 2007, the viral disease has infected up to\n8000 people in neighbouring Kitgum district alone, and killed 129.\nThe disease has since spread to the districts of Pader, Gulu,\nAdjumani, and Amuru.\n\nHepatitis E is transmitted mainly by drinking contaminated water or\neating contaminated food. Charles Kurua, the Pader deputy\ncommissioner, said the majority of those infected in the district\nwere internally displaced persons (IDPs).\n\n'There is need for intervention by local government and health\npartners to curb the spread of the disease,' said Kurua, who is also\na member of the hepatitis E taskforce in the district, adding that\nthe number of those being infected was rising daily. Poor sanitation\nhas contributed to the spread of the disease, with some IDPs lacking\npit latrines and others drinking unsafe water from unprotected\nsources, leaving them prone to infection, Kurua said. 'Our people are\nliving under unhygienic conditions in IDP camps and areas of return\nin villages that leave them more vulnerable to diseases such as\nhepatitis E and cholera,' he said. 'If they [IDPs] keep on staying in\nthe camps, more would die from the diseases.'\n\nThe infected were being treated at Kalongo, the main hospital in the\ndistrict, as well as in health centres in Pader, Acholi Bur, Pajule,\nand Patongo areas. Kurua said the taskforce was being frustrated by a\nlack of adequate resources, making it hard for its members to reach\nall the communities living in Pader. He said efforts were underway to\ndrill boreholes in all resettlement areas to avoid outbreaks of\nsanitation-related diseases.\n\nAlfred Akena, a local leader in Pader, said the situation was\nworrying because in most of the villages IDPs are returning to do not\nhave adequate functional health centres. 'A number of parishes have\nnot been able to get health centres within their reach due to a\ncollaboration gap between the parish development committees and the\ndistrict, this is dangerous when we get outbreak of diseases,' he\nsaid. Moreover, Akena said, people in the neighbouring district of\nKotido also risk infection of hepatitis E following an influx of\nKarimojong people looking for food and water.

A\ncumulative total of 7727 cases and 121 deaths have been registered in\n17 sub counties in Kitgum district since the onset of the epidemic on\n25 Oct 2007. It should, however, be noted that there are deaths and\nhepatitis E cases that are not reported to health centres.\n\nAccording to the Branch Field Coordinator, Kitgum, Mr. Peter Opika\nOpoka, health assistants in all sub counties have been asked to\nfollow up and clarify the case definition. The increase in the number\nof deaths is attributed to late reporting to health facilities and\nconsumption of the local Herbs which add toxic materials to the\nalready infected liver.

He said leaders have to ensure\nthat each household has a pit latrine and that the compounds and\nsurrounding areas are kept clean in accordance with public health regulations.\n\nThe head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Kitgum, Dr Charles\nOkot, said hepatitis E had affected about 68 percent of the\npopulation in Kitgum. He added that the district needed more support\nfrom the government and health agencies in eradicating it. 'The main\nrisk factor is the low latrine coverage in the newly-created IDP\n[internally displaced persons] camps or in the villages to which the\npeople are returning. Most people use the bush and when it rains, the\nwater takes the faeces into water sources and contaminates them,' he explained.\n\nThere is also the problem of inadequate safe drinking water sources\nin the villages, he said, and called for the drilling of more\nboreholes. 'Our population still practices communal hand washing, or\nuse water in the same basin. So if one of them visited the toilet and\nhis or her faeces had hepatitis E [virus], then the others will\ndefinitely get the infection.'\n\nMeanwhile, [reporter] Mary Karugaba [notes] that the Acholi\nParliamentary Group has expressed concern about the rate at which the\ndisease is spreading. They said it has spread to the districts of\nPader, Gulu, and Amuru, covering the entire Acholi region. Addressing\njournalists on Thursday [31 Jul 2008], the group, led by chairperson\nLivingstone Okello Okello, said: 'An average of 112 people share one\nlatrine in the IDP camps, almost 6 times above the standard\nrequirement of 20 people per latrine.'

Over 3082 cases have been registered in the district\nsince October 2007, with 64 deaths,' Kitgum District Health Officer\nAlex Olwedo told IRIN. 'The majority of those getting the infection\nand dying are women who are pregnant and it's really disturbing,' he said.\n\nA report by the Kitgum health directorate said the worst affected\nareas of the district were Madi Opei sub-county, which is the\nepicentre of the disease with 1114 cases, followed by Agoro with 685\ncases, Paloga with 607 cases, Padibe 304 cases, Mucwini 277 cases and\nLokung with 25 cases.

Health minister\nStephen Mallinga told journalists that hepatitis E, which was reported in\nthe 4 parishes of Madi, Opei Sub-county in Kitgum late last year [2007],\nhas now spread to Yumbe District in West Nile and 4 other sub-counties in\nKitgum District.\n\nDr Mallinga was on Friday [9 May 2008] giving an update of the action taken\nby the Ministry of Health to control hepatitis E. 'During the last 2\nmonths, Adravu Sub-county in Yumbe District has also reported cases among\nthe Sudanese refugees, but fortunately, no more cases have been reported in\nthe district,' Dr Mallinga said.\n\nYumbe District health officer Alfred Yayi told Daily Monitor on Friday [10\nMay 2008] that so far 23 cases have been reported in Yumbe out of which 4\ndied. Dr Yayi said all the cases were from a refugee camp where about 10\n000 refugees from South Sudan are living. He said the United Nations high\ncommissioner for refugees in collaboration with the International Committee\nof the Red Cross have started repatriating the refugees. Dr Yayi said so\nfar about 3000 refugees have been repatriated and that the district, the\nMinistry of Health, and other partners are sensitising the residents on\ngood sanitation practices to contain the disease.\n\nSince last October [2007], a viral disease that WHO says has no cure, has\nbeen killing people in near the frontier with Sudan. Dr Mallinga said the\nnumber of hepatitis E cases has increased from 1109 last month [April 2008]\nto 1262 and that 25 people have died. About 81 per cent of the deaths have\noccurred among pregnant women. Pregnant women are at a higher risk of dying\nthan other people because during pregnancy, the blood volume in the body\nincreases by over 40 per cent and weakens the immune system, which makes\nmothers susceptible to any illnesses including minor diseases.\n\nDr Mallinga said the weekly trends indicate that the number of cases\ncontinues to go up due to increased contamination of water during the rainy\nseason. He said during the past week, 156 new cases have been reported, and\none person died.\n\nHepatitis E is a viral disease transmitted through eating or drinking water\nor food contaminated with faeces. Some of its symptoms include fever, dark\nyellow urine, and yellow eyes. The transmission is similar to that of other\ndiarrhoeal diseases such as cholera and dysentery. It is very common in\nareas with low latrine coverage, inadequate safe water, and poor personal\nhygiene. Dr Mallinga said water testing in the affected areas has revealed\nthat 32 per cent of wells are contaminated with human waste. At the\nhousehold level, 75 per cent of the household clay pots used to store and\ncollect water are contaminated. He said communities are being mobilised\nthrough public education meetings, home visits, and radio talk shows among\nothers. More pit latrines and safe water sources have been constructed so\nthat people can stop using contaminated water.\n\nDr Mallinga also said the Health Ministry has remitted an additional\nfunding of UGX 25 million (about USD 15 000) to Kitgum to help the district\ncope with the limited number of staff in health facilities. The Ministry is\nproviding families with jerricans, which cannot easily be contaminated.\nInvestigations done by the Ministry of Health have revealed that\ncommunities using pots to store drinking water are at a higher risk of\ngetting infection.\n\n[byline: Jane Nafula]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is\ntransmitted in much the same way as other enteric viruses.

The appeal was made\nin view of the higher incidence of viral hepatitis E infection\nrecently.\n\nThe Consultant, Community Medicine, of CHP, Dr S K Chuang, said a\ntotal of 45 cases had been reported to CHP so far this year [2008],\nwhile the figure for the same period in 2007 was 25. The figures for\nthe whole year of 2005, 2006, and 2007 were 33, 34, and 64\nrespectively.\n\nThe cases were distributed throughout Hong Kong and involved patients\naged between 16 and 84. So far, the food histories provided by the\npatients have not shown a single common source outbreak related to\nany particular food premises, Dr Chuang said.\n\nDr Chuang said hepatitis E was acquired by ingestion of contaminated\nfood or water and therefore it is preventable by observing good\npersonal and food hygiene. The incubation period ranges from 15 to 64\ndays before onset of symptoms. Hepatitis E is usually more active\nduring the winter and spring seasons.\n\n'Clinical features of acute hepatitis E resemble those of other types\nof viral hepatitis, including anorexia, malaise, fever, and vomiting,\nfollowed by jaundice, passing tea-coloured urine, and hepatomegaly.\nMost of the patients recover in 3 to 6 weeks. However, pregnant\npatients carry a higher risk of severe disease from the infection,'\nDr Chuang said.\n\nTo prevent hepatitis E infection, the public is advised to take the\nfollowing precautions:\n- most important, cook food thoroughly before consumption;\n- avoid raw food or semi-cooked food;\n- purchase fresh food from reliable sources and do not patronise\nillegal hawkers;\n- handle and store raw and cooked food, especially seafood,\nseparately (upper compartment of the refrigerator for cooked food and\nlower compartment for raw food) to avoid cross contamination;\n- store perishable food in the refrigerator, well covered, and keep\nthe temperature of the refrigerator at or below 4 deg C (39 deg F);\n- wash hands properly with soap and water before eating or handling\nfood, and after going to the toilet.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[A recent paper in the April 2008 issue of the Journal of Medical\nVirology (2008; 80(4): 646-58) should be consulted for an up-to-date\naccount of hepatitis E disease.\n\nFrom the Abstract: 'Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the sole member of the\ngenus _Hepevirus_ in the family _Hepeviridae_, has been the major\ncause of several outbreaks of waterborne hepatitis in tropical and\nsubtropical countries and of sporadic cases of viral hepatitis in\nendemic and industrialized countries. Transmission of HEV occurs\npredominantly by the fecal-oral route although parenteral and\nperinatal routes have been implicated. The overall death rate among\nyoung adults and pregnant women is 0.5-3 per cent and 15-20 per cent,\nrespectively.\n\nThere are 4 major genotypes of HEV and a single serotype. At present,\nthere are approximately 1600 sequences of HEV that are already\navailable at INSDC (International Nucleotide Sequence Database\nCollaboration) of both human and animal isolates. Diagnostic and\nmolecular assays have been described for the accurate differentiation\nof ongoing from remote infection of HEV.\n\nIdentification and characterization of swine HEV in China, Japan, the\nUnited States, and many other countries and their close relationship\nto locally characterized human HEV found in the same geographic areas\nprove that HEV is indeed a zoonotic virus and that domestic swine,\nwild deer, and boars are reservoirs of HEV in nature.

A total of 314 cases\nwith 11 deaths have been registered since the epidemic began to\nspread in November 2007 and the outbreak in Madi Opei has shown\nminimal reduction in its trend of progression. About 75 percent of\nthe cases are between the age group of 15 and 44 years. Meanwhile,\nabout 60 percent (186/314) of the cases are females. The risk factors\nresponsible for this continued transmission of HEV have been\ndiscovered to be extremely low latrine coverage, contamination of\nwater at household levels and poor hygiene practices in the affected\nIDP camps.\n\nAccording to findings of a situational analysis carried out in 25\nvillages located in Madi Opei, an average of 112 people share one\nlatrine facility within the IDP camp. This is almost 6 times above\nthe standard requirement of 20 people per latrine facility.\nFurthermore, most villages are lacking latrines and thus the\ncommunities have formed the habits of open defecation. Most of the\navailable latrines are not being maintained, making their use\ndifficult. This also encourages open air defecation.\n\nHygiene practices at household levels such as routine washing hands\nwith soap after visiting the toilet or before meals are hardly\npracticed. Despite the fact that soaps were distributed to the\ncommunity, there are no indications to show that soap was being used\nfor hand washing at all. Water samples (from pots and buckets)\ncollected from households showed heavy presence of coli\nmicro-organisms giving the indication that contamination of water is\ntaking place at household levels, attributed to the use of pots and\npoor personal hygiene practices.\n\nMadi Opei IDP camp has a total of 19 functional boreholes that supply\noptimal amount of water to the community. Bucket chlorination is\nbeing conducted at all water sources in Madi Opei and the\nsurrounding. It was established that there were occasional\ninterruption in the supply of chlorine tablets, resulting into\nerratic discontinuation in chlorination of water at source. This was\nlargely attributed to weak supervisory/oversight role provided to the\nchlorination activity.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV)\nwhich is transmitted in much the same way as other enteric viruses.\nHepatitis E outbreaks have occurred world-wide in recent years (see\nreferences below). The signs and symptoms of HEV infection are loss\nof appetite, nausea, vomiting, discoloured urine, jaundice and\nabdominal pain. However, there is no chronic (long-term) infection.\nHepatitis E is more severe among pregnant women, especially in the\n3rd trimester. HEV is found in the feces of persons and animals with\nhepatitis E. HEV is spread by eating or drinking contaminated food or\nwater.

The near\nuniversal prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus (HAV) by the age of\n5-10 in endemic areas (1) argues strongly against HAV as the cause of large\nepidemics of hepatitis amongst adults in these regions.\nIn 1980, it was shown that HAV was not the cause of a large outbreak of\nwater-born hepatitis in Kashmir (2,3) resulting in 52 000 hepatitis cases\nand 1560 deaths.\nIn 1993, Arankalle and colleagues (4) reported the results of a\nretrospective seroepidemiologic study of 17 epidemics of water-born\nhepatitis, none of which were caused by HAV.\nIn 16 (94 per cent) of these epidemics, evidence of recent hepatitis E\nvirus (HEV) infection was found in 60-100 per cent of patients studied,\nincluding in the large epidemic in Delhi in 1955 involving 29 000 patients\nwith hepatitis, in which all of the 28 archived serum samples were positive\nfor anti-HEV IgM.\nThus, it is indeed likely that many outbreaks of epidemic hepatitis\npreviously ascribed to HAV were in fact caused by HEV (1). With respect to\nthe post preceding Dr McNair Scott's question, we have previously looked at\nHEV infection in Victoria, Australia (5,6).

Now Europeans are also contracting the disease here,\nsay scientists today [Mon 3 Sep 2007] at the Society for General\nMicrobiology's 161st meeting at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\nHepatitis E virus is one of the few viruses which has been shown to be\ntransmitted directly from animals through food. It was recently thought to\nbe confined to developing countries, and although scientists are still\nunsure exactly how it spreads to people, direct contact with pigs or eating\ncontaminated pork products is a likely route.\n'If this proves to be a relevant route for pig to human infection for\nhepatitis E in Europe, food safety regulations might need to be adapted\naccordingly,' says Dutch researcher Erwin Duizer. 'Where we do find\nhepatitis E virus identified in Europe, then the strain is usually closely\nrelated to the viruses found in pigs in the same country.'\nFar fewer cases of hepatitis E virus are reported than actually occur,\nsince doctors currently rarely ask for the relevant diagnostic tests in\nmany industrialized countries. Although they do not yet know the exact\nroute for most infections, the scientists do know that these viruses can\ninfect people if they eat infected pig's livers without cooking them.\nGenetic material from hepatitis E viruses has already been detected in pig\nlivers being offered for sale in Japan, USA and the Netherlands, proving\nthat European pigs are in contact with hepatitis E. Wild boar products\ncould present a similar risk.\n'To improve understanding of this disease, doctors should routinely start\nasking for hepatitis E screening tests, even if the patient has not been\ntravelling in India, China or other countries where they might expect to be\nat risk of infection,' says Erwin Duizer. 'Once more people are correctly\ndiagnosed with viral hepatitis E, they can be treated more effectively, and\nwe can learn more on the transmission routes. Current rates of diagnosis\nare up to 13 per cent of acute viral hepatitis patients in European\ncountries, but we think the true rate is much higher. Up to 3 per cent of\nblood donors in Europe show evidence of exposure to the virus through\ndetectable antibodies. We also need to quickly work out the local route of\ninfection in Europeans, as [in] knowing if hepatitis E is directly caused\nby eating pork meat or liver or caused by foods or people being in contact\nwith pig faeces, [which] will make it possible to implement effective\npreventive measures,' says Erwin Duizer.\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promedmail@promedmail.org>\n[Some time ago, Dr Robert McNair Scott <scottrmcn@cs.net> wrote to\nProMED-mail asking a question, which this Moderator failed to answer for\nwant of appropriate information.

Are these seat of the pants diagnoses?

Even in countries like\nBritain, whose sanitary infrastructure should be good, there are those who\nare now saying that HEV is the most common cause of viral hepatitis in that\ncountry.

There were a\nnumber of ports of call including: Madeira, Barbados, Acapulco, San\nFrancisco, Pago Pago (American Samoa), Nuku'Alofa (Tonga), Auckland, Sydney\nand Hong Kong.\n\nThe passenger capacity of the cruise ship is 1800 with 900 staff but, as\npeople joined and left the cruise at different points during the journey,\nthe cumulative number of passengers on board at some point during the\ncruise was 3000. Passengers were mainly from the UK but also included\nnationals from the USA, Australia, South Africa, Denmark, and Ireland.\n\nThe Health Protection Agency (HPA) has been working closely with the cruise\nship operator and port health authority to assist with investigations and\nensure all passengers receive appropriate information. The cruise company\nhas sent letters and a factsheet on hepatitis E to all passengers to inform\nthem and to advise that they seek medical advice should they develop\nsymptoms compatible with hepatitis E. They are also being asked to contact\nthe HPA directly so that linked cases might be identified.\n\nHepatitis E is a viral infection that usually produces mild disease with\nsymptoms of jaundice, dark urine and pale stools with or without nausea,\nloss of appetite and/or abdominal pain [1]. In rare cases it can prove\nfatal, particularly in pregnant women. Hepatitis E is endemic in many\ncountries in Asia, Africa and Central America. It is a relatively uncommon\ncause of hepatitis in the United Kingdom; 292 cases were reported in 2006\nand most of these were associated with travel.\n\nDirect person-to-person spread of hepatitis E is uncommon. Exposure usually\narises from contaminated food or water and can be prevented through good\nhygiene, for example:\n- drinking bottled water only if it is from a known safe supply and the\nbottle is unopened.\n- not using ice or eating anything with ice, unless the ice is made from\nsafe bottled water.\n- not eating uncooked fruits or vegetables unless peeled and washed in safe\nwater.\n- not eating foods or beverages from street vendors.\n\nThe HPA asks health professionals to ensure that any patients with symptoms\ncompatible with hepatitis E are tested.

In young piglets, up to\n6-weeks old, 36.2 percent proved to be infected. In older piglets,\nthe infection ratio was even higher.

Vital medical supplies have to\nbe floated across the wadi on rafts.\n\nEven though the hepatitis outbreak is slowing down there, more than 50\npeople in this area near the town of Goz Beida have already lost their\nlives. Doctor Camilo Kuan, who has been treating hepatitis patients at the\nvillage clinic, says there still are not enough medical facilities in this\nremote corner of Chad. 'The medical centre in Kerfi is the only one for 50\nkilometres and people can't reach it,' Dr Kuan says. 'There aren't any\nboats, there aren't horses which can cross the wadis -- people have to\nswim. So if people are ill they stay at home.'\n\nHepatitis E may not be a headline-grabbing disease like Ebola or HIV/AIDS,\nbut it can still be deadly. There is no vaccine for the disease, and there\nis also no cure.\n\nSouleymane Diabate of UNICEF says that one of the most frustrating aspects\nof the disease is how simple it is to prevent - clean drinking water and\ngood hygiene practices are all that are needed. 'It's mainly due to the\nfact that most of the localities around Goz Beida don't have drinking\nwater, the sanitation is really poor and the practice of hygiene also\ndoesn't exist,' she says. 'So most of the people are going to the river to\nfetch water for consumption. So, most of the population suffer from this\ndisease.'\n\nAs [this reporter] learnt from the medical staff here [the village of Goz\nBeida], 15 other villages are also suffering from the outbreak of hepatitis\nE.

A WHO\nepidemiologist, Dr Jean Robert Likofata, said on Tuesday [17 Oct 2006] in\nthe capital, Kinshasa, that 4 health zones around the town of Gemena in\nEquateur were threatened by the disease, which has an incubation period of\nbetween 3 and 8 weeks. He said the whole province was threatened by this\nepidemic because Gemena was an 'epicentre', as it is a market town,\nfacilitating contact with almost the whole population in the area.\nMoreover, Likofata said cases of hepatitis E had been recorded up to 65 km\nsouthwest in the health zone of Bwamanda; 105 km west in the Tandaba zone\nand at least 44 km northwest in the health zones of Bogose and Nubea. 'This\ndisease is transmitted through contaminated water, especially when hygiene\nis not good when it comes to the washing of hands,' Likofata said. 'And at\nthis market, which dominates Gemena town, you have businessmen coming from\nall around the province.'\nLikofata led a medical team to Gemena when the first cases were reported in\nJuly 2006, to inspect samples that were later sent to a laboratory in\nKinshasa. Initially, Likofata said, the outbreak was suspected to be yellow\nfever until the laboratory results confirmed it was hepatitis E. He said\nthose affected initially exhibit flu-like symptoms, with high fever, nausea\nand loss of appetite, which could last a week. The next phase is yellowing\neyes, pale faeces and dark urine consistent with liver disease. There is no\neffective treatment aside from bed-rest and fluid replacement, so\nprevention is key.\nBesides sharing information about the disease's symptoms with staff in the\nmain health centres in Equateur, the medical team also conducted awareness\ncampaigns to inform the public about the importance of hygiene in the\nprevention of hepatitis E.\n--\nBrent Barrett\n<salbrent@sbcglobal.net>\n[Hepatitis E virus, has caused large epidemics of enterically transmitted\nself-limiting acute viral hepatitis throughout the Indian subcontinent,\nsoutheast and central Asia, the Middle East, parts of Africa, and Mexico.\nSeroprevalence surveys indicate that the virus is prevalent elsewhere\nsuggesting the existence of strains of differing virulence.\nHepatitis E is a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality and poses a\nmajor health problem in endemic regions. Hepatitis E epidemics are\nwaterborne outbreaks. During these outbreaks, overall attack rates range\nfrom 1 to 15 percent, being higher among adults (3 to 30 percent) than\namong children (0.2 to 10 percent). The outbreaks are characterized by a\nparticularly high attack rate and mortality among pregnant women. In\nnon-endemic regions, hepatitis E accounts for less than 1 percent of\nreported cases of acute viral hepatitis.\nThe clinical disease in humans is typical of viral hepatitis. The liver\nappears to be the only target organ of infection, and its extrahepatic\nmanifestations have been rare. The incubation period ranges from 15 to 50\ndays. The preicteric phase lasts for 1-10 (average 3-4) days, and\ngastrointestinal symptoms, such as epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting,\nare frequently reported. The icteric phase begins abruptly, with the\nappearance of jaundice, dark urine and clay-coloured stools. In\nuncomplicated cases these symptoms last 12-15 days, and complete recovery\nusually takes place within 1 month. About half the patients develop fever\nand 2/3 complain of arthralgia.\nClinical studies have shown that elevation of serum alanine\naminotransferase levels occur as a single peak preceding or coinciding with\nthe onset of jaundice, which is similar to most other forms of viral\nhepatitis. In disease-endemic regions, this infection constitutes an\nimportant cause of fulminant hepatic damage. Pregnant women, particularly\nthose in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, are more frequently affected during\nhepatitis E outbreaks and have a worse outcome. Mortality rates among\npregnant women, especially those infected in the 3rd trimester, range\nbetween 5 and 25 percent. Frequency of abortions, stillbirths and neonatal\ndeaths is also increased among hepatitis E virus-infected pregnant women.\nControl of hepatitis E outbreaks consists predominantly of measures to\ninterrupt water-borne transmission of disease and appropriate education of\nthe population at risk.\nA map of the Democratic Republic of Congo showing the location of Gemena in\nthe north of Equateur Provincec an be accessed via\n<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/english/htmain.htm>. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Besides sharing information about the disease's symptoms with staff in the\nmain health centres in Equateur, the medical team also conducted awareness\ncampaigns to inform the public about the importance of hygiene in the\nprevention of hepatitis E.\n-- A WHO\nepidemiologist, Dr Jean Robert Likofata, said on Tuesday [17 Oct 2006] in\nthe capital, Kinshasa, that 4 health zones around the town of Gemena in\nEquateur were threatened by the disease, which has an incubation period of\nbetween 3 and 8 weeks.

Based on the Food Sanitation Law, the Ministry and the Hokkaido\nPrefectural Government started examining the health of other patrons\nof the barbecue restaurant and checking its remaining stocks of meat.\nAccording to health officials, the 6 were related and went to the\nrestaurant with 7 other relatives in mid-August 2004. There, they\nreportedly ate pork liver and other organs, in addition to beef and\nchicken. Among them, a man in his 60s developed symptoms of fulminant\nhepatitis and was hospitalized in late September [2004]. Hepatitis E\nvirus was detected in his blood, and the man died several days later.\nSince recipients of the blood donated by his son were later found to\nbe infected with the virus, the Ministry and blood experts decided to\ntest the blood of the surviving 12 relatives. [Subsequently], they\ndetected hepatitis E virus [nucleic acid] in the son's blood and\nantibody against the virus -- proof of infection -- in his and 5\nother relatives' blood, said the officials.\nSince the disease has a latent period of about 6 weeks on average, it\nis normally difficult to determine which food is the source of\ncontagion. However, as a result of thorough interviews, the Ministry\nand [other specialists] found that most of the 6 people [who\ncontracted] hepatitis E ate both barbecued pork liver and organs. The\n7 others [who did not contract hepatitis E] did not eat both of them,\naccording to health officials.\nSince the meal at the barbecue restaurant was the only time the 13\nrelatives had eaten together in the relevant time frame, the Ministry\nconcluded that one of the pork dishes, most probably the liver, was\nthe source of infection. At this restaurant, patrons are [expected]\nto barbecue meat themselves, said officials of the Ministry and the\nHokkaido Prefectural Government. Many patrons are said to prefer\neating the dish rare.\nThough no other patrons have been reported to be infected yet, their\nhealth, along with that of employees at the restaurant, is being\nmonitored, and sanitation measures at the restaurant are being\nexamined. In past cases, groups of people were reportedly infected\nwith hepatitis E virus [as a result of] eating [improperly cooked]\nwild boar or deer [meat]. However, since hepatitis E virus has also\nbeen detected in ordinary pork liver at meat shops, the Ministry has\nstarted urging the public not to eat pork liver without cooking it\nthoroughly. 'It is important to realize the dangers of eating raw\nmeat of not only wild, but also domestic animals,' said a hepatitis E\nspecialist. 'Research has shown that infection is likely to take\nplace only if a food contains a large amount of hepatitis E virus.\nInfection can be prevented if the meat is heated enough.'\nIn developing countries, a major source of hepatitis E virus\ninfection is said to be drinking water. Though in developed countries\na route of infection has not been established, an increasing number\nof experts say infection is caused by eating raw or under-cooked wild\ngame.\nJaundice and other symptoms of the disease develop in 15 to 50 days\nafter infection, but most patients recover naturally without\ndeveloping chronic hepatitis. The mortality rate is said to be one\npercent, but pregnant women have a higher mortality rate, according\nto the experts.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This outbreak of hepatitis E in the Hokkaido Prefecture of Japan\nappears to have been restricted to a single family party at a\nrestaurant where customers barbecued their own meat. No other\ncustomers were affected, but some others contracted infection through\nblood donations from one member of the family party, the son of the\ndeceased (though the precise details of this are obscure). No\ninformation is provided concerning the consequences of this\nblood-borne transmission, and the matter is left hanging in the air.\nFurther information is awaited.\nUnlike previous outbreaks in Japan (see the ProMED-mail posts listed\nbelow), the hepatitis E virus-contaminated meat did not originate\nfrom wild-life but was identified as liver tissue originating from\nfarmed pigs.

The Ministry also is considering\nconducting a nationwide survey on what kinds of animals and how many of\nthem have the virus.\nIn the Hyogo Prefecture case, 3 people in a family and a friend received\nsome venison from an acquaintance in late February 2003 and ate it raw, the\nsources said. All 4, aged between 40 to 69, displayed symptoms of the\ndisease, including high fever, vomiting, and impaired hepatic function in\nApril. They were examined at Kasai Municipal Hospital in Kasai, Hyogo\nPrefecture, and diagnosed as having the virus. The 4 victims recovered from\nthe ill effects of eating the meat without developing chronic hepatitis E\nvirus infection.

Until\nrecently, it had been considered a disease of developing countries with\npoor sanitary conditions, but Mishiro found that it has claimed the lives\nof Japanese people since the 1990s. According to experts, consumers do not\nneed to worry even if meat contains the virus, provided it is fully cooked.\n'The virus is usually killed off by heat, but the risk level of eating the\nmeat of wild animals is totally unknown.

Fortunately,\nleftover meat had been frozen and dated at the time of eating. HEV RNA\nsequences in the meat of one deer and most of the patients' samples were 100\npercent identical.

Hepatitis A infections have been transmitted to\nhumans from non-human primates (1). More than 200 cases of hepatitis\nA virus infection have been transmitted from non-human primates to\nhumans (2), primarily from chimpanzees (_Pan troglodytes_). Other\nnon-human primates, including woolly monkeys, siamangs, Celebes\ncrested apes, and gorillas have transmitted hepatitis A virus to\nhumans.\nNeedless to say, given that chimpanzees have been experimentally\ninfected with hepatitis B and C viruses, there is at least the\ntheoretical possibility that humans could acquire these infections\nfrom infected chimpanzees, but I am unaware of any documented cases\nof transmission to humans.\nReferences:\n-----------\n1.

Of the main\nviral forms of [hepatitis], which inflames the liver, only hepatitis E\nvirus infection can be spread by animals. The Health, Labor and Welfare\nMinistry began researching the number of cases of hepatitis E virus\ninfection and studying the route of infection, after Europe and the United\nStates reported increased [incidence] of the disease in recent years. The 3\npatients who died were diagnosed with hepatitis E virus infection during\nautopsies. Among them was a Hokkaido woman who was diagnosed with acute\nhepatitis 6 days after being admitted to a hospital last year and later\nunderwent a partial liver transplant from a living donor. However, she died\n3 months after the operation.\nA research team led by Shunji Mishiro, director of Toshiba Hospital's\nresearch department, detected hepatitis E virus (HEV) when testing her\nblood after her death. Another research group also found HEV in the serums\nof 2 elderly men of the Tohoku Region who died of acute hepatitis in the 1990s.\nThe cases, the first fatalities confirmed to be caused by hepatitis E virus\nin the nation, were reported to a meeting of experts last month. Mishiro\nand his team also detected HEV in the blood of 7 patients in Tokyo, Saitama\nPrefecture and Hokkaido who had been diagnosed with acute hepatitis between\n1996 and 2002. As none of the 7 had been to places abroad where the disease\nis prevalent, experts said it is likely the virus has taken root in the\ncountry. Cases of people returning from abroad with the illness also have\nbeen confirmed.\nExaminations found 3 [genotypes] of HEV among the 7 people who contracted\nthe virus in Japan, all of which were different from the types of the virus\nfound overseas. Mishiro determined that HEV came to the country through 3\nroutes. HEV, as with hepatitis A virus (HAV), is contained in patients'\nstools, and can be caught through consuming food or water contaminated by\nfeces from an infected person.\nAccording to studies in areas where the virus is rampant, hepatitis virus\ninfection E can become more serious than hepatitis A. The virus is fatal in\n1-2 percent of cases; a death rate 10 times that of hepatitis A. About 20\npercent of pregnant women who contract acute hepatitis E die.\nIn Japan, HEV has not been considered a serious risk because it has been\nassociated with countries with underdeveloped water supplies. In light of\nthis and the fact that HEV testing is not widely available, it is possible\nthat other people infected with the virus have gone undiagnosed. HEV can\n[survive] and grow in the body of animals without causing serious problems\nto its host. Therefore, pigs, goats, and rats are thought to carry the\nvirus in some foreign countries. As the virus can spread if left unchecked,\nthe ministry is trying to determine as soon as possible the number of\nhepatitis E cases among patients infected with unspecified forms of acute\nhepatitis.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[As stated above, Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been associated\nwith developing regions and attributed to oral-fecal transmission due to\ninadequate sanitation. Several recent findings, however, have led to a new\nunderstanding of this virus. A number of novel isolates have been\nidentified in patients with acute hepatitis from regions other than Japan\nnot considered endemic for HEV (Austria, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\nSpain, and the United States). These individuals reported no recent travel\nto HEV-endemic areas. In addition, a number of HEV-like sequences have also\nbeen isolated from swine worldwide, suggesting the potential of an animal\nreservoir.\nThe August issue of the Journal of General Virology (83(Pt 8):1931-1940,\n2002) contains a paper by Takahashi et al. describing the identification\nof 2 distinct genotypes of hepatitis E virus in a Japanese patient with\nacute hepatitis who had not travelled abroad. The paper should be consulted\nfor an up-to-date assessment of the situation. The authors conclude among\nother things that one of the 2 strains had higher sequence identity to\nhuman and swine HEV isolates from the United States (US1, US2 and swUS1)\nthan to those reported thus far from Japan (JRA1 and swJ570). The 2\nco-infecting strains identified from the single patient shared only 80.1\npercent nucleotide identity. These results indicate that multiple genotypes\nof HEV co-circulate in Japan, and that genotype IV comprises a remarkably\nheterogeneous group of HEVs. It seems clear that at least 4 distinct\ngenotypes of hepatitis E virus are prevalent in Japan and that this should\nbe taken into account in the treatment of acute hepatitis. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "As the virus can spread if left unchecked,\nthe ministry is trying to determine as soon as possible the number of\nhepatitis E cases among patients infected with unspecified forms of acute\nhepatitis.\n A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n The August issue of the Journal of General Virology (83(Pt 8):1931-1940,\n2002) contains a paper by Takahashi et al. describing the identification\nof 2 distinct genotypes of hepatitis E virus in a Japanese patient with\nacute hepatitis who had not travelled abroad.

Meng, M.D., Ph.D. <xjmeng@vt.edu>\n\nRemarks on Dr. Radford Davis's comments regarding Zoonotic\nTransmission of Hepatitis E Virus\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[In the proMED-mail post archived as 'Hepatitis E virus, new\ngenotypes - Japan (03) 20020724.4850'] Dr. Davis [referring to\nnon-human primates] commented that he was 'unaware of any evidence\nthat proves any other animal species is capable of harboring\nhepatitis E virus (HEV) and transmitting it to humans'. If anyone\ncares to do a literature search or knows anything about HEV, he/she\nwould find that there is ample evidence documenting otherwise.\nPigs and chickens have been confirmed to harbor HEV, and the HEV\ngenomic sequences in these animal species have been determined. Swine\nHEV and avian HEV are genetically and antigenically related to human\nHEV. It has been shown that swine HEV infects chimpanzees and rhesus\nmonkeys and conversely human HEV infects pigs. In addition, pig\nveterinarians and pig handlers in several countries (including the\nU.S.) had significantly higher anti-HEV prevalence compared to\nmatched control blood donor populations. Human HEV strains resembling\nswine HEV have been identified from patients in a number of\nindustrialized countries, including 2 US patients. The viruses\nrecovered from the 2 US patients are extremely similar to the\nprototype swine HEV, and the US human HEV infects pigs.\nUS Army scientists have reported the detection and genetic\nidentification of a HEV strain from rodents, and the 'murine HEV' is\nclosely related to human HEV. In addition to pigs, human HEV has been\nsuccessfully transmitted to rats and lambs. Furthermore, there are a\nnumber of other animal species (cats, dogs, cattle, etc.) that have\nbeen found to be seropositive.\nWhat evidence do we need for a zoonosis claim? Our lab is responsible\nfor the discovery of the swine and avian hepatitis E viruses (see\nreferences below). In my opinion, the claim that hepatitis E is a\nzoonosis and that animal reservoirs exist, is very appropriate and\nthis concept has been accepted by the hepatitis E research community.\nThe 4th International Conference on Emerging Zoonosis will have a\ntopic on Hepatitis E.\nReferences:\n1.
