It joins an older strain, H3N8, that has been present in the state since 2015, also mainly confined to Northern Nevada.\n\nLocal veterinarians say they haven't seen either flu strain in Las Vegas yet, but warn it's just a matter of time. 'I was shocked it took so long to get here (to Nevada),' Dr. Travis McDermott, hospital director at Durango Animal Hospital in Las Vegas, said of the new strain. 'It's going to be a big deal, I think.'\n\nDr. Debbie White, a veterinarian at Craig Road and Lone Mountain animal hospitals, also predicted the illness will spread here. 'People in Vegas, we kind of think we don't have infectious disease and we live in a bubble,' she said. 'But that's not the case.'\n\nIn the past, veterinarians typically only recommended the vaccine for dogs traveling to an area where the flu was present. But this year [2018], many vets are telling pet owners it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nThe signs of dog flu resemble those of kennel cough, a highly contagious canine respiratory disease, or even the human infection: coughing, sneezing, fever and lethargy. And like the human flu, dog flu can kill. 'As many as 8 to 10 percent will die from it,' McDermott said. 'The scary thing about it is that it's extremely contagious,' though not to humans.\n\nFor dogs boarded at Durango Animal Hospital, the vaccine is mandatory, McDermott said. Dogs who come into close contact with other dogs at locations like parks, kennels or shelters are at higher risk for contracting the virus and also are recommended to be vaccinated.\n\nInfected dogs can transmit the flu for about 3 weeks -- even if they never come down with symptoms -- as can a pet owner who interacts with an infected dog and then a healthy one. In addition to direct contact, the virus can also spread through contaminated objects and a cough or sneeze.\n\n'The dogs in Las Vegas are naive, (meaning) they've never seen this virus,' White said. 'And that means just about every dog that encounters the virus is going to become infected.'\n\nAs in humans, the vaccine, which protects against both strains, isn't 100 percent effective, though it can dampen symptoms if a dog contracts the flu.\n\nHarley, an energetic 1.5-year-old Doberman pinscher, stood perfectly still recently as Dr. Brittney Spurling at the Cheyenne West Animal Hospital administered her flu shot. Veterinarians there have been notifying their clients via email about the concern. That's how Harley's owner, who asked not to be named, heard about the shot.\n\nSpurling said she was particularly worried when colleagues in Reno told her they'd dealt with the Northern Nevada outbreak firsthand and urged dog owners to visit their veterinarian to get the flu vaccine and a booster shot 2 to 4 weeks later. 'We're just trying to hope for the best and prepare for the worst,' she said.\n\n[Byline: Jessie Bekker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n['Canine influenza [CI] or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the US, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the United States, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain.\n\n'In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia, specifically, Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs.

Michigan has recently started seeing cases of this infectious disease. Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine has treated some of these ill dogs. Ingham County Animal Control and Shelter, and other rescues and shelters in the area, have started preventative protocols to help reduce the spread of this virus. H3N2 has similar signs to 'kennel cough' and other upper respiratory illnesses. It typically presents with sneezing, nasal discharge, and frequent coughing that may persist for 2 weeks or more.\n\nBecause this is an infectious disease spread by an airborne virus, a shelter environment is highly susceptible to an outbreak. Ingham County Animal Control and Shelter is taking a proactive approach and is already administering vaccinations to dogs that are staying at the shelter. It is a 2- step vaccine, requiring a booster shot 3 weeks after the initial vaccine. Shelter dogs will receive both doses at the shelter if they are still in the shelters care. Pet owners will be advised when the vaccination was given (or vaccinations) and are encouraged to speak with their personal veterinarians about additional follow up care and vaccines.\n\nAccording to the University of Florida Shelter Medicine Program, most dogs recover in about 2 weeks without complications, however about 20 percent of infected dogs progress the pneumonia within the 1st week of the illness.

There has been a spike in human flu cases in Washington and across the country. The Washington State Department of Health reports at the end of December [2017], there had been at least 29 deaths from influenza. But people aren't the only one susceptible to the flu. So is your dog.\n\nVeterinarians are warning pet owners that a spike in dog flu cases has raced across the country. Canine influenza has been reported in 46 states -- including here in Washington. Dog flu, like the human flu, is passed from dog to dog through the air. Symptoms are similar to the flu that affects humans, said Critical Care Veterinarian Meghan Harmon of Blue Pearl Seattle. 'Things like coughing, sneezing, not eating, lethargy and fever (are symptoms),' Harmon said.\n\nHarmon said only about 2 cases of confirmed dog flu have been reported in Washington dogs. However, dogs traveling to other areas of the country for shows or other reasons where the flu is prevalent have a good chance of getting sick. 'Once they're exposed, there's a good chance they'll get infected,' Harmon said.\n\nAround 80 percent of dogs exposed to canine influenza get the virus. Most dogs recover in 2 to 3 weeks. But, like humans, older dogs and dogs with weakened immune systems can come down with more serious health problems as a result. Less than 10 percent of dogs that get the disease will die, Harmon said. The virus is not transferable to humans.\n\nThe disease is often mistaken with Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common infection for dogs.\n\nIf you suspect your dog has the canine flu, keep it quarantined from other pets. If it has a high fever, such as 104 or 105, it's a good idea to call your vet. And if you think your dog has the flu and you plan on taking them in, please call ahead, Harmon says. 'The disease is spread by aerosol and it lives on surfaces for hours,' Harmon said, mentioning dogs with the flu will be put into quarantine at the vet.\n\nFor more information on dog flu, visit the American Veterinary Medical Association website.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 12 Jan 2018\nSource: Newsweek [edited]\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/what-dog-flu-780655?utm_source=email&utm_medium=morning_brief&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=read_more&spMailingID=2781043&spUserID=MTI0NzM3MDk1MzgS1&spJobID=950605623&spReportId=OTUwNjA1NjIzS0\n\n\nIs your pup sneezing, coughing or not acting like himself? He may have dog flu. Cases of canine influenza have been popping up around the country, including states like Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Pennsylvania and now Canada -- and it's highly contagious among dogs.\n\n'They were 1st recognized in greyhounds around 2003, and they've since been diagnosed in over 36 states,' Dr. Kyle Frandle, a veterinarian at Los Gatos Dog and Cat Hospital, told Mercury News in California. 'Experts feel dog flu is now endemic in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Florida and now here in California. There's some controversy over where it originates from; some experts think it came from horse influenza and some think from avian influenza.'\n\nCanine influenza can't infect humans, but it can be dangerous for dogs and might even lead to death, with a mortality rate of 10 percent, if not treated, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Some vets, however, are calling the panic unwarranted. After Fox News published an initial report of the disease spreading in 46 states, one Washington doctor refuted that claim, writing in a blog post said it wasn't time to panic yet.\n\n'There has been no serious increase in flu cases on the west coast, and no confirmed cases reported in Washington for over 2-years,' Dr. Mark Kummer, who works at Fairhaven Veterinary Hospital, wrote.\n\nStill, several states are seeing an increase in cases. One pet hospital near San Francisco, United Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Hospital, saw over 50 cases in 2 weeks, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\nThe disease is transmitted 'through droplets or aerosols containing respiratory secretions from coughing, barking and sneezing,' according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. 'Dogs in close contact with infected dogs in places such as kennels, groomers, day care facilities and shelters are at increased risk of infection.'\n\nIf you notice symptoms in your dog, like coughing, sneezing, fever, decreased appetite and nasal discharge, you should take them to the vet to get tested. The symptoms could mean a different illness, and so a test is the only way to know for sure.\n\nThe illness has even been spotted in Canada, where 2 dogs in southwestern Ontario had tested positive, the Toronto Sun reported on [Tue 9 Jan 2018].\n\n[Byline: Melina Dekic]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As with humans most dogs will come through a 'flu bout successfully.

All 3 cases were in July [2018], the 1st of which was on Wed 11 July 2018, according to the veterinary group's other medical director, Dr. Clare Fahy.\n\nIn the USA, there are 2 strains causing dog flu: H3N8 and H3N2. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, H3N8 was 1st reported in the USA in 2004, and H3N2 1st appeared in the USA in 2015. The H3N2 virus appeared in Brooklyn, NY, back in April [2018] and spread across New York City's boroughs before making its way to Connecticut.\n\nRosen said 'the best way to prevent dogs from becoming severely ill' is to vaccinate them against both strains. Dog owners should also 'wash their hands and any shared toys after playing or contact with other dogs,' she added, and 'avoid bringing their dogs to areas where other dogs congregate,' such as grooming facilities, dog parks, and doggy day cares.\n\nDr. Ralph Hunt of the Wilton Hospital for Animals on Danbury Road reported on Thu 9 Aug 2018 that his practice hasn't had any cases of H3N2 but said 'there's more precaution with this particular strain.' The Office of the State Veterinarian is 'trying to be proactive' when it comes to the virus, he said, and is requiring veterinarians to report confirmed cases of canine influenza in the state. The Bulletin reached out to the state veterinarian but did not hear back in time for publication.\n\nThere have been no confirmed cases of H3N2 at the Cannondale Animal Clinic on Danbury Road, but the clinic did have 3 dogs come in with coughs 'shortly after the outbreak' in Stamford, according to Dr. Paula Belknap.\n\nTwo of the dogs were tested and came back negative for H3N2 but positive for _Bordetella_ and mycoplasma, said Belknap, 'which contributed to their flu-like signs.'\n\n'Both dogs had been previously vaccinated for H3N2 virus,' she said, 'and I believe it is why they tested negative for H3N2.' Belknap said the owner of the 3rd dog declined testing.\n\nAccording to the Cornell University School of Veterinary Medicine, 'virtually all dogs are susceptible' to dog flu, and the onset of signs come 2-3 days after infection. Signs include high fever, coughing, loss of appetite, lethargy, runny nose, and eye discharge. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), not all dogs show signs of illness, and 'the severity of illness associated with canine flu in dogs can range from no signs to severe illness.'\n\nDogs with flu signs should be taken to the vet promptly for assessment and treatment. If diagnosed with canine flu, dogs should be kept away from other dogs for at least 3 weeks to prevent spreading the disease.\n\nThere are no drugs to treat canine influenza, which means the illness must run its course once a dog is infected. [Supportive treatment may be needed with severely ill animals. - Mod.TG]\n\nWhile most dogs recover within 2-3 weeks, according to the CDC, 'some may develop secondary bacterial infections, which may lead to more severe illness and pneumonia.'\n\n[Byline: Kendra Baker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Canine influenza (CI) or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the USA, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the USA, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain.\n\n'In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia, specifically Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 CI across the USA' (see https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Control-of-Canine-Influenza-in-Dogs.aspx).\n\nHealthy dogs can be vaccinated and should be if you must board your animal. There is a vaccine for both strains of the flu mentioned above. If the virus is circulating in your area, avoiding canine social activities (dog parks, play dates, interactions in the park, etc.) may help protect your dog.\n\nCanine influenza viruses (H3N2 and H3N8) are not known to infect humans (see https://www.cdc.gov/flu/canineflu/keyfacts.htm).\n\nThis article briefly discussed 3 cases but does not provide any laboratory evidence or substantial data to raise the suspicion of a more virulent strain. It does indicate that 2 dogs had been vaccinated and tested negative, which may mean, as mentioned in the article, that there was infection but not necessarily co-infection with another organism.

The dogs were imported from Asia (via the US) in late December [2017] and were showing signs of respiratory disease the following day when they were examined by a veterinarian. A small number of dogs that had close contact with the affected dogs also have mild respiratory disease, but test results from those animals are not yet available.\n\nThis is the 1st known incursion of H3N2 canine influenza in Canada. The virus is widespread in some parts of Asia and is causing outbreaks in various locations in the United States, especially in shelters. Canine influenza virus is of concern because it is highly transmissible between dogs, particularly in areas (such as Canada) where dogs do not have natural immunity from previous infection and where canine influenza vaccination is rare.\n\nA few important points should be noted:\n1. Most dogs that develop influenza do not get seriously ill. Respiratory disease that is indistinguishable from other infectious respiratory diseases (canine infectious respiratory disease complex, also known as 'kennel cough') usually occurs, although serious (including fatal) infections and/or complications can develop.\n2. Infected dogs can shed influenza virus for a short time prior to the onset of disease. So, dogs that appear to be healthy are still a potential source of infection.\n3. Canine influenza vaccines are available from veterinarians in Canada. Like human flu vaccines, they do not guarantee protection but they reduce the risk of disease.\n4. Cats can be infected but this appears to be rare.\n\nCanine H3N2 influenza virus is different than the human H3N2 influenza virus that is a common seasonal flu virus in people. There is no known human risk from H3N2 canine influenza virus; however, the risk of reassortment (or mixing together) between the canine H3N2 virus and human seasonal influenza viruses is a potential concern. As influenza in animals is a reportable disease, the Windsor-Essex county Health Unit, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) and Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) are involved in the investigation, along with the University of Guelph.\n\nThe investigation and response are ongoing, and at this point, the concern mainly involves the imported dogs and their close contacts. Affected and exposed dogs are being confined by their owners to help prevent further spread. However, dog owners in the Essex county area should be vigilant and watch for signs of respiratory disease in their dogs, particularly dogs that frequently have contact with other dogs.\n\nBecause canine influenza virus (as well as other infectious causes of respiratory disease) can be highly contagious, care must be taken with sick dogs. Dogs with signs of respiratory disease (such as cough, decreased appetite, nasal and eye discharge, fever) should be kept away from others dogs for at least 3 weeks. If a dog with potentially infectious respiratory disease is taken to a veterinarian, the veterinary clinic should be informed in advance so that they can take appropriate precautions, such as admitting the dog directly to an examination or isolation room and using isolation precautions.\n\nMore information will be provided as it becomes available.\n\n[Byline: Scott Weese]\n\n--\nCommunicated by\nScott Weese\nUniversity of Guelph\nCanada\n<jsweese@uoguelph.ca>\n\n[For a full description of H3N2 canine influenza virus, its transmission, clinical disease, diagnosis, treatment, vaccination, infection control, zoonotic potential, and reporting, go to https://www.wormsandgermsblog.com/files/2018/01/H3N2-vet-info-sheet-final-WG.pdf.\n\nA 2nd news report from CBC News, but similar to that of Weese's, is available at http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/confirmed-case-canine-influenza-essex-1.4477588, with thanks to ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall.\n\nAt this point there is no known human risk, but public health officials are worried that a dog infected with H3N2 could also contract a human flu, and those strains could combine to create a new virus. Distinguishing the canine flu is difficult in dogs because the symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections like kennel cough. It's a flu-like illness. It gives them fever; they feel pretty run down; and they get a cough, which is often the most remarkable sign. In most dogs that's it. It runs its course, that is, just like the human flu epidemic that we are presently suffering from. But like the flu, it could cause complications for older dogs, or those canines with existing health problems.

Moreover, because of the period of onset to contract swine flu after exposure, the Clinton County health commissioner does not expect any more potential swine flu cases among humans who visited the Clinton County Fair's Hog Barn last week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017]. State of Ohio officials shut down the hog barn on [Thu 13 Jul 2017] after swine flu was detected in a pig [see Influenza, swine - USA: (OH) H3N2 20170717.5180499].\n\nOn [Fri 14 Jul 2017], Clinton County Health Commissioner Pamela Walker Bauer reported there now are 11 lab-confirmed cases of the H3N2 flu virus in people. Lab testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still underway to see whether there is a connection to the specific variation of the swine flu [found at the fair], she said. A total of about 13 people were reported sick with flu-like illness to the Clinton County Health District, but 2 of them did not test positive for the H3N2 flu virus, according to Walker Bauer. Of the 11 lab-confirmed human cases of the H3N2 flu virus, the age range is from 7 months to 64 years old, reported Walker Bauer. The age bracket of 10 and younger has a higher level of incidence among the 11 cases compared to other age brackets, she said.\n\nOf those 11 patients, 8 are Clinton County residents, 2 are Warren Countians, and one lives in Highland County. By gender, 6 are males and 5 are females. All 11 patients reportedly are recovering, said the Clinton County health commissioner.\n\nAlso [Fri 14 Jul 2017], state officials said nearly 50 hogs at another county fair in Ohio were removed for slaughter after at least 2 animals tested positive for swine flu, according to The Associated Press (AP). The Ohio Department of Agriculture says the hogs were removed from the Franklin County Fair on [Wed 19 Jul 2017] for slaughter. The Franklin County Agricultural Society said [Thu 20 Jul 2017] that livestock areas have been disinfected. State officials last week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017] ordered approximately 300 hogs slaughtered after the discovery of swine flu cases at the Clinton County Fair, added the AP.\n\nAgriculture Department spokesman Mark Bruce told The Columbus Dispatch the 2 incidents aren't related and involved different strains of influenza. He said viruses have an easier time infecting the animals when the weather is hot and humid [more likely due to the stress on the animals in the fair environment and the mixing of large numbers of animals from different farms - Mod.JH].\n\n[Byline: Gary Huffenberger]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Ohio can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/237.

However, as swine influenza was recently reported in pigs at the fair, the possibility of animal to human transmission is likely.\n\nThe A/H3N2v viruses were first identified in US pigs in 2010 (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-situation.htm). Between 2011 and September 2016, 364 human H3N2v cases were reported from 14 states. The largest outbreak occurred in 2012 when a total of 309 human cases of H3N2v flu were identified, including 16 hospitalizations and one death (http://nasphv.org/Documents/Influenza_Transmission_at_Swine_Exhibitions_2016.pdf). The majority of cases were exhibitors and others in close contact with pigs at agricultural fairs.\n\nSymptoms of H3N2v infection in people are usually mild and similar to those of seasonal flu viruses, but as with seasonal flu, complications can lead to hospitalization and death. Clinical features may include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, as well as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The incubation period (the time it takes from exposure to onset of illness) for this influenza is also typically similar to seasonal influenza at about 2 days, but may be up to 10 days.\n\nThere are ways to reduce the spread of influenza viruses between pigs and people (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/swineflu/prevent-spread-flu-pigs-at-fairs.pdf).\n\nCDC recommendations for people not at high risk include:\n- don't take food or drink into pig areas; don't eat, drink, or put anything in your mouth in pig areas;\n- don't take toys, pacifiers, cups, baby bottles, strollers, or similar items into pig areas. Avoid close contact with pigs that look or act ill;\n- take protective measures if you must come in contact with pigs that are known or suspected to be sick. This includes minimizing contact with pigs and wearing personal protective equipment like protective clothing, gloves and masks that cover your mouth and nose when contact is required;\n- wash your hands often with soap and running water before and after exposure to pigs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub;\n- to further reduce the risk of infection, minimize contact with pigs in the pig barn or arenas;\n- avoid contact with pigs if you have flu symptoms. Wait to have contact with pigs until 7 days after your illness started or until you have been without fever for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications, whichever is longer;\n- people with high risk factors who develop flu symptoms should call a health care provider;\n\nThe same influenza antiviral drugs used to treat seasonal flu can be used to treat variant virus infection.\n\nCDC recommendations for people with high risk factors include:\n- anyone who is at high risk of serious flu complications (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm) planning to attend a setting where pigs will be present should avoid pigs and swine barns;\n- people who are at high risk of serious flu complications include children younger than 5 years, people 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions (like asthma and other lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neuro-developmental conditions). - Mod.UBA]\n\n[Since H3N2 viruses first appeared in pigs in 1998 there have been other documented swine-origin influenza A spillover cases in humans prior to the emergence of the A/H3N2v virus that contains the matrix protein from the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus.

Due to the significant biosecurity risks posed by county fairs, most people working in the US swine industry do not participate in such events.

Officials say the disease can be 'highly contagious.' In its mild form, dogs develop 'soft moist cough' that can persist from 10 to 30 days. In severe illness, dogs can develop fevers that can lead to pneumonia. It can be fatal in less than 10 percent of infections, officials said.\n\nA vaccine can help prevent the virus. According to officials, the H3N2 vaccine is 'highly recommended' for dogs that frequently come into contact with other dogs, visit dog parks or kennels, or travel a lot.\n\nAlthough there are no cases of the virus transferring to humans, humans can pass it to dogs, meaning that if we come into contact with the virus, our 4-legged friends could potently catch it.\n\nProper hygiene, including handwashing for anyone who comes into contact with an unfamiliar dog, is recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n'This diagnosis is an important reminder that flu season is among us,' MCACC wrote in a news release.

In the US, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the United States, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain. In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia -- specifically, Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs.

A local outbreak of canine influenza has sickened dozens of area dogs recently, with at least 5 confirmed cases. While the highly contagious virus has been identified previously in other Ohio metropolitan areas and across the country over the last few years, it's now hitting Toledo for the 1st known time.\n\n'We've been seeing at least 5 [cases] a day; it has spread very quickly,' said Geanna Beck, hospital director at MedVet Toledo.\n\nAs of Tuesday [24 Oct 2017], the emergency veterinary clinic had confirmed 3 cases of the H3N2 strain of canine flu, with tests for other dogs still pending. The clinic has treated at least 50 dogs thus far with the numbers continuing to climb, Ms. Beck said.\n\nThe outbreak appears to have stemmed from a Columbus-area dog who arrived on 4 Oct 2017 at the Pups Paradise boarding and daycare facility in Sylvania. The dog showed no signs during its stay but later became ill and was confirmed to have the virus.\n\nAnother dog who was in playgroups with the affected canine also spent time at the Pups Paradise location in Perrysburg, subsequently exposing dogs there to the virus as well.\n\n'The following week, we started receiving reports of dogs that were coughing and were being treated for kennel cough,' owner Ron Deleeuw said.\n\nKennel cough, or bordetella, is the canine version of the common cold. Both kennel cough and the canine flu present with similar signs like coughing, a runny nose, lethargy, and lack of appetite. The canine flu often also includes fever, though some kennel cough cases can develop fever as well.\n\n'The signs are very similar, and without a confirmatory test, it's hard to differentiate,' said Dr. Gary Thompson of West Suburban Animal Hospital in Sylvania Township.\n\nDr. Thompson, whose clinic is just down the road from Pups Paradise in Sylvania, said his office confirmed 1 case of H3N2 and has treated about 15 to 20 dogs for the illness. Not all dogs are tested specifically for the virus because it can be expensive, but veterinarians will treat for it if a dog has likely been exposed.\n\nDogs are contagious for several days before they develop signs and can remain contagious for up to a month. Treatment is limited to supportive care like antibiotics, fluids, and cough suppressants.\n\nDr. Thompson said the average, healthy dog can successfully fight off the flu with support. But it can become complicated in more severe cases.\n\n'The big concern is if they develop secondary pneumonia,' he said.\n\nThe outbreak has extended up into Michigan, with Temperance Animal Hospital also having confirmed a case.\n\nBoth Pups Paradise locations shut down their operations Saturday [21 Oct 2017] to begin extensive cleaning and multiple rounds of top-to-bottom sanitizing, along with replacing all air filters. The last dog in boarding went home Tuesday [24 Oct 2017].\n\n'It was just a matter of time until it came to the area,' Mr. Deleeuw said. 'Unfortunately, it came to us first.'\n\nPups Paradise expects to reopen this Saturday [28 Oct 2017] but will now require all clients' dogs be fully vaccinated for the flu before they will be allowed to return.\n\n'We average 150 dogs a day between both locations,' Mr. Deleeuw said. 'We will do everything we can to safely care for the dogs.'\n\nDr. Thompson said area dog owners should not panic, but use general caution. Those dogs who regularly visit boarding, daycare, or grooming facilities, dog parks, and other places where canines gather should get a bivalent vaccination that covers both the H3N2 strain and the older H3N8 strain of canine flu.\n\n'It spreads just like the flu in people and is super contagious,' Dr. Thompson said. 'If you're in a population that has that kind of exposure, then the vaccine is recommended.'\n\nThe vaccine requires an initial dose followed by a booster 2 to 4 weeks later, Dr. Thompson said. Dogs should then receive an annual booster shot.\n\n[Byline: Alexandra Mester]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n['Canine influenza [CI] or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus.

Many countries especially in East Asia and Europe appeared to have already peaked and were reporting decreasing trends. Worldwide, influenza A(H3N2) virus was predominant. The majority of influenza viruses characterized so far were similar antigenically to the reference viruses contained in vaccines for use in the 2016-2017 northern hemisphere influenza season. Nearly all tested viruses collected recently for antiviral sensitivity were susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications.\n\n- In North America, influenza activity with A(H3N2) virus predominating increased in the United States of America and Mexico, whereas in Canada influenza activity continued to decrease.\n- In Europe, influenza activity remained elevated with influenza A(H3N2) virus being the most prominent subtype. Most of the countries reported stable or decreasing trends compared with previous weeks. Persons aged over 65 years were most frequently associated with severe disease from influenza infection.\n- In East Asia, influenza activity appeared to be decreasing with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominant.\n- In Western Asia, influenza activity was decreasing with influenza A(H3N2) predominant in the region. Low levels of influenza B viruses were also detected.\n- In Southern Asia, influenza activity sharply increased in India and Sri Lanka, with mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 reported followed by influenza B and A(H3N2).\n- In South East Asia, influenza activity remained low.\n- In Northern Africa, influenza activity seemed to have peaked; influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B virus detections were reported.\n- In West Africa, influenza B continued to be detected in Ghana.\n- In the Caribbean countries and Central America, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low in general, except in Puerto Rico where influenza activity remained above the seasonal threshold with influenza A(H3N2) predominating.\n- In tropical South America, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low, although RSV activity remained elevated in Colombia.\n- In the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels.\n\nNational Influenza Centers (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 83 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 23 January 2017 to 05 February 2017 (data as of 17 Feb 2017 11:53:23 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 154 949 specimens during that time period. 40 292 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 36 922 (91.6 percent) were typed as influenza A and 3370 (8.4 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 418 (2.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 and 14 024 (97.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 332 (62.8 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 197 (37.2 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[Predominant A/H3N2 circulation among Influenza A and B-Yamagata lineage among Influenza B reported in this update, a continuation of the earlier trends in the 2016-17 season in the northern hemisphere. - Mod.UBA]\n\n******\n[2] Seasonal Vaccine Studies-Europe\nDate: Thu 23 Feb 2017\nSource: Eurosurveillance [edited]\nhttp://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22723\n\n\nSystems for register-based monitoring of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza (LCI) in real time were set up in Stockholm County, Sweden, and Finland, before start of the 2016/17 influenza season, using population-based cohort studies. Both in Stockholm and Finland, an early epidemic of influenza A(H3N2) peaked in week 52, 2016. Already during weeks 48 to 50, analyses of influenza VE in persons 65 years and above showed moderately good estimates of around 50 percent, then rapidly declined by week 2, 2017 to 28 and 32 percent in Stockholm and Finland, respectively. The sensitivity analyses, where time since vaccination was taken into account, could not demonstrate a clear decline, neither by calendar week nor by time since vaccination. Most (68 percent) of the samples collected from vaccinated patients belonged to the 3C.2a1 subclade with the additional amino acid substitution T135K in haemagglutinin (64 percent) or to subclade 3C.2a with the additional haemagglutinin substitutions T131K and R142K (36 percent). The proportion of samples containing these alterations increased during the studied period. These substitutions may be responsible for viral antigenic change and part of the observed VE drop.

Analysis of haemagglutinin (HA) sequences demonstrated co-circulation of multiple clades (3C.3a, 3C.2a and 3C.2a1).

She then noticed some signs in [her dog] and called Misty Vistas Pet Hospital. '[My dog is] very young and we just got her, so I wouldn't want her to get any more sick and a concern could be that something could be more serious,' she said. Her veterinarian Dr. Joey Branstutter gave her some antibiotics for her [dog`s] respiratory illness and recommended keeping her in isolation from other dogs. 'I'm definitely going to keep her away from other dogs for a period of 10 days, I know that it is actually more contagious before the onset of everything,' [the dog owner] said.\n\nBranstutter said there have been no confirmed cases of dog flu at Misty Vistas, including [this dog,] but he has received several calls about it.\n'Respiratory signs, cough, any kind of gurgling signs, lethargy, lack of appetite, that kind of thing,' Branstutter said. 'Most cases they are going to pass on their own after 10 to 14 days. About 20 percent of them will progress to a pneumonia and can get more severe, so that's the scary thing about it.'\n\nExperts are warning pet owners to be extra vigilant in keeping their dogs healthy. Officials advise dog owners to call their veterinarian if they notice the following signs:\n- Coughing\n- Eye or nose discharge\n- Loss of appetite\n- Loss of energy\n\nThe dog flu spreads through direct contact with the contamination, experts said. You can prevent spread of disease by washing your hands after coming in contact with dogs.\n\nPetsmart released a statement on Thursday [23 Jul 2015]:\n'We have seen multiple cases of canine respiratory illness in dogs in our Mason PetsHotel location. At this point, we have several confirmed cases of canine influenza.\n\n'Out of caution, we temporarily stopped taking new reservations for the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp. We also contacted all pet parents with pets staying in this hotel to ask them to pick up their pets if possible. In the meantime, pets that remained in our care were monitored around the clock by a PetSmart associate. In partnership with Banfield Pet Hospital, these pets also received multiple visits every day from a Banfield veterinarian.\n\n'Once pets were safely removed from the hotel, we began a rigorous 72-hour disinfecting process. We expect to reopen the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp tomorrow.\n\n'The health and well-being of pets is our top priority, and we are going to do everything we can to help contain the spread of this virus and ensure the pets in our PetsHotels receive the best care possible.

The Humane Society is halting intakes and adoptions at its St. Paul facility and expediting testing of other animals that might be sick. A 2nd possible case has been identified. The dog is undergoing testing and treatment.\n\nThe Humane Society is sending a letter to people who have adopted a dog in the past 30 days asking them to see a veterinarian if their pets show signs such as a deep cough, nasal discharge or fever. Janelle Dixon, president and CEO of the Humane Society, said the nonprofit organization is acting with 'an abundance of caution.' The group doesn't think the flu has spread to dogs at its other shelters, and if pets show no signs, 'there's nothing to worry about,' Dixon said.\n\nThe infected dog came to the Humane Society shelter 2 Jun 2015 from St. Paul Animal Control.

The case was confirmed in metro Atlanta, and that has officials concerned that the pet has been in contact with other dogs in the area.\n\nVeterinarians like Doctor Arhonda Johnson say the virus is very serious, even deadly. 'Dogs can die from this,' says Johnson. 'There's a mild form, and there's a severe form, and it depends on what accompanies the disease. If they get pneumonia or a bacterial infection, they can die from it.'\n\nJohnson is urging dog owners to not wait until the last minute. The Georgia Veterinary Medical Association isn't sure how severe the case is here. We're told swab samples were taken from the dog to the University of Georgia where it was confirmed. Now the state is waiting to see whether it's linked to the cases in Chicago.\n\nThere are some signs you can look for in your pet to determine whether they have canine influenza: One obvious sign is if they're coughing. Other signs include nasal discharge, which could be accompanied with fever or pneumonia.\n\nYour veterinarian can best help you identify whether these are signs of a canine flu. 'Be proactive; don't let an epidemic start here; vaccinate and be done with it,' said Johnson.\n\n'If something happened to him, it would be horrible, so it's very important to me,' [the dog's owner said].

The staff is administering antibiotics to the dogs to prevent secondary infection, such as pneumonia, as well as providing nebulizer treatments and making sure they eat and take in plenty of fluids.\n\nHSCA staff is keeping the animals' spirits up with toys, treats and blankets.\n\n'Our staff is working around the clock to care for our dogs,' Delaney said. 'We're also relying on network agencies, local rescue groups and other shelters for any help we can get during this time.'\n\nShe said there is a particular need right now for surgical gloves and gowns as well as toys and blankets. A complete list of needed items can found on the HSCA's website.\n\nThe virus appears to be highly contagious and can become severe very quickly, according to Delaney. The clinical signs are generally the same as they are in common human viruses: a deep cough, vomiting, yellow or green nasal discharge and lethargy. However, it's rare that a dog would die from the disease, and it cannot be passed on to cats, she said.\n\nDelaney encourages pet owners to closely monitor their own pets and contact their veterinarian if they notice any symptoms.\n\nGiven the current situation, HSCA has ceased taking in dogs or any other animals and has suspended adoptions. Delaney estimated the outbreak's medical cost at USD 30 000, not including the additional staffing costs.\n\nMoreover, closure of the facilities impacts other animal shelters and rescue organizations that cannot use HSCA resources, such as it's spay and neuter clinic. And with HSCA closing, the number of pets in need of a home is straining other animal facilities in Northwest Indiana.\n\n'I have only 20 cages and don't have an open one,' said Sandy Litke, Griffith animal control warden. 'Everybody across the region is full.'\n\nShe advised people who find a lost animal or have one for adoption to hold onto it for now, but in the meantime it's important they take the animal to a veterinarian for the appropriate vaccinations. She noted that all animals receive a flu vaccination when they arrive at the Griffith Animal Shelter to prevent an outbreak.\n\nLitke said the 'lostandfoundpet' page on Facebook is a great resource to find shelter and care for unwanted and displaced pets, and that the entire pet community in Northwest Indiana is pulling together during the crisis at the HSCA.\n\n[Byline: Jim Masters]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This can be a serious disease that easily spreads between dogs. Owners should be extremely cautious of taking dogs to dog parks and other canine social events.\n\nQ: What is canine influenza?\nA: Canine influenza (CI), or dog flu, is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the U.S., canine influenza has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the United States, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain. In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate canine influenza virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia -- specifically, Korea, China and Thailand. In Asia. This H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 canine influenza across the U.S.\n\nTwo clinical syndromes have been seen in dogs infected with the canine influenza virus -- a mild form of the disease and a more severe form that is accompanied by pneumonia.\n\n- Mild form -- Dogs suffering with the mild form of canine influenza develop a soft, moist cough that persists for 10 to 30 days. They may also be lethargic and have reduced appetite and a fever. Sneezing and discharge from the eyes and/or nose may also be observed. Some dogs have a dry cough similar to the traditional 'kennel cough' caused by _Bordetella bronchiseptica_/parainfluenza virus complex. Dogs with the mild form of influenza may also have a thick nasal discharge, which is usually caused by a secondary bacterial infection.\n- Severe form -- Dogs with the severe form of canine influenza develop high fevers (104 deg F to 106 deg F) and have clinical signs of pneumonia, such as increased respiratory rates and effort. Pneumonia may be due to a secondary bacterial infection.\n\nQ: Are all dogs at risk of getting canine influenza?\nA: Because this is still an emerging disease and dogs in the U.S. have not been exposed to it before, almost all dogs, regardless of breed or age, lack immunity to it and are susceptible to infection if exposed to the active virus. Virtually all dogs exposed to the virus become infected, and nearly 80 percent show clinical signs of disease, though most exhibit the mild form described above.\n\nHowever, the risk of any dog being exposed to the canine influenza virus depends on that dog's lifestyle. Dogs that are frequently or regularly exposed to other dogs -- for example at boarding or day care facilities, dog parks, grooming salons, or social events with other dogs present -- are at greater risk of coming into contact with the virus. Also, as with other infectious diseases, extra precautions may be needed with puppies, elderly or pregnant dogs, and dogs that are immunocompromised. Dog owners should talk with their own veterinarian to assess their dog's risk.\n\nQ: Do dogs die from canine influenza?\nA: Fatal cases of pneumonia resulting from infection with canine influenza virus have been reported in dogs, but the fatality rate is low (less than 10 percent). Most dogs recover in 2-3 weeks.\n\nQ: How widespread is the disease?\nA: The 1st recognized outbreak of canine influenza in the world is believed to have occurred in racing greyhounds in January 2004 at a track in Florida. From June to August of 2004, outbreaks of respiratory disease were reported at 14 tracks in 6 states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Texas, and West Virginia). Between January and May of 2005, outbreaks occurred at 20 tracks in 11 states (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin). The canine influenza virus has been reported in at least 40 states and Washington, DC.\n\nThe H3N2 strain of canine influenza virus had been reported in Korea, China and Thailand, but had not been detected outside of those countries until 2015. In April 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was determined to be caused by an H3N2 strain that was genetically almost identical to the one in Asia. Since May 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 canine influenza across the U.S.\n\nQ: Is there a vaccine?\nA: The 1st canine vaccine for H3N8 canine influenza was approved in 2009, and there are several H3N8 canine influenza vaccines available. It is not known whether the H3N8 vaccine will offer any protection against the H3N2 strain. Canine influenza vaccines are considered 'lifestyle' vaccines, meaning the decision to vaccinate is based on a dog's risk of exposure. Dog owners should consult their veterinarian to determine whether vaccination is needed.\n\nIn November 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture granted a conditional license to Zoetis for the 1st commercially available H3N2 canine influenza vaccine. Later that month, Merck Animal Health announced the availability of an H3N2 canine influenza vaccine, also conditionally licensed by USDA.\n\nQ: How is a dog with canine influenza treated?\nA: As with any disease caused by a virus, treatment is largely supportive. Good animal care practices and nutrition assist dogs in mounting an effective immune response.\n\nThe course of treatment depends on the pet's condition, including the presence or absence of a secondary bacterial infection, pneumonia, dehydration, or other medical issues (e.g., pregnancy, pre-existing respiratory disease, compromised immune system, etc.). The veterinarian might prescribe medications, such as an antibiotic (to fight secondary infections) and/or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (to reduce fever, swelling and pain). Dehydrated pets may need fluid therapy to restore and maintain hydration. Other medications, or even hospitalization, may also be necessary for more severe cases.\n\nQ: Is canine influenza virus transmissible from dogs to humans?\nA: To date, there is no evidence of transmission of canine influenza virus from dogs to people.\n\nQ: Is canine influenza virus transmissible from dogs to cats, horses or other animal species?\nA: At this time, there is no evidence of transmission of H3N8 canine influenza from dogs to horses, cats, ferrets, or other animal species. The H3N2 strain, however, has been reported in Asia to infect cats, and there's also some evidence that guinea pigs and ferrets can become infected.\n\nPrecautions to prevent spread of the virus are outlined below, in the answer to 'I work in a kennel/animal care facility. What should I do to prevent transmission of influenza virus from infected dogs to susceptible dogs?'\n\nQ: Do I need to be concerned about putting my dog in day care or boarding it at a kennel?\nA: Dog owners should be aware that any situation that brings dogs together increases the risk of spread of communicable illnesses. Good infection control practices can reduce that risk, so dog owners involved in shows, sports, or other activities with their dogs or who board their dogs at kennels should ask whether respiratory disease has been a problem there, and whether the facility has a plan for isolating dogs that develop respiratory disease and for notifying owners if their dogs have been exposed to dogs with respiratory disease.\n\nAs long as good infection control practices are in place, pet owners should not be overly concerned about putting dogs in training facilities, dog parks, kennels, or other areas frequented by dogs.\n\nQ: My dog has a cough ... what should I do?\nA: Consult your veterinarian. Coughing can be caused by many different medical problems, and your veterinarian can examine and evaluate your dog and recommend an appropriate course of treatment. If canine influenza is suspected, treatment will usually focus on maximizing the ability of your dog's immune system to combat the virus. A typical approach might include administration of fluids if your dog is becoming dehydrated and prescribing an antimicrobial if a secondary bacterial infection is suspected.\n\nCanine influenza virus can be spread via direct contact with respiratory secretions from infected dogs (via barking, coughing or sneezing), and by contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Therefore, dog owners whose dogs are coughing or exhibiting other signs of respiratory disease should not participate in activities or bring their dogs to facilities where other dogs can be exposed to them. Clothing (including shoes), equipment, surfaces, and hands should be cleaned and disinfected after exposure to dogs showing signs of respiratory disease to prevent transmission of infection to susceptible dogs. Clothing can be adequately cleaned by using a detergent at normal laundry temperatures.\n\nQ: I manage a kennel/veterinary clinic/animal shelter/dog day care center. How do I keep canine influenza out of my facility, and if it does enter my facility, what should I do?\nA: Viral disease is usually best prevented through vaccination. A vaccine against H3N8 canine influenza has been available since 2009, and H3N2 vaccines were conditionally approved in late 2015. It is considered a 'lifestyle' vaccine, which means that the decision to vaccinate a dog against CIV is based on the risk of exposure. A veterinarian should determine whether vaccination is needed based on related risks and benefits, and should administer these vaccinations at least 2 weeks prior to planned visits to dog activity and care facilities (e.g., kennels, veterinary clinics, dog day care centers, training facilities, dog parks). This differs from 'core' vaccines -- such as distemper, parvo and rabies -- that are required for all dogs, regardless of lifestyle.\n\nVaccination against other pathogens causing respiratory disease (such as _Bordetella_, adenovirus and parainfluenza) may help prevent more common respiratory pathogens from becoming secondary infections in a respiratory tract already compromised by influenza infection.\n\nRoutine infection control precautions are key to preventing spread of viral disease within facilities. The canine influenza virus appears to be easily killed by disinfectants (e.g., quaternary ammonium compounds, potassium peroxymonosulfate and bleach solutions at a 1 to 30 dilution) in common use in veterinary clinics, boarding facilities, and animal shelters. Protocols should be established for thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting cages, bowls, and other surfaces between uses. Employees should wash their hands with soap and water (or use an alcohol-based hand cleaner if soap and water are unavailable) before and after handling each dog; after coming into contact with a dog's saliva, urine, feces, or blood; after cleaning cages; and upon arriving at and before leaving the facility. (See 'I work in a kennel/animal care facility. What should I do to prevent transmission of influenza virus from infected dogs to susceptible dogs?')\n\nAnimal care facility staff should be alerted to the possibility that a dog with a respiratory infection could be presented for care or boarding. If a dog with respiratory signs is presented, staff members should inquire whether the dog has recently been boarded or adopted from a shelter, has recently participated in dog-related group activities, or has been exposed to other dogs known to have canine influenza or kennel cough. The dog should be brought directly into a separate examination/triage area that is reserved for dogs with respiratory signs and should not be allowed to enter the waiting room or other areas where susceptible dogs may be present.\n\nDogs with suspected canine influenza virus infection discovered after entry into the facility should be evaluated and treated by a veterinarian. Isolation protocols should be rigorously applied for dogs showing signs of respiratory disease, including the wearing of disposable gloves by persons handling infected dogs or cleaning contaminated cages. Respiratory disease beyond what is considered typical for a particular facility should be investigated, and the investigation should include submission of appropriate diagnostic samples. (See 'What diagnostic tests will tell me whether a dog has canine influenza?')\n\nQ: What diagnostic tests will tell me whether a dog has canine influenza? What samples do I send? Where do I send the samples? How do I distinguish between canine influenza and kennel cough?\nA: There is no rapid test for the specific diagnosis of acute canine influenza virus infection. Nasal or throat swabs from dogs that have been ill for less than 3 days may be sent to a diagnostic laboratory for testing. Your veterinarian may also offer other testing, such as an in-house test to detect influenza types A and B.\n\nAntibodies to canine influenza virus may be detected as early as 7 days after onset of clinical signs. Convalescent-phase samples should be collected at least 2 weeks after collection of the acute-phase sample. If an acute-phase sample is not available, testing a convalescent-phase sample can reveal whether a dog has been infected with or exposed to CIV at some point in the past.\n\nFor dogs that have died from pneumonia or other conditions in which CIV is suspected, additional diagnostic tests are available to your veterinarian through reference laboratories.\n\nQ: I work in a kennel/animal care facility. What should I do to prevent transmission of influenza virus from infected dogs to susceptible dogs?\nA: Canine influenza is not known to be transmissible from dogs to people. However, caretakers can inadvertently transmit canine influenza virus from infected dogs to susceptible dogs by not following good hygiene and infection control practices. To prevent spread of canine influenza virus, caretakers should take the following precautions:\n\n- Wash hands with soap and water (if soap and water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner):\n-- Upon arriving at the facility\n-- Before and after handling each animal\n-- After coming into contact with animal saliva, urine, feces or blood\n-- After cleaning cages\n-- Before eating meals, taking breaks, smoking or leaving the facility\n-- Before and after using the restroom\n- Wear a barrier gown over your clothes and wear gloves when handling sick animals or cleaning cages. Discard gown and gloves before working with other animals.\n- Consider use of goggles or face protection if splashes from contaminated surfaces may occur.\n- Bring a change of clothes to wear home at the end of the day.\n- Thoroughly clean clothes worn at the animal facility.\n- Do not allow animals to 'kiss' you or lick your face.\n- Do not eat in the animal care area.\n- Separate newly arriving animals from animals that have been housed one week or longer.\n- Routinely monitor animals for signs of illness. Separate sick animals from healthy animals, especially animals with signs of respiratory disease.\n- There is no evidence of transmission of canine influenza virus from dogs to people. However, because of concerns about diseases that are transmissible from dogs to people, in general, it may be prudent for young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons to limit or avoid contact with animals that are ill.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from: https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Control-of-Canine-Influenza-in-Dogs.aspx - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/217.]", "summary": "Good infection control practices can reduce that risk, so dog owners involved in shows, sports, or other activities with their dogs or who board their dogs at kennels should ask whether respiratory disease has been a problem there, and whether the facility has a plan for isolating dogs that develop respiratory disease and for notifying owners if their dogs have been exposed to dogs with respiratory disease.

Virtually all dogs exposed to the virus become infected, and nearly 80 percent show clinical signs of disease, though most exhibit the mild form described above. \n\nIn November 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture granted a conditional license to Zoetis for the 1st commercially available H3N2 canine influenza vaccine. Canine influenza is not known to be transmissible from dogs to people. How do I keep canine influenza out of my facility, and if it does enter my facility, what should I do?\n Canine influenza vaccines are considered 'lifestyle' vaccines, meaning the decision to vaccinate is based on a dog's risk of exposure. In the U.S., canine influenza has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The H3N2 strain of canine influenza virus had been reported in Korea, China and Thailand, but had not been detected outside of those countries until 2015. \n\nThe course of treatment depends on the pet's condition, including the presence or absence of a secondary bacterial infection, pneumonia, dehydration, or other medical issues (e.g., pregnancy, pre-existing respiratory disease, compromised immune system, etc.). Owners should be extremely cautious of taking dogs to dog parks and other canine social events. Employees should wash their hands with soap and water (or use an alcohol-based hand cleaner if soap and water are unavailable) before and after handling each dog; after coming into contact with a dog's saliva, urine, feces, or blood; after cleaning cages; and upon arriving at and before leaving the facility.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rabies"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2015-11-25 00:00:00", "2015-03-25 00:00:00", "2015-04-25 00:00:00", "2004-01-25 00:00:00", "2015-05-25 00:00:00", "2016-03-25 00:00:00", "2009-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2004-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Alabama", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Arkansas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Zoetis", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rhode Island", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Wisconsin", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Massachusetts", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington , DC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Indiana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chicago", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kansas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Arizona", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Florida", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Thailand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Iowa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Illinois", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Virginia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Northwest Indiana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3364031", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Influenza, canine - USA (07): (TX) H3N2 alert", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3364031", "date": "2015-05-16 04:59:00", "main_text": "INFLUENZA, CANINE - USA (07): (TEXAS) H3N2 ALERT\n************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 12 May 2015\nSource: ABC13, KTRK-TV [edited]\nhttp://abc13.com/pets/pet-owners-cautioned-to-watch-out-for-dog-flu/717245/\n\n\nLocal veterinarian offices are being warned to be on the lookout for canine influenza.

She has heard about H3N2 because of the ongoing outbreak in the Chicago area where it has sickened more than a thousand dogs and killed a half dozen.\n\nNow, for the 1st time, the virus is in Texas. A dog near Baytown tested positive for H3N2 after its owners moved to Beach City from Chicago.\n\n'It's really worrisome because it seemed like it was so far away and now that it is really close to home, it's scary because it can spread pretty quickly,' said Fleischmann.\n\nThe infected dog went to the vet last week [week of 4 May 2015] suffering from coughing, gagging, and failure to take in food and water.\n\nThe appearance of the virus in just one dog was enough for the Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services to send a warning to veterinarian offices and kennels to be on the lookout for sick dogs and to keep kennel surfaces, water bowls, collars and leashes clean because the virus is spread through saliva.\n\n'Clinics are going to have to very vigilant, kennels are going to have to be very vigilant, they are going to have to make sure the vaccines are ok, and when the animals come in, look at them,' said Houston Vet Alice Frei.\n\nFrei says while no vaccine is available for H3N2, a different canine flu vaccine is on the market and does offer some protection against H3N2.\n\nFrei says dogs that are around other dogs are more likely to develop H3N2 and like in humans, the very young and very old will suffer the extremes of the illness.\n\n'The puppy was probably going to get sicker than a middle aged dog or the adult dog and the older dog of course is at much higher risk,' said Frei.\n\nRemember, your dog must be exposed to the saliva of a sick dog to get the virus. The real concern now is that this is the beginning of the summer kennel season when thousands of family dogs are boarded when their owners go away on vacation.\n\nAsk your vet about the vaccine, ask your kennel if they've heard about the Texas case of canine flu and ask what the kennel is doing to protect dogs from getting sick.\n\n[Byline: Jeff Ehling]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There is a vaccine available for the H3N8 strain; however, it is currently unknown if the vaccine will provide protection from the new H3N2 strain.

The H3N2 strain originated in Asia and is believed to have sickened more than 1000 dogs in the Midwest.\n\nWhile not transferable to humans, it is extremely contagious to other dogs. Pet owners should keep sick animals at home if they suspect their dog could have the flu virus.\n\nPerry Creek Animal Hospital veterinarian Dr David Ray said he first treated the sick dog for flu-like signs on 20 Apr 2015. As of Monday afternoon [27 Apr 2015], he said the dog's owners reported his health was improving.\n\nLocal veterinarians are monitoring the outbreak. Ray said roughly half of Siouxland animal clinics have reported dogs experiencing flu-like symptoms, which include a dry cough, fever, loss of appetite, and nasal discharge.\n\nThe canine flu is not contagious to humans, said Ray. If it is the latest H3N2 strain, current vaccines are ineffective, he said.\n\nThe Siouxland Animal Adoption and Rescue Center, at 2400 Hawkeye Drive, hasn't had any sick dogs recently, said owner Cindy Rarrat. Normal precautions will be taken if that happens, she said.\n\n'We always have a quarantine section at the shelter,' she said. 'If they come in and are displaying any signs of sickness they automatically go to the quarantine section.'\n\nAlthough canine flu is extremely contagious -- the American Veterinary Medical Association estimates 80 percent of exposed dogs get the virus -- it isn't usually fatal, Ray said. Deaths usually occur only in unhealthy and old dogs. Ray estimates most dogs will show the flu-like symptoms for 5 to 7 days.\n\nDogs should avoid socialization with other dogs in public places, said Dr Aaron Bessmer of Elk Creek Animal Hospital, 6003 Morningside Ave. This includes dog parks, grooming places, and boarding centers.\n\n'It's just like the flu with people. If your dog is sick, obviously keep it away from other dogs,' Bessmer said. 'I would not take my dog out in areas where there are a lot of dogs.'\n\nDog owners should take their dogs to the vet if their pet shows any symptoms, said Bessmer.\n\n'The flu is something most dogs recover from, but it spreads very rapidly and they can get really sick from it,' Bessmer said.

One of the dogs lives in Winston-Salem. It's a hope-and-pray waiting game for Dr Sandra McAvoy. Her dog is now the 3rd confirmed case of H3N2 in North Carolina.\n\nIt's a strain of dog flu that's resistant to vaccines. We first learned of a large outbreak in Chicago back in April [2015]. 'And then it was quiet for a while and then all of a sudden we're hearing it again,' said McAvoy. 'I had somebody come in last week [week of 13 Jul 2015] and say there's a case in South Carolina and then there were a couple cases in Asheville this past week, and then my dog.' So where did it come from? Dr McAvoy is also fostering a dog from the Forsyth County Humane Society. She thinks it's possible that foster dog got her dog sick.\n\nOn [Thu 16 Jul 2015], the Society is closed and a sign on the door says it's for cleaning. Dr McAvoy says 2 dogs, including the one she's fostering, were showing respiratory disease [signs]. Those dogs came from Forsyth County Animal Control. The director said he's not surprised the flu has made it here. 'As the only open door shelter in Forsyth County, we've been anticipating seeing it as it's become prevalent or start showing up in North Carolina and we expect we'll see it in the future,' said Tim Jennings.\n\nThe state is also testing samples from a cluster of dogs in Greensboro that are showing similar signs. 'All dogs are at risk because this is something new, they've never been exposed,' said Dr McAvoy. 'They don't have any natural immunity to it. So it's probably going to run a course and then down the road we're going to have immune dogs, down the road we're going to have vaccines so the dogs will be vaccinated and they won't get it.'\n\nAs for Dr McAvoy's dog, she's recovering from pneumonia. The dog is being hand fed to encourage the her to eat. Dr McAvoy is hopeful she'll manage to pull through; 2 percent of the dogs that have caught this strain have died. Meantime, the state has set up a website to keep you in the loop when it comes to the dog flu.\n\nYou can't catch this strain from your dog, but you can pass it on to other dogs. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water and follow it with an alcohol based soap or sanitizer between every animal you pet or touch. If you have a dog, keep an eye out for signs and don't touch other dogs without washing your hands. Vets recommend not taking your dog to dog parks or any places where dogs gather.\n\nSigns for dog flu are similar to the human flu so if you notice your dog sneezing, or coughing or just seeming lethargic, take your pet to the veterinarian right away.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Canine influenza (CI), or dog flu, is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by 2 influenza A viruses. In the US, canine influenza has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the US, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain. In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate canine influenza virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia -- specifically, Korea, China, and Thailand. This H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs.\n\nTwo clinical syndromes have been seen in dogs infected with canine influenza viruses -- a mild form of the disease and a more severe form that is accompanied by pneumonia.\n\nMild form\n--------\nDogs suffering with the mild form of canine influenza develop a soft, moist cough that persists for 10 to 30 days. They may also be lethargic and have reduced appetite and a fever. Sneezing and discharge from the eyes and/or nose may also be observed. Some dogs have a dry cough similar to the traditional 'kennel cough' caused by _Bordetella bronchiseptica_/parainfluenza virus complex. Dogs with the mild form of influenza may also have a thick nasal discharge, which is usually caused by a secondary bacterial infection.\n\nSevere form\n-----------\nDogs with the severe form of canine influenza develop high fevers (104-106 deg F/40-41 deg C) and have clinical signs of pneumonia, such as increased respiratory rates and effort. Pneumonia may be due to a secondary bacterial infection.\n\nBecause this is still an emerging disease and dogs in the US have not been exposed to it before, almost all dogs, regardless of breed or age, lack immunity to it and are susceptible to infection if exposed to the active virus. Virtually all dogs exposed to the virus become infected, and nearly 80 percent show clinical signs of disease, though most exhibit the mild form described above.\n\nHowever, the risk of any dog being exposed to the canine influenza virus depends on that dog's lifestyle. Dogs that are frequently or regularly exposed to other dogs -- for example at boarding or day care facilities, dog parks, grooming salons, or social events with other dogs present -- are at greater risk of coming into contact with the virus. Also, as with other infectious diseases, extra precautions may be needed with puppies, elderly or pregnant dogs, and dogs that are immunocompromised. Dog owners should talk with their veterinarian to assess their dog's risk.\n\nFatal cases of pneumonia resulting from infection with canine influenza virus have been reported in dogs, but the fatality rate is low (less than 10 percent). Most dogs recover in 2-3 weeks.\n\nThe 1st recognized outbreak of canine influenza in the world is believed to have occurred in racing greyhounds in January 2004 at a track in Florida. From June to August of 2004, outbreaks of respiratory disease were reported at 14 tracks in 6 states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Texas, and West Virginia). Between January and May 2005, outbreaks occurred at 20 tracks in 11 states (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin). Canine influenza viruses have been reported in at least 30 states and Washington, DC.\n\nThe H3N2 strain of canine influenza virus had been reported in Korea, China, and Thailand, but had not been detected outside of those countries until 2015. In April 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was determined to be caused by an H3N2 strain that was genetically almost identical to the one in Asia.\n\nThe 1st canine vaccine for H3N8 canine influenza was approved in 2009, and there are several H3N8 canine influenza vaccines available. At this time, there is not an H3N2 vaccine available in the United States, and it is not known whether the H3N8 vaccine will offer any protection against the H3N2 strain. Canine influenza vaccines are considered 'lifestyle' vaccines, meaning the decision to vaccinate is based on a dog's risk of exposure. Dog owners should consult their veterinarian to determine whether vaccination is needed.\n\nCanine influenza virus can be spread via direct contact with respiratory secretions from infected dogs, and by contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Therefore, dog owners whose dogs are coughing or exhibiting other signs of respiratory disease should not participate in activities or bring their dogs to facilities where other dogs can be exposed to them. Clothing, equipment, surfaces, and hands should be cleaned and disinfected after exposure to dogs showing signs of respiratory disease to prevent transmission of infection to susceptible dogs. Clothing can be adequately cleaned by using a detergent at normal laundry temperatures.\n\nCanine influenza is not known to be transmissible from dogs to people. However, caretakers can inadvertently transmit canine influenza virus from infected dogs to susceptible dogs by not following good hygiene and infection control practices. To prevent spread of canine influenza virus, caretakers should take the following precautions:\n1. Wash hands with soap and water (if soap and water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner):\n- upon arriving at the facility;\n- before and after handling each animal;\n- after coming into contact with animal saliva, urine, feces, or blood;\n- after cleaning cages;\n- before eating meals, taking breaks, smoking, or leaving the facility;\n- before and after using the restroom\n2. Wear a barrier gown over your clothes and wear gloves when handling sick animals or cleaning cages. Discard gown and gloves before working with other animals.\n3. Consider use of goggles or face protection if splashes from contaminated surfaces may occur.\n4. Bring a change of clothes to wear home at the end of the day.\n5. Thoroughly clean clothes worn at the animal facility.\n6. Do not allow animals to 'kiss' you or lick your face.\n7. Do not eat in the animal care area.\n8. Separate newly arriving animals from animals that have been housed one week or longer.\n9. Routinely monitor animals for signs of illness. Separate sick animals from healthy animals, especially animals with signs of respiratory disease.\n\nThere is no evidence of transmission of canine influenza virus from dogs to people. However, because of concerns about diseases that are transmissible from dogs to people, in general, it may be prudent for young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons to limit or avoid contact with animals that are ill.\n\nThere is no evidence thus far that this strain of influenza can be transmitted between dogs and people or from dogs to cats.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Control-of-Canine-Influenza-in-Dogs.aspx - Mod.TG\n\nThe state of North Carolina can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/235.

Canine influenza is not known to be transmissible from dogs to people. The H3N2 strain of canine influenza virus had been reported in Korea, China, and Thailand, but had not been detected outside of those countries until 2015. \n\nThe state is also testing samples from a cluster of dogs in Greensboro that are showing similar signs. ' In the US, canine influenza has been caused by 2 influenza strains. Canine influenza viruses have been reported in at least 30 states and Washington, DC.\n\n In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate canine influenza virus, H3N2. Dr McAvoy says 2 dogs, including the one she's fostering, were showing respiratory disease [signs]. If you have a dog, keep an eye out for signs and don't touch other dogs without washing your hands.

Researchers at Cornell say results from additional testing indicate that the outbreak is being caused by a virus closely related to Asian strains of influenza A H3N2 viruses, currently in wide circulation in southern Chinese and South Korean dog populations since being identified in 2006. There is no evidence that it can be transmitted to humans.\n\nThe outbreak in the Midwest had been attributed to the H3N8 strain of virus, which was identified in the U.S. dog population in 2004 and has been circulating since. The H3N2 virus had not been previously detected in North America. The outbreak in Chicago suggests a recent introduction of the H3N2 virus from Asia.\n\nTesting of clinical samples from the outbreak conducted at The New York State Animal Diagnostic Laboratory at Cornell indicated that the virus was Influenza A. Further testing led researchers to believe a new strain was at fault. Subsequent testing, carried out with the assistance of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, identified the new subtype as H3N2. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, is sequencing 2 isolates from this outbreak, which were isolated at Cornell, to facilitate rapid complete characterization of the viruses.\n\nBoth Influenza strains can cause high fever, loss of appetite, coughing, nasal discharge, and lethargy. Signs may be more severe in cases caused by the H3N2 virus. Some infected dogs may not show signs at all.\n\nH3N2 has also caused infection and respiratory illness in cats.\n\nVeterinary professionals are advised that diagnostic testing of samples from sick pets can be done using a broadly targeted Influenza A matrix reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay (Rt-PCR). The canine-specific Influenza A H3N8 Rt-PCR in use in several laboratories will not detect this virus. Serology is also currently not available as the H3N2 virus is different enough from H3N8 that antibodies may not cross react. However, an H3N2-specific serologic assay is under development and will be available soon.\n\nIt is not known if the current vaccine will provide any protection from this new virus. It does protect against H3N8, which is in circulation in some areas. Other preventive advice remains the same: In areas where the viruses are active, avoid places where dogs congregate, such as dog parks and grooming salons.\n\nOwners of symptomatic dogs and cats should consult their veterinarians about testing and treatment.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nChanel Schwartzentruber\n<cschwart@mail.uoguelph.ca>\n\n[A new strain of influenza in dogs is big news, especially with a strain that has history in Asia. There are likely more questions than answers. For example, did the strain originate in birds? How did it adapt to dogs?

The hospital is awaiting confirmation of the exact strain, but veterinarians suspect it is the same strain that has now become an epidemic in the Midwest. The dog is recovering at home in Watertown.\n\nMore than 1700 cases of dog flu -- dubbed H3N2 -- have been confirmed in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin and Texas, the MSPCA said.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in late April 2015 that a genetic analysis of the new strain found no sign that it can infect or cause severe disease in humans.\n\nThe more common H3N8 canine flu, which has been circulating in the United States since 2004, also poses a low threat to humans.\n\nCornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) has been monitoring detections nationwide, and its most recent map as of 6 May 2015 shows that positive tests for the virus have come from 11 states: California, Texas, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Alabama, and Michigan.\n\nSince then, tests in Georgia and possibly in Ohio have detected H3N2 in dogs, which would raise the number of affected states to 13. The University of Georgia Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratories (UGVDL) announced on 19 May 2015 that the strain was detected in a dog from the metropolitan Atlanta area that had recently been in contact with other dogs at an Atlanta boarding facility.\n\nMeanwhile, a possible case was detected in the Ohio city of Newark this week, but a 2nd round of tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis, according to a 20 May 2015 statement from the Ohio State University (OSU) College of Veterinary Medicine. Joshua Daniels, DVM, PhD, associate clinical professor in veterinary clinical sciences, said, 'Because this is an emerging disease in a single animal in a new geographic area, it should be confirmed by a secondary test.'\n\nDetections outside of Illinois appear to be sporadic. But in the Chicago area, more than 1700 cases, including 8 known deaths, have been reported, the Chicago Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA) said in a 18 May 2015 statement. Donna Alexander, DVM, director of the Cook County department of animal and rabies control, urged dog owners to remain on heightened alert and said there has been no let-up in the number of severe canine respiratory cases in the Chicago area. The CVMA said that, because of the high risk of dog-to-dog spread, owners should take precautions and avoid allowing dogs to socialize with other dogs in settings such as training classes, kennels, doggie daycares, dog parks, and grooming facilities until further notice.\n\nThe Cornell AHDC, which has been heavily involved in testing samples, said in its background materials that all subtyped samples from the Chicago area have been the new H3N2 strain. Though the virus can be transmitted to cats, no cats have tested positive in the outbreak so far. Cornell experts said it's not known whether an H3N8 vaccine that is available for dogs offers any protection against the H3N2 strain. They said group settings pose the most risk, and -- as for other infectious diseases -- extra measures should be taken for puppies, older dogs, and those that have underlying health conditions. The Cornell group added that especially severe disease has been seen in some groups of greyhounds.\n\n[See the URL above for links to the following]:\nCornell AHDC canine influenza testing map\nApr 13 CIDRAP News scan 'New H3N2 virus implicated in Chicago canine flu outbreak'\nApr 29 CIDRAP News scan 'CDC study suggests dog flu virus poses little threat to humans'\nMay 19 UGVDL statement\nMay 20 OSU College of Veterinary Medicine press release\nMay 18 CVMA press release\nCornell AHDC canine influenza virus FAQ\nCornell AHDC H3N2 FAQ\n\n[byline: Lisa Schnirring]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Both of these articles indicate that this influenza virus is on the move.

No ongoing human-to-human transmission has been identified and the case [did report] close contact with swine in the week prior to illness onset. Public health and agriculture officials are investigating the extent of disease among humans and swine and no increases in influenza-like illness in the community have been reported.\n\nGenetic sequencing of the H3N2v virus conducted at CDC showed that this virus has the nucleoprotein (NP) and the matrix (M) gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus, which is a slightly different combination of internal genes than H3N2v viruses reported in previous years. However, this H3N2v virus has the same genetic composition as influenza viruses previously isolated from swine in the US this summer [2014].\n\nIn 2013, the CDC tallied 19 H3N2v from 5 states, while in 2012, the federal health agency reported 309 cases. The 1st year the novel influenza virus surfaced was 2011 when 12 people were reportedly infected. H3N2v is a non-human influenza virus that normally circulates in pigs and that has infected humans. Viruses that normally circulate in pigs are 'swine influenza viruses.' When these viruses infect humans, they are termed 'variant' viruses.\n\nSymptoms of H3N2v infection in people are similar to those of seasonal flu viruses and can include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, and possibly other symptoms, such as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Infections with influenza viruses (including variant viruses like H3N2v) can sometimes cause severe disease, even in healthy people. This can include complications, such as pneumonia, which may require hospitalization, and sometimes results in death.\n\nPeople who are at high risk of developing complications if they get influenza include children younger than 5 years of age, people 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As far as I can tell, this is the 1st case of influenza A H3N2v to occur in a human this year (2014).

The boy, who had been vaccinated against the flu, nevertheless still succumbed to what might have been the 2nd deadly case of an H3N2 virus, according to the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control. The previous victim was a man older than 90, with neither case being protected by the vaccines because they [were infected with a mutated strain] of H3N2, the [Taiwan] CDC said. The same virus killed 21 adults in Hong Kong within just 1 week, reports said.\n\nTests at laboratories showed that 27 percent of H3N2 cases belonged to the new type, which could lead to serious complications if the patient failed to seek medical care in time, the [Taiwan] CDC said. In Hong Kong, the proportion was reportedly as high as 70 percent, making effective treatment even more difficult. According to experts, the H3N2 flu was the type most likely to convert itself into new forms in order to escape treatment. Over the past few decades, various types, named as the Fujian and the Sydney flu, had appeared and evolved to create relatively high fatality counts, physicians said.\n\nIn the future, H3N2 could only grow stronger and more dangerous, causing more deaths than previous types, according to experts. Children would be the most susceptible victims because of their low resistance and because they would not be protected by vaccinations in the case of new flu types. The boy who died last week had been vaccinated last November [2014] but showed signs of fever and coughing on 9 Jan 2015, the [Taiwan] CDC said. After 3 visits to a clinic, he began to suffer severe breathing problems, which led his parents to take him to another medical center on 13 Jan 2015. The boy died at the intensive care ward of a hospital on 15 Jan 2015, within the space of one week after the signs of the flu emerged.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This death was reported by Taiwan on Fri 23 Jan 2015. It occurred at the same time as Taiwan is suffering from its most severe [H5] avian influenza outbreak in over the past decade. Over 2300 people employed at poultry farms across 9 counties are being monitored. Over 400 000 poultry have been culled since the H5 [not H3] strain of avian flu struck 2 weeks ago (http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/video/2015-01/25/c_133945147.htm).\n\nThe mutation in H3N2 referred to in this report was discussed on 8 Dec 2014 in a report from The Pulse (http://wyomingmedicalcenter.org/pulse/2014/12/08/dr-mark-dowell-urges-flu-shots-despite-mutated-h3n2-strain/): Dr Mark Dowell urges flu shots despite mutated H3N2 strain (byline: Kristy Bleizeffer):\n\n'Last week [week of 1 Dec 2014], the [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the 2014-2015 flu vaccine is not as protective as hoped for the seasonal influenza A H3N2 virus, a strain found to be most common so far this year. About half of the H3N2 viruses tested are 'drift variants,' meaning they've mutated to a form not protected by the vaccine, the [US] CDC said.'\n\nTypically, the flu vaccine is about 70 percent protective in the typical adult population. In older adults -- those 65 and older -- the vaccine is 40 to 50 percent protective. 'But this year [2014-15], across the board, the vaccine is probably around 50 percent protective. It could not have been predicted. The virus played its own game and changed a little. This is our battle against nature every year,' Dowell said.\n\nThe unfortunate death of the child in Taiwan [from the H3 virus] was most likely the consequence of lack of protection from the vaccine and unrelated to the severe avian flu [H5 virus] outbreak.\n\nInfluenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs are called 'variant' viruses when they are found in people. Influenza A H3N2 variant viruses (also known as 'H3N2v' viruses) infections have mostly been associated with prolonged exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs. Limited human-to-human spread of this virus has been detected in the past but no sustained or community spread of H3N2v has been identified.

But contrary to widespread rumor, there is no hard data yet, nor even strong circumstantial evidence, to link the H3N2 outbreak to rescues of dogs from Asian meat markets.\n\nRescue agencies in recent months are known to have transported fewer than 100 dogs to the US from the regions of Asia where the H3N2 canine influenza virus occurs. None of those dogs are known to have reached the US Midwest. While the possibility of the H3N2 virus moving with a rescue dog cannot be totally excluded, there are many other ways in which it might have come to the US.\n\nThe simplest scenario might be that an infected sniffer dog might have sneezed while inspecting outbound cargo at an Asian airport. The H3N2 virus -- or almost any flu virus -- could remain alive and infectious for far longer than the 13:35 duration of a flight from Seoul to Chicago.\n\nUpon arrival in Chicago, a US sniffer dog inspecting incoming cargo might have inhaled the virus. Since most dogs do not suffer severe clinical signs from canine influenzas, and since the viruses usually have an incubation period of up to a week, the infected US dog might have spread the virus to any number of others before any US dogs fell seriously ill.\n\nThe H3N2 virus was detected in the US, CBS News reported on 5 Apr 2015, 'after several dogs at PetSmart boarding facilities got sick. The company temporarily closed 3 Chicago-area locations to be disinfected.'\n\nThe hum increased to a shriek after Audie Cornish of National Public Radio on 15 Apr 2015 interviewed Edward Dubovi of the Cornell University Department of Population Medicine & Diagnostics and Cornell School of Veterinary Medicine. 'The outbreak really went into full force around the Easter holiday,' explained Dubovi, 'when a number of people probably put their dogs into kennels, and so you had maybe a higher collection of dogs in smaller environments. And so this thing (the virus) had an opportunity to expand very rapidly.\n\n'We've had a [canine influenza] virus in the dog population in the United States since 2004,' Dubovi continued, referring to an outbreak of canine influenza that began among racing greyhounds. But that outbreak turned out to be a mutated form of the H3N8 equine influenza virus, identified in racehorses for more than 40 years. Occurring in racehorses in 13 nations during 2004, H3N8 somehow jumped into greyhounds at tracks in 11 US states -- several of which were dual-purpose tracks, used for both horse and greyhound racing, or had been used for both horse and greyhound racing at some time in the past.\n\n'As we did some subsequent testing and the outbreak got a bit bigger,' Dubovi went on, 'it became evident that this was not the normal canine influenza virus that we have been seeing in the US. And the preliminary evidence so far is that this virus is probably one that came out of Asia. And as it turns out, our requirements for movement of companion animals into the United States are fairly lax. And we certainly have situations now,' Dubovi speculated, 'where animal rescue groups are rescuing dogs in China and Korea from their meat markets, and we know for a fact that, in fact, some of those dogs have found their way into the Chicago area.'\n\nAsked by ANIMALS 24-7 for particulars of that allegation, Dubovi offered none, but referred ANIMALS 24-7 to Maddie's Fund assistant professor of shelter medicine Cynda Crawford, of the University of Florida at Gainesville. Crawford, the lead researcher in identifying the H3N8 canine influenza virus in 2004, had recently been in Chicago investigating the H3N2 outbreak, Dubovi said. 'I generally keep to the business of disease diagnostics and test reporting,' Dubovi told ANIMALS 24-7. 'I have probably reviewed most of the papers out of China and Korea about H3N2 and have been concerned about the appearance of this virus in the US, as it appears to be more pathogenic than our H3N8,' Dubovi added.\n\nCynda Crawford had more questions than answers. Crawford was aware that Humane Society International (HIS) and the Change for Animals Foundation in January 2015 flew 23 dogs who had been rescued from a dog meat farm from Seoul, South Korea to Washington, DC. Two months later, in March 2015, HSI and the Change for Animals Foundation flew another 57 dogs from a South Korean dog meat farm to San Francisco [California].\n\nBut the 1st 23 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, the Fairfax County Animal Shelter, the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, the City of Manassas Animal Control & Adoption Shelter, Loudoun County Animal Services [all in Virginia], and the Washington Animal Rescue League [in Washington, DC] -- all about 700 miles from Chicago.\n\nThe 2nd 57 South Korean dogs were re-homed by the San Francisco SPCA, the East Bay SPCA, the Marin Humane Society, and the Sacramento SPCA [all in California] -- all more than 2000 miles from Chicago.\n\n'I am afraid I don't have any more information than what can be found on the Internet,' Crawford told ANIMALS 24-7. 'I certainly support the laudable work of HSI, the Change for Animals Foundation, the Asia Canine Protection Alliance, and other international animal welfare groups to stop the dog meat farming and trade. There is no evidence that I know of for inadvertent introduction of the Asian H3N2 virus via their efforts.\n\n'The importation of South Korean dogs to shelters in north Virginia in early January would be within the time frame of the start of the Chicago cases in late January/early February,' Crawford acknowledged. 'However, I do not know if any of these Korean dogs or any dogs that had contact with them made it to Chicago. I am curious if the dogs had respiratory signs on arrival to stateside shelters, or shortly thereafter, and were considered to have 'kennel cough' associated with the stress of long distance travel. It would also be interesting to know if any of the resident dogs in the receiving shelters developed 'kennel cough' after the arrival of the Korean dogs.'\n\nBut several layers of biosecurity requirements for importing dogs into the US -- if observed -- would appear to preclude any of the dogs rescued by Humane Society International and the Change for Animals Foundation being infected with H3N2.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control & Prevention [CDC] requires dogs 'be vaccinated against rabies and be healthy upon arrival,' summarizes https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/461/~/quarantine-requirements-for-imported-dogs,-including-puppies.\n\n'Dogs that have never been vaccinated against rabies must be vaccinated at least 30 days before entering the United States,' the site adds. 'Puppies must not be vaccinated against rabies before 3 months of age, so the youngest that a puppy can be imported into the United States is 4 months of age. The rabies vaccination requirement applies to all dogs including service animals. The only exception is for dogs arriving from areas designated as being rabies-free who have lived there for at least the last 6 months or since birth.'\n\nThe CDC requirement implies that imported dogs must have been under health observation and in secure custody, if not actual quarantine, for more than 4 times longer than the normal incubation period for canine influenza.\n\nThe USDA Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service on 18 Aug 2014 introduced an even stricter rule governing the import of dogs 'from any part of the world into the continental United States or Hawaii for purposes of resale, research, or veterinary treatment, unless the dogs are in good health, have received all necessary vaccinations, and are at least 6 months of age,' according to the regulatory language. Specifically, USDA-APHIS requires vaccinations for rabies and distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Moreover, the USDA-APHIS rule was introduced with text specifically rejecting exemptions for 'imports for rescue purposes.'\n\n'Because the canine flu viruses are a quick-hit virus with short shedding periods,' explained Crawford, 'it would seem difficult to import an infected dog who was still in the contagious period. That said,' Crawford cautioned, 'the biggest flu outbreak in Australia occurred in horses in 2007. Australia was an equine influenza-free country and this status was maintained by strict quarantine of imported horses for 3 weeks. In 2007, equine influenza virus was brought into the country via an infected horse, possibly due to a breach in quarantine, and the virus spread like wildfire to hundreds of horses with many deaths. Like the canine virus, the equine flu virus also is a quick-hit, short shedding period (7 days) virus.'\n\n'The H3N2 virus,' Crawford elaborated, 'is typically shed for 7 days, possibly 10 days in some cases. The incubation period is typically 2-3 days, meaning the virus is already in day 2-3 of its short 7-10 day shedding cycle by the time dogs start coughing. A subset of dogs have subclinical infection -- they shed virus for a few days but do not display clinical signs. The flu viruses do not persist in the environment for more than 12-24 hours, depending on ambient conditions,' meaning that H3N2 might survive outside of a host animal for the duration of a direct flight from South East Asia, but would probably not survive for longer unless flown in a frozen form. 'Flu viruses can be viable after freeze/thawing,' Crawford noted.\n\nBut while the temperatures in aircraft holds often dropped below freezing in earlier generations of high-flying jets, the Boeing and Airbus jets usually used on transoceanic flights today typically maintain hold temperatures of close to 40 degrees Fahrenheit [5 degrees Celsius].\n\n'Obviously, there are many potential routes by which this virus could breach our borders,' Crawford said. 'We may never know how the H3N2 virus was introduced into the US -- the most important thing right now is finding out how to stop the spread.'\n\n'There are likely more questions than answers,' agreed Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases infectious disease moderator Tam Garland of Texas A&M University, at http://www.promedmail.org. 'For example, did the strain originate in birds? How did it adapt to dogs? How long did it take to adapt to dogs if it came from avians? Did it pass through an intermediate host such as humans or pigs prior to adapting to dogs? Does it present a risk to humans? The risk to humans is likely small,' Garland anticipated, 'or we would have had affected human caretakers of these affected dogs coming down with this strain of the flu.'\n\nResponded Crawford to the question of avian origin, which might suggest a link to the illegal but extensive commerce between the US and Southeast Asia in gamecocks, 'The H3N2 canine virus evolved from avian H3N2 viruses in Korea, but several mutations have occurred over the years associated with adaptation to the dog as the new host. I think these mutations have distanced the dog virus from the bird virus. There are several published papers on the phylogenetics of the dog H3N2 virus compared to avian and human H3N2 viruses.'\n\nConcerning the potential risk to humans, Dubovi told Audie Cornish of NPR, 'Right now we have no evidence that the virus is moving from the dogs into the human population,' but that does not mean such a cross-species infection could not happen. 'If you had a sick dog in your house,' Dubovi said, 'you could transmit the virus to another animal in the house through what we call fomites -- just saliva, or if a dog sneezes on you, and you move to another animal.' Dubovi warned that 'The Asian variety of the flu also can infect cats. There is a vaccine against the US variety,' Dubovi said, but cautioned, 'We are unable at this point in time to indicate whether or not it will afford any protection against the virus we think is coming from Asia. 'The best thing to do right now until this calms down,' Dubovi advised, 'is to keep dogs separated as much as possible. The fewer contacts your dog has with another dog, the lesser the chance of it picking this particular virus up, or any other virus for that matter.'\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nMerritt Clifton\nEditor\nhttp://www.animals24-7.org\n\n[Subsequent to this posting on Animals 27-7, it was noted by Mr Clifton:\n\n'After posting 'Canine influenza, dog meat, & the rescue connection,' I became aware of an independent rescuer, not affiliated with any organization larger than her own, who claims to have imported 23 dogs from South Korea, 1 or 2 at a time, between January 2014 and late January 2015.

Since most dogs do not suffer severe clinical signs from canine influenzas, and since the viruses usually have an incubation period of up to a week, the infected US dog might have spread the virus to any number of others before any US dogs fell seriously ill. Like the canine virus, the equine flu virus also is a quick-hit, short shedding period (7 days) virus.' \n\nThe USDA Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service on 18 Aug 2014 introduced an even stricter rule governing the import of dogs 'from any part of the world into the continental United States or Hawaii for purposes of resale, research, or veterinary treatment, unless the dogs are in good health, have received all necessary vaccinations, and are at least 6 months of age,' according to the regulatory language. \n\n'We've had a [canine influenza] virus in the dog population in the United States since 2004,' Dubovi continued, referring to an outbreak of canine influenza that began among racing greyhounds. The incubation period is typically 2-3 days, meaning the virus is already in day 2-3 of its short 7-10 day shedding cycle by the time dogs start coughing. \n\n'Because the canine flu viruses are a quick-hit virus with short shedding periods,' explained Crawford, 'it would seem difficult to import an infected dog who was still in the contagious period. \n\nConcerning the potential risk to humans, Dubovi told Audie Cornish of NPR, 'Right now we have no evidence that the virus is moving from the dogs into the human population,' but that does not mean such a cross-species infection could not happen.

In 2007, equine influenza virus was brought into the country via an infected horse, possibly due to a breach in quarantine, and the virus spread like wildfire to hundreds of horses with many deaths. Rescue agencies in recent months are known to have transported fewer than 100 dogs to the US from the regions of Asia where the H3N2 canine influenza virus occurs. But several layers of biosecurity requirements for importing dogs into the US -- if observed -- would appear to preclude any of the dogs rescued by Humane Society International and the Change for Animals Foundation being infected with H3N2. The H3N2 virus -- or almost any flu virus -- could remain alive and infectious for far longer than the 13:35 duration of a flight from Seoul to Chicago. \n\n'As we did some subsequent testing and the outbreak got a bit bigger,' Dubovi went on, 'it became evident that this was not the normal canine influenza virus that we have been seeing in the US.

The outbreak really went into full force around the Easter holiday,' explained Dubovi, 'when a number of people probably put their dogs into kennels, and so you had maybe a higher collection of dogs in smaller environments. A subset of dogs have subclinical infection -- they shed virus for a few days but do not display clinical signs. \n\n'The H3N2 virus,' Crawford elaborated, 'is typically shed for 7 days, possibly 10 days in some cases.

It would also be interesting to know if any of the resident dogs in the receiving shelters developed 'kennel cough' after the arrival of the Korean dogs.'

It supersedes the last H3N2v-related HAN Health Advisory, HAN 325, which was issued 3 Aug 2012.\n\nBackground\n----------\nThe 1st cases of influenza A (H3N2) variant1 (H3N2v) virus infection this year were reported in June 2013. These cases were associated with exposure to swine at an agricultural fair prior to illness onset. H3N2v viruses with the matrix (M) gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus were 1st detected in people in 2011 and were responsible for a multi-state outbreak [in the US] in the summer of 2012 that resulted in 306 cases, including 16 hospitalizations and one fatality. Genetic sequencing by CDC has confirmed that H3N2v viruses isolated in June 2013 are nearly identical to those detected during summer 2012. Most cases of H3N2v identified during 2012 were associated with exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs. Agricultural fairs take place across the United States every year, primarily during the summer months and into early fall. Many fairs have swine barns, where pigs from different places come in close contact with each other and with people. These venues may allow spread of influenza viruses both among pigs and between pigs and people. Data indicate that infected pigs may spread influenza viruses even if they are not symptomatic (e.g., coughing and/or sneezing). Although instances of limited person-to-person spread of this virus have been identified in the past, sustained or community-wide transmission of H3N2v has not occurred.\n\nClinical characteristics of the 2012 and 2013 H3N2v cases have been generally consistent with those of seasonal influenza, and have included fever, cough, pharyngitis, myalgia, and headache. Of the 16 H3N2v hospitalized patients, most were at increased risk for complications of influenza because of age or the presence of an underlying medical condition. None of the persons ill with 2013 H3N2v infection have been hospitalized, and no deaths have occurred among them.\n\nRapid detection and characterization of novel influenza viruses remain important components of national efforts to prevent further cases and evaluate clinical illness associated with these viruses. As a result, clinicians are reminded to consider influenza as a possible diagnosis when evaluating patients with acute respiratory illnesses, and clinicians should consider the possibility of H3N2v in persons presenting with respiratory illness and recent swine contact or attendance at an agricultural fair. The H3N2v case definitions for 2013 (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/case-definitions.htm) include laboratory-confirmed cases and cases under investigation for H3N2v virus infection; the probable case definition used in 2012 has been deleted.\n\nCDC anticipates that state health departments will identify more H3N2v cases in 2013 as agricultural fair season continues. The number of cases may exceed those identified last year, and CDC recommends a surveillance strategy for 2013 designed primarily to identify increases in person-to-person transmission or clinical severity. Testing for H3N2v should focus primarily on persons with exposures known to be associated with H3N2v virus infection (e.g., fair attendance) and in settings where person-to-person transmission has been identified previously (e.g., influenza-like illness outbreaks in child-care centers). For more information on 2013 testing recommendations, please see http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-surveillance.htm. Novel influenza A virus infections, which include those caused by H3N2v, remain notifiable conditions in the United States, and all confirmed cases should be reported to CDC within 24 hours.\n\nRecommendations for H3N2v for clinicians, public health practitioners, and the public for the summer and fall of 2013 are summarised below.\n\nRecommendations for Health Care Providers and Public Health Practitioners\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n- Clinicians who suspect influenza in persons with recent exposure to swine should obtain a nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate from the patient, place the swab or aspirate in viral transport medium, and contact their state or local health department to arrange transport and request a timely diagnosis at a state public health laboratory.\n- Commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) may not detect H3N2v virus in respiratory specimens. Therefore, a negative rapid influenza diagnostic test result does not exclude infection with H3N2v or any influenza virus. In addition, a positive test result for influenza A cannot confirm H3N2v virus infection, because these tests cannot distinguish between influenza A virus subtypes (i.e., they do not differentiate between other human influenza A viruses and H3N2v virus). Therefore, respiratory specimens should be collected and sent for sub-type specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing at a state public health laboratory.\n- Enhanced surveillance for influenza during agricultural fair season is recommended to facilitate timely detection and investigation of H3N2v cases. Recommendations for influenza surveillance and testing can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-surveillance.htm.\n- Clinicians should consider antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir in patients with suspected or confirmed H3N2v virus infection. Antiviral treatment is most effective when started as soon as possible after influenza illness onset. For more information on antiviral treatment for H3N2v virus infections, please see http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-treatment.htm.\n\nRecommendations for the Public\n---------------------------\n- Persons who are at high risk for influenza complications should avoid exposure to pigs and swine barns at fairs this year.\n- Persons engaging in activities that may involve swine contact at fairs should wash their hands frequently with soap and running water before and after exposure to animals; avoid eating or drinking in animal areas; and avoid close contact with animals that look or act ill. For additional information, please see http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-fairs-factsheet.htm.\n- Patients with influenza-like illness who are at high risk for influenza complications should see their health care provider promptly to determine if treatment with antiviral medications is warranted.\n- Patients who experience influenza-like symptoms following direct or close contact with pigs and who seek medical care should inform their health care provider about the exposure.\n- Influenza viruses have not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and prepared pork or other products derived from pigs.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka", "summary": "In addition, a positive test result for influenza A cannot confirm H3N2v virus infection, because these tests cannot distinguish between influenza A virus subtypes (i.e., they do not differentiate between other human influenza A viruses and H3N2v virus). -------------------------------------------------------------\n- Clinicians who suspect influenza in persons with recent exposure to swine should obtain a nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate from the patient, place the swab or aspirate in viral transport medium, and contact their state or local health department to arrange transport and request a timely diagnosis at a state public health laboratory.

Rapid detection and characterization of novel influenza viruses remain important components of national efforts to prevent further cases and evaluate clinical illness associated with these viruses. The 1st cases of influenza A (H3N2) variant1 (H3N2v) virus infection this year were reported in June 2013. \n- Clinicians should consider antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir in patients with suspected or confirmed H3N2v virus infection. H3N2v viruses with the matrix (M) gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus were 1st detected in people in 2011 and were responsible for a multi-state outbreak [in the US] in the summer of 2012 that resulted in 306 cases, including 16 hospitalizations and one fatality.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": ["influenza-like illness"], "event_date": ["2040-03-25 00:00:00", "2012-03-25 00:00:00", "2013-06-25 00:00:00", "2009-03-25 00:00:00", "2013-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Background", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2095131", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Influenza, canine - China: H3N2 avian origin, RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2095131", "date": "2013-12-05 20:44:41", "main_text": "INFLUENZA, CANINE - CHINA: H3N2 AVIAN ORIGIN, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 4 Dec 2013 [accessed]\nSource: Infection, Genetics and Evolution, cited by Flutrackers [edited]\nhttp://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=214497\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24298574\n\n\nAvian-origin H3N2 canine influenza virus circulating in farmed dogs in Guangdong, China.

However, little is known about the prevalence situation of H3N2 CIV infections in farmed dogs in China. This is the 1st systematic epidemiological surveillance of CIV in different dog populations in Southern China.\n\nTwo virus strains -- A/Canine/Guangdong/1/2011(H3N2) and A/canine/Guangdong/5/2011(H3N2) -- were isolated from canine nasal swabs collected at one dog farm in Guangzhou and the other farm in Shenzhen. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of 8 gene segments of these viruses revealed that they were most similar to the newly isolated canine H3N2 viruses in dogs and cats from Korea and China, which originated from an avian strain. This indicates that H3N2 CIV may be a common pathogen for pet and farmed dog populations in southern China at present.\n\nSerological surveillance has shown that the infection rates of this avian-origin canine influenza in farmed dogs and in pet dogs were 12.22 and 5.3 percent, respectively, as determined by ELISA. The data also suggested that transmission occurred, most probably by close contact, between H3N2 CIV infected dogs in different dog populations in recent years.\n\nAs H3N2 outbreaks among dogs continue in Guangdong Province (located very close to Hong Kong), [in densely populated areas with frequent animal trade], there is a continued risk for pet H3N2 CIV infections and for mutations or genetic reassortment leading to new virus strains with increased transmissibility among dogs. Further in-depth study is required, as H3N2 CIV has been established in different dog populations and poses a potential threat to public health.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The text of the full paper concluded with the following segment: '...although no direct transmission of H3N2 CIV from dogs to humans has been reported, it is possible that the CIV may generate a new pandemic outbreak, which poses a great threat to our human life. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring dogs in pet hospitals and on dog farms; furthermore, the development of a canine H3N2 vaccine is extremely urgent.'\n\nThe initial genome announcement of the H3N2 canine strain from Guangdong was published in September 2012.\n\nReference\nShuo Su, Nan Cao, Jidang Chen, Furong Zhao, Huatao Li, Mingxi Zhao, Yanjing Wang, Zhen Huang, Liguo Yuan, Heng Wang (2012).

An international team from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Australia, Russia, and the United States reported their findings in the 22 Nov 2013 issue of Science [abstract reproduced below]. The team looked at genetic sequences of representative H3N2 viruses from 11 antigenic clusters that emerged during the 35-year period, a time that followed the appearance of the strain in humans. Their goal was to pinpoint the substitutions that drove the antigenic changes.

From 1968 to 2003, antigenic change was caused mainly by single amino acid substitutions, which occurred at only 7 positions in HA immediately adjacent to the receptor binding site. Most of these substitutions were involved in antigenic change more than once. Equivalent positions were responsible for the recent antigenic changes of influenza B and A/H1N1 viruses. Substitution of a single amino acid at one of these positions substantially changed the virus-specific antibody response in infected ferrets. These findings have potentially far-reaching consequences for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that govern influenza viruses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Editors added the following comment to put these data in perspective.\n\n'5 antigenic sites in the virus surface hemagglutinin protein, which together comprise 131 amino acid positions, are thought to determine the full scope of antigenic drift of influenza A virus. Koel et al show that major antigenic change can be caused by single amino acid substitutions. These single substitutions substantially skew the way the immune system 'sees' the virus. All substitutions of importance are located next to the receptor-binding site in the hemagglutinin. Because there are few positions of importance for antigenic drift, there are strict biophysical limitations to the substitutions at these positions, which restricts the number of new antigenic drift variants at any point in time.

It was not the sick child's pig that tested positive for the virus, but another exhibition animal at the same fair, said Bridget Patrick, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [MDARD].\n\nAs a result of the illnesses, the health and agriculture officials have launched an extensive multi-state outreach to meat processing plants that bought pigs from the Berrien County Fair, to make them aware of the potential exposure to their employees who may have come into contact with the live pigs shipped for slaughter. Meat from the pigs, all healthy at the time of slaughter at the end of the fair, is safe to eat and cannot transmit the disease, said Dr. James Averill, MDARD Animal Industry Division Director and State Veterinarian. State health and agriculture officials are working with the Berrien County Youth Fair board to reach out to swine exhibitors who attended the fair to identify additional illnesses. Patrick said 234 exhibitors showed 300 pigs at that fair.\n\nThe incubation period for this influenza, like the usual seasonal influenza, is 1 to 7 days; and most commonly 2 days. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be new cases from direct exposure at the recent Berrien County Youth Fair, which ran from [12-17 Aug 2013], officials said. The MDARD has notified managers at upcoming fairs in Hillsdale, St. Joseph, Allegan, Chippewa, Dickenson and Presque Isle counties, as well as fairs in Saline and Novi, reminding them of swine exhibit hygiene and screening practices designed to prevent the spread of illness. Initial information was circulated earlier this year [2013] after flu outbreaks in neighboring states of Ohio and Indiana, Patrick said.\n\n'Berrien County Youth Fair had hand washing stations, posters, and good biosecurity practices in place, and it's important that all fairs continue these practices.' Symptoms of H3N2v infection in people are similar to those of seasonal flu viruses and can include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, and possibly other symptoms, such as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Infections with influenza viruses can sometimes cause severe disease, even in healthy people. This can include complications, such as pneumonia, which may require hospitalization, and sometimes results in death.\n\n'While this variant flu virus has rarely been shown to spread from person to person, we remain on the lookout for such secondary cases. In addition, any individual with flu-like symptoms at this time, prior to the traditional flu season, should contact his or her medical provider and local health department,' said Dr. Rick Johansen, Medical Director of the Berrien County Health Department. 'While Michigan did see a handful of H3N2v cases in 2012, this 1st case for 2013 should serve as an important reminder of the simple steps that can be taken to protect our health as we would with any flu season,' said Dr. Matthew Davis, Chief Medical Executive with the Michigan Department of Community Health.\n\n'Washing your hands, covering your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough, and staying home when you feel sick are some of the best ways to protect yourself and others from becoming ill.'\n\n[Byline: Rosemary Parker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The distinctive feature of this case is that the pig brought to the fair by the child who contracted influenza was uninfected, and the child's infection originated from another animal being displayed at the fair. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/8cL-.]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The distinctive feature of this case is that the pig brought to the fair by the child who contracted influenza was uninfected, and the child's infection originated from another animal being displayed at the fair.

All individuals visited the Grant County Agricultural Fair, 16-22 Jun 2013, prior to illness, and at least 2 had contact with swine. Variant influenza A(H3N2)v was identified in Indiana last year, with a total of 138 cases in 2012.\n\nThe Indiana State Department of Health and the Grant County Health Department continue to investigate these cases. Human infections with (H3N2)v are rare but have most commonly occurred after close proximity to live infected pigs, such as working with them in barns and livestock exhibits at fairs. Influenza viruses are not transmitted by eating pork and pork products. According to the State Board of Animal Health, 13 pigs at the fair tested positive for H3N2. It is not uncommon for pigs to be infected with swine influenza viruses but not show any signs of illness. If ill with influenza they typically recover.\n\n'Fairs are a great way to get outdoors, have some fun and learn about agriculture,' said State Health Commissioner William VanNess, MD 'If you plan to attend a fair this summer, just be sure to wash your hands frequently and avoid taking food into areas where animals are kept.' Symptoms of variant influenza A include: fever, cough, sore throat, chills, headache and muscle aches. Diarrhea and nausea may occur in children. Symptoms can begin approximately one to four days after being exposed to the illness and last from two to seven days.\n\nAs several county fairs will open in the next few weeks, State health officials are increasing surveillance for influenza-like illness. 'We are increasing our surveillance so we can learn more about this virus and because antiviral treatment is most effective if given within 48 hours,' said Dr VanNess. 'It's important to contact your health care provider if you begin experiencing flu-like symptoms.' And if you have visited a fair or been around animals, let your health care provider know.

Wash hands with soap and water before and after petting or touching any animal. Never eat, drink or put anything in your mouth when visiting animal areas, and avoid face-to-face contact with animals. People at high risk for flu complications should avoid close contact with swine in the fair setting particularly.\n\nWhile influenza is not an uncommon diagnosis in pigs, the State Board of Animal Health encourages swine owners to contact a veterinarian if their animals show signs consistent with flu, including coughing, respiratory illness, off-feed, and fever.

As always good hygiene and other everyday preventive actions are important to take as well. Wash your hands frequently. Cough or sneeze into your sleeve or elbow. Avoid contact with people or animals that are ill. Stay home if you develop influenza symptoms and contact your health care provider.\n\nIn 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 309 infections with (H3N2)v in the United States.

The previously healthy student started having symptoms on 25 Apr [2013] and went to the hospital the next day when they worsened. There, 2 throat swabs were taken, and rapid testing showed influenza A. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in Nanjing indicated influenza A, H7, and H3. Virus isolation yielded H7N9 and H3N2 viruses. The H7N9 virus was highly similar to a Zhejiang strain, and the H3N2 virus was closely related to currently circulating seasonal H3N2 viruses, according to the report. The boy was admitted to the hospital where he received oseltamivir (Tamiflu) treatment. He recovered on 2 May [2013].

This strain, known as H3N2, spread around the globe and eventually killed an estimated 1 million people. A new study from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] reveals that there are many strains of H3N2 circulating in birds and pigs that are genetically similar to the 1968 strain and have the potential to generate a pandemic if they leap to humans. The researchers, led by Ram Sasisekharan, the Alfred H Caspary Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT, also found that current flu vaccines might not offer protection against these strains. 'There are indeed examples of H3N2 that we need to be concerned about,' says Sasisekharan, who is also a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. 'From a pandemic-preparedness point of view, we should potentially start including some of these H3 strains as part of influenza vaccines.' The study, which appears in the [10 May 2013] issue of the journal Scientific Reports, also offers the World Health Organization and public health agencies' insight into viral strains that should raise red flags if detected.\n\nInfluenza evolution\n-------------------\nIn the past 100 years, influenza viruses that emerged from pigs or birds have caused several notable flu pandemics. When one of these avian or swine viruses gains the ability to infect humans, it can often evade the immune system, which is primed to recognize only strains that commonly infect humans. Strains of H3N2 have been circulating in humans since the 1968 pandemic, but they have evolved to a less dangerous form that produces a nasty seasonal flu. However, H3N2 strains are also circulating in pigs and birds. Sasisekharan and his colleagues wanted to determine the risk of H3N2 strains re-emerging in humans, whose immune systems would no longer recognize the more dangerous forms of H3N2. This type of event has a recent precedent: In 2009, a strain of H1N1 emerged that was very similar to the virus that caused a 1918 pandemic that killed 50 million to 100 million people. 'We asked if that could happen with H3,' Sasisekharan says. 'You would think it's more readily possible with H3 because we observe that there seems to be a lot more mixing of H3 between humans and swine.'\n\nGenetic similarities\n--------------------\nIn the new study, the researchers compared the 1968 H3N2 strain and about 1100 H3 strains now circulating in pigs and birds, focusing on the gene that codes for the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. After comparing HA genetic sequences in five key locations that control the viruses' interactions with infected hosts, the researchers calculated an 'antigenic index' for each strain. This value indicates the percentage of these genetic regions identical to those of the 1968 pandemic strain and helps determine how well an influenza virus can evade a host's immune response. The researchers also took into account the patterns of attachment of the HA protein to sugar molecules called glycans. The virus' ability to attach to glycan receptors found on human respiratory-tract cells is key to infecting humans.\n\nSeeking viruses with an antigenic index of at least 49 percent and glycan-attachment patterns identical to those of the 1968 virus, the research team identified 581 H3 viruses isolated since 2000 that could potentially cause a pandemic. Of these, 549 came from birds and 32 from pigs.\n\nThe researchers then exposed some of these strains to antibodies provoked by the current H3 seasonal-flu vaccines. As they predicted, these antibodies were unable to recognize or attack these H3 strains. Of the 581 HA sequences, 6 swine strains already contain the standard HA mutations necessary for human adaptation, and are thus capable of entering the human population either directly or via genetic reassortment, Sasisekharan says.\n\n'One of the amazing things about the influenza virus is its ability to grab genes from different pools,' he says. 'There could be viral genes that mix among pigs, or between birds and pigs.' The findings from this study will raise our awareness for potential H3N2 flu pandemics and will at the same time help us to monitor, prevent and prepare for such events,' says Yizhi Jane Tao, an assistant professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Rice University who was not part of the research team. Sasisekharan and colleagues are now doing a similar genetic study of H5 influenza strains. The H3 study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\n\n[Byline: Anne Trafton]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The introductory and discussion sections from the scientific publication on which the commentary above is based are summarised below. - Mod.CP]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 10 May 2013\nSource: Nature, Scientific Reports [edited]\nhttp://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130510/srep01822/full/srep01822.html\n\n\n[Ref: Tharakaraman K, Raman R, Stebbins NW, Viswanathan K , Sasisekharan V, Sasisekharan R: Antigenically intact hemagglutinin in circulating avian and swine influenza viruses and potential for H3N2 pandemic.

Given that the H3N2 is another subtype that currently circulates in the human population and is high on WHO pandemic preparedness list, we assessed the likelihood of reemergence of H3N2 from a non-human host. Using HA sequence features relevant to immune recognition, receptor binding and transmission we have identified several recent H3 strains in avian and swine that present hallmarks of a reemerging virus. IgG polyclonal raised in rabbit with recent seasonal vaccine H3 fail to recognize these swine H3 strains suggesting that existing vaccines may not be effective in protecting against these strains. Vaccine strategies can mitigate risks associated with a potential H3N2 pandemic in humans.\n\n[Interested readers are recommended to access the original text at the source URL above to view the impressive volume of data processed in this analysis, and the excellent diagrams and images accompanying the text. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe H3 HA of some of the recent avian strains share approximately 86 percent overall sequence identity with the HA of the avian progenitor of the 1968 pandemic virus (A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963), reflecting antigenic intactness within birds. Many sequences from swine, some collected as recently as 2001, were also found to have high homology with the A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963 HA, indicating avian to swine transfer. For reasons that remain unclear, the more recent swine H3 HAs (2006 and later) have diverged significantly from the 1968 pandemic H3N2 HA while in contrast the majority of swine H1 HAs remained antigenically stable from 1918 to the 1990s. Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time -- quite possibly, this could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period. In fact, the AI [antigenic identity] values of human H3 in the last decade are comparable to the AI values of some swine H3 HAs of the same period; interestingly, the recent human and swine HAs show differential binding to polyclonal antibodies generated against seasonal vaccine strain (Fig. 2). This apparent discrepancy may be explained in part by the presence of certain key antigenic 'hotspot' locations, where amino acid substitutions can lead to disproportionately large changes in antigenicity. Our observation is supported by other studies on H3 antigenic evolution. The frequent interspecies transmission of H3 viruses might also explain why this subtype is associated with the highest rates of mortality.\n\nThe importance of glycosylation in antigenic site masking leading to a new pandemic cycle and viral evolution became apparent after the 2009 pandemic. It was observed that the seasonal H1N1 HA carries antigenic site-masking glycosylation sites not present in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 HA (and 1918 H1N1 HA) and the exposure of the unprotected antigenic surface is believed to be the reason underpinning the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Akin to H1 subtype, the additional glycosylation sites on the recent seasonal H3 appear to have a role in antigenic site masking. For instance, the glycosylation at position 63 masks antigenic site E, and glycosylation at sites, and protect antigenic A. The shielding nature of these glycosylation sites is evident from the gradual decline in the mutation rate of the masked antigenic sites following their appearance (Fig. S2), portending a 2009 H1N1-like H3N2 pandemic. If a virus carrying a HA similar to the ones identified by this analysis makes its way into humans, it would need to evolve rapidly in response to selective pressures from vaccination and herd immunity. The ability of H3 subtype to add glycosylation sites will be a key factor enabling the virus to achieve sustained circulation in the next cycle. In contrast, a previous study using nucleotide sequence analysis concluded that H2 has an intrinsically lower capacity to add glycosylation sites. Taking these factors together, we assert that it is less likely for an avian or swine H2 virus (antigenically similar to 1957-58 pandemic H2N2) to gain a foothold for sustained circulation in humans when compared to H3 viruses.\n\nThe rapid antigenic drift that human H3N2 HA underwent during the early adaptation period of the virus (1968-76) appears to have slowed down after 1977. Interestingly, this time period also coincides with the reemergence of H1N1 in the human population. The (re-) emerging H1N1 subtype could have imposed strong selective pressures on the H3N2 to stop circulating in humans after 1977. The evolution of human H3N2 HA after 1977 is characterized by glycosylation accrual, low-level site-specific antigenic changes, and variations at other non-immunodominant sites. Additionally, a recent study found that the affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001. These observations suggest that currently circulating viruses are not as dominant as the earlier viruses. Based on this trend, one can argue that human H3N2 HA presently is 'antigenically drained', which poses a substantially high barrier to evolution via antigenic drift. However, the presence of antigenically intact H3 in avian and swine suggests that, as with 2009 H1N1 pandemic, reassortment can result in 'resetting and shifting' the antigenicity back to that of the 1968 pandemic and hence facilitate sustained evolution of this subtype in humans.\n\nInfluenza A viruses of other subtypes (H5, H7, H9) that have caused sporadic infections in humans over the past decade also pose equal risk of a pandemic, especially since they represent completely novel HA subtypes. Although antigenic phenotypes could be predicted from HA sequences, the genetic signatures in influenza viruses that lead to a sustained human-to-human transmission cannot be accurately predicted. Although an antigenically novel HA is necessary, it is not the only determining factor for a pandemic. While gain of host receptor specificity is a key determinant, changes in influenza proteins other than HA such as the polymerase (PB2) are typically involved, making predictions of the timing of future pandemics more complex. Nevertheless, our study facilitates setting the stage for future work aimed at designing vaccination studies with animal models using a cocktail of H3 antigens from strains of current avian and swine origin along with specific past strains. Such studies would augment the preparedness in the event of potential re-emergence of H3N2 pandemic.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Unlike the 1918 H1N1 virus which crossed to swine soon after and remained in swine, the human H3N2 viruses appear to have repeatedly crossed from humans to swine for some time, which could be the reason why swine H3 viruses appear to manifest the antigenic drift that human strains underwent during this period.\n\nThe affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001.

Nevertheless, the authors claim that this study facilitates setting the stage for future work aimed at designing vaccination studies with animal models using a cocktail of H3 antigens from strains of current avian and swine origin along with specific past strains. \n\nThe importance of glycosylation in antigenic site masking leading to a new pandemic cycle and viral evolution became apparent after the 2009 pandemic. Nevertheless, our study facilitates setting the stage for future work aimed at designing vaccination studies with animal models using a cocktail of H3 antigens from strains of current avian and swine origin along with specific past strains. A new study from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] reveals that there are many strains of H3N2 circulating in birds and pigs that are genetically similar to the 1968 strain and have the potential to generate a pandemic if they leap to humans. When one of these avian or swine viruses gains the ability to infect humans, it can often evade the immune system, which is primed to recognize only strains that commonly infect humans. For reasons that remain unclear, the more recent swine H3 HAs (2006 and later) have diverged significantly from the 1968 pandemic H3N2 HA while in contrast the majority of swine H1 HAs remained antigenically stable from 1918 to the 1990s. Of the 581 HA sequences, 6 swine strains already contain the standard HA mutations necessary for human adaptation, and are thus capable of entering the human population either directly or via genetic reassortment, Sasisekharan says. [Ref: Tharakaraman K, Raman R, Stebbins NW, Viswanathan K , Sasisekharan V, Sasisekharan R: Antigenically intact hemagglutinin in circulating avian and swine influenza viruses and potential for H3N2 pandemic. Although antigenic phenotypes could be predicted from HA sequences, the genetic signatures in influenza viruses that lead to a sustained human-to-human transmission cannot be accurately predicted. Using HA sequence features relevant to immune recognition, receptor binding and transmission we have identified several recent H3 strains in avian and swine that present hallmarks of a reemerging virus. Given that the H3N2 is another subtype that currently circulates in the human population and is high on WHO pandemic preparedness list, we assessed the likelihood of reemergence of H3N2 from a non-human host. You would think it's more readily possible with H3 because we observe that there seems to be a lot more mixing of H3 between humans and swine.'\n\nGenetic similarities\n Source: MIT News [edited]\nhttp://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/potential-flu-pandemic-lurks-0510.html\n\n\nPotential flu pandemic lurks\n IgG polyclonal raised in rabbit with recent seasonal vaccine H3 fail to recognize these swine H3 strains suggesting that existing vaccines may not be effective in protecting against these strains. Strains of H3N2 have been circulating in humans since the 1968 pandemic, but they have evolved to a less dangerous form that produces a nasty seasonal flu. Influenza A viruses of other subtypes (H5, H7, H9) that have caused sporadic infections in humans over the past decade also pose equal risk of a pandemic, especially since they represent completely novel HA subtypes. Additionally, a recent study found that the affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001. This value indicates the percentage of these genetic regions identical to those of the 1968 pandemic strain and helps determine how well an influenza virus can evade a host's immune response. In the new study, the researchers compared the 1968 H3N2 strain and about 1100 H3 strains now circulating in pigs and birds, focusing on the gene that codes for the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. \n\nThe affinity of human H3 viruses for human receptors has reduced drastically since 2001. The shielding nature of these glycosylation sites is evident from the gradual decline in the mutation rate of the masked antigenic sites following their appearance (Fig. S2), portending a 2009 H1N1-like H3N2 pandemic. The evolution of human H3N2 HA after 1977 is characterized by glycosylation accrual, low-level site-specific antigenic changes, and variations at other non-immunodominant sites. The rapid antigenic drift that human H3N2 HA underwent during the early adaptation period of the virus (1968-76) appears to have slowed down after 1977. Many sequences from swine, some collected as recently as 2001, were also found to have high homology with the A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963 HA, indicating avian to swine transfer. In 2009, a strain of H1N1 emerged that was very similar to the virus that caused a 1918 pandemic that killed 50 million to 100 million people. ' Based on this trend, the author suggest that human H3N2 HA presently is 'antigenically drained', which poses a substantially high barrier to evolution via antigenic drift. \n\nThe authors concede that while gain of host receptor specificity is a key determinant, changes in influenza proteins other than HA such as the polymerase (PB2) are typically involved, making predictions of the timing of future pandemics more complex. Based on this trend, one can argue that human H3N2 HA presently is 'antigenically drained', which poses a substantially high barrier to evolution via antigenic drift. After comparing HA genetic sequences in five key locations that control the viruses' interactions with infected hosts, the researchers calculated an 'antigenic index' for each strain. The virus' ability to attach to glycan receptors found on human respiratory-tract cells is key to infecting humans.

From a pandemic-preparedness point of view, we should potentially start including some of these H3 strains as part of influenza vaccines.'", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2000-03-25 00:00:00", "1977-03-25 00:00:00", "1918-03-25 00:00:00", "2013-03-25 00:00:00", "2006-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-31 00:00:00", "2001-03-25 00:00:00", "2009-03-25 00:00:00", "2013-05-10 00:00:00", "1968-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "Hong Kong"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1448522", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Influenza (113): A(H3N2) receptor affinity change", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1448522", "date": "2012-12-12 20:05:49", "main_text": "INFLUENZA (113): A(H3N2) RECEPTOR AFFINITY CHANGE\n*************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\nDate: Tue 11 Dec 2012\nSource: CIDRAP News [edited]\nhttp://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/dec1112fluscan.html\n\n\nA study of the evolution of A(H3N2) influenza viruses since 1968 shows that the current virus has a low propensity to bind to human receptor analog sites, which correlates with the marked reduction in A(H3N2) disease impact in the last 10 years, UK researchers reported yesterday [10 Dec 2012] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [abstract reproduced in part 2 below - Mod.CP].

By Yi Pu Lina, and 13 others.\n\nAbstract\n-------\n'The hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A(H3N2) virus responsible for the 1968 influenza pandemic derived from an avian virus. On introduction into humans, its receptor binding properties had changed from a preference for avian receptors (a2,3-linked sialic acid) to a preference for human receptors (a2,6-linked sialic acid). By 2001, the avidity of human H3 viruses for avian receptors had declined, and since then, the affinity for human receptors has also decreased significantly. These changes in receptor binding, which correlate with increased difficulties in virus propagation in vitro and in antigenic analysis, have been assessed by virus hemagglutination of erythrocytes from different species and quantified by measuring virus binding to receptor analogs using surface biolayer interferometry. Crystal structures of HA-receptor analog complexes formed with HAs from viruses isolated in 2004 and 2005 reveal significant differences in the conformation of the 220-loop of HA1 relative to the 1968 structure, resulting in altered interactions between the HA and the receptor analog that explain the changes in receptor affinity. Site-specific mutagenesis shows the HA1 Asp-225 --Asn substitution to be the key determinant of the decreased receptor binding in viruses circulating since 2005. Our results indicate that the evolution of human influenza A(H3N2) viruses since 1968 has produced a virus with a low propensity to bind human receptor analogs, and this loss of avidity correlates with the marked reduction in A(H3N2) virus disease impact in the last 10 years.'\n\nIn their discussion, the authors review the biological consequences of receptor binding variation as follows: 'There are potentially important consequences of changes in receptor binding properties for virus isolation, for antigenic characterization, and for vaccine production. Viruses with decreased affinity for cellular receptors are under increased selection pressure when propagated in tissue culture cells and in hens' eggs for vaccine production. Indeed, the reduced avidity of the HA for the receptor is likely to be a key factor that promotes the observed ability of the virus neuraminidase to substitute for the HA in receptor binding by viruses propagated in certain cell lines. Difficulties with antigenic characterization derive largely from differences in the behavior of viruses in the hemagglutination assays that are central to antigenic analyses, leading to the need to use guinea pig erythrocytes in standard hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition assays for recent H3N2 viruses. Biologically, the most important consequence of amino acid substitutions that result in decreased affinity for receptors is their effect on the efficiency of infection and transmission. Despite the changes in receptor binding that have been observed, and the widespread immunity to H3N2 viruses generally, these viruses continue to circulate and have predominated in North America in the 2010/2011 influenza season and in the 2011/2012 season in Europe. Nevertheless, it is striking that the severity of infections has declined since the major epidemics of 1968-1970, 1975-1976, 1989-1990, 1994-1995, and 1999-2000, and this may be linked to the marked reduction in receptor binding affinity in the recent years of this 44-year-long pandemic.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <proemd@promedmail.org>\n\n[These findings do not conflict with the generally held belief that human epidemic influenza viruses may arise by a change in their receptor binding properties such that the virus acquires a preference for human receptors (a2,6-linked sialic acid) in place of a preference for avian receptors (a2,3-linked sialic acid). In the case of the 1968 epidemic A(H3N2) influenza virus, however, this does not appear to have been a stable development, and, over subsequent seasons, preference for human-type receptors has progressively declined. Definition of the evolutionary forces mediating these changes in receptor-binding properties of epidemic viruses will be an essential component in the analyses and prediction of influenza virus epidemics.\n\nThe practical consequences for vaccine production and antigen analyses associated with this decline in human (and avian) receptor affinities are considerable. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail <proemd@promedmail.org>\n\n[These findings do not conflict with the generally held belief that human epidemic influenza viruses may arise by a change in their receptor binding properties such that the virus acquires a preference for human receptors (a2,6-linked sialic acid) in place of a preference for avian receptors (a2,3-linked sialic acid).

There are localized pockets of high activity in parts of the country, and national levels of influenza-like-illness and the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for flu in clinical laboratories continues to increase. H1N1 viruses are most common at this time. This is the same H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 to cause a pandemic. Seasonal flu vaccines have included the H1N1 pandemic virus since 2010. CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older. If you have not gotten vaccinated yet this season, you should get vaccinated now. Below is a summary of the key flu indicators for the week ending 13 Feb 2016:\n\nFor the week ending 13 Feb 2016, the proportion of people seeing their health care provider (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/#S4) for influenza-like illness (ILI) increased from 2.4 per cent to 3.1 per cent, which is above the national baseline (2.1 per cent). Nine of 10 regions (Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10) reported ILI at or above their region-specific baseline levels. One way that CDC measures the length of the influenza season is the number of consecutive weeks during which ILI is at or above the national baseline. ILI has been at or above the national baseline for 5 consecutive weeks so far this season. For the last 13 seasons, the average duration of a flu season by this measure has been 13 weeks, with a range from 1 week to 20 weeks.\n\nPuerto Rico and 2 states (Arizona and Oklahoma) experienced high ILI activity. New York City and 11 states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah) experienced moderate ILI activity. Six states (California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) experienced low ILI activity. 30 states experienced minimal ILI activity. The District of Columbia and one state (Colorado) did not have sufficient data to calculate an activity level. ILI activity data indicate the amount of flu-like illness that is occurring in each state.\n\nWidespread flu activity was reported by Puerto Rico and 12 states (Arizona, California, Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Vermont). Regional flu activity was reported by 20 states (Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Washington). The District of Columbia, Guam and 15 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) reported local influenza activity. The U.S. Virgin Islands and 3 states (Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia) reported sporadic influenza activity. Geographic spread data show how many areas within a state or territory are seeing flu activity.\n\nSince 1 Oct 2015, 1147 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/#S6) have been reported through FluSurv-NET, a population-based surveillance network for laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations. This translates to a cumulative overall rate of 4.1 hospitalizations per 100 000 people in the United States. More data on hospitalization rates, including hospitalization rates during other influenza seasons, are available at http://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html and http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/FluHospChars.html.\n\nThe highest hospitalization rates are among people 65 years and older (12.7 per 100 000), followed by children younger than 5 years (6.0 per 100 000), and adults 50-64 years (5.2 per 100 000). During most seasons, children younger than 5 years and adults 65 years and older have the highest hospitalization rates.\n\nFluSurv-NET hospitalization data (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm#Hospitalization) are collected from 13 states and represent approximately 8.5 per cent of the total U.S. population. The number of hospitalizations reported does not reflect the actual total number of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States.\n\nThe proportion of deaths (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/#S2) attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was below the system-specific epidemic threshold in both the NCHS Mortality Surveillance System and the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System.\n\nOne death was associated with an influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, and one death was associated with an influenza A virus for which no subtyping was performed. Both deaths occurred during week 4 (the week ending 30 Jan 2016).\n\nA total of 13 influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported during the 2015-2016 season.\n\nNationally, the percentage of respiratory specimens (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm#Viral) testing positive for influenza viruses in clinical laboratories during the week ending 13 Feb 2016 was 12.0 per cent. For the most recent 3 weeks, the regional percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza viruses in clinical laboratories ranged from 2.2 per cent to 14.6 per cent. During the week ending 13 Feb 2016, of the 2135 influenza-positive tests reported to CDC by clinical laboratories, 1559 (73.0 per cent ) were influenza A viruses, and 576 (27.0 per cent) were influenza B viruses.\n\nThe most frequently identified influenza virus type reported by public health laboratories during the week ending 13 Feb 2016 was influenza A viruses, with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominating.\n\n- During the week ending 13 Feb 2016, 423 (72.9 per cent) of the 580 influenza-positive tests reported to CDC by public health laboratories were influenza A viruses, and 157 (27.1 per cent) were influenza B viruses. Of the 412 influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 51 (12.4 per cent) were H3 viruses, and 361 (87.6 per cent) were (H1N1)pdm09 viruses.\n\n- Cumulatively, from 4 Oct 2015-13 Feb 2016, influenza A (H3) viruses were predominant in one of the 4 age groups (38.7 per cent in ages 65 years and older). Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant in the 0-4 years age group (64.4 per cent), 5-24 years age group (42.7 per cent), and in the 25-64 years age group (67.1 per cent).\n\nCDC has characterized 532 specimens (181 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, 228 influenza A (H3N2) and 123 influenza B viruses) collected in the U.S. since 1 Oct 2015.\n\n- All 181 (100 per cent) influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized as similar to A/California/7/2009, the influenza A (H1N1) component of the 2015-2016 Northern Hemisphere vaccine.\n\n- All 228 H3N2 viruses were genetically sequenced, and all viruses belonged to genetic groups for which a majority of viruses antigenically characterized were similar to cell-propagated A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2015-2016 Northern Hemisphere vaccine.\n\n- A subset of 107 H3N2 viruses also were antigenically characterized; 100 of 107 (93.5 per cent) H3N2 viruses were similar to A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 by HI testing or neutralization testing.\n\n- All 88 (100 per cent) of the B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were antigenically characterized as similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013, which is included in both the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines.\n\n- All 35 (100 per cent) of the B/Victoria-lineage viruses were antigenically characterized as similar to B/Brisbane/60/2008, which is included in the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent vaccine.\n\nSince 1 Oct 2016, CDC has tested 330 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, 261 influenza A (H3N2), and 202 influenza B viruses for resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors antiviral drugs. While the vast majority of the viruses that have been tested are sensitive to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, so far this season, 2 (0.6 per cent) influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses have showed resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir (but both were sensitive to zanamivir).\n\nFluView (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm) is available, and past issues are archived (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm) on the CDC website.\n\nNote: Delays in reporting may mean that data changes over time.

Over the past week, there were only 2614 cases of acute respiratory virus infection, influenza and pneumonia (including 27 cases of influenza, 106 cases of pneumonia, and 2481 cases of respiratory virus infection). The incidence rate is lower than last week [week of 8 Feb 2016] by 32 per cent.\n\nOf the total number of cases, 1108 are children under age 17 years, and there is a decline among this age group as well compared with the previous week by 30.7 per cent. Among the schoolchildren, there are 385 cases of influenza, which is below the level of morbidity as compared to last week by 28 per cent. Among adults, there were 1506 cases registered, which is below the level of the previous week by 30.9 per cent. Therefore, the flu epidemic in Mariupol is in decline,' the report says.\n\nHowever, given predictions about a possible 2nd wave of influenza in Ukraine, the Health Department of the City Council recommends that city residents should stay vigilant and, at the 1st signs of disease, immediately seek medical care.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The report states the actual information from the municipal health department website of the city of Mariupol in regards to the situation on incidence of flu for the last week [8-15 Feb 2016]. Compared to other regions of Ukraine, Mariupol was one of the cities of Donezk region that took the 1st blow of the epidemic, along with Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and others. Thanks to the efforts of local physicians, isolation of infected cases, and timely delivery of the necessary medicines to the region, the city managed to stabilize the situation, and, as can be seen from the report, there has been a downward trend in the number of cases.\n\nAt the same time, the number of deaths from influenza in Ukraine continues to increase [see below]. Since the beginning of the epidemic season (28 Sep 2015-11 Feb 2016) in Ukraine, 273 people died as a result of the flu epidemic. 3.6 million were registered with flu, among them 61.2 percent were children under the age of 17 years (according to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine).

The Ministry of Health reports the victims died from flu complications. Among the dead are 4 children and 2 pregnant women.\n\n'The largest number of deaths was stated in the Odesa, Cherkasy, Donetsk and Lviv regions, and in the city of Kyiv. Only 1/3rd of those who died had sought medical advice. The tests have shown that the victims had no vaccinations against the flu,' stated the Ministry of Health.\n\nAccording to the doctors, since the start of the flu season, nearly 3.7 million Ukrainians (9.5 per cent) suffered from the illness. Most of them are children.\n\nAt the end of January [2016], Ukraine's healthcare ministry announced the flu epidemic and urged people to turn to hospitals immediately to try to prevent the disease from spreading.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5] Georgia: Influenza review\nDate: Sun 14 Feb 2016\nSource: IA: Interfax [trans.

Ohio State University researchers tested 20 pigs each at 53 fair events over those 3 summers and found at least one flu-positive pig at 12 fairs -- almost a quarter of fairs tested. The influenza strains identified in pigs in this study include H1N2 and H3N2 viruses -- strains that have been circulating in pigs since 1998. In 2011, all of the H3N2 and H1N2 isolates found in pigs at the fairs contained a gene from the 2009 pandemic strain of H1N1, which is similar to the H3N2v strain causing human illness this year.\n\nNo cause for panic\n------------------\nThough this finding alone is no cause for panic, it does show how quickly influenza viruses can change, said Andrew Bowman, lead author of the study and a Ph.D. candidate in veterinary preventive medicine at Ohio State. In a 2nd study led by Bowman, researchers compared the genomic sequences of influenza A viruses recovered in July 2012 from pigs and people. The analysis, showing a greater than 99 percent genetic similarity among the viruses, confirms that pigs and humans were infected with the same virus, indicating interspecies transmission.\n\ncases\n-----\nAs of 25 Sep 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had confirmed 107 human cases of H3N2v influenza in Ohio since July 2012, with the majority linked to exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs. While most of the human illness caused by H3N2v has been mild, one person, who had a compromised immune system, has died. The more often that flu viruses are transmitted, the better their chances are of evolving into a strain which humans are not immune, which is the big-picture concern among scientists monitoring these viral infections. 'Pigs can be infected with human-, avian- and swine-origin influenza viruses, making it possible for these viruses to easily swap their genetic material, which could allow for a new strain to emerge,' Bowman said. 'The potential is there for newly emerged strains to be the next pandemic we never saw coming.' Bowman and colleagues will continue to investigate strategies to protect swine and public health.\n\nRisk mitigation strategies\n--------------------------\nIn the meantime, the research group has offered potential risk mitigation strategies for fairs with swine competitions to consider: shortening the pig exhibition period, avoiding movement of pigs from one fair to the next, and vaccinating exhibition swine for appropriate influenza A viruses. In addition, the CDC recommends that people with compromised immune systems avoid pig displays at fairs. Both studies appear online and are scheduled for later print publication.\n\nPublications\n------------\nThe 3-year surveillance at Ohio fairs is published in the journal 'Emerging Infectious Diseases', and the analysis of human and pig viruses appears in 'Emerging Microbes & Infections' [Bowman AS, Sreevatsan S, Illian ML, et al. Molecular evidence for interspecies transmission of H3N2pM/H3N2v influenza A viruses at an Ohio agricultural fair, July 2012. Emerg Microbes Infect 2012].\n\nHuman-swine & swine-swine contact\n---------------------------------\nEach summer, agricultural fairs bring together animal and human populations that normally don't spend much time in the same place. Pigs are susceptible to multiple strains of influenza A viruses, and the 3-year surveillance suggests that the daily visual inspection of pigs at fairs isn't effective at identifying pigs infected with influenza A viruses. This combination of facts adds up to an environment conducive for the transmission of influenza A viruses among pigs and between humans and pigs, potentially in both directions. 'The prevalence of flu in market-weight pigs in commercial swine-production settings is pretty low. But finding flu at the fair shouldn't be that surprising. If you bring 200-plus pigs together from multiple locations and house them with new neighbors for a week in a new environment, they are all bound to share pathogens,' Bowman said. 'But we were surprised to find as much flu as we did subclinically, when pigs weren't showing any signs of illness.'\n\nFair surveillance\n-----------------\nBowman and his colleagues, members of the College of Veterinary Medicine's Animal Influenza Ecology and Epidemiology Research Program, tested pigs at 15 Ohio county fairs in 2009, 16 in 2010 and 22 in 2011, using nasal swabs to collect their samples.The scientists found influenza A virus in at least one pig at 12 (22.6 percent) of the 53 fairs. At the fairs where flu was detected in the pigs, the average frequency of virus detection was 63 percent. Pigs showing signs of illness were observed and tested positive for flu at 2 fairs, and pigs without signs of illness but positive for flu were found at 10 (18.9 percent) of the 53 fairs. That means pigs at 10 of 12 fairs with positive flu cases, or 83.3 percent of flu-positive pigs, actually didn't appear to be sick. A total of 1073 pigs was tested over the 3-year period. 'This is an explanation of why people were becoming infected in 2012 -- because a high percentage of infected pigs with no clinical symptoms are exhibited at fairs,' said Richard Slemons, professor of veterinary preventive medicine at Ohio State and senior author of both studies. 'There is potentially high exposure. Therefore, this is something we hadn't seen before or did not know was going on because no one had systematically examined fairs. 'Influenza A virus usually infects the respiratory tract, and pigs can 'shed' the virus into the air. Slemons described flu-positive swine areas as potentially under a 'cloud' of flu particles that would be difficult to avoid. Swine infected with flu typically show clinical signs similar to those in humans: nasal discharge, cough, fever, lethargy and poor appetite.\n\nConfirmed interspecies transmission\n-----------------------------------\nIn the 2nd study, the researchers used swine-origin virus isolates collected during fair surveillance that had continued into the summer of 2012, and obtained the genetic sequences of human-origin influenza A virus isolates from GenBank, the National Institutes of Health genetic sequence database. The human viruses had been recovered from people with flu-like illness following exposure to pigs at an Ohio fair in July 2012. The timing of the illnesses and the proximity of humans and pigs suggested the viruses were the same, but it was the higher than 99 percent similarity in the viruses' genetic sequences that confirmed interspecies transmission, Bowman said.\n\n'This study presents clear molecular evidence that pigs and humans were concurrently infected with the same strain of influenza A virus at an Ohio county fair in July 2012,' he said. Bowman noted that the results of the 2 studies create new questions: How do these viruses get to the fair, what can be done to lessen the risk to animals and people, and are the infections going in only one direction, from pigs to humans? The research program members are continuing to monitor the antigenic and genomic properties of type A influenza viruses in swine. 'It is possible that humans are infecting the pigs. The lineage of the H3N2 strains we see in pigs can be tracked back to the human seasonal flu of the 1990s,' Bowman said. 'Human-to-swine transmission of influenza viruses has the potential to significantly impact swine health.'\n\nNo risk to consumers\n--------------------\nHe noted that influenza A virus is not considered a food-safety risk as long as pork is cooked properly.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 25 Oct 2012\nSource: CIDRAP News [edited]\nhttp://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/oct2512h3n2v.html\n\n\nFair-related swine and human H3N2 viruses closely match\n-------------------------------------------------------\nResearchers report that swine and human influenza A/H3N2 viruses associated with an Ohio county fair held in July [2012] make a nearly perfect genetic match, suggesting that there is almost no biological barrier to prevent such viruses from passing between humans and pigs.\n\nThe authors sequenced the genomes of H3N2 viruses isolated from pigs that were exhibited at the fair and from several people who were infected with strains of variant H3N2 (H3N2v, the term for the human version) after participating in or visiting the fair. They found that the genomes were more than 99 percent the same, according to their report in 'Emerging Microbes and Infections' [see part 1 above]. The human cases were among 306 H3N2v cases reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since Jul 12 of this year. The vast majority of these occurred in young people who were involved in agricultural fairs. The cases have mostly been fairly mild, and no sustained human-to-human transmission has been seen. But they have prompted health officials to warn people at risk for flu complications to stay out of swine barns at fairs, and fair visitors and participants have been urged to take special precautions if they have exposure to pigs.\n\nAndrew S. Bowman, DVM, of The Ohio State University (OSU), 1st author of the new study, said it is the 1st study in a peer-reviewed journal to compare the genomes of H3N2 viruses recovered from people and pigs in connection with county fair-related cases. The research team also included scientists from Minnesota and Iowa. The H3N2 viruses in the fair-related cases, both swine and human, carry the M or matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. In the current study, the authors call the swine-origin strain H3N2pM.\n\nIn their study, the research team gathered nasal swabs from 34 pigs that were randomly selected on the last day of the fair, 28 Jul 2012, about a week after the pigs arrived there. The fair was not identified. None of the pigs had obvious signs of illness at the time of the sampling, although exhibitors said some pigs had been sick 3 to 5 days earlier and a few had been sent home.\n\nUsing polymerase chain reaction, the team found that 31 of the 34 pigs were infected with the H3N2pM virus, and they isolated viruses from 29 of these. The researchers also gathered samples from 5 of 22 people who had H3N2v infections associated with the fair, and they ran several analyses to compare the genomes of the swine and human strains. Analysis of the hemagglutinin genes showed that all the viruses belong to 'Cluster IV' H3 viruses circulating in US swine, the report says. Findings for the neuraminidase, polymerase complex, nucleoprotein, and non-structural genes were similar, with near-99 percent similarity between the swine and human isolates. Also, the M genes from the swine and human viruses fit in a clade with the M genes from 2009 H1N1 viruses isolated in 2009 and 2012.\n\n'This study presents clear molecular evidence that pigs and humans were concurrently infected with the same strain of influenza A virus at an Ohio county fair in July 2012,' the authors write. 'The lack of difference between the genotypes of these isolates suggests that there are virtually no innate species barriers preventing bidirectional interspecies transmission of H3N2pM/H3N2v viruses between humans and pigs,' they add.\n\nThe report says that H3N2pM and H3N2v viruses are probably the product of reassortment, or gene-swapping, events in pigs, because the most recent ancestors of all the genetic segments of the viruses can be found in triple-reassortant H3N2, H1N2, and H1N1 viruses that have been identified in North American swine. Bowman and his colleagues note that sustained human transmission of the viruses has not been observed, but they say that in view of the growing number of human cases in recent months, 'the continuing evolution [of] H3N2v is a concern.'\n\nThey conclude by calling for 'appropriate steps to prevent and/or reduce' flu transmission among pigs and between pigs and humans at fairs, 'while considering short- and long-term implications for the cultural value of livestock exhibitions.'\n\nAccording to an OSU press release yesterday [24 Oct 2012], the team has suggested that fairs consider such preventive strategies as shortening the pig exhibition period, avoiding movement of pigs from one fair to the next, and vaccinating exhibition swine for appropriate influenza A viruses.\n\n[Byline: Robert Roos]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These observations are consistent with the long-held hypothesis that swine act as a 'mixing vessel' in the generation of human influenza pathogens, but leave open the question of the factors that determine the ability of reassortant animal influenza viruses to propagate in human hosts.

This combination of facts adds up to an environment conducive for the transmission of influenza A viruses among pigs and between humans and pigs, potentially in both directions. ' Ohio State University researchers tested 20 pigs each at 53 fair events over those 3 summers and found at least one flu-positive pig at 12 fairs -- almost a quarter of fairs tested. The human viruses had been recovered from people with flu-like illness following exposure to pigs at an Ohio fair in July 2012. -----------------\nBowman and his colleagues, members of the College of Veterinary Medicine's Animal Influenza Ecology and Epidemiology Research Program, tested pigs at 15 Ohio county fairs in 2009, 16 in 2010 and 22 in 2011, using nasal swabs to collect their samples. As of 25 Sep 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had confirmed 107 human cases of H3N2v influenza in Ohio since July 2012, with the majority linked to exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs. The analysis, showing a greater than 99 percent genetic similarity among the viruses, confirms that pigs and humans were infected with the same virus, indicating interspecies transmission. But they have prompted health officials to warn people at risk for flu complications to stay out of swine barns at fairs, and fair visitors and participants have been urged to take special precautions if they have exposure to pigs.

' Human-to-swine transmission of influenza viruses has the potential to significantly impact swine health.' In 2011, all of the H3N2 and H1N2 isolates found in pigs at the fairs contained a gene from the 2009 pandemic strain of H1N1, which is similar to the H3N2v strain causing human illness this year. It would seem prudent, however, as suggested, to limit where possible the exposure of humans to groups of pigs where there may be active transmission of influenza viruses.

Officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta say an additional 52 cases have been spotted, bringing the count since July to 276 human infections. Those cases have been recorded in 10 states; so far no infections with this virus have been seen outside the United States.\n\nThe vast majority of the cases have been in young children who had contact with pigs; many of the infections seem to have taken place at state and county fairs. But the CDC says it now knows of three recent cases where a person was likely infected by another person, not a pig. Still, the agency's experts say there is no need at this time to call for a closure of the swine exhibits at fairs. Earlier this week Michael Osterholm, a flu expert from the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, said the pig barns should be closed to minimize the risk of future spread of the virus.\n\nThe virus is a swine H3N2, a distant cousin of the human H3N2 viruses. The human virus entered the pig population in the late 1990s and has circulated among swine ever since. This particular H3N2 is identified as H3N2v, with the 'v' being short for variant. Nancy Cox, who heads the CDC's Influenza Division, said Friday that the agency and its partners are weighing a lot of factors as they monitor the situation. For now, they feel the risk doesn't warrant closing the barns. 'When you're looking at shutting down all of this activity where there may not be a problem, you know you are trying to balance many, many things,' Cox said in an interview. 'If we saw that there were really high numbers of cases or we saw that there was an increase in severity or an increase in transmission ... there could be a lot of different kinds of signals that would change what we recommended.'\n\nTo date most of the illnesses triggered by the virus have been mild. There have been 13 people hospitalized with H3N2v infections, but no deaths. One of the signals officials are watching for is spread of the virus among people. But they aren't looking for just one generation of spread -- a sick child infects a family member, but the chain of transmission ends there. They are looking for sustained spread. 'The presence of human-to-human spread is interesting. The presence of community transmission, several generations for instance of community spread is critical,' said Dr. Joe Bresee, chief of influenza epidemiology and prevention at the CDC. Bresee wouldn't say in which states the cases of human spread were spotted. It's up to individual states to release that information, he said. But he did say these three cases don't come as a surprise. 'We expected that. And we've been looking hard for it and to find it, because we know that this virus at least has that potential to spread in a very limited way between people.' In fact, this virus has been seen before. Late last year a child in West Virginia was infected with the virus in what was believed to have been person-to-person spread.\n\nThe CDC has been urging people with health problems that put them at high risk of becoming severely ill if they contract influenza to avoid pig barns at fairs. And they are recommending that people who do visit the barns not eat or drink while in the facilities, and wash their hands after their visit.\n\nMeanwhile, agricultural authorities are testing pigs as they arrive at fairs in a bid to weed out sick pigs so they don't infect other animals. But a study published last week -- a study on which Cox was an author-- showed that pigs that don't have symptoms can still be infected with flu viruses.\n\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[There have now been 276 cases of A(H3N2)v virus infection in 10 states; none outside the United States.

The death occurred in an older adult with multiple underlying health conditions who reportedly had direct exposure to pigs in a fair setting. While limited person-to-person spread of this virus has been detected and likely continues to occur sporadically, no sustained community transmission has been found. CDC is monitoring this situation and working with states to respond to these evolving outbreaks. The agency continues to urge people at high risk from serious flu complications to stay away from pigs and pig arenas at fairs this summer.\n\n'We're saddened to hear about the death of one person in Ohio associated with the current H3N2v outbreaks,' says CDC's Dr. Lyn Finelli. 'Like with seasonal flu, we have been -- and continue to be -- particularly concerned about people with factors that put them at high risk of serious complications if they get the flu. These people should absolutely not have contact with pigs or visit pig arenas at fairs this summer.' Dr. Finelli is Lead for the Surveillance and Outbreak Response Team in CDC's Influenza Division.\n\nHigh risk factors for serious flu complications include: being younger than 5 years (especially children younger than 2 years), or 65 and older, pregnancy, and certain chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions. A full list of high risk conditions is available on the CDC seasonal flu website.\n\n'Anyone with a high risk factor should not only avoid pigs and pig arenas at fairs, but they should also seek prompt medical attention if they get flu-like symptoms, especially if they have pig exposure, but even in the absence of pig exposure,' Finelli says.\n\nCDC has issued information for clinicians on H3N2v; guidance which underscores the importance of rapid antiviral treatment of influenza, including H3N2v virus infection, in high risk patients. The H3N2v virus is susceptible to the influenza antiviral drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu \u00ae) and zanamivir (Relenza \u00ae).\n\nFor seasonal flu, CDC recommends that it is best that people with high risk conditions who develop flu-like symptoms contact their doctor, tell them about their symptoms, and remind them about their high risk status. For the current H3N2v outbreaks, if high risk people have exposure to pigs, it's especially important that they tell their doctor about this exposure.\n\n'Like with seasonal flu,' Finelli says, 'prompt antiviral treatment in a high risk person can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus a very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay or even death,' says Finelli. 'This message is critical not only for people who are at high risk, but for America's doctors who are treating these patients. We want their suspicion for H3N2v to be high right now. Ask patients with influenza-like-illness if they have pig exposure, but regardless of whether they do, if they have a high risk factor, treat them empirically with antivirals for influenza without waiting for testing results.'\n\nThe 12 new cases reported this week are from the states of Minnesota (1), Ohio (3), Pennsylvania (1), and Wisconsin (7). Cumulative totals for 2011 and 2012 by state are available in the H3N2v case count table.\n\nSymptoms of H3N2v have been consistent with seasonal influenza and can include some or all of the following: fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue. Like with seasonal flu, it's possible that not everyone will have a fever. This may be particularly true in elderly people or people with weakened immune systems, whose bodies may not mount as effective an immune response to the virus infection.\n\nFound in U.S. pigs in 2010 and humans in July 2011, this H3N2v virus appears to spread more easily from pigs to people than other variant influenza viruses. Most reported cases to date have occurred in people who are exhibiting or helping to exhibit pigs at fairs this season after close and prolonged contact with pigs. 'So far more than 90 percent of cases have occurred in people who are exhibiting or helping to exhibit pigs, or who are family members of these people. That is why our message is so targeted,' says Finelli. CDC has developed recommendations and materials for people attending fairs this summer and is working with states as well as organizations like 4-H National Headquarters and the International Association of Fairs and Expositions to disseminate thesemessages and materials.\n\nCDC also has developed supplemental H3N2v guidance for schools. Last year, there was at least one outbreak of H3N2v in a day care setting in the fall and CDC believes it possible that localized outbreaks of H3N2v, particularly in schools or day cares, may occur as the weather turns colder and schools across the country are underway. 'The guidance document is a heads up for schools to be aware of, and on the look-out for, illness with this virus,' Finelli explains.\n\n'It's important to remember that this is an evolving situation that could change quickly.' Finelli concludes, 'We're constantly looking at our data and re-evaluating.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[These recommendations are specific for the United States.

For seasonal flu, CDC recommends that it is best that people with high risk conditions who develop flu-like symptoms contact their doctor, tell them about their symptoms, and remind them about their high risk status. \n\nHigh risk factors for serious flu complications include: being younger than 5 years (especially children younger than 2 years), or 65 and older, pregnancy, and certain chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions. \n\n'Like with seasonal flu,' Finelli says, 'prompt antiviral treatment in a high risk person can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus a very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay or even death,' says Finelli. ' The agency continues to urge people at high risk from serious flu complications to stay away from pigs and pig arenas at fairs this summer. Like with seasonal flu, we have been -- and continue to be -- particularly concerned about people with factors that put them at high risk of serious complications if they get the flu. \n\nFound in U.S. pigs in 2010 and humans in July 2011, this H3N2v virus appears to spread more easily from pigs to people than other variant influenza viruses.

For the current H3N2v outbreaks, if high risk people have exposure to pigs, it's especially important that they tell their doctor about this exposure. Ask patients with influenza-like-illness if they have pig exposure, but regardless of whether they do, if they have a high risk factor, treat them empirically with antivirals for influenza without waiting for testing results.' Most reported cases to date have occurred in people who are exhibiting or helping to exhibit pigs at fairs this season after close and prolonged contact with pigs. ' This may be particularly true in elderly people or people with weakened immune systems, whose bodies may not mount as effective an immune response to the virus infection. So far more than 90 percent of cases have occurred in people who are exhibiting or helping to exhibit pigs, or who are family members of these people.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2012-03-25 00:00:00", "1982-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-07-25 00:00:00", "2065-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Wisconsin", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Minnesota", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ohio", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "America", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "find", "country": "Australia"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1297468", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Influenza (87): USA, H3N2, H1N2, H1N1, human cases", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1297468", "date": "2012-09-17 23:16:19", "main_text": "INFLUENZA (87): USA, H3N2, H1N2, H1N1, HUMAN CASES\n**************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 14 Sep 2012\nSource: CIDRAP [edited]\nhttp://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/sep1412flu.html\n\n\nThe number of swine-origin H3N2 (variant H3N2, or H3N2v) influenza cases in the United States has climbed by 9 in the past week, to 305, and another rare swine-origin variant, H1N1v, has cropped up in Missouri, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported today [14 Sep 2012].\n\nThe case in Missouri involves an H1N1v virus carrying the M (matrix) gene from the pandemic 2009 H1N1 (pH1N1) virus, marking only the 2nd finding of such an isolate, the CDC reported. The previous case was reported in Wisconsin in December 2011; 12 other H1N1v cases (without the pH1N1 M gene) have been reported since 2005, CDC reports show.\n\nThe Missouri case was found because of increased surveillance for H3N2v cases, the CDC said in its weekly flu update. The patient got sick after contact with pigs and has since recovered. The agency gave no further details about the case.\n\nThe CDC's report on the H1N1v case in Wisconsin in December 2011 said similar viruses had been found in US swine since 2010 and that the strain was susceptible to antiviral drugs.\n\nThe CDC said the total number of variant flu cases detected since July 2012 has now reached 309. That includes the 305 H3N2v cases, the Missouri H1N1v case, and 3 H1N2v cases that were recently reported in Minnesota. All 3 strains contain the pH1N1 M gene.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minnesota Department of Health reports that the number of H1N2v cases has increased to 4, as one case previously listed as probable has been confirmed. The CDC says that when state and CDC case counts disagree, the state numbers should be considered more accurate.\n\nThe 305 H3N2v cases, most of which involved people exposed to pigs at county and state fairs, were scattered across 10 states. New cases were reported this week in: Michigan, one case (6 total); Minnesota, 2 (4); Ohio, 4 (106); and Wisconsin, 2 (20). Indiana continues to lead the list with 138 cases.\n\nThe numbers of H3N2v-related hospitalizations and deaths stayed the same, at 16 and one, respectively.\n\nThe CDC said today [14 Sep 2012], as it has previously, that a few cases of likely human-to-human transmission of H3N2v have been identified but no ongoing human transmission.\n\nAside from the variant cases, flu remained at seasonably low levels in the United States last week, according to the CDC. The percentage of outpatient visits for flu-like illness stayed below the national baseline, and the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and flu was under the epidemic threshold. No flu-related pediatric deaths were reported.\n\nGlobally, flu activity was low or decreasing in most regions, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its biweekly flu update, covering the last 2 weeks of August 2012.\n\nMost countries in northern temperate regions have not started their seasonal flu reporting, but available data indicate that seasonal flu transmission has not begun in those areas, the WHO said.\n\nMost tropical countries reported low or decreasing flu trends. The exceptions are Nicaragua, which is finding mostly influenza B, and India and Thailand, which are both reporting pH1N1 and B, the WHO said.\n\nFlu activity declined in most temperate countries of the Southern Hemisphere, including Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Paraguay, and South Africa, the agency said.

The virus involved in the Missouri H1N1v infection appears to be unique so far, with the acquisition of the M (matrix) gene from the pandemic 2009 H1N1 (pH1N1) virus. Fortunately so far, there is no evidence for sustained, ongoing human to human transmission with any of these variant viruses.\n\nThe count of human cases by state since August 2011 issued by the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-case-count.htm) shows 12 cases in 5 states in 2011 and 306 cases in 11 states this year (2012). - Mod.TY\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1hiS.]", "summary": "The count of human cases by state since August 2011 issued by the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-case-count.htm) shows 12 cases in 5 states in 2011 and 306 cases in 11 states this year (2012).

The strain known as H3N2v is typically associated with swine, but the departments of health and agriculture said handling or eating pork products presents no risk of exposure to influenza. The influenza cases occurred among youths participating in the Huntingdon County Fair last week. There are no reported hospitalizations, and no evidence so far that the new flu strain is spreading from person-to-person, health officials said.\n\nThe same virus has recently caused illness in Indiana and Ohio, mostly among children who were participants or visitors at agricultural fairs. Health secretary Dr Eli N Avila said people should take steps to protect their health if they're visiting or exhibiting in a county fair in the coming weeks, especially if they are at high risk for illness. He said fair attendees should wash their hands after visiting areas with live animals and avoid carrying food or drink or putting things in their mouth while in those areas.\n\nHealth officials said people at high risk of influenza complications should consider avoiding areas where live pigs are displayed. Those at high risk include:\n- children less than 5 years of age;\n- people 65 years of age and above;\n- pregnant women; and\n- people with certain chronic medical conditions or weakened immune systems.\n\nOfficials said symptoms of H3N2v influenza are similar to seasonal flu, and include fever, coughing, fatigue, and lack of appetite. Other influenza symptoms may include a runny nose, sore throat, muscle aches, eye irritation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Anyone with flu-like illness who has been in contact with live animals including pigs at agricultural fairs or on farms in the week before they got sick should contact their health care provider.\n\n[byline: Mark Hall]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As in all the other states reporting cases of A(H3N2)v influenza virus infection, illness has been mild and there has been no record of onward human-to-human transmission of infection.

Up to 20 per cent of show pigs at the 2009 Minnesota State Fair were infected, and an infected animal was also found at the 2009 South Dakota fair, the researchers report in the September issue of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases.\n\nThe findings come in the wake of recent CDC warnings to fairgoers and reports of new swine flu strains, called H3N2v, in people who had direct or indirect contact with pigs at agricultural fairs. 'The new H3N2v viruses that are circulating now in pigs and apparently affecting people at pig shows are offsprings of the 2009 pandemic virus that spread throughout the world,' says lead investigator Gregory Gray, chairman of the UF College of Public Health and Health Professions department of environmental and global health, and a member of UF's Emerging Pathogens Institute. 'It mixed with the viruses that were already present in pigs and out has come a new progeny virus.' Between 12 Jul and 10 Aug, health authorities have confirmed 153 cases of H3N2variant infections in 4 states. And with county and state fair season in full swing, the number of infections is expected to rise.\n\nFor the summer 2009 study, Gray, then the director of the University of Iowa's Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, and his team evaluated pigs and their handlers at the Minnesota and South Dakota state fairs. The researchers collected completed questionnaires from handlers, and swab samples from pigs' nostrils. All the pigs had been deemed healthy by a veterinarian before being permitted to enter the show. Of 57 pigs examined at the Minnesota fair, 11 tested positive for swine flu, and of 45 pigs examined at the South Dakota fair, one tested positive. Most of the flu-positive pigs had nasal samples collected within 24 hours of arrival at the fair, so the results suggest the animals were infected before they got there. The presence of influenza A in healthy-looking pigs is consistent with a 2011 Canadian study that demonstrated that as many as 90 per cent of infected pigs may not show clinical signs of viral infection.\n\nIn addition, 6 of 7 viruses the researchers isolated from pigs in the 2009 study were identical to the pandemic H1N1 virus that had first been confirmed in humans just 5 months earlier, in April of that year. In a follow-up telephone survey, 2 human study participants reported influenza-like illness.\n\n'Pandemic influenza is a good example of how certain strains of influenza can spread in both human and pig populations at the same time -- this is obviously of serious concern,' says Juergen A Richt, the Regents Distinguished Professor at the Kansas State University College of Veterinary Medicine, who was not involved in the study. 'The recent sharp increase in cases of influenza associated with the novel H3N2v virus at local and state fairs throughout the Midwest further confirms this phenomenon. It is important that we increase public awareness that animals, such as pigs, cattle, and sheep can carry viruses that might be of concern to the general public.'\n\nThe UF investigators recommend that swine show visitors follow CDC's guidelines: wash your hands before and after exposure to animals; don't eat or drink in areas where animals are kept; and avoid contact with animals if you are experiencing flu-like symptoms or if the animals appear sick. People who are pregnant, under 5 years of age, or who have weakened immune systems should avoid exposure to pigs and pig barns. Eating pork from a pig infected with influenza has not been shown to cause infection in humans, according to CDC.\n\nWorkers involved in swine farming, food animal veterinarians, and people who raise show pigs should receive seasonal flu vaccinations and consider using gloves in their work, Gray says. And swine show organizers should consider using inexpensive rapid diagnostic tests to determine onsite whether the show pigs are carrying viruses that could spread to humans. Such testing is especially important since studies show that accurate infection surveillance cannot be based solely on observation of signs in animals, Gray said. 'We really need a much better understanding of how common these infections are in US pigs and how they are spreading,' Gray says. 'Public health, veterinary health, environmental health, and the pork industry must work closely together in understanding influenza transmission as some of these viruses can cause significant health problems in man and pigs, as well as major economic harm to agribusinesses.'\n\n[byline: Joe Vansickle]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These findings are hardly surprising since the H3N2v human infectious occurred prominently at agricultural fairs exhibiting healthy pigs.

In less than a month, more than 200 people -- most young children -- have been infected by an unwanted visitor to many of the state and county fairs that are held at this time of year. A new swine flu virus is infecting a growing number of people in the United States. But the official response to this outbreak is substantially different from the one that greeted the swine H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009. Public health authorities, perhaps still stinging from criticism of the response to the H1N1 pandemic, are struggling to strike the right note with this virus, which so far doesn't seem to be spreading from person to person. But is their low-key strategy the right one to take? One prominent flu expert is questioning the approach, which has largely focused on encouraging people not to eat or drink while touring pig barns at fairs and to wash their hands after visiting these exhibits.\n\nMichael Osterholm suggests it's too soon to conclude that this new virus is going to be a mere nuisance or just another weird chapter in the ever-perplexing saga of influenza viruses. And he says it's time to take what likely would be a very unpopular step -- tell organizers that this year, pigs should stay home from the fair. 'I'm convinced that wherever you have pigs and fairs right now you're seeing this transmission -- at least in North America,' says Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, and of the Minnesota Center for Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance.\n\nThe virus, an influenza A of the H3N2 family and a distant cousin of human viruses of the same name, was first spotted in humans last summer. To distinguish between the animal and human viruses, scientists call this H3N2-variant or H3N2v. Cases have predominantly cropped up among children who have attended agricultural exhibitions. But human health officials in the U.S. have been reluctant to call for the closure of pig barns this fair season. Asked about the issue on a recent teleconference with the media, a senior influenza scientist with the Centers for Disease Control said a two-pronged strategy was being introduced to try to bring the situation at fairs under control.\n\nThe plan: Stress hand hygiene among humans and screen pigs at they arrive to weed out evidently unhealthy animals.\n'So I don't think it's necessary at this point at least to cancel a swine show,' Dr. Joe Bresee, the CDC's head of influenza epidemiology said on 9 aug 2012. 'We'll continue to follow these things, and we'll continue to follow the cases and learn more about the epidemiology and exposures of risks over the coming weeks. And the recommendations may change. But I think let's let the prevention strategies that are just now being put in place take hold and see what we get.'\n\nJust last week, however, a CDC journal published an article reporting that many seemingly healthy pigs that are brought to show in the United States are infected with influenza virus. And since a 9th August CDC teleconference, scores of new human cases have been identified, in a lengthening list of states. On Monday, Minnesota joined Wisconsin, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Maryland, Indiana, Illinois and Hawaii to report human cases in the past month. Cases were also seen last year and this spring in Maine, Iowa and Utah.\n\n'I think veterinary public health and human public health have done far too much to reassure the public that the methods taken at the fairs are going to substantially impact this transmission,' says Osterholm. 'I think we have to be up front and honest about that. Does this mean this is potentially significant public health event? We don't know that. We have to be careful.' 'I'm not sitting here crying 'wolf' or 'fire'. But at the same time, we can't reassure people that this is going to be an uneventful situation. We don't know.'\n\nSo far the virus has not been found in pigs in Canada [nor in Europe - Mod.CP]; no human cases have cropped up here either. There are suspicions about that south of the border, given the degree of movement of pigs between the two countries. But a senior official with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency insists there has been no sign of the virus here. Dr. Jim Clark, the agency's national manager of animal welfare, biosecurity and assurance programs, says pigs coming into Canada -- except if they are headed for slaughter -- are quarantined for 30 days and are only released if they are healthy. U.S. pigs coming to Canada for slaughter go directly to those facilities and don't interact with Canadian swine herds. Also, while late summer fairs -- like the Canadian National Exhibition, now underway in Toronto -- are popular in Canada, they generally don't have the swine exhibits that are prominent features of U.S. state and county fairs, Clark says.\n\nDr. John Spika of the Public Health Agency of Canada says both his agency and CFIA are planning to beef up surveillance for the virus. 'You almost have to assume that it's here in Canada, given that it's just across the border,' says Spika, director general for the centre for immunization and respiratory infectious diseases at the Public Health Agency. Spika says the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg has been randomly screening a proportion of flu samples looking for H3N2v. But federal officials are interested in doing some targeted surveillance, looking for infections in children with exposure to pigs.\n\nThe lack of cases in adults has led some flu experts to conclude that years of exposure to human H3N2 viruses may give adults some protection against this virus. That's despite the fact that a recently published Canadian study showed only about a quarter of the population would have what are considered protective antibodies against the virus. The work, led by Dr. Danuta Skowronski at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, showed the highest rates of antibodies in adolescents and young adults. Young children and middle-aged people had little or no immunity, her study found. The study is considered well done, and the largest to date on this issue. Still, people are looking at the ages of the cases and suggesting there may be some protection in adults that the tests Skowronski used can't measure. (The tests she used are the standard ones to look for protection against influenza.) 'The ultimate arbitrator of what's really going on is what you see in populations -- you know, what in fact is the infection pattern,' says Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the senior influenza expert at the World Health Organization in Geneva. 'So why are we not seeing infections occur through the entire age spectrum? Well, the answer may partly be well, we're missing them in older people,' says Fukuda, the WHO's assistant director-general for health security and the environment. 'Or it may be that in fact . . . older people have protection, younger people have less protection -- that's what's really being reflected.'\n\nOsterholm suggests Fukuda's first explanation needs further exploration before people can assume the second is true.\nSince the link between state fairs and human cases of H3N2v was spotted, public health officials have been looking for infections in children who attend fairs. There may not be as much of an effort to find cases in adults, he says, a situation that would skew the picture of the cases. 'We have to be incredibly careful about assuming that these fairs are telling us what's happening with these viruses in two ways,' Osterholm says. 'One is in terms of who's at risk. And second of all we have very limited data on human-to-human transmission. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.'\n\n(By Helen Branswell)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[So far there has been little evidence of sustained transmission of the A (H3N2)v influenza virus in the human population.

As of 10 Aug 2012, the total number of confirmed human cases of influenza A(H3N2)v for 2012 increased to 154, mainly as a result of follow up investigations of the initial cases in Ohio and Indiana. One case was also reported from Hawaii and one in Illinois.\n\nMost cases were children who had direct or indirect exposure to pigs in agricultural fairs, no further human to human transmission has been documented for the 2012 cases. Clinically, these cases are similar to seasonal influenza cases, and all patients have recovered from their illness. Investigations around cases and contacts is ongoing.\n\nLimited serological studies indicate that adults may have some pre-existing immunity to this virus but children do not. Seasonal vaccines do not provide cross-protection to influenza A(H3N2)v in adults or children. 3 candidate vaccine viruses specific for A(H3N2)v have been developed in the USA and could be used to produce an (H3N2)v vaccine if needed.\n\nOverall public health risk assessment for influenza A(H3N2)v viruses: further human cases and small clusters may be expected as this virus is circulating in the swine population in the USA. Sporadic human cases and small clusters of human infection with the virus are expected and do not change WHO's current assessment of pandemic risk at this point.\n\nHowever, because influenza viruses evolve constantly and change characteristics and behavior unpredictably, WHO continues to stress the importance of global monitoring of variant influenza viruses and recommends to all member states to strengthen routine surveillance activities. Countries experiencing outbreaks of influenza virus infection in animals should implement appropriate biosafety measures to protect people working with or living nearby infected and potentially infected animals. Collaboration with animal health partners is necessary to optimally control this disease and decrease risks to public health.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] USA (Michigan, West Virginia, Ohio)\nDate: Thu 16 Aug 2012\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy) News [edited]\nhttp://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/aug1612variant.html\n\n\n3 states report new cases of variant H3N2\n-----------------------------------------\nThis summer [2012] 2 more states -- Michigan and West Virginia -- reported their 1st cases of variant swine-origin H3N2 influenza (H3N2v) that has been linked to exposure to pigs at fairs. Also, Ohio health officials are reporting 72 cases, an increase of 18 from the total the state released on 14 Aug 2012. The new cases from Ohio, plus the cases in Michigan and West Virginia, appear to push the national number of new H3N2v cases this summer to 198. The Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) said yesterday [15 Aug 2012] that its 1st patient is a child from Washtenaw County who was recently exposed to pigs at the Ingham County Fair. Dean Sienko, the MDCH's interim chief medical executive, said in the statement that although the virus is new to Michigan, simple steps, such as washing hands frequently with soap and water after exposure to animals, can be taken to avoid getting sick. Meanwhile, the Michigan's assistant state veterinarian, Nancy Frank, emphasized that the new virus doesn't pose a food safety risk, because influenza isn't transmitted by food, and people can't get sick with influenza from eating pork and pork products.\n\nMeanwhile, West Virginia yesterday [15 Aug 2012] reported its 1st 3 H3N2v cases of the summer, which occurred in Mason County, according to a statement from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (WVDHHR). Marian Swinker, West Virginia's state health officer and commissioner for public health, said in the statement that the 3 cases were linked to attendance at the Gallia County Fair in Ohio, where swine were present. 'We will not be surprised to identify more cases of H3N2v in West Virginia as surveillance efforts to detect this illness have increased,' she said. The WVDHHR said it would post updates on new H3N2v cases in West Virginia each Thursday on its website. In December 2011, West Virginia reported 2 H3N2v infections, both in children who were daycare contacts and had no history of exposure to pigs, according to previous reports.\n\nIn other developments, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) said today that the number of H3N2v cases in the state has risen to 72, up from 54 cases on 14 Aug 2012. Infections have been reported from 20 counties, though more than half of them are from 3 counties: Butler, Champaign, and Gallia.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of cases of influenza A(H3N2)v virus infection continues to increase probably mainly as a consequence of enhanced surveillance and the availability of appropriate diagnostic reagents.

Limited serological studies indicate that adults may have some pre-existing immunity to this virus whereas children do not.

Indiana reported the highest number of cases at 138, up from 120 reported the previous week. The swine-origin H3N2 virus contains the matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus and so far this summer has been detected in Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nMaryland today [17 Aug 2012] reported its 1st 6 H3N2v infections, in 5 children and one adult from Queen Anne's county who had direct contact with pigs. None of the patients had serious infections or were hospitalised. Also, testing by the Maryland Department of Agriculture has detected a similar virus in pigs that the sick people had contact with at 4 Queen Anne's county farms. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (MDHMH) said in a statement that the findings in pigs are preliminary and will be confirmed by more testing. It said animal health officials will boost surveillance for the virus and monitor pigs at agricultural fairs in Maryland more closely for flulike symptoms. Fairs are under way in Montgomery and Worcester counties.\n\nPennsylvania is reporting 4 confirmed and 6 probable cases, all youth who participated in the Huntingdon County Fair that took place from 5 through 11 Aug [2012], according to a statement today [17 Aug 2012] from the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDH). None of the patients were hospitalized, and though investigations are ongoing, so far authorities have found no evidence of person-to-person spread. Eli Avila, MD, JD, MPH, Pennsylvania's secretary for health, said the illnesses fit the typical flu profile, and he urged people to take the same precautions as for seasonal flu. 'People should use common sense and take steps to protect their health if they're visiting or exhibiting in a county fair in the coming weeks, especially if they are at high risk for illnesses,' he added.\n\nWisconsin health officials today [17 Aug 2012] said the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene has confirmed 2 H3N2v cases, both with links to the Wisconsin State Fair, according to a statement from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS). The Wisconsin State Fair took place from 1 through 11 Aug 2012 in West Allis, a suburb of Milwaukee. One case was in an adult from southeastern Wisconsin who worked at the fair, but did not have direct contact with pigs. The other was in an adolescent from the western part of the state who exhibited swine at the fair. Neither patient has been hospitalized and both are recovering from their illness, the WDHS said. The Wisconsin Division of Public Health is working with the state lab and local health departments to identify additional cases. Henry Anderson, MD, Wisconsin's state health officer, said in the statement, 'We encourage people to enjoy all their local fairs have to offer this summer, but take precautions to reduce the chances of getting H3N2v influenza.' He urged older people, pregnant women, young children, and people with weakened immune systems to avoid swine barns this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Indiana reported that 3 more counties (Marion, Marshall, and Delaware) are reporting H3N2v cases, pushing the total number of affected counties to 23. In a statement yesterday [16 Aug 2012], the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) said it found some duplicated samples that were submitted to the state lab and it has adjusted the number of confirmed cases in some counties. Indiana health officials continue to investigate the cases but so far have found no evidence of person-to-person transmission, according to the statement, which said human infections are most likely in people who have close proximity to infected pigs, such as working with them in barns and in livestock exhibits at fairs.\n\nJoe Bresee, MD, medical epidemiologist in the CDC's Influenza Division, told CIDRAP News that most of the H3N2v cases are still occurring in kids and people who have direct exposure to pigs, such as spending all day in a barn with them at a fair. 'There have been some casual exposure cases, but not many,' he said, adding that the CDC doesn't have enough information about all of the cases yet to assess the relative risks of different types of exposure. The CDC expects to get more system data from the H3N2v infections in the next few weeks, Bresee said, but so far, more than 90 percent of the infections are occurring in kids, the same level the CDC reported last week.\n\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said no swine H3N2 virus that contain the former pandemic virus's matrix gene have been detected in European pigs. Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection (CHP) announced today [17 Aug 2012] that variant H3N2 has been declared a notifiable disease. A spokesman for the CHP said in a statement that the move was made to prepare for the possible importation of the virus into Hong Kong and that the strengthened surveillance can help streamline prevention and control measures.\n\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nKen Cokanasiga <kenc@spc.int>\n\n[In previous posts in this thread it has been stated that there had been no onward transmission of the A(H3N2)v influenza virus in humans.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said no swine H3N2 virus that contain the former pandemic virus's matrix gene have been detected in European pigs. There have been some casual exposure cases, but not many,' he said, adding that the CDC doesn't have enough information about all of the cases yet to assess the relative risks of different types of exposure. However the recent human cases of A(H3N2)v influenza virus infection were contracted from healthy pigs at agricultural fairs. It said animal health officials will boost surveillance for the virus and monitor pigs at agricultural fairs in Maryland more closely for flulike symptoms.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2021-01-06 00:00:00", "2009-03-25 00:00:00", "1974-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Delaware", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "Hong Kong"}, {"location": "Illinois", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "West Virginia", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Michigan", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Indiana", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Bresee", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Hawaii", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Allis", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Milwaukee", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Hong Kong 's", "country": "Hong Kong"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Maryland", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Wisconsin", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Ohio", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "JD", "country": "Somalia"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1238403", "headline": "PRO/AH> Influenza (68): A(H3N2)v, age-related seroprotection", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1238403", "date": "2012-08-10 12:45:18", "main_text": "INFLUENZA (68): A(H3N2)V, ACE-RELATED SEROPROTECTION\n****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 9 Aug 2012\nFrom: Danuta Skowronski <Danuta.Skowronski@bccdc.ca> [edited]\n\n\nRe: Influenza A/(H3N2)v: age-related seroprotection\n---------------------------------------------------\nIn response to recent ProMED-mail postings [see listing below] of additional H3N2v detections in the United States (US) in July and August 2012, we would like to provide reference to a paper now appearing in the Journal of Infectious Diseases (JID) entitled 'Cross-reactive and vaccine-induced antibody to emerging swine influenza A(H3N2)v' [1], selected as 'Editor's Choice', permitting Open Access to the manuscript at http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/08/07/infdis.jis500.abstract.\n\nThis paper reports age-specific seroprotection at greater precision, and across a broader age span, than previously available from earlier, smaller serosurveys [2-4].

[Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when isolated from swine, but are called variant viruses when isolated from humans. A variant virus (human isolate) might or might not have the M gene from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, along with other genetic changes. Seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses that circulate worldwide in the human population have significant antigenic and genetic differences from influenza A (H3N2viruses circulating in swine].\n\nThis report provides 1) an update on the number of reported cases of H3N2v infections from July 12 to August 9, 2012, in the United States, 2) an updated results interpretation for the CDC Flu Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) Dx Panel for A(H3N2)v for public health laboratories, and 3) an evaluation of rapid influenza diagnostic tests for the detection of H3N2v viruses.\n\nFrom July 12 to August 9, a total of 153 cases of H3N2v infections were reported in Indiana (120 cases), Ohio (31), Hawaii (one), and Illinois (one). Of the 138 reported cases for which demographic information was available, 128 (93%) occurred in persons aged <18 years, and 10 (7%) occurred in adults. The median age of patients was 7 years. Two persons were hospitalized as a result of their illness; no deaths occurred. The patient in Hawaii was exposed to swine on the job, and no additional cases were found in Hawaii. The 152 patients reported from Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio resided in 27 counties; all reported direct or indirect exposure to swine, the majority at agricultural fairs.\n\nH3N2v viruses can be detected by qualified U.S. public health laboratories using the CDC Flu rRT-PCR Dx Panel. Initially, if specimens tested positive for influenza A, H3, and pandemic influenza A markers and negative for H1 and pandemic H1 markers, they were reported as inconclusive until confirmed as influenza A (H3N2)v at the CDC laboratory (1). On August 7, CDC updated the results interpretation of the CDC Flu rRT-PCR Dx Panel for H3N2v for public health laboratories. Specimens with these findings may now be reported as 'presumptive positive for influenza A (H3N2)v virus' and, for the ongoing investigations, cases with presumptive-positive test results at the state or local public health laboratory will now be classified as confirmed, as are those cases confirmed at CDC.\n\nThe CDC Flu rRT-PCR Dx Panel is available in public health laboratories but is not a point-of-care test available to clinicians. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) frequently are used for the diagnosis of influenza infection in clinical settings, and the recent outbreaks of H3N2v virus (2,3) have highlighted the need to evaluate commercially available, widely used RIDTs for their ability to detect H3N2v viruses. As an initial assessment, CDC conducted an evaluation of seven FDA-cleared RIDTs with seven H3N2v viruses (Table 1). Five 10-fold dilutions in physiological saline of each virus grown in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were tested with all of the RIDTs in duplicate. Tests with BinaxNOW, Directigen, FluAlert, QuickVue, and Sofia were performed according to the procedures in the kit inserts for nasal washes or aspirates. Xpect tests were performed according to their procedure for nasal washes and swab specimens transported in liquid media. For the Veritor test, 100 \u00b5L of diluted specimen was added directly to the reagent tube. Positive and negative controls contained in each RIDT were run before testing the viruses in the study to verify performance of each assay lot, with the exception of FluAlert, which does not provide controls.\n\nOnly four of seven RIDTs in this study (Directigen, Sofia, Veritor, and Xpect) detected all influenza A (H3N2)v viruses (Table 2). BinaxNOW detected five of seven, and QuickVue detected three of seven. FluAlert detected only one of seven.\n\nMMWR Editorial Note\n-----------------\nThe H3N2v viruses identified since July 12, 2012, are similar to the 13 H3N2v viruses identified during July 2011-April 2012 (1); all sequenced viruses had the M gene from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. As of August 9, all H3N2v patients for whom contact information was available reported contact with swine or attended an agricultural fair where swine were present. During 2011, evidence of limited human-to-human transmission of H3N2v was observed in some cases, and human-to-human transmission might occur in the current outbreak. Enhanced surveillance for influenza H3N2v virus infection is indicated, especially in regions and states with confirmed H3N2v cases. The initial goal of enhanced surveillance is to detect the source and geographic spread of these viruses, but once cases are detected, particular emphasis should be placed on detection of ongoing transmission within the community through investigation of close contacts of patients with confirmed cases. In addition, surveillance in hospitals will be important to determine whether severe illnesses are occurring as a result of H3N2v infections.\n\nThe predominance of children among persons with confirmed H3N2v infections is consistent with serologic studies that found children less likely to have cross-protective antibodies than adults (4). However, confirmation of cases in adults highlights the fact that persons of any age can be infected. Persons who are at increased risk for influenza complications (e.g., those with underlying chronic medical conditions, or who are pregnant, or aged <5 or \u226565 years, or who have weakened immune systems [5]) should avoid exposure to pigs and swine barns this summer, particularly if ill swine have been identified. Persons with increased risk for complications who develop influenza-like illness should see their health-care provider promptly to determine whether treatment with antiviral medications is warranted. Clinicians should consider antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir in patients with suspected or confirmed H3N2v infection. Antiviral treatment is most effective when started as soon as possible after influenza illness onset (5).\n\nThe sensitivity of RIDTs to detect seasonal influenza viruses compared with virus isolation or rRT-PCR varies among commercial kits but has been shown to be low in some reports (6-9). In this evaluation of seven RIDTs, the ability to detect H3N2v virus varied substantially among the tests. This evaluation emphasizes the fact that a negative RIDT result should not be considered as conclusive evidence of lack of infection with influenza A (H3N2)v. More data are needed on the clinical performance of all RIDTs in detecting H3N2v virus in various respiratory specimens. Results from RIDTs, both positive and negative, always should be interpreted in the broader context of the circulating influenza strains present in the area, level of clinical suspicion, severity of illness, and risk for complications in a patient with suspected infection. Clinicians should minimize the occurrence of false RIDT results by strictly following the manufacturer's instructions, collecting specimens soon after onset of influenza-like illness (ideally within the first 72 hours), and confirming RIDT results by sending a specimen to a public health laboratory (10). Additional CDC guidance on interpretation of RIDTs for testing of patients with suspected H3N2v infection is available athttp://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-testing.htm.\n\nReferences\n---------\n1.

In July 2012, four new cases were reported from Indiana, all in persons who had contact with swine at a county fair. From July 12 to August 9, 2012, a total of 153 cases of H3N2v virus infection were reported in four states (Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio); all patients for whom such information was available reported direct or indirect contact with swine.

Enhanced surveillance for influenza H3N2v virus infection is indicated, especially in regions and states with confirmed H3N2v cases. Clinicians should minimize the occurrence of false RIDT results by strictly following the manufacturer's instructions, collecting specimens soon after onset of influenza-like illness (ideally within the first 72 hours), and confirming RIDT results by sending a specimen to a public health laboratory (10).

The current list includes the following 7 swine diseases: African swine fever, classical swine fever, Nipah virus encephalitis, porcine cysticercosis, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, swine vesicular disease and transmissible gastroenteritis.\n\nAs laid out in OIE's Disease Information Summary on Swine Influenza (http://tinyurl.com/brs96wx), the reason for the disease not being listed is explained by its low mortality rate and its being a 'very uncommonly documented human disease.' Accordingly, it does not meet OIE criteria for disease notification. The criteria that are democratically adopted by all OIE Members can be found in chapter 1.2 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code; see http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.1.2.htm.\n\nOIE's definition of 'Emerging disease' is: 'A new infection resulting from the evolution or change of an existing pathogenic agent, a known infection spreading to a new geographic area or population, or a previously unrecognized pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the 1st time and which has a significant impact on animal or public health.'\n\nA non-listed animal disease is officially required to be immediately notified if determined as 'an emerging disease with significant morbidity or mortality, or zoonotic potential.' This is spelled out in Article 1.1.3.1.e of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code.\n\nIn 2009/2010, countries from 3 continents notified to the OIE diagnosed cases in swine and other animal species of 'Pandemic A/H1N1 virus (2009),' caused by the novel A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, as an 'emerging disease.' The OIE encourages members to carry out surveillance and reporting of the presence of all epidemiologic events of significance in animals due to influenza viruses.\n\nA joint OIE-FAO network of expertise on influenza, called OFFLU, was established in 2005. It initially engaged in international efforts to monitor and control infections of avian influenza in poultry and other bird species and to share biological material and data to support early development of human pandemic vaccines, and later expanded its role to cover all animal influenza viruses, including swine influenza.\n\nA chapter on swine influenza is included in OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. A new version of the said chapter 2.8.8. was adopted by OIE's General Session, Paris, May 2010 (available on-line at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.08_SWINE_INFLUENZA.pdf).\n\n--\nArnon Shimshony\nProMED-mail Animal Disease and Zoonoses Moderator\n<promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "The undersigned's commentary to ProMED-mail's posting 'Influenza (64): USA A/(H3N2)v CDC report,' archive number 20120805.1228593, suggested that the subclinical or mild cases of influenza virus A/(H3N2)v recently recorded in swine in the USA are 'not regarded as OIE-notifiable swine influenza.' \n\nOIE's definition of 'Emerging disease' is: 'A new infection resulting from the evolution or change of an existing pathogenic agent, a known infection spreading to a new geographic area or population, or a previously unrecognized pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the 1st time and which has a significant impact on animal or public health.' \n\nAs laid out in OIE's Disease Information Summary on Swine Influenza (http://tinyurl.com/brs96wx), the reason for the disease not being listed is explained by its low mortality rate and its being a 'very uncommonly documented human disease.'

But the states said they have not found any person-to-person transmission of the virus.\n\nIn a news release, the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) said the 113 cases are scattered among 18 counties and predicted that more cases would be confirmed this week. Most of the previous cases have been in children who had contact with pigs at county fairs, but today's announcement gave no details about the patients' age range, swine exposure, or severity of illness. The Ohio announcement states, 'There are currently 30 cases of H3N2v statewide; all individuals had direct contact with swine at fairs and no human-to-human passage of the virus has been confirmed.' The counties and their case numbers are Butler, 16; Clark, 3; Gallia, 4; Greene, 4; and Hamilton, 3.\n\nThe Ohio patients range from 6 months to 36 years old, the statement said. It said one patient was hospitalized as a precaution but has since been released. One other H3N2v case was reported recently in Hawaii. With the new Indiana and Ohio cases, the apparent total for the past few weeks has now reached 144. However, Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cautioned that the growing case count in part reflects increased testing and that some of the cases may not ultimately be confirmed.\n\n'The increase in Indiana and soon to be other states is because states are now reporting presumptive positive cases based on testing in their labs and part of this is because of increasing numbers of samples arrived for testing compared with last week,' Skinner commented via e-mail. He added that the CDC believes most of the cases are still due to contact with pigs. 'However, limited human-to-human transmission with this virus has been observed in the past, and we expect that some human to human spread will be observed in these current outbreaks,' he said. The Indiana release said, 'Health officials have not determined person-to-person transmission at this time, but continue to investigate the possibility.'\n\nSkinner and officials from the 2 states reemphasized the need to take precautions around pigs and when attending fairs. People should wash their hands before and after touching animals and should avoid eating, drinking, or putting anything in the mouth when visiting animal areas, officials said. They also reiterated that the virus is not spread through eating properly prepared pork. The CDC has said that people who have an increased risk for flu complications, such as the elderly, small children, and those with chronic diseases, should consider avoiding pigs and swine barns this summer. 'It's important for folks to remember this is a mild illness with symptoms similar to what we see with seasonal flu,' said State Health Commissioner Gregory Larkin, MD, in the Indiana statement today. The CDC has developed a candidate vaccine for the new strain, and clinical trials of versions made by two companies are expected this fall.\n\nIndiana counties that have had H3N2v cases, according to today's announcement, are Bartholomew, Greene, Hamilton, Hendricks, Jackson, Jennings, Johnson, Kosciusko, LaPorte, Lawrence, Monroe, Morgan, Owen, Porter, Scott, Tipton, Washington, and White. A report from Indiana Public Media today said 68 people in Monroe County have contracted the virus. Penny Caudill, administrator of the Monroe County health Department, said the virus does not appear to have spread from person to person, according to the story. The swine barn at the Monroe County Fair was closed last week because of sickness among the pigs.\n\n[Byline: Robert Roos, Lisa Schnirring]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n*****\n[2]\nDate: 9 Aug 2012\nSource: Boston.com (AP) [edited]\nhttp://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/2012/08/09/cdc-cases-new-swine-flu-strain-from-pigs/0D9SRdONnQgLtCZzFHqK5J/story.html\n\n\nCDC: 158 cases of new swine flu strain from pigs\n------------------------------------\nHealth officials Thursday reported a five-fold increase of cases of a new strain of swine flu that spreads from pigs to people.\n\nThe cumulative case count jumped from 29 a week ago to 158 this week, thanks to a wave of new cases confirmed in Indiana and Ohio, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Most of the cases have been tied to state and county agricultural fairs, where visitors are put in close contact with infected pigs, said the CDC's Dr. Joseph Bresee.\n\nThe recent cases include at least 113 in Indiana, 30 in Ohio, one in Hawaii and one in Illinois, Bresee said.\n\nMost of the infected patients are children -- probably because many were working closely with raising, displaying and visiting pigs at the agricultural fairs, Bresee said.\n\nAlso, diagnosis of cases has become quicker in the last week. CDC no longer must confirm a case with its own lab. Now states are using CDC test kits to confirm cases on their own on, speeding the process along. The patients were likely infected a week or two ago.\n\nThe CDC has been tracking cases since last summer. A concern: the new strain has a gene from the 2009 pandemic strain that might let it spread more easily than pig viruses normally do.\n\nThe good news is the flu does not seem to be unusually dangerous. Almost all of the illnesses have been mild and no one has died. Two of the recent cases were hospitalized, but both recovered and were discharged, added Bresee, the agency's chief of influenza epidemiology.\n\nMore good news is that all of the recent cases appear to have spread from pigs to humans, meaning it's not very contagious, at least between people.\n\nBut there probably will be more cases in the weeks ahead, and it won't be surprising if at least a few of them involve person-to-person transmission, Bresee said.end of story marker\n\n[byline: Mike Stobbe]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Type A influenza viruses, including H3N2 and its variants, commonly infect swine, causing outbreaks among swine herds.

The state Agriculture Department plans to take nasal swabs of a 'couple' of pig herds on Maui looking for evidence of the H3N2v virus, said state veterinarian Dr. James Foppoli.\n\nSince August 2011, the H3N2v virus has only been found in 17 patients on the mainland, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 'If we find an infected herd, our recommendation is to not move the animals to make sure there's no more transmission in the herd, and then they will be OK to go to slaughter once they're well,' Foppoli said. 'Human-to-human transmission is uncommon, so that's not a likely source. You've got to suspect that there's a pig intermediate somewhere along the line where the person got the virus.'\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late last week confirmed Hawaii's 1st case of the H3N2v virus after the unidentified, adult Maui resident sought medical attention upon experiencing symptoms consistent with the regular seasonal flu, including fever, cough and body aches, the Health Department said. The patient has recovered fully and did not require hospitalization, the Health Department said.\n\nHealth officials recommend that people who have been in 'close contact with pigs' consult with their health care providers if they come down with flu-like symptoms, said Health Department spokeswoman Judy Kern. She emphasized that 'pork is safe to eat if properly cooked. There is no risk at all for properly cooked pork.' State agriculture officials are encouraging Hawaii's swine producers to practice good hygiene, such as hand washing. In 2009, 13 people in Hawaii -- most of them on Oahu -- died after contracting the H1N1 'swine flu' virus that also sickened dozens of other patients.\n\nUntil the Maui case, the new H3N2v flu had been confirmed in Indiana (6 cases), Iowa (3), Maine (2), Pennsylvania (3), Utah (one) and West Virginia (2), according to the CDC. Hawaii health officials said the mainland cases occurred primarily in children and those who work closely with pigs. 'The virus seems to be behaving as previously observed in other cases, with illness similar to seasonal flu and with no sustained community transmission,' state epidemiologist Sarah Park said in a statement. 'Still, anyone who develops flu-like illness within a week after close contact with domestic pigs should see their healthcare provider.' Children, pregnant women, seniors and anyone with compromised immune systems should be particularly careful around pigs and practice good hand-washing habits, the Health Department said.\n\nBecause the Maui patient's primary care doctor participates in the Health Department's influenza like-illness sentinel network, a respiratory specimen was 1st sent to the state Laboratories Division for testing. 'Fortunately, we have a robust surveillance network, and our state laboratory detected this variant virus and conferred with federal partners,' Health Director Loretta Fuddy said in a statement. 'Thanks to the excellent cooperation of Hawaii's health care providers, participation in our sentinel network exceeds CDC recommendations,' Fuddy said. 'In addition to our state laboratory's ability to identify unusual flu strains, sentinel physicians contribute to our ability to catch incidents such as this, which might otherwise fall below the radar.'\n\n[Byline: Dan Nakaso]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDavid Duffy\nPacific Cooperative Studies Unit\nBotany\nUniversity of Hawaii\n3190 Maile Way\nHonolulu Hawaii 96822 USA\n<dduffy@hawaii.edu>\n\n[The number of known A(H3N2)v cases in the United States has now risen to 17 in the past year.

The H3N2v virus contains the M gene from the human influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2009 H1N1) virus, as have the previous 17 cases detected since July 2011 [last year]. All of this week's reported cases occurred in people who had direct or indirect contact with swine prior to their illness. The 10 cases in Ohio were associated with attendance at a fair where reportedly ill swine were present. The H3N2v case reported by Indiana also occurred in a person who attended a fair where swine were present. CDC continues to recommend preventive actions people can take to make their fair experience a safe and healthy one.\n\nThe number of cases of infection with H3N2v viruses with the M gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus detected in the United States since July 2011 now totals 29 [Hawaii (1), Indiana (7), Iowa (3), Ohio (10), Maine (2), Pennsylvania (3), Utah (1), and West Virginia (2)]. Twenty-three of these cases reported swine contact prior to illness onset. Among those 29 cases, 19 cases were associated with fairs where swine were present. Most human illness with H3N2v virus infection has resulted in signs and symptoms of influenza (fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, muscle aches); 3 hospitalizations have occurred. All of the people hospitalized had high risk conditions. All H3N2v virus cases have recovered fully.\n\nAccording to USDA [US Department of Agriculture] swine influenza surveillance, this swine H3N2 virus with the pandemic [virus] M gene has been detected in swine in a number of U.S. states. This virus may be circulating widely in U.S. swine at this time. It should be noted, however, that influenza viruses have not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and prepared pork (pig meat) or other products derived from pigs. It is possible that acquisition of the M gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus may allow H3N2v viruses to be more transmissible from pigs to people and from person-to-person.\n\nLate summer is typically fair season across the United States, and fairs are a setting that can provide many opportunities for exposures to occur between pigs and people. CDC continues to advise people to take recommended precautions when interacting with pigs or their environments, including frequent hand washing and avoiding contact with pigs that appear ill. The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians has developed the 'Compendium of Measures to Prevent Disease Associated with Animals in Public Settings, 2011' to provide some preventive actions that are applicable to people raising swine, showing swine at fairs, or attending fairs.\n\nThis includes:\n- Wash your hands frequently with soap and running water before and after exposure to animals.\n- Never eat, drink or put things in your mouth while in animal areas and don't take food or drink into animal areas.\n- Young children, pregnant women, people 65 and older and people with weakened immune systems should be extra careful around animals.\n- If you have animals -- including swine -- watch them for signs of illness and call a veterinarian if you suspect they might be sick.\n- Avoid close contact with animals that look or act ill, when possible.\n- Avoid contact with pigs if you are experiencing flu-like symptoms.\n- If you must come in contact with pigs while you are sick, or if you must come in contact with pigs known or suspected to be infected, or their environment, you should use appropriate protective measures (for example, wear protective clothing, gloves, masks that cover your mouth and nose, and other personal protective equipment) and practice good respiratory and hand hygiene.\n\nAdditionally, in response to recent human cases of H3N2v virus infection, CDC would like to convey the following information:\n\n1. Children younger than 5 years, people 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic medical conditions (like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions) are at high risk from serious complications if they get influenza. These people should consider avoiding exposure to pigs and swine barns this summer, especially if sick pigs have been identified.\n\n2. Studies conducted by CDC have indicated that children younger than 10 years old would have little to no immunity against H3N2v virus, whereas adults may have some cross-protective immunity. Most cases of H3N2v have occurred in children at this time.\n\n3. There are two FDA-approved drugs that are expected to be effective in treating illness associated with H3N2v virus infection. The antiviral drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) - which are used to treat infection with human seasonal influenza viruses -- are also expected to be effective in treating H3N2v virus. Antiviral treatment is most effective when started as soon as possible after illness onset.\n\n4. Signs and symptoms of H3N2v virus infection cannot be differentiated from those caused by other respiratory infections, including seasonal influenza virus infection.\n\n5. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests may not detect H3N2v virus in human respiratory specimens ([they may give] false negative results). If H3N2v virus infection is suspected because of recent exposure to pigs or to an ill person who had contact with pigs, testing of respiratory specimens should be done at a state health department.\n\n6. Influenza viruses have not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and prepared pork (pig meat) or other products derived from pigs.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[While swine influenza A viruses seldom infect humans, such infections have occurred. Human infections with swine viruses are thought to occur in the same way that seasonal influenza viruses spread among people. Pigs that are infected shed influenza virus -- possibly in coughs or sneezes -- and people who are nearby can breathe the virus in. Infection also may occur by a person touching a surface or object that has virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose.'\n\nSigns of swine flu in pigs can include fever, depression, coughing (barking), discharge from the nose or eyes, sneezing, breathing difficulties, eye redness or inflammation, and going off feed. Some pigs infected with influenza viruses, however, may have no symptoms at all.\n\nMore information about H3N2v is available on the CDC website at 'Information on H3N2 Variant Influenza A Viruses'\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/influenza-variant-viruses-h3n2v.htm.\n\nInfluenza A/(H3N2)v viruses have only been detected in North America so far. - Mod.CP]\n\n[In order to improve communications and avoid confusion, FAO, OIE and WHO established, in late 2011, a working group of experts to standardize the terminology for variant influenza viruses. The joint recommendation for the above mentioned A(H3N2) virus was: A (H3N2)v , where 'v' stands for 'variant'. Subclinical or mild cases of influenza have been reportedly observed in swine in contact with infected humans (eg a county fair in Indiana) where the A (H3N2)v strain was identified in both man and animal. These cases are not regarded as the OIE-notifiable 'Swine influenza', a highly contagious viral infection of pigs caused by pathogenic Swine Influenza Virus (SIV) strains. In some instances, SIV infections are associated with reproductive disorders such as abortion. Morbidity rates can reach 100% with SIV infections, while mortality rates are generally low. Secondary bacterial infections can exacerbate the clinical signs following infection with SIV. Transmission is through contact with SIV-containing secretions such as nasal discharges and aerosols created by coughing or sneezing.(H3N2)v causing sub-clinical or mild disease in swine, seems not to be regarded as the notifiable SIV. During 2009/2010, when the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (2009) virus) was reportedly spreading globally in humans, becoming a cause for international concern, more than 20 countries notified the OIE about the identification of the virus in swine, as an 'emerging disease'. This virus was generally regarded to spread through the human-to-swine route. - Mod.ARN]\n\n[The Hawaiian case presents a puzzle. In ProMED post Influenza (61): USA (HI) A/(H3N2)v, pig worker, 20120802.1225864, state veterinarian Dr. James Foppoli is quoted as saying 'Human-to-human transmission is uncommon, so that's not a likely source. You've got to suspect that there's a pig intermediate somewhere along the line where the person got the virus.' Since there is no suggestion that the human had become infected during travel outside Hawaii, is that island importing pigs from the USA mainland? - Mod.JW]", "summary": "These cases are not regarded as the OIE-notifiable 'Swine influenza', a highly contagious viral infection of pigs caused by pathogenic Swine Influenza Virus (SIV) strains.

All 4 individuals had direct contact with swine and all 4 cases are now recovered.\n\nThe State Health Department continues to collect information to determine the extent of the illnesses. Symptoms reported include cough, fever and sore throat. Confirmed test results on patient specimens indicate the cause as a variant influenza A virus. Swine specimens also tested positive for this virus. [Since August 2011, the US CDC has identified several human infections in 5 states with a swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) viruses -- now referred to as 'influenza A (H3N2)v, a variant influenza viruses with genes from avian, swine and human viruses.' These A(H3N2)v viruses also have the M gene from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. See: Update: Influenza A (H3N2)v Transmission and Guidelines -- Five States, 2011, MMWR Weekly, January 6, 2012 / 60(51);1741-1744 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6051a4.htm#box].\n\nInfluenza viruses can be directly transmitted from swine to people and from people to swine. Human infections are most likely to occur when people are in close proximity to live infected swine, such as in barns and livestock exhibits at fairs. Influenza viruses are not transmitted by eating pork or pork products. Since 2011, 17 human cases of [a] variant influenza A virus have been identified nationwide; 6 of these cases have been identified in Indiana.\n\nIndividuals should always wash hands with soap and water before and after petting or touching any animal. Never eat, drink, or put anything in your mouth in animal areas. Older adults, pregnant women, young children, and people with weakened immune systems should be extra careful around animals. Hoosiers who have direct, routine contact with swine, such as working in swine barns or showing swine at fairs, and have experienced cough or influenza-like illness should contact their health care provider or local health department. Symptoms include cough, sore throat, fever, body aches, and possibly other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea.\n\nWhile influenza is not an uncommon diagnosis in pigs, the State Board of Animal Health encourages swine owners to contact a veterinarian if their animals show signs consistent with flu, including coughing, respiratory illness, off-feed and fever.

On 16 Jul 2012, specimens were collected from 4 persons with respiratory illness; 2 had become ill on 12 Jul 2012 and sought care at an emergency department, and 2 were identified as part of the subsequent public health investigation. All 4 persons were swine exhibitors or family members of swine exhibitors and had close contact with swine.\n\nOn 18 Jul 2012, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing at the Indiana State Department of Health laboratory identified suspected influenza A (H3N2) variant (H3N2v) virus in all 4 specimens. On 21 Jul 2012, partial genome sequencing at CDC confirmed H3N2v virus with the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus M gene; the viruses detected in the 4 specimens are similar to 12 viruses detected in 2011 and one detected earlier this year (1). None of the 4 persons were hospitalized, and all have fully recovered. [See also ProMED-mail archived report: Influenza (57) - USA: (IN) A(H3N2)v cases 20120725.1214922].\n\nAdditionally, all respiratory specimens collected from a sample of 12 swine at the fair were positive for influenza A (H3N2) virus. The specimens were forwarded to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories of the U.S. Department of Agriculture for additional testing. Preliminary genetic analysis has shown a very high level of similarity between the gene sequences of H3N2v viruses from humans and the H3N2 viruses from swine.\n\nAlthough human-to-human transmission of H3N2v has been limited in previous outbreaks (1), these viruses could change to transmit efficiently among humans. Clinicians who suspect influenza in persons with recent exposure to swine should obtain a nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate from the patient, place the swab or aspirate in viral transport medium, and contact their state or local health department to arrange transport and request a timely diagnosis at a state public health laboratory (1). Clinicians should consider antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir in suspected cases (2).\n\nPersons who raise swine or come into close contact with swine at fairs or other venues should be aware of the potential risk for influenza transmission between swine and humans. To reduce this risk, preventive measures such as practicing frequent hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette are recommended. Persons also should avoid close contact with animals that look or act ill, when possible, and if experiencing influenza-like illness themselves, should avoid contact with swine. Additional guidelines on prevention of influenza transmission between humans and swine are available at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/industry_guidance.htm.\n\nIncluding the cases in this report, 17 infections with H3N2v virus with the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus M gene have been reported since August 2011. Novel influenza A virus infection in humans is a nationally notifiable disease (3) and a reportable disease under International Health Regulations (4). State public health laboratories should contact CDC and send all suspected novel influenza A specimens for confirmatory testing.

They noted that most Cambodian swine are raised on small farms in proximity to humans and other animal species.\n\nSo far, swine influenza viruses have never been isolated in Cambodia, and only rarely in surrounding countries. Antibodies against influenza A were detected in 14.9 percent of samples. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus was found after the pandemic virus reached Cambodia and was the most frequently found virus, peaking in 2010, followed by seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, which peaked in 2008.\n\nResearchers found that some of the pigs had been exposed to more than one human flu virus, a factor they said could lead to reassortment events that could produce new pathogenic variants.\n\nTests on 150 random samples found no evidence of H5N1 avian influenza exposure.\n\nThe investigators concluded that more systematic surveillance systems are needed to monitor influenza A viruses on farms rather than just slaughterhouses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMike Nunn\n<Mike.Nunn@daff.gov.au>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 31 May 2012\nSource: Influenza & Other Respiratory Viruses -- early view (Article first published online: 29 May 2012) [edited]\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00382.x/abstract\n\n\n[Ref: Rith S, Netrabukkana P, Sorn S, et al (2012): Serologic evidence of human influenza virus infections in swine populations, Cambodia.

The results were compared by year, age, and province.\n\nResults:\nAntibodies against a human influenza A virus were detected in 14.9 percent of samples. A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were dominant over the study period (23.1 percent), followed by those to human H1N1 (17.3 percent) and H3N2 subtypes (9.9 percent). No pigs were serologically positive for avian H5 influenza viruses. The seroprevalence of human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses peaked in 2008, while that of A(H1N1)pdm09 reached a peak in 2010. No significant differences in seroprevalence to human influenza subtypes were observed in different age groups.\n\nConclusions:\nCambodian pigs were exposed to human strains of influenza A viruses either prior to or during this study. The implications of these high prevalence rates imply human-to-swine influenza virus transmission in Cambodia. Although pigs are mostly raised in small non-commercial farms, our preliminary results provide evidence of sustained human influenza virus circulation in pig populations in Cambodia.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The current observations from Cambodia, indicative of continuous circulation of human influenza A viruses in the pig population, are in line with past observations in many countries (1).

Our findings for 2010-11, currently in press with Clinical Infectious Diseases [1], are also relevant to Dr. Wilson's queries for the 2011-12 season.\n\nDuring the 2010-11 season, H3N2 viruses dominated among influenza detections in Canada and through phylogenetic analysis we identified two variant clades among strains circulating through the sentinel system [1]. Viruses belonging to the A/Hong Kong/2121/2010 clade comprised nearly 90% and those belonging to the A/Victoria/208/2009 clade about 10% of sequenced strains. Based on phylogenetic analysis, few belonged to the A/Perth/16/2009 vaccine clade. Both variant clades showed substantial amino acid substitutions away from the vaccine strain in key antigenic sites, meeting genetic criteria for potential antigenic drift [2]. Consistent with this, we measured suboptimal vaccine effectiveness for the H3N2 component of TIV that season [1].\n\nFor the 2011-12 northern and 2012 southern hemisphere influenza seasons, the A/Perth/16/2009 vaccine strain was retained as H3N2 component but has been replaced for the 2012-13 TIV by A/Victoria/361/2009 [3]. The latter belongs to the A/Victoria/208/2009 clade we identified through sentinel surveillance in Canada in 2010-11, but has accumulated further mutations in antigenic sites [1].\n\nIn British Columbia, we have identified more significant contribution from the A/Victoria phylogenetic clade this season and given our geographic proximity, the same may also be anticipated in the USA Pacific Northwest. The most recent surveillance bulletin for Washington state reports that 10/22 H3N2 viruses characterized to date for 2011-12 show reduced titres with antiserum produced against the A/Perth/16/2009 vaccine strain [4]. In that regard, suboptimal protection among vaccinated children this season may not be unexpected. It would be informative if the viruses detected by Dr. Wilson and colleagues were also strain characterized and sequenced to better elucidate their identity.\n\nWe should point out that influenza B has also been a contributor to influenza activity in British Columbia in recent weeks, with some lineage-level mismatch to the vaccine component noted among characterized strains, a finding also in common with Washington state [4].\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

But the\ninvestigation into the West Virginia case suggests the child was\ninfected by another person, not a pig and that some amount of\nhuman-to-human spread of the virus took place in the unnamed community\nwhere the child lives, according to details released Friday by the\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control [see below - Mod.CP].\n\nThe H3N2 case is the 12th \u2013 in five states -- reported in the U.S.\nsince this new virus was first spotted in July. And the CD\nacknowledges there are probably more cases that haven\u2019t been picked\nup by the country\u2019s flu surveillance systems. 'We don\u2019t think\nthese are all' the cases, said Dr. Joe Bresee, head of the influenza\nepidemiology team in the CDC's Influenza division. To date no other\ncountry has reported seeing human infections with this virus, which\nhas also been isolated from pigs in the U.S.\n\nDetails of the investigations into the West Virginia case -- the\nsecond in that state -- and one spotted in the fall in Indiana were\nreleased late Friday [23 Dec 2011]. The Indiana case was in a man who\nworked with pigs. A separate release revealed details of the Wisconsin\ncase, which involved a new H1N1 virus with genes from avian, swine and\nhuman flu viruses. The case accounts were contained in a report that\nrevealed that international influenza science partners have agreed to\na new name for these viruses, one that drops the constant reference to\nthe viruses\u2019 swine origin. The agricultural sector objected loudly\nin the early days of the 2009 pandemic when human health officials\nreferred to the new virus as a swine influenza virus. Pork sales\nplummeted and the industry has been worried the same could happen\nagain with new reports of human infections with swine flu viruses. The\nWorld Health Organization and the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture\nOrganization have agreed to call these viruses 'H3N2 variants' or\nH3N2v for short. The new H1N1 virus -- which has been circulating in\npigs since last year -- will be similarly called H1N1v.\n\nThe H3N2v viruses are hybrids of a swine influenza virus that has been\ncirculating for more than a decade in pigs. That virus has acquired an\ninternal gene -- the M gene -- from the H1N1 virus that caused the\n2009 pandemic. Studies have shown that gene appears to make viruses\nthat contain it more transmissible among guinea pigs, a model that is\nused to predict how flu behaves in humans. The virus from the H1N1v\ncase in Wisconsin also contains the M gene from the 2009 pandemic\nvirus.\n\nCases of human infection with the variant H3N2 virus have been seen in\nIndiana, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Maine and West Virginia. Most have been\nin children younger than 10 and none of the cases has died. Six of the\n12 had exposure to pigs but in the other six, no contact with swine\ncould be found. The CDC has said it believes some of these cases are\nthe result of human-to-human spread, but suggests spread among people\nis probably still limited at this point.\n'It\u2019s not clear yet that these viruses have acquired the ability to\ncirculate in humans in a sustained way. We certainly haven\u2019t seen\nthat in the outbreaks that we\u2019ve investigated' Bresee said. But the\nreport on the case in West Virginia suggests there may have been quite\na few more cases there. And surveillance in the area and the adjacent\ncommunities of Maryland has been ramped up.\n\nThe latest case was a child under five years of age who attended the\nsame daycare as West Virginia\u2019s earlier case of H3N2v infection. But\nthere were more than 10 days between the onset of the first case and\nthe onset of the second, which suggests the first child was not the\nsource of the second child\u2019s infection. Furthermore, multiple\ncontacts of the two children -- including other children in the\ndaycare -- were reported to have had respiratory illnesses in the\nperiod when the cases occurred, though most were not tested for flu.\n\nThis H3N2v virus is a distant cousin of the virus by the same name\nthat circulates among humans. Testing conducted at the CDC suggests\nthe virus is most closely related to human H3N2 viruses that\ncirculated in the early 1990s, which suggests many people over age 20\nmay have some antibodies that would respond to the variant virus.\n\nFlu experts are watching the situation with concern, though not alarm\nat this point. What path the virus will take remains unclear: it could\npeter out, continue to circulate at low levels, mainly in young\nchildren, or spread more broadly. Most experts don\u2019t believe it\ncould cause a pandemic, given the amount of immunity the human\npopulation has to human H3N2 viruses. But they worry it might be able\nto seed itself in humans enough to continue to spread, potentially\ncreating a situation where there might be three families of\ncirculating influenza A viruses: the H1N1s, the human H3N2s and these\nvariant H3N2s.,If it appeared the viruses were causing enough disease\nto warrant including them in the annual flu strain 'that will be a\nmess,' said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, an influenza researcher at New\nYork\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital. 'If they jump into humans, I don\u2019t\nthink it will be a big public health nightmare,' Garcia-Sastre said.\n'But I think what it could do is it may be able to establish a second\nlineage of H3s. And that will make it very difficult to handle, from\nthe point of view of the vaccine.'\n\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 23 Dec 2011\nSource: MMWR Weekly 2011 / 60 (Early Release);1-4 [abridged & edited]\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm60e1223a1.htm?s_cid=mm60e1223a1_w\n\nUpdate: Influenza A (H3N2)v Transmission and Guidelines -- Five\nStates, 2011\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n>From 17 Aug to 23 Dec 2011, 2011, CDC received reports of 12 human\ninfections with influenza A (H3N2)v viruses that have the matrix (M)\ngene from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus (formerly called\nswine-origin influenza A [H3N2] and pandemic influenza A [H1N1] 2009\nviruses, respectively). [See the note on nomenclature change\nreproduced in the Moderator's comment below]. The 12 cases occurred in\nfive states (Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia),\nand 11 were in children (1,2). Six of the 12 patients had no\nidentified recent exposure to swine. Three of the 12 patients were\nhospitalized, and all have recovered fully.\n\nA case in an adult male in Indiana with occupational exposure to swine\nwas among the 12, and two children in West Virginia who regularly\nattended the same day care accounted for the latest cases. This report\ndescribes those cases and swine influenza virus (SIV) surveillance\nbeing conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nCase Reports\n-----------\nIndiana\n------\nOn 28 Oct 2011, CDC was notified by the Indiana Department of Health\nof a suspected case of A(H3N2)v virus infection in an adult male. The\npatient experienced onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath,\nnausea, vomiting, and body aches on October 20, and was hospitalized\nfor 4 days. He did not receive treatment with influenza antiviral\nmedications and recovered fully.\n\nOn October 22, a respiratory specimen from the patient was positive\nfor influenza at the hospital. On October 28, the virus was identified\nby real-time, reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction\n(rRT-PCR) testing at the Indiana State Public Health Laboratory as an\ninconclusive influenza A virus, consistent with results seen with\nother recent A(H3N2)v infections. On October 31, genome sequencing at\nCDC confirmed the virus as A(H3N2)v with the M gene from the\nA(H1N1)pdm09 virus, similar to the viruses identified in the other\ncases of human infection in the United States since August 2011.\n\nThe patient reported direct contact with swine during his work in the\nweek before illness onset. He said he did not wear any personal\nprotective equipment (PPE) because the swine did not exhibit signs of\nillness. No illness was reported among the patient's household members\nor other close contacts.\n\nWest Virginia\n--------\nOn November 19, a child aged <5 years developed acute onset of fever\nafter 1 week of cough and congestion. The child had been hospitalized\nfor an unrelated condition 2 days before the onset of fever. On\nNovember 21, a respiratory specimen was collected. Rapid diagnostic\ntests conducted by the hospital were negative for influenza and\nrespiratory syncytial virus, but influenza A was identified by an\nalternative rRT-PCR at the hospital. The specimen was forwarded to the\nWest Virginia Office of Laboratory Services, where it was identified\nas a suspected influenza A (H3N2)v virus. Subsequent genome sequencing\nconducted at CDC confirmed the virus as A(H3N2)v with the M gene from\nthe A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The child, who had no recent travel or\nexposure to swine, was discharged on November 21, and has since\nrecovered from the influenza illness.\n\nAn investigation was conducted to ascertain respiratory illnesses\namong contacts of the child that occurred during November 9\u2013December\n19. Multiple contacts, including children who regularly attended day\ncare with the child, were found to have had respiratory illness during\nthis period. On November 29, a second child aged <5 years who attended\nday care regularly with the first child and who had no recent travel\nor swine exposure became ill with fever, cough, diarrhea, and\nrhinorrhea. The second child did not seek medical care and recovered\nfully from the illness. A respiratory specimen obtained from the\nsecond child on December 7 was inconclusive by rRT-PCR at the West\nVirginia Office of Laboratory Services; however, the specimen was\nconfirmed as influenza A (H3N2)v with the M gene from the A(H1N1)pdm09\nvirus via genome sequencing at CDC.\n\nNo additional A(H3N2)v cases have been identified among the other ill\nday care attendees or contacts of either patient. Enhanced\nsurveillance for influenza-like illness and increased diagnostic\ntesting of respiratory specimens is being conducted in West Virginia\nand adjacent counties in Maryland as part of the ongoing investigation\nof these cases. Currently, no evidence of additional human-to-human\ntransmission in the community has been identified.\n\nInfluenza Surveillance of U.S. Swine\n-----------------------------\nSurveillance for SIV in the United States is overseen by USDA, largely\nin swine that display influenza-like illness. In July 2009, USDA's\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the swine industry\nimplemented a SIV surveillance program to characterize the\ndistribution of SIV in U.S. swine herds. To date, approximately 150\nSIV isolates have undergone sequencing of three genes (hemagglutinin,\nmatrix, and neuraminidase gene segments) and sequences have been\nsubmitted to GenBank. Thirty isolates have been identified as A(H3N2)\nviruses and eight of those 30 have the M gene from the influenza A\n(H1N1)pdm09 virus as determined by an informal analysis of GenBank\nsubmission data by the USDA Agricultural Research Service. Further\ncharacterization and analysis are ongoing, and new submissions are\nadded as diagnostic work is completed.\n\nMMWR Editorial Note\n-----------------\nHuman infections with the influenza viruses currently circulating\namong swine are rare. Since 2005, only 35 cases have been reported in\nthe United States, but the frequency with which they have been\ndetected increased in 2011. When different influenza viruses\nsimultaneously infect a single host (e.g., a human or swine), exchange\nof genetic material can occur, resulting in a new influenza virus.\nDepending on the antigenic distance between the new virus and recently\ncirculating seasonal viruses, little or no immunity might exist in the\nhuman population. Influenza A (H3N2)v viruses resulted from\nreassortment of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses with swine influenza A\n(H3N2) viruses. A diagram depicting this reassortment is available\nonline from CDC's Public Health Image Library [Available at:\nhttp://phil.cdc.gov/phil/details.asp (image ID: 13469]. Because these\nviruses carry a newly identified combination of genes, little\ninformation is available regarding transmission efficiency in swine,\nin humans, or between swine and humans. However, the recent human\ncases involving swine exposure and results of SIV surveillance\nindicate that these viruses also currently are circulating in swine\nherds.\n\nThe case of influenza A (H3N2)v infection after occupational contact\nwith swine in Indiana and the apparent limited human-to-human\ntransmission of A(H3N2)v virus that occurred in a day care setting in\nWest Virginia represent two different possible scenarios for\ntransmission of this virus. Work exposure highlights the risk for\ninterspecies influenza transmission in occupational settings where\nhumans are exposed to swine, an association that has been described\npreviously (3\u20137). To minimize the risk for interspecies influenza\ntransmission in occupational settings, CDC and the Occupational Safety\nand Health Administration (OSHA) encourage swine workers to 1) get\nvaccinated against human seasonal influenza, 2) wear appropriate PPE,\nand 3) practice good hygiene, such as washing hands thoroughly with\nsoap and water, when in contact with swine, especially swine that show\nsigns of illness. The National Pork Board also recommends producers\nwork with their veterinarian to develop appropriate prevention and\ncontrol measures for influenza in swine, which can include vaccinating\nswine against swine influenza. Similar to humans, swine infected with\ninfluenza viruses do not always exhibit signs of infection (8).\nPersons with swine exposure in the week before onset of an illness\nwith symptoms of influenza requiring medical care should notify their\nhealth-care provider of their swine exposures. Persons who develop\nsymptoms of influenza after close contact with swine are recommended\nto stay home until well to minimize contact with persons and swine as\nmuch as possible.\n\nThe A(H3N2)v cases in West Virginia involved two children who attended\nthe same day care, but the first child was unlikely to have\ntransmitted the virus to the second child, given the \u226510-day\ndifference in their symptom onset dates. This represents a scenario of\nlimited human-to-human transmission occurring in a day care setting.\nTherefore, clinicians also should consider the possibility of\ninfluenza A (H3N2)v infections in patients who have not had exposure\nto swine, particularly young children in those states where influenza\nA (H3N2)v cases have been reported. Clinicians who suspect variant\ninfluenza virus infection should obtain a nasopharyngeal swab, place\nthe swab in viral transport medium, and contact their state or local\nhealth department to facilitate transport and timely diagnosis (10).\nInfluenza A (H3N2)v viruses detected to date are susceptible to\noseltamivir and zanamivir for the treatment of influenza. Clinicians\nwho suspect variant influenza infection in a patient should consider\ntreatment with these medications if clinically indicated (10). Because\nthese viruses have the M gene from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus,\nthey are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine.\n\nCDC is working with USDA and state public health and animal health\nexperts in the locations where these cases have occurred to\ninvestigate each case fully and to enhance influenza surveillance to\ndetect human cases of variant influenza virus infections. The CDC\nrRT-PCR assay that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in\nSeptember 2011 is able to identify these cases as presumptive\ninfluenza A (H3N2)v cases. These diagnostic test kits have been\ndistributed to public health laboratories in the United States and\nNational Influenza Centers designated by the World Health Organization\nin other countries. Additional rRT-PCR test enhancements to further\nimprove detection of influenza A (H3N2)v viruses are under\ndevelopment.\n\nLimited serologic studies conducted to date indicate that young\nchildren have little preexisting immunity to influenza A (H3N2)v\nviruses. Because the hemagglutinin genes of these viruses are related\nto human influenza A (H3N2) viruses that circulated in the 1990s,\nolder children and adults might have limited immunity against these\nviruses. Certain persons, including young children, pregnant women,\npersons with chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or\nheart and lung disease, and persons aged \u226565 years, are likely to be\nat greater risk for serious influenza-related complications from\nvariant influenza viruses such as influenza A (H3N2)v. The influenza A\n(H3N2)v virus is different enough from current human seasonal\ninfluenza viruses that the seasonal influenza vaccine is not expected\nto provide significant protection.\n\n[The references cited in this report can be accessed at the source\nURL. - Mod.CP]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[[Future ProMED-mail reports will wherever possible conform to the new\nnomenclature described below for the swine-origin influenza A (H3N2)\nand pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 viruses. - Mod.CP]\n\n'After discussions among the World Health Organization (WHO), the\nWorld Organization for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization, CDC, and other U.S. federal agencies, swine-origin\ninfluenza viruses identified in humans will now be referred to as\n'variant' viruses and denoted with a 'v.'

Hence, all such\nstatements on the epidemiology of swine influenzas must be treated\nwith caution.\n- Most of the US cases experienced only mild disease. Those\nhospitalised had underlying conditions, and all patients recovered\ncompletely.\n- These viruses are susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors\n(oseltamivir and zanamivir) though the current A(H3N2) component of\nseasonal influenza vaccines is unlikely to provide protection. Older\npeople are likely to have some protection from exposure to earlier\nvaccines.\n- It is considered by the United States Centers for Disease Control\n(CDC) that there had already been some very limited human-to-human\ntransmission of these and similar viruses in the US.\n- Unlike in March 2009 (the start of the pandemic), there are no\nreports of numbers of unexplained influenza infections elsewhere in\nthe Americas. Hence, it is unlikely that these US cases represent\noutliers for a larger phenomenon.\n- Overall, therefore, the immediate direct threat to human health in\nEurope is low.\n- ECDC staff are following the situation closely and are in direct\ncontact with the WHO, the US CDC and relevant experts in EU Member\nStates.\n- There is a need to ensure that these infections could be detected\nthrough diagnostic testing in European national influenza\nlaboratories.\n- There are strong public health arguments for more active\nvirological surveillance of pig herds in Europe (and North America)\nincluding active surveillance of infections in humans that are in\ndirect or indirect contact with pigs.\n- Equally justified are more formal approaches to assessing emerging\ninfluenza viruses for their pandemic potential, and such virological\nrisk assessments should continue to be developed.\n- Unusual influenza viruses should continue to be referred to\nNational Influenza Centres and on to the WHO Collaborating Centre in\nEurope, along with relevant clinical and epidemiological data.\n\nPublic Health Issue:\n[There is] implication for Europe of recent human infection and\nlimited probable human-to-human transmission in the United States with\ntriple reassortant swine-origin influenza S-OtrA(H3N2) viruses with a\nunique gene segment combination including the M gene from the 2009\nA(H1N1) pandemic viruses.\n\nHowever, since these are now seasonal viruses and no other human\nadapted A(H1N1) viruses have been found in the last Northern and\nSouthern seasons in this risk assessment, they will generally be\nreferred to as A(H1N1) in text for brevity. Swine influenza viruses\nare generally designated as S-O to indicate swine origin.\n\nDisease background information:\nAnimal infection and disease: Swine influenza is an acute viral\ninfection of the respiratory tract in pigs. The mortality in pigs is\nlow, and recovery usually occurs within 7-10 days. An infected pig may\nhave rapid onset of fever, loss of appetite, laboured abdominal\nbreathing and coughing, but subclinical infections are common. The\ninfections are considered endemic in pigs in Europe and elsewhere in\nthe world. Serological surveys indicate that a significant proportion\nof all pigs are infected during their lifetimes. Unlike human\ninfluenza in temperate countries, there is no seasonal pattern for\ninfluenza among pigs. However, surveillance of influenza in pigs\nremains incomplete and patchy even in Europe and the USA, mostly\nbecause swine influenza has little significance for food production\nand food safety. There is little relevant legislation, and swine\nproducers are reluctant to allow voluntary testing.\n\nSwine influenza is not a notifiable animal disease in the EU, and\nthere is no extensive surveillance. The most relevant EU data come\nfrom research work in a limited number of countries supported by the\nEuropean Commission. Given the limitations of surveillance in Europe,\nstatements on the epidemiology and virology of swine influenza in\nEurope can only be preliminary. The swine influenza subtypes currently\ncirculating in pigs in Europe are known to include A(H1N1)i, A(H3N2)ii\nand A(H1N2). Recently, a reassortant pandemic A(H1N1) influenza\ninfluenza virus has been identified circulating among pigs in Germany.\nThese are swine influenzas not human influenzas.\n\nThe epidemiology and virology of swine influenza viruses in Europe and\nthe United States seem to be quite different. The triple reassortant\nviruses, S-OtrA(H3N2) seen in pigs and humans in the USA have not been\nfound in Europe to date. The main swine influenza viruses circulating\nin US pig herds in recent years have been swine triple reassortant\nA(H1N1) viruses, A(H3N2) and A(H1N2) viruses. An important point is\nthat there is little if any movement of live pigs between continents.\nIndeed, it is not legal for live pigs to be imported from the USA to\nEurope. Hence, there is little risk of spread of the American viruses\nto pigs in Europe. This is in contrast to the situation, for example,\nof the transmission of avian influenza through movement of wild birds\nand trade in domestic poultry. It is considered that there is no risk\nto humans of acquiring infections with swine influenza from\nconsumption of food.\n\nInfection with swine influenza virus has occasionally been detected in\nhumans since the 1950s. Because of weaknesses in surveillance,\nstatements on how common these infections are in humans must be made\nwith caution. Human disease is usually clinically similar to disease\ncaused by infections with human influenza viruses. Complications have\nonly rarely been reported in the literature, although they have\noccurred even in otherwise healthy adults. An exception is a well\nknown 1976 outbreak of swine influenza among young, essentially\nhealthy adult military recruits at a basic-training centre in New\nJersey (Fort Dix). This was caused by a swine-origin A(H1N1) virus and\nresulted in at least 230 infections, 13 of whom experienced severe\ndisease, and one death of a previously healthy man. After intense\nlocal transmission over a one-month period, that virus was then never\nobserved again. Hence, the pandemic 2009 A(H1N1) virus is so far the\nonly swine-origin virus that has shown the capacity to spread rapidly\nbetween humans.\n\nSerological surveys undertaken in North America among persons working\nwith pigs have shown that they quite often have evidence of prior\ninfection with swine influenza viruses. Interpretation of\nsero-prevalence data can be difficult due to cross-reactivity (i.e.\ninfection with a seasonal influenza virus might be misinterpreted as\nindicating prior swine influenza infection). There are few\ncontemporary serological data from humans for Europe [17].\n\nOverall Conclusion:\nThe viruses in question have not been seen in pigs in Europe (EU/EEA),\nbut there has been swine-to-human transmission in Europe with European\nviruses. However, there are no reports of anything but mild,\nself-limiting illness and no ongoing transmission. The clinical\npicture is in stark contrast to avian influenza A(H5N1) infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[By necessity, the text of this document has been severely truncated.\nInterested readers are recommended to consult the original text via\nthe source URL to view the complete text, references and citations. -\nMod.CP]", "summary": "Following recent infections in children in North America with a\nswine-origin triple reassortant influenza A(H3N2) virus that includes\na genetic component from the pandemic [H1N1] 2009 virus, and with\nprobable human-to-human transmission of these viruses, ECDC has come\nto the following preliminary opinion:\n\n- These viruses are known to be found in pigs in North America, but\nthey have not been found in pigs in Europe (EU/EEA countries).

Since\nearly September, the CDC has reported 10 infections with a\nswine-origin H3N2 reassortant strain that includes the M gene from the\n2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus. On 22 Nov 2011 the CDC reported\nthat it had prepared a vaccine virus and was providing it to vaccine\nmanufacturers as a precaution in case the novel virus spreads.\n\nA flu update from the World Health Organization (WHO) today [2 Dec\n2011] revealed that the vaccine virus is based on an isolate that was\ncollected in Minnesota in 2010. A CDC official told CIDRAP News that\nthe isolate is from a pair of swine-origin H3N2 infections that\noccurred in Minnesota in November 2010. Those cases were among 5\nswine-origin H3N2 cases reported in 3 states during the 2010-11 flu\nseason. The 2010 strain is not an exact match for the recent novel\nH3N2 isolates, but it is close enough to be the basis for a vaccine,\nsaid Michael Shaw PhD, associate director for laboratory science in\nthe CDC's Influenza Division. 'Since we were seeing these cases\npopping up sporadically, over the summer the decision was made to go\nahead and try to make a high-yield reassortant [for a vaccine], and it\nturned out to be a good decision, to have it in reserve,' Shaw said.\nHe said it takes several weeks to prepare a flu vaccine virus. In the\ncase of the 2009 pandemic, the task took about 6 weeks, from April 15\nto the end of May, which was considered fast, he noted. The reason the\nMinnesota isolate was chosen was that it was the only one available at\nthe time that grew in eggs, Shaw explained. 'Vaccine strains need to\nbe egg-derived, because inactivated vaccines are grown in eggs,' he\nsaid. 'This one from November 2010 is not like the new reassortant in\nthat it doesn't have that M gene from the H1N1 strain. But the HA\n[hemagglutinin] is close enough to be a good vaccine match.'\n\nHemagglutinin is the viral surface protein that is recognized and\ntargeted by the human immune system. The protein often mutates, making\nit necessary to formulate new vaccines. Shaw said the hemagglutinin of\nthe 2010 isolate is very closely related to the version found on the\nrecent swine-origin viruses. 'We've characterized it genetically and\nantigenically, so it would be an acceptable vaccine strain, which is\nwhy we decided to distribute it to the manufacturers, so they can get\nsome experience with it and grow it, in case they have to scale up.'\n\nTo make a vaccine virus, the CDC first takes clinical isolates and\nputs them in eggs to see if they will grow, Shaw explained. Once an\nisolate that grows in eggs is identified, it is recombined with a\nlaboratory strain that grows well in eggs. That task is handled by a\nseparate lab at New York Medical College. The desired product is a\n'high-yield reassortant': a virus with internal genes from the lab\nstrain and surface genes from the clinical isolate. After a high-yield\nreassortant is obtained, it must be characterized to make sure it\nhasn't changed too much in the course of the lab manipulations, Shaw\nsaid. 'There's a great deal of consultation with the FDA [Food and\nDrug Administration] and the WHO to reach the conclusion that it is\nthe best one for its purposes,' he added. 'So about 6 weeks for the\npandemic one, that's a very good timeline.'\n\nSince the creation of the vaccine virus from the 2010 isolate, the CDC\nhas succeeded in growing one of the more recent novel H3N2 viruses,\nfrom an Indiana case, in eggs, but 'we don't have a high-yield\nreassortant available for it,' Shaw said. 'For now the Minnesota one\nis the only one that's egg-derived and for which we have a high-yield\nreassortant.'\n\nShaw said no more infections with the novel H3N2 strain have been\nreported since the 3 that were cited in Iowa children on Nov 22. Those\ncases were believed to involve person-to-person transmission, since\nthe children attended the same daycare center and none of them had any\nexposure to pigs. 9 of the 10 recent cases have been in children; all\nthe patients recovered. Besides the Iowa illnesses, the cases include\n2 in Indiana, 3 in Pennsylvania, and 2 in Maine.\n\n(By Robert Roos)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[It is considered by the United States Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC)that there has already been some very limited\nhuman-to-human transmission of the swine origin H3N2 reassortant and\nsimilar viruses in the USA.

None of the children were hospitalized, and\neach has recovered from a mild episode of febrile respiratory illness.\nAll 2 were in contact with one another, and none had a known recent\nexposure to swine. No additional human infections with this virus have\nbeen detected in Iowa, and no evidence of sustained human-to-human\ntransmission of this S-OtrH3N2 virus exists; surveillance is ongoing.\n\nIn total, 18 human infections with swine-origin influenza A (H3N2)\nviruses have been identified since 2009 (1,2). The most recent 10\ncases, including the 3 Iowa cases described in this report, were\ninfections with S-OtrH3N2 viruses containing the matrix (M) gene from\nthe pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus (pH1N1). These viruses are\nconsidered reassortant viruses between a swine-origin influenza A\n(H3N2) virus circulating in North American swine and a pH1N1 virus.\nAll cases of human infection with S-OtrH3N2 virus containing the M\ngene from the pH1N1 virus have occurred in 2011 and have been reported\nfrom 4 states: Pennsylvania (3 cases), Maine (2), Indiana (2), and\nIowa (3) (3).\n\nCase reports\n------------\nPatient A: in the 2nd week of November 2011, patient A, a previously\nhealthy female child, experienced acute onset of influenza-like\nillness (ILI). 3 days after her illness onset (illness day 4), she was\nseen by a health-care provider, who obtained a respiratory specimen\nand performed a rapid influenza diagnostic test, which was positive.\nAs part of routine influenza surveillance, the respiratory specimen\nwas forwarded to the University of Iowa State Hygienic Laboratory\n(SHL) for further evaluation. Patient A's brother experienced onset of\nILI one day before patient A's date of illness onset. Patient A's\nbrother was not tested for influenza but was treated with oseltamivir\nby a health-care provider and has recovered. During her illness days 2\nand 3, patient A was in contact with her father, who subsequently\ndeveloped ILI 2 days after his most recent contact with patient A. He\nwas not tested for influenza. No other household member has reported\nrespiratory illness. No family member reported exposure to swine\nbefore their illness onset. On her illness day one, patient A attended\na small gathering of children.\n\nPatients B and C: patient B is a previously healthy male child who\ndeveloped ILI 2 days after patient A's 1st day of illness. He is the\nsibling of patient C, a previously healthy male child who developed\nILI one day after patient B's illness onset. Both children were seen\nby a health-care provider 2 days after patient B's illness onset;\nrapid influenza diagnostic testing was positive for both patients. As\npart of routine influenza surveillance, respiratory specimens were\nforwarded to SHL for further evaluation. The mother of patients B and\nC reported that no other household member had a respiratory illness\nand none had been exposed to swine before patient B became ill. On\npatient A's illness day one, patients B and C attended the same small\ngathering of children as patient A.\n\nEpidemiologic and laboratory investigations\n-------------------------------------------\nAn investigation by the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH)\ndetermined that the families of patients A, B, and C reported no\nrecent travel or attendance at community events. To date, the only\nepidemiologic link among patients A, B, and C that has been identified\nis attendance at a gathering of children on patient A's illness day\none. No illnesses were reported among adults or among the 5 other\nchildren who were present at this gathering on that day. No swine\nexposures have been identified among adults or children attending this\ngathering. IDPH has detected no increase in absenteeism or reports of\nrespiratory illness in the community where patients A, B, and C reside\nor in the schools in the community. Enhanced surveillance for ILI has\nbeen implemented in health-care facilities in the communities where\npatients A, B, and C reside. IDPH has instructed health-care providers\nto obtain respiratory specimens from patients with ILI for influenza\ndiagnostic testing at SHL. Thus far, no additional cases of S-OtrH3N2\ninfection have been identified, and surveillance data from the state\nhave shown low levels of influenza activity currently and at the time\nof all these patients' illnesses.\n\nEight days after patient A's illness onset, real-time reverse\ntranscription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing of\nrespiratory specimens from patients A, B, and C at SHL indicated\npossible S-OtrH3N2 influenza virus. At CDC, preliminary rRT-PCR\ndiagnostic results were inconclusive but indicated probable infection\nwith a swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus. Subsequent complete\ngenome sequencing at CDC confirmed all 3 specimens as S-OtrH3N2 with\nthe M gene from the pH1N1 virus. The viruses from these 3 patients are\nresistant to amantadine and rimantadine but are expected to be\nsusceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor drugs oseltamivir and\nzanamivir based on their genetic sequence. Because these viruses carry\na unique combination of genes, little information currently is\navailable regarding the capacity of this virus to transmit efficiently\nin swine, humans, or between swine and humans.\n\nMMWR editorial note\n-------------------\nSince July 2011, a total of 10 cases of human infection with S-OtrH3N2\nviruses have been identified in the United States, all containing the\nM gene from the pH1N1 virus. Seven of these 10 cases resulted in mild\nillness, but 3 of the infected persons were hospitalized for\ninfluenza; all patients have recovered. In all 7 earlier cases,\nexposure to swine was identified in the patient or in a close contact\nof the patient (4). The lack of known exposure to swine in the 3 cases\ndescribed in this report, combined with the known epidemiologic links,\nsuggests that limited human-to-human transmission of this novel\ninfluenza virus might have occurred. Transmission of swine-origin\ninfluenza A (H3N2) viruses not containing the M gene from the pH1N1\nvirus to humans from close contact with an infected person has been\nreported previously and has not resulted in sustained human-to-human\ntransmission (5). Preliminary evidence from the investigation of these\ncases in Iowa shows no evidence of ongoing transmission among humans.\nSwine influenza viruses are spread from pig to pig but are not known\nto spread through human contact with pork or pork products.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of human infections with animal influenza\nviruses do not result in human-to-human transmission (6), each case\nshould be investigated fully to ascertain if these viruses are\ntransmitted among humans and to limit further exposure of humans to\ninfected animals, if infected animals are suspected. Such\ninvestigations require close collaboration among state, local, and\nfederal public and animal health officials. As part of routine\npreparedness measures to counter possible pandemic threats posed by\nnovel influenza viruses in the event that they gain the ability to\nspread easily from person-to-person, CDC has developed a candidate\nvaccine virus that could be used to produce a human influenza vaccine\nagainst these S-OtrH3N2 viruses and has provided this candidate virus\nto manufacturers.\n\nAlthough swine exposure was not associated with the 3 cases described\nin this report, because most previous cases of human infection with\nS-OtrH3N2 viruses have occurred in patients who reported swine\nexposure before illness onset, clinicians should consider swine-origin\ninfluenza A virus infection in the differential diagnosis of patients\nwith febrile respiratory illness who have had contact with swine. It\nis anticipated that commercially available diagnostic tests, including\npoint-of-care rapid tests, will detect infection with the S-OtrH3N2\nvirus; however, these tests will not differentiate S-OtrH3N2 from\nseasonal influenza A viruses. Clinicians who suspect swine influenza\nvirus infections in humans should treat with oseltamivir when\nindicated (7), obtain a nasopharyngeal swab from the patient, place\nthe swab in viral transport medium, and contact their state or local\nhealth department to facilitate transport and timely diagnosis at a\nstate public health laboratory, using the CDC RT-PCR assay cleared by\nthe Food and Drug Administration. CDC requests that state public\nhealth laboratories send all suspected novel influenza A specimens,\nsuch as these S-OtrH3N2 viruses, to the CDC Influenza Division's Virus\nSurveillance and Diagnostics Branch Laboratory.\n\nThe 2011-12 seasonal influenza vaccine is expected to provide limited\nprotection from this virus for adults but none for young children.\nEnhanced surveillance, including surveillance for ILI and diagnostic\ntesting of respiratory specimens, is being conducted in Iowa and\nsurrounding states as part of the ongoing investigation of these\ncases.

All cases of human infection with S-OtrH3N2 virus containing the M\ngene from the pH1N1 virus have occurred in 2011 and have been reported\nfrom 4 states: No additional human infections with this virus have\nbeen detected in Iowa, and no evidence of sustained human-to-human\ntransmission of this S-OtrH3N2 virus exists; surveillance is ongoing. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In summary, this report describes the investigation of the 3\nconfirmed cases of human infection with S-OtrH3N2 virus in Iowa\nassociated with limited person-to-person transmission. Since July 2011, a total of 10 cases of human infection with S-OtrH3N2\nviruses have been identified in the United States, all containing the\nM gene from the pH1N1 virus. During her illness days 2\nand 3, patient A was in contact with her father, who subsequently\ndeveloped ILI 2 days after his most recent contact with patient A. Seven of these 10 cases resulted in mild\nillness, but 3 of the infected persons were hospitalized for\ninfluenza; all patients have recovered. \n\n\nLimited human-to-human transmission of novel influenza A (H3N2) virus\n- Iowa\n At CDC, preliminary rRT-PCR\ndiagnostic results were inconclusive but indicated probable infection\nwith a swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus. In all 7 earlier cases,\nexposure to swine was identified in the patient or in a close contact\nof the patient (4). The mother of patients B and\nC reported that no other household member had a respiratory illness\nand none had been exposed to swine before patient B became ill. IDPH has instructed health-care providers\nto obtain respiratory specimens from patients with ILI for influenza\ndiagnostic testing at SHL. He is the\nsibling of patient C, a previously healthy male child who developed\nILI one day after patient B's illness onset. Patient A's\nbrother was not tested for influenza but was treated with oseltamivir\nby a health-care provider and has recovered. The\nviruses identified are similar to 7 previous cases reported in 2011,\n As part of routine influenza surveillance, the respiratory specimen\nwas forwarded to the University of Iowa State Hygienic Laboratory\n(SHL) for further evaluation.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2007-03-25 00:00:00", "2070-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00", "1084-08-25 00:00:00", "2011-12-25 00:00:00", "2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-07-25 00:00:00", "2009-03-25 00:00:00", "1213-05-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Swine", "country": "Antarctica"}, {"location": "Maine", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Iowa", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "IOWA", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Indiana", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1025762", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Influenza (05): Europe, H3N2 predominant", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1025762", "date": "2012-01-29 18:32:14", "main_text": "INFLUENZA (05): EUROPE, H3N2 PREDOMINANT\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 27 Jan 2012\nSource: EuroFlu - Weekly Electronic Bulletin [abreviated & edited]\nhttp://www.euroflu.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi\n\nInfluenza activity continues to rise slowly in the WHO European Region due to A(H3N2)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary\n\nInfluenza activity continues to rise slowly in the WHO European Region due to A(H3N2)\n\u2022 This issue is based on data for week 3/2012 reported by 46 Member States in the WHO European Region. Consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) continue to be relatively low in most countries of the Region, but with many countries reporting increasing activity.\n\u2022 29 % of sentinel specimens tested positive for influenza, which is an increase over last week: 95% of these were influenza A.\n\u2022 Of the 352 influenza A viruses from sentinel sources that were subtyped, 99 % were A(H3N2).\n\nCurrent situation: week 3/2012\n\nTrends in clinical activity were reported by 42 countries: 20 stable, 19 increasing and 3 decreasing. At the same time, ILI and ARI consultation rates remained at low levels in most countries of the WHO European Region. Similar to the previous week, consultation rates were highest in young children. Of the 41 countries reporting on the geographical spread of influenza: 12 reported no activity; 7 local activity; 18 sporadic activity; and 4 countries (Finland, Iceland, Italy and Spain) regional activity. Intensity was reported to be low in most countries reporting on this indicator, except for Bulgaria, Iceland, Italy and Spain, where influenza activity was at medium levels.\n\nSevere acute respiratory infection (SARI): week 3/2012\n\n11 countries reported data from sentinel hospital-based surveillance for SARI: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia and Ukraine. The number of SARI hospitalizations remained largely unchanged compared to the previous week, except in Kazakhstan, which reported increases in SARI hospitalization \u2013 mainly in children aged 0\u20134 years. A total of 122 respiratory specimens was collected from SARI patients, of which 10 (8%) tested positive for influenza with 6 being subtyped, all as A(H3N2). 6 countries so far (Albania, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Romania and Ukraine) have reported influenza detections in SARI patients during the course of this influenza season.\n\nVirological situation: week 3/2012\n\nSentinel outpatient clinics collected 1469 respiratory specimens, 422 (29 %) of which tested positive for influenza viruses: 401 (95%) were type A and 21 (5%) were type B. Of the 352 influenza A viruses subtyped, 349 (99%) were influenza A(H3N2) and 3 (1%) were A(H1N1)pdm09. In the 18 countries testing 20 or more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 0% to 85%, with a median of 22% (mean: 25%). In addition, 525 non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for influenza: 504 (96%) type A and 21 (4%) type B. Of the influenza A viruses, 189 were subtyped: 173 (92%) as A(H3N2) and 16 (8%) as A(H1N1)pdm09.\n\nCumulative virological data: weeks 40/2011 \u2013 3/2012\n\nDuring this period, 3436 influenza virus detections were reported: 3226 (94%) were influenza A and 210 (6%) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 2099 were subtyped: 1985 (95%) as A(H3N2) and 114 (5%) as A(H1N1)pdm09.\n\nIn addition, 56 influenza viruses were characterized antigenically: 46 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 2 were A(H1N1)pdm09 A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like; 2 were B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); 2 were B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 4 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage). Of 95 influenza viruses characterized genetically, 1 belonged to the A(H1N1)pdm09 group represented by A/Astrakhan/1/2011; 1 belonged to the A(H1N1)pdm09 group represented by A/St Petersburg/100/2011; 5 belonged to the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); 2 belonged to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage); and 86 belonged to the A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade \u2013 63 in the group represented by A/Stockholm/18/2011 (group 3), 19 in the group represented by A/Iowa/19/2010 (group 6) and 1 in the group represented by A/Johannesburg/114/2011(group 7).\n\nComment\n\nInfluenza activity has increased consistently over the past several weeks, but influenza detections remain low compared to the same period of the 2010/2011 season.

But the swine flu H3N2\nvirus is unlikely to cause a 'major' human health risk, the Centre\nfor Food Safety said. 15 pigs were found infected with 'essentially a\nswine influenza H3N2 virus that has picked up some genes of human\nswine influenza virus,' the center said. They were detected out of\n1000 samples taken from August to mid-October [2011].\n\nThe same flu subtype [had been] isolated also in the last round of the\nsurveillance programs, from May to July 2011, in 16 pigs. In both\ninstances, the department said it had notified mainland authorities.\nThere have been no recent reports of such H3N2-infected swine in\nGuangdong province, however.\n\nFlu expert Malik Peiris said the H3N2 subtype seen in the pigs is not\nthe same swine-originated new H3N2 that has infected 7 people in the\nUnited States since July [2011]. The US Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention said earlier that while [these] infections have been\nmainly mild, they are being closely monitored [see: ProMED-mail\narchived reports below]. Dr Nancy Cox, head of the Atlanta- based\nagency's influenza division, said a seed strain for a vaccine that\nwould protect against the virus has already been developed and given\nto manufacturers. [This statement likely refers to the\nUSA-swine-origin H3N2 reassortant (see ProMED-mail Influenza (66): USA\nswine-origin H3N2 reassortant, update 20111105.3298) and not the Hong\nKong swine-origin H3N2 reassortant. - Mod.CP]. The World Health\nOrganization also said that for pandemic preparedness purposes, it has\ndeveloped and made available 2 candidate vaccine viruses.\n\nAll pigs coming from the mainland are slaughtered centrally in the\nSheung Shui slaughterhouse before they are taken to Hong Kong markets.\nA spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department said the\ninfected pigs were destroyed. However, abattoir workers have not been\nchecked for the presence of the virus, the spokesman revealed. 'There\nis no routine check of influenza antibody level in slaughterhouse\nstaff,' he said, in response to questions from The Standard. But staff\nare advised to wear face masks and gloves while on duty, and to\nobserve personal hygiene.\n\nPeiris said human flu viruses cross to pigs occasionally, and vice\nversa. 'This one [H3N2] is a pandemic reassorted virus,' he said,\nadding it was derived from the 2004-5 human flu, so most of the\npopulation would have [acquired] immunity from [exposure to] it,\nexcept very young children.

The CDC reported the swine H3N2 virus\nprobably picked up the M gene from the pandemic H1N1 virus when a pig\nwas co-infected with swine H3N2 and the H1N1 strain. It's not clear\nwhether the acquisition of this human-origin gene facilitated\ntransmission of the reassortant to humans, but It did not enhance its\nvirulence or facilitate its transmissibility among humans.\n\nLikewise there is no evidence (yet) that the Hong Kong swine H3N2\nreassortant virus described above has any increased virulence for\nhumans or enhanced ability to infect human hosts. It is likely that\nsub-unit reassortment of influenza A virus genome sub-unit is a\nfrequent occurrence, and inapparent without some specific selection\npressure to reveal its occurrence. - Mod.CP]\n\n[The most common subtypes currently found in pigs are H1N1, H1N2 and\nH3N2; however, the situation is complex, as 2 or more viruses of each\nsubtype are circulating in swine populations.

The new cases, in Maine and Indiana,\nbring to 7 the number seen in the U.S. since July [2011]. To date\nCanada has seen no infections with this virus, the National\nMicrobiology Laboratory said.\n\nWhile the infections have been mainly mild, the CDC is keeping a close\neye on the situation. The head of the Atlanta-based agency's influenza\ndivision said a seed strain for a vaccine that would protect against\nthis virus has already been developed and has been given to vaccine\nmanufacturers. 'We're really trying to be in front of events in terms\nof preparedness,' Dr. Nancy Cox said in an interview. 'We're being\nvery vigilant because we realize that there's a portion of the\npopulation ... that really has very little cross-reactive antibodies\nto the swine reassortant virus.'\n\nThe group Cox was referring to is children. Most of the infections --\n2 from Maine, 3 from Pennsylvania and 2 from Indiana - have been in\nyoung children, though Cox noted one of the cases was a 59-year-old\nperson. Most of the people who have been infected had close contact\nwith pigs and the 2 latest cases are no exception.\n\nDr. Stephen Sears, state epidemiologist for Maine, said the 2 children\nfrom his state who were infected both had a lot of contact with pigs.\nWhile they live in the same region of Maine, the children did not have\ncontact with each other. Sears said there is no thought at this point\nthat the virus is spreading from person to person and there were no\nreports of influenza among members of either child's family.\n\nThe virus is a strain of influenza A known as H3N2 that has picked up\none of the genes -- the M gene -- of the H1N1 flu strain that caused\nthe 2009 pandemic. The CDC says the swine H3N2 virus probably picked\nup the M gene from the pandemic H1N1 virus when a pig was co-infected\nwith swine H3N2 and the H1N1 strain. It's not clear whether having\nthat gene is helping this virus transmit to humans. But a study done\nin guinea pigs -- one of the animal models for influenza -- showed\nthat the M gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus is critical to the pandemic\nvirus's ability to transmit well [in guinea pigs].\n\nDr. Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, who was involved in that study, said that\nfinding is suggestive, but guinea pigs aren't people. 'Whether these\ncases now reflect that this particular H3N2 with the M gene of the new\nH1N1 transmits better into humans, I think it's too early to say,'\nsaid Garcia-Sastre, a researcher at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital.\n\nThe swine-origin H3N2 is related -- though not closely - to H3N2\nviruses that circulate each winter among people. The CDC said the H3N2\ncomponent in the annual flu shot would not be expected to protect\nagainst the swine-origin variety. Cox said the virus seems most\nclosely related to human H3N2s that circulated in the early 1990s.\nThat suggests a lot of people would probably have antibodies against\nthis virus, which in turn might make it hard for the virus to be able\nto spread person to person. But people born after the early 1990s\nprobably would not be protected against the virus. Cox said it's not\npossible to be sure, but based on lab work, her team believes fewer\npeople would be susceptible to this virus than were vulnerable to the\n2009 pandemic virus when it emerged.\n\nPigs are highly susceptible to influenza, and a number of flu strains\ncirculate among swine herds. Occasionally, these viruses trigger human\ninfections, generally among people who work with pigs. There have been\n28 such cases reported since 2005, the CDC said.\n\nIn the last few years, the rate of such detections appears to have\nincreased. But no one is sure whether that means there have been more\ncases, or whether there have always been these numbers of cases but\nimprovements to surveillance means they are now being seen.\n\nThe United States and other countries have built up flu surveillance\nefforts in the past 7 or 8 years, 1st due to concern over H5N1 avian\nflu and later as a result of the 2009 pandemic. After a spate of human\ncases of swine H3N2 infection last year [2010], the CDC asked the\nlaboratory that makes candidate viruses for vaccines to make one for a\nswine H3N2 vaccine. That lab is at New York Medical College in\nValhalla. That virus had the same hemagglutinin and neuraminidase\ngenes -- the H and N in a virus's name -- as the new virus does. And\nflu vaccines target [the proteins encoded] in these 2 genes.\n\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are now 7 cases (6 children and an adult) of infection with an\ninfluenza virus that has been sporadically jumping to people from pigs\nin the United States; 2 in Maine, 3 in Pennsylvania and 2 in Indiana.\nAlthough these cases appear to be independent events, most of those\ninfected had close contact with pigs.\n\nAt present there is no evidence that the virus is spreading from\nperson to person and there has been no report of influenza among\nfamily members.\n\nIt seems likely that the swine H3N2 virus probably picked up its M\ngene (by sub-unit reassortment) from the pandemic H1N1 virus when a\npig was co-infected with swine H3N2 and the H1N1 strain.

Cox said it's not\npossible to be sure, but based on lab work, her team believes fewer\npeople would be susceptible to this virus than were vulnerable to the\n2009 pandemic virus when it emerged. Model\nexperiments with guinea pigs suggest that the presence of the M gene\nfrom the 2009 H1N pandemic virus favours transmissibility of the the\nH3N2 reassortant virus. Two new cases of human infection with a flu virus that has been\nsporadically jumping to people from pigs have been spotted in the\nUnited States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nreported Friday [4 Nov 2011]. \n\nThe infections have been mainly mild, but as a precaution the\ninfluenza division of the CDC has already developed a seed strain for\na vaccine that would protect against this virus and supplied it to\nvaccine producers. The head of the Atlanta-based agency's influenza\ndivision said a seed strain for a vaccine that would protect against\nthis virus has already been developed and has been given to vaccine\nmanufacturers. ' After a spate of human\ncases of swine H3N2 infection last year [2010], the CDC asked the\nlaboratory that makes candidate viruses for vaccines to make one for a\nswine H3N2 vaccine.

We're being\nvery vigilant because we realize that there's a portion of the\npopulation ... that really has very little cross-reactive antibodies\nto the swine reassortant virus.' Whether these\ncases now reflect that this particular H3N2 with the M gene of the new\nH1N1 transmits better into humans, I think it's too early to say,'\nsaid Garcia-Sastre, a researcher at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital. \n\nIt seems likely that the swine H3N2 virus probably picked up its M\ngene (by sub-unit reassortment) from the pandemic H1N1 virus when a\npig was co-infected with swine H3N2 and the H1N1 strain. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are now 7 cases (6 children and an adult) of infection with an\ninfluenza virus that has been sporadically jumping to people from pigs\nin the United States; 2 in Maine, 3 in Pennsylvania and 2 in Indiana.

The virus is a strain of influenza A known as H3N2 that has picked up\none of the genes -- the M gene -- of the H1N1 flu strain that caused\nthe 2009 pandemic. That suggests a lot of people would probably have antibodies against\nthis virus, which in turn might make it hard for the virus to be able\nto spread person to person. \n\nAt present there is no evidence that the virus is spreading from\nperson to person and there has been no report of influenza among\nfamily members.

The child had contact with\npigs, including time spent in a closed setting at an agricultural\nfair, public health officials said. The child became sick earlier this\nmonth [October 2011]. So far, officials said Friday [21 Oct 2011], the\ncase of the child in Cumberland County, Maine, 'is an isolated event.\nThey said Maine 'is not aware of any person-to-person transmission.'\n\nPublic health officials have long feared a new, dangerous strain of\ninfluenza would be bred in animals and passed to people, where it\nwould have the ability to spread throughout the human population in a\nmanner similar to the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic. That\nconcern explains the enormous publicity and reaction to the so-called\nswine flu scare of 2009, which petered out when the H1N1 strain proved\nless dangerous than feared.\n\nThe Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and federal health\nauthorities are investigating the latest case, which is unusual,\nalthough not unique. Since 2005, the federal Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention reports, there have been 26 cases of flu virus\npassing from pigs to people. None of those cases have resulted in\ndisease that passes from people to other people.\n\n'Swine-origin influenza is rare in humans, but veterinarians should\nremind owners and those who work closely with swine to watch for\nsymptoms of ILI (influenza-like illness) in themselves and their\nfamilies,' said the announcement from Maine, which was passed on to\nNew Hampshire veterinarians on Thursday [20 Oct 2011]. 'Any person\nwith ILI, defined as fever greater than 100 deg F [38 deg C] with\ncough or sore throat, should contact their primary care provider for\nfollow-up.'\n\nInfluenza can have a variety of signatures, differentiated by the\nletters H and N, which stand for different proteins on the surface of\nthe virus. There are 16 types of H (hemagglutinin) and 9 types of N\n(neuraminidase), meaning up to 1454 strains of flu can exist, which is\nwhy tracking and vaccinating for the disease is difficult.\n\nOfficials said the influenza in the Maine case is similar to rare\nhuman infections with swine-origin H3N2 viruses, but it also contains\na genetic component of the pandemic H1N1 virus.

After\n15 hours, he was discharged home and subsequently recovered\nuneventfully. 2 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected on the day of\nadmission and sent to the Ontario Agency for Health Protection (OAHPP)\nPublic Health Laboratories (PHL) for influenza testing by real-time\nreverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). Influenza A [virus] was detected\nin both specimens by rRT-PCR, and when subtyped were positive for\nhemagglutinin (H3) gene in a moderately high copy number (cycle\nthresholds 29 and 31). They were also noted to be positive for the\npandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1) neuraminidase (NA) gene at a very low\nlevel (CT values 38 and 39), which was detected using an in-house\nrRT-PCR (1). Suspecting contamination, primary samples were\nreextracted and retested; identical results were obtained.\n\nFurther sequencing confirmed presence of the following genes in the\nprimary samples:\nA. Pandemic H1N1 2009 genes: Matrix, NS, H1, N1\n(H1 sequencing was conducted on one primary sample only)\nB. Seasonal H3N2 genes: N2\n(H3 sequencing was not conducted on either primary sample)\n\nThe 1st specimen underwent conventional viral culture in rhesus\nmonkey kidney cells. Whole genome sequence analysis of cultured\nmaterial showed that the isolate possessed H3 and N2 of seasonal H3N2\nin combination with PB2, PB1, PA, NS, NP, and M of pandemic H1N1. Gene\nsequences obtained in culture and primary specimen were identical. A\nBLAST [basic local alignment search] was conducted against sequences\navailable in GenBank. The H3 and N2 gene sequences most closely\nmatched the currently circulating A/Perth/16/2009 strain.\n\nThe matrix and NS genes amplified from the primary sample were\nidentical to currently circulating pH1N1, most closely matching the\nA/California/07/2009 strain.\n\nCanada's National Microbiology Laboratory performed plaque forming\nassays on the primary sample and culture material using Madin-Darby\ncanine kidney cell lines. Sequencing of individual plaque material in\nboth primary sample reconfirmed a reassortant virus as described\nabove, with no evidence of the HA and NA genes of pH1N1. In addition,\ngene sequences obtained in both plaque assays matched each other, and\nwere also identical to those obtained at OAHPP. The isolate strain\ntype was A/Perth/16/09 (H3N2) by hemagglutination inhibition assay.\n\nSummary and implications\n------------------------\nThis case represents coinfection with H3N2 and pH1N1, followed by\nreassortment in the patient (in vivo reassortment). The low level of\npandemic H1N1 2009 NA gene in the primary sample indicates that the\nreassortment occurred in the child and the lab detected a remnant of\nNA left behind. If it were just coinfection but not reassortment, we\nwould have expected to find evidence of H3N2 viral genes other than H3\nand N2 in the primary sample. The subsequent reassortant virus\nconsisted of HA and NA of H3N2 together with the remaining 6 genes\n(PB2, PB1, PA, NS, NP and M) of pH1N1.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the 1st case of reassortment\ninvolving pH1N1 and seasonal H3N2. We could not document any\ntransmission of this reassortant, which arose during a coinfection\ninvolving both subtypes. In a recent study reverse genetics was used\nto generate a laboratory reassortant of this type -- infection of\nferrets with this reassortant resulted in higher levels of virus and\nmore severe respiratory damage when compared to wild-type pH1N1 (2).\nThis case and the 5 reports of human infection with swine triple\nreassortant H3N2 in the United States since September 2010 highlight\nthe need for ongoing molecular and phenotypic surveillance for novel\ninfluenza strains (3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

This appears to be especially problematic\nwhen this virus does not appear to produce clinical findings much\ndifferent from seasonal influenza.\n\nGiven swine H3N2 has been circulating for years now, it would probably\nbe helpful to understand in this instance how these cases came to the\nattention of the PA Dept. of Agriculture. Was there an influenza\nsurveillance system already in place where virus samples were being\ncollected passively and sequenced?

Genetic analysis can distinguish animal origin\ninfluenza viruses from the seasonal human influenza viruses that\ncirculate widely and cause annual epidemics. This report describes 2\ncases of febrile respiratory illness caused by swine-origin influenza\nA (H3N2) viruses identified on 19 Aug 2011 and 26 Aug 2011, and the\ncurrent investigations. No epidemiologic link between the 2 cases has\nbeen identified, and although investigations are ongoing, no\nadditional confirmed human infections with this virus have been\ndetected. These viruses are similar to 8 other swine-origin influenza\nA (H3N2) viruses identified from previous human infections over the\npast 2 years, but are unique in that one of the 8 gene segments\n(matrix [M] gene) is from the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus. The\nacquisition of the M gene in these 2 swine-origin influenza A (H3N2)\nviruses indicates that they are 'reassortants' because they contain\ngenes of the swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus circulating in\nNorth American pigs since 1998 (2) and the 2009 influenza A (H1N1)\nvirus that might have been transmitted to pigs from humans during the\n2009 H1N1 pandemic. However, reassortments of the 2009 influenza A\n(H1N1) virus with other swine influenza A viruses have been reported\npreviously in swine (3). Clinicians who suspect influenza virus\ninfection in humans with recent exposure to swine should obtain a\nnasopharyngeal swab from the patient for timely diagnosis at a state\npublic health laboratory and consider empiric neuraminidase inhibitor\nantiviral treatment to quickly limit potential human transmission\n(4).\n\nCase reports\n------------\nPatient A -- On 17 Aug 2011, the United States Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention [CDC] was notified by the Indiana State\nDepartment of Health Laboratories of a suspected case of swine-origin\ninfluenza A (H3N2) infection in a boy aged <5 years. The boy, who had\nreceived influenza vaccine in September 2010, experienced onset of\nfever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and sore throat on 23 Jul\n2011. He was brought to a local emergency department (ED) where a\nrespiratory specimen later tested positive for influenza A (H3). The\nboy was discharged home, but was not treated with influenza antiviral\nmedications. He has multiple chronic health conditions, returned to\nthe ED on 24 Jul 2011, and was hospitalized for treatment of those\nhealth problems, which had worsened. The boy was discharged home on 27\nJul 2011, and has since recovered from this illness. As part of\nroutine CDC-supported influenza surveillance, the respiratory specimen\ncollected on 24 Jul 2011, was forwarded to the Indiana State\nDepartment of Health Laboratories, where polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) testing identified a suspect swine-origin influenza A (H3N2)\nvirus on 17 Aug 2011. The specimen was forwarded to CDC where the\nfindings were confirmed through genome sequencing on 19 Aug 2011.\n\nNo direct exposure to swine was identified for this child; however, a\ncaretaker reported direct contact with asymptomatic swine in the weeks\nbefore the boy's illness onset and provided care to the child 2 days\nbefore illness onset. No respiratory illness was identified in any of\nthe child's family or close contacts, the boy's caretaker, or in the\nfamily or contacts of the caretaker.\n\nPatient B -- On 24 Aug 2011, CDC was notified by the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Health of a suspected case of swine-origin influenza A\n(H3N2) virus infection in a girl aged <5 years. The girl, who had\nreceived influenza vaccine in September 2010, experienced acute onset\nof fever, nonproductive cough, and lethargy on 20 Aug 2011. She was\nbrought to a local hospital ED where a nasopharyngeal swab tested\npositive for influenza A by rapid influenza diagnostic test. She was\nnot treated with influenza antiviral medications and was discharged\nhome the same day. The girl has completely recovered from this\nillness.\n\nA nasopharyngeal swab and nasal wash specimen were obtained at the ED\nand forwarded to the Pennsylvania State Department of Health Bureau of\nLaboratories for additional testing as part of routine CDC-supported\ninfluenza surveillance. On 29 Aug 2011, the state public health\nlaboratory identified a suspected swine-origin influenza A (H3N2)\nvirus by PCR testing, and both specimens were forwarded to CDC. On 26\nAug 2011, genome sequencing confirmed the virus as swine-origin\ninfluenza A (H3N2). On 16 Aug 2011, the girl was reported to have\nvisited an agricultural fair where she had direct exposure to swine\nand other animals. No additional illness in the girl's family or close\ncontacts has been identified, but illness in other fair attendees\ncontinues to be investigated. No additional confirmed swine-origin\ninfluenza virus infections have been identified thus far.\n\nEpidemiologic and laboratory investigations\n-------------------------------------------\nAs of 2 Sep 2011, no epidemiologic link between patients A and B had\nbeen identified, and no additional cases of confirmed infection with\nthe identified strain of swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus had\nbeen identified. Surveillance data from both states showed low levels\nof influenza activity at the time of both patients' illnesses. Case\nand contact investigations by the county and state human and animal\nhealth agencies in Indiana and Pennsylvania are ongoing, and enhanced\nsurveillance for additional human cases is being implemented in both\nstates.\n\nPreliminary genetic characterization of these 2 influenza viruses has\nidentified them as swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) viruses.

The one notable\ndifference from the viruses previously identified in human infections\nwith swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus is that these 2 viruses\nhave a matrix (M) gene acquired from the 2009 influenza A (H1N1)\nvirus, replacing the classical swine M gene present in the prior 8\nswine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus infections in humans.\n\nAlthough reassortment between swine influenza and 2009 influenza A\n(H1N1) viruses has been reported in pigs in the United States (3),\nthis particular genetic combination of swine influenza virus segments\nis unique and has not been reported previously in either swine or\nhumans, based on a review of influenza genomic sequences publicly\navailable in GenBank. Analysis of data submitted to GenBank via the US\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) Swine Influenza Virus Surveillance\nProgram subsequent to this case identified 2 additional influenza A\n(H3N2) isolates from swine containing the M gene from the 2009\ninfluenza A (H1N1) virus.

Because these viruses carry a unique\ncombination of genes, no information currently is available regarding\nthe capacity of this virus to transmit efficiently in swine, humans,\nor between swine and humans.\n\nMMWR editorial note\n-------------------\n>From 2005 to 2007, CDC received reports of about one human infection\nwith a swine-origin influenza virus each year. In 2007, human\ninfection with a novel influenza A virus, including swine-origin\ninfluenza virus infections, became a nationally notifiable condition.\nSince that time, CDC has received about 3 to 5 reports a year of human\ninfections with swine-origin influenza viruses. The recent increase in\nreporting might be, in part, a result of increased influenza testing\ncapabilities in public health laboratories that allows for\nidentification of human and swine-origin influenza viruses, but\ngenetic changes in swine influenza viruses and other factors also\nmight be contributing to this increase (5--7). During December\n2005--November 2010, before the 2 cases described in this report, 21\ncases of human infection with swine-origin influenza were reported (12\ncases with swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection, 8 cases\nwith swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus infection, and one case\nwith swine-origin influenza A (H1N2) virus infection). 6 of these 21\ncases occurred in patients who reported direct exposure to pigs; 12\npatients reported being near pigs; human-to-human transmission was\nsuspected in 2 cases after epidemiologic investigations revealed no\nreported contact with swine in either case, but contact with ill\npersons who reported swine exposure was the suspected source of\ninfection; the exposure in one case was unknown (8) (CDC, unpublished\ndata; 2011). Although the vast majority of human infections with\nanimal influenza viruses do not result in human-to-human transmission\n(9,10), each case should be investigated fully to ascertain whether\nthese viruses are transmitted among humans and to limit further\nexposure of humans to infected animals, if infected animals are\nidentified.\n\nThe lack of known direct exposure to pigs in one of the 2 cases\ndescribed in this report suggests the possibility that limited\nhuman-to-human transmission of this influenza virus occurred. Likely\ntransmission of swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus from close\ncontact with an infected person has been observed in past\ninvestigations of human infections with swine-origin influenza A\nvirus, but has not resulted in sustained human-to-human transmission.\nPreliminary evidence from the investigation of the Indiana case shows\nno ongoing transmission. No influenza illness has been identified, but\nif additional chains of transmission are identified rapid intervention\nis warranted try to prevent further spread of the virus. Clinicians\nshould consider swine-origin influenza A virus infection as well as\nseasonal influenza virus infections in the differential diagnosis of\npatients with febrile respiratory illness who have been near pigs.\nClinicians who suspect influenza virus infection in humans with recent\nexposure to swine, should obtain a nasopharyngeal swab from the\npatient, place the swab in a viral transport medium, contact their\nstate or local health department to facilitate transport and timely\ndiagnosis at a state public health laboratory, and consider empiric\nneuraminidase inhibitor antiviral treatment (4).\n\n[Interested readers should access the original document at the source\nURL to view the references cited in the above text]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report describes 2 cases of febrile respiratory illness caused\nby swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) viruses identified on 19 Aug 2011\nand 26 Aug 2011.

No other cases have been\nidentified, but an investigation is underway. The influenza strain\nthat infected the child was identified as an H3N2 virus that commonly\ncirculates in pigs in North America. It is different from the\npandemic H1N1 virus, also of swine origin, that was first detected in\nthe United States in mid-April [2009]. [It presumably differs also\nfrom the current human seasonal H3N2 virus. - Mod.CP]\n\n'It is critical for people to understand that this H3N2 virus is not\nrelated to the pandemic H1N1 virus,' said Jason Eberhart-Phillips,\nKansas State Health Officer and Director of Health at the Kansas\nDepartment of Health and Environment (KDHE). 'This is not a mutation\nor a recombination of the pandemic strain, and it does not appear at\nthis time to be a threat to human health.' The child was likely\nexposed to the virus during the Riley County Fair in late July\n[2009], where the child had direct contact with pigs. The child later\ndeveloped influenza-like symptoms and sought medical care. The child\nhas fully recovered and no other family members have reported illness.\n\nThe KDHE is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the\nRiley County Health Department and the Kansas Animal Health\nDepartment to investigate this case. The KDHE and the local health\ndepartment are working to determine if the Riley County Fair swine\nexhibitors, or their pigs, have been ill. Swine flu viruses do not\nnormally infect humans, but human infections occur from time to time.\nTypically the CDC has received reports of approximately one human\ninfection with a swine influenza virus each year. That number has\nrisen slightly in the past few years. The increased number of\nreported cases this year is likely the result of increased influenza\ntesting related to the H1N1 pandemic. So far this year, 14 cases of\nhuman infections with swine influenza viruses have been reported in\nthe United States. That number does not include the number of H1N1\ncases, as the H1N1 virus has not been detected in swine in the USA.\n\n'Most instances of human infection with animal influenza viruses,\nlike the swine H3N2 virus, do not result in human-to-human\ntransmission,' Dr. Eberhart-Phillips said. 'However, each case needs\nto be fully investigated to be sure that the viruses are not\nspreading among humans.' Most commonly, cases of human infection with\nswine influenza occur in people with direct exposure to pigs, he added.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Riley County in the NorthEast section\nof Kansas is available at:\n<http://geology.com/county-map/kansas.shtml>\n- CopyEd.EJP]\n................cp/ejp/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported Friday [15\nJan 2010] that a child from Iowa became infected with a new swine flu\nvirus in September [2009], though the case didn't come to light until\nNovember. The unnamed boy didn't need to be hospitalized, and he\nrecovered fully from the illness. Testing later showed he'd been\ninfected with a swine influenza virus of the H3N2 subtype,\n*** different both from the pandemic H1N1 virus and from the seasonal\nH3N2 viruses that have been circulating in people for decades.*** [see\nProMED archives listed below]. Human cases of infection with swine\ninfluenza viruses happen from time to time. Often, though not always,\nthese infections are seen in people who work on pig farms or in\nproximity to swine herds.\n\nLast summer officials in Saskatchewan spotted a different swine H1N1\nvirus in 2 hog farm workers. As in the case of the boy in Iowa, that\nvirus seemed to stop spreading. 'While these cases are rare, they're\nnot unheard of,' Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, said from\nAtlanta, Georgia. 'We do detect them from time to time and it's\nimportant for us to investigate, which happened in this case. And\nluckily there wasn't any evidence of sustained person-to-person\ntransmission.'\n\nIt isn't clear how the boy became infected with the virus. He had no\nknown contact with pigs, an eerie echo of the emergence last spring of\nthe pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. [Pandemic] H1N1 was 1st spotted in 2\nchildren from California who had had no contact with pigs or with each\nother. 'It was a child, and yeah, very similar to the circumstances\nthat occurred last spring,' Skinner said of the Iowa case. He said the\nfact that the investigation turned up no other cases and that some\ntime has since elapsed suggests there isn't any ongoing spread. 'I\nthink if there was other transmission going on associated with this\ncase we would have picked it up and we haven't.'\n\nThere are a variety of influenza viruses circulating among pigs.\nAccording to the CDC, the 4 main types currently found are H1N1, H1N2,\nH3N1 and H3N2 viruses. Prior to the pandemic, a human case of swine\nflu in the United States was discovered every year or 2.

Canine\nspecies were considered to be the new natural hosts for this virus.\nHowever, at the beginning of 2010, influenza-like respiratory signs,\nsuch as dyspnea, were also observed among cats as well as in dogs in\nan animal shelter located at Seoul, South Korea. The affected cats\nshowed 100 percent morbidity and 40 percent mortality.\n\nWe were able to isolate a virus from the lung specimen of a dead cat\nthat had suffered from the respiratory disease, in embryonated chicken\neggs. The 8 viral genes isolated were almost identical to those of the\ncanine influenza H3N2 virus suggesting interspecies transmission of\ncanine influenza H3N2 virus to the cat. Moreover, 3 domestic cats\ninfected with intranasal canine/Korea/GCVP01/07 (H3N2) all showed\nelevated rectal temperatures, nasal virus shedding, and severe\npulmonary lesions, such as suppurative bronchopneumonia. Our study for\nthe 1st time shows that cats are susceptible to canine influenza H3N2\ninfection, suggesting that cats may play an intermediate host role in\ntransmitting the H3N2 virus among feline and canine species, which\ncould lead to the endemic establishment of the virus in companion\nanimals.\n\nSuch a scenario raises a public health concern, as the possibility of\nthe emergence of new recombinant feline or canine influenza viruses in\ncompanion animals with the potential to act as zoonotic infection\ncannot be excluded.\n\n[Byline: Song DS, An DJ, Moon HJ, Yeom MJ, Jung HY, Jung WS, Park SJ,\nKim HK, Han SY, Oh JS, Park BK, Kim JK, Poo H, Webster RG, Jung K,\nKang BK.

Test samples from 2\npatients submitted by Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have been confirmed at the\nCDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] as positive for swine\norigin triple-reassortant (tr) H3N2 influenza viruses -- viruses that\nnormally infect pigs. While human infection with swine influenza viruses is\nrare, it can occur. This is most likely to occur when people are in close\nproximity to infected pigs, such as in pig barns and livestock exhibits\nhousing pigs at fairs.\n\nBoth of the patients with confirmed trH3N2 infection reported in FluView\nwere in the vicinity of live pigs. Dates of illness onset in the 2 patients\nare more than 6 weeks apart and the viruses from the 2 patients have some\ngenetic differences, confirming that these 2 cases are not linked. Ongoing\ninvestigations in both states have not shown any evidence of community\ntransmission of these viruses. The most likely scenario at this point is\nthat these are 2 isolated cases of human infection with swine influenza\nviruses that, while very rare, do occur from time to time. Both patients\nhave fully recovered from their illnesses; however, these 2 cases do\nunderscore the importance of human and animal surveillance for influenza.\n\nThese 2 cases reported in FluView bring the total number of human\ninfections with swine origin influenza viruses reported to CDC since 2005\nto 18. Previously, 3 of these reports had been swine origin A (H3N2)\nviruses. The Pennsylvania and Wisconsin cases bring the number of reports\nswine origin A (H3N2) infections in humans in the United States to 5. The\nviruses identified in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are similar to viruses\nthat infected a patient in Iowa in September 2009, a patient in Kansas in\nAugust 2009 and a patient in Minnesota in May 2010.\n\nSwine Influenza (swine flu) is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type\nA influenza viruses that regularly causes outbreaks of influenza in pigs.\nSwine flu viruses cause high levels of illness and low death rates in pigs.\nSwine influenza viruses may circulate among swine throughout the year, but\nmost outbreaks occur during the late fall and winter months similar to\noutbreaks in humans. There are 4 main influenza type A virus subtypes that\nhave been isolated in pigs: H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and H3N1. Most flu viruses\ncirculating in pigs are referred to as 'triple-reassortant' viruses because\nthese flu viruses contain genes from human, swine and avian influenza viruses.\n\nMost commonly, cases of human infection with swine-origin influenza viruses\noccur in people with direct exposure to pigs. The patient in Pennsylvania\nlives in an area where live pigs are farmed and the patient in Wisconsin\nbecame sick 2 days after attending a state fair where pigs were exhibited.\nIt's important to note that swine influenza viruses are not transmitted to\nhumans by food. You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork\nproducts. Eating properly handled and cooked pork and pork products is safe.\n\nIn the past, CDC received reports of approximately one human infection with\na swine influenza virus every one to 2 years, but in the past few years,\nabout 3 cases have been reported per year. Increased reporting of human\ninfections with swine influenza could be the result of increased influenza\ntesting capacity and capabilities in public health laboratories.\n\nThese trH3N2 viruses are different from the 2009 H1N1 virus that has been\ncirculating in the United States since late April 2009. They are also\ndifferent from human seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses that typically\ncirculate among people during the flu season. Swine trH3N2 viruses commonly\ncirculate in pigs in North America, but rarely infect humans. These viruses\nare different from the swine classical H1N1 or swine trH1N1 influenza\nviruses that also circulate in pigs in North America because they have H3N2\nsurface antigens. Tr H3N2 viruses first emerged in North American swine\nherds in the late 1990s. The H3 and N2 genes which 1st emerged in swine flu\nviruses originated from human seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses that\ncirculated globally among humans in the late 1990s.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of instances of human infection with animal\ninfluenza viruses do not result in human to human transmission, each case\nshould be fully investigated to be sure that such viruses are not spreading\namong humans and to limit further exposure of humans to infected animals if\ninfected animals are identified. Surveillance for both seasonal and novel\ninfluenza viruses is conducted by the CDC and its state and local health\npartners year round.\n\nFor more information about swine influenza, see:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/>.\nWeekly US surveillance updates are published in FluView and posted at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm>.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[There are 4 main influenza type A virus subtypes that have been isolated\nin pigs: H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and H3N1.

More people get sick\nduring flu seasons with mismatches. But a seasonal flu vaccine\nmismatch coinciding with a flu pandemic? That is no one's idea of a\ngood time. Dr. Allison McGeer groaned when she heard a new H3N2\nvariant is circulating in some parts of the Southern Hemisphere.\n'It's going to be a long winter. I know that already,' said McGeer,\nan influenza expert and head of infection control at Toronto's Mount\nSinai Hospital. 'It's not going to be pleasant because ... it's going\nto be one big long influenza season, from some time in September\nuntil next May.'\n\nThe new variant has been seen on a number of continents, though it\nstill remains a minority member of the H3N2 [strains], according to\nexperts at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. With the demands\nthe ongoing pandemic is placing on the WHO's laboratory network,\nresearchers haven't yet had time to study whether the new variant is\nmaking up a growing percentage of H3N2 viruses, said Dr. Nancy Cox,\ndirector of the CDC's influenza division. If they were, that would\nsuggest the variant was on its way to becoming the dominant H3N2\nvirus and a vaccine mismatch would be on the cards.\n\nFurther clouding the issue is the fact that labs around the world\nhaven't been submitting as many H3N2 viruses to the WHO network.\nThere are simply fewer of them around. 'We haven't had that many H3N2\nviruses to analyze because we've had such a flood of the novel H1N1\nviruses because they're predominating,' Cox said. Dr. Wenqing Zhang\nof the WHO's global influenza program said many Southern Hemisphere\ncountries are just coming into their regular flu seasons. The next\nmonth or so will give the world a clearer picture as to whether the\npandemic virus will crowd out the previous influenza A subtypes --\nmaking the composition of the seasonal vaccine less relevant -- or\nwhether one or both of the seasonal flu A virus [subtypes] will\ncontinue to circulate. And if H3N2 sticks around, the coming weeks\nwill also offer a sign as to whether this new variant is likely to\ncomplicate the upcoming Northern Hemisphere flu season.\n\n'While seemingly this variant H3 is emerging, we do not know to what\nextent it will be circulating,' Zhang said by e-mail from Geneva. Cox\nsaid the WHO collaborating labs will be heightening surveillance for\nseasonal flu viruses in the lead-up to the WHO's strain selection\nmeeting for the Southern Hemisphere seasonal vaccine, held in\nSeptember [2009]. One place they'll be checking is virus samples from\nnursing homes. H3N2 viruses prey on seniors and are behind many of\nthe frequent flu outbreaks seen in long-term care facilities. For\nsome reason, nursing home outbreaks are rarely caused by seasonal\nH1N1 viruses and so far the influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus has\nlargely spared that population too. 'If we start to see outbreaks in\nthose types of settings, this would increase our level of concern,'\nCox said. 'We haven't seen that to date.'\n\nBecause it takes months to make and ship flu vaccine, the viruses\ncovered by the seasonal flu shot have to be chosen long in advance.\nFor the Northern Hemisphere vaccine, experts like Cox gather at the\nWHO in February [2009] to assess the viruses circulating and make\ntheir best estimates of which will be the major disease sources in\nthe following winter. For the 2009-2010 winter they chose an H3N2\nvirus called A/Brisbane/10 first spotted in 2007. But within weeks of\nthe decision hints emerged that there was a new H3N2 variant, one\nsufficiently mutated ('drifted' in the language of flu) that it might\nbe able to evade the vaccine.\n\nResearchers in the influenza lab at the British Columbia Centre for\nDisease Control spotted it in early March [2009] as they were\nconducting late-season surveillance looking for just such viral\nevolution. In early May [2009], they reported the finding on\nProMed-mail, an electronic bulletin board and mailing list which\nmonitor infectious diseases outbreaks around the world [Influenza A\n(H1N1) - worldwide (11): coincident H3N2 variation 20090505.1679].\n\nDr. Danuta Skowronski, an influenza expert at the BCCDC, said she is\nexpecting this new variant to take over as the dominant H3N2 strain.\nAnd since the swine flu virus isn't infecting older adults much, it\ncould leave a niche for the new H3 variant. 'So it's hard to know. We\njust have to prepare for that possibility either way,' Skowronski\nsaid. 'The idea of having a mismatched drift strain circulating the\nsame year that we also have swine influenza [influenza pandemic\n(H1N1) 2009 virus infection] may mean that all segments of the\npopulation are affected by influenza one way or the other, whether\nit's the elderly with H3N2 and the young with H1N1.'\n\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[For an up-to-date detailed account of the prevention and control of\nseasonal influenza with vaccines, readers should consult the recently\npublished 'Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization\nPractices (ACIP), 2009.'

Cox\nsaid the WHO collaborating labs will be heightening surveillance for\nseasonal flu viruses in the lead-up to the WHO's strain selection\nmeeting for the Southern Hemisphere seasonal vaccine, held in\nSeptember [2009]. With the demands\nthe ongoing pandemic is placing on the WHO's laboratory network,\nresearchers haven't yet had time to study whether the new variant is\nmaking up a growing percentage of H3N2 viruses, said Dr. Nancy Cox,\ndirector of the CDC's influenza division. \n\n'This report updates the 2008 recommendations by CDC's Advisory\nCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the use of\ninfluenza vaccine for the prevention and control of seasonal\ninfluenza (CDC. \n\nThe 2009 recommendations include 3 principal changes or updates, one\nof which is that: The 2009-2010 trivalent vaccine virus strains are\nA/ Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like, A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like, and\nB/ Brisbane 60/2008-like antigens.

[For an up-to-date detailed account of the prevention and control of\nseasonal influenza with vaccines, readers should consult the recently\npublished 'Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization\nPractices (ACIP), 2009.' Some samples of the emerging new strain of H3N2 viruses show a\nsubstantially reduced response to antibodies generated by the\ncorresponding virus in the seasonal vaccine, raising the possibility\nof significantly reduced protection in some cases. In early May [2009], they reported the finding on\nProMed-mail, an electronic bulletin board and mailing list which\nmonitor infectious diseases outbreaks around the world [Influenza A\n(H1N1) - worldwide (11): coincident H3N2 variation 20090505.1679]. Researchers in the influenza lab at the British Columbia Centre for\nDisease Control spotted it in early March [2009] as they were\nconducting late-season surveillance looking for just such viral\nevolution. For the Northern Hemisphere vaccine, experts like Cox gather at the\nWHO in February [2009] to assess the viruses circulating and make\ntheir best estimates of which will be the major disease sources in\nthe following winter. Another storm may be brewing for the coming flu season: A component\nof the seasonal flu shot may not be well matched to the circulating\nviruses, potentially setting up what's known as a vaccine mismatch. \n\nDr. Danuta Skowronski, an influenza expert at the BCCDC, said she is\nexpecting this new variant to take over as the dominant H3N2 strain.\n The idea of having a mismatched drift strain circulating the\nsame year that we also have swine influenza [influenza pandemic\n Information on vaccination issues related to the\nrecently identified novel influenza A H1N1 virus will be published\nlater in 2009.

Dr. Wenqing Zhang\nof the WHO's global influenza program said many Southern Hemisphere\ncountries are just coming into their regular flu seasons. it's going\nto be one big long influenza season, from some time in September\nuntil next May.'\n\n the decision hints emerged that there was a new H3N2 variant, one\nsufficiently mutated ('drifted' in the language of flu) that it might\nbe able to evade the vaccine. Vaccination and health-care providers should be alert\nto announcements of recommendation updates and should check the CDC\ninfluenza website periodically for additional information.' And if H3N2 sticks around, the coming weeks\nwill also offer a sign as to whether this new variant is likely to\ncomplicate the upcoming Northern Hemisphere flu season. I know that already,' said McGeer,\nan influenza expert and head of infection control at Toronto's Mount\nSinai Hospital. ' If they were, that would\nsuggest the variant was on its way to becoming the dominant H3N2\nvirus and a vaccine mismatch would be on the cards. These recommendations and other\ninformation are available at CDC's influenza website\n We haven't had that many H3N2\nviruses to analyze because we've had such a flood of the novel H1N1\nviruses because they're predominating,' Cox said.

We\njust have to prepare for that possibility either way,' Skowronski\nsaid. ' If we start to see outbreaks in\nthose types of settings, this would increase our level of concern,'\n We haven't seen that to date.'\n\nBecause it takes months to make and ship flu vaccine, the viruses\ncovered by the seasonal flu shot have to be chosen long in advance. The 2009 seasonal influenza recommendations include\nnew and updated information. H1N1 viruses and so far the influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus has\nlargely spared that population too.

Through a natural process known as antigenic drift, a\nnew strain of influenza that can diminish the effectiveness of today's\nvaccine is already emerging on the far side of the world. The emergent\nstrain raising questions now is known as A/Wellington, named after the New\nZealand city where it was 1st detected. 'The flu season has been late this\nyear [2004], and it seems some people who have been vaccinated have been\nhit by this changing strain,' said New Zealand Health Ministry flu chief\nDr. Lance Jennings.\nLike weather forecasters watching tropical storms, epidemiologists for the\nWorld Health Organization track the ever-evolving strains of influenza. The\npredominant flu virus around the globe right now is one called A/Fujian,\nand the vaccine Americans are seeking today is a perfect match for it. But,\nA/Wellington is gaining ground. Tests suggest that 43 percent of recent New\nZealand flu cases spring from the new strain, or variants of it.\nA/Wellington has even turned up about as far from the South Pacific as is\ngeographically possible: in Norway.\nThe late season surge of A/Wellington was so worrying that the WHO, on 8\nOct 2004, recommended that next year's [2005] flu vaccine for the Southern\nHemisphere, which is shipped in March, be reformulated to protect against\nit. Dr. Nancy Cox, director of the Influenza Branch at the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, said there is no way of knowing whether the\nA/Wellington strain will establish a beachhead in the United States this\nwinter. 'Influenza viruses are inherently unpredictable,' she said in a\ntelephone interview.\nOne reason for concern is that laboratory animal tests suggest that the\ncurrent vaccine -- which targets A/Fujian -- is about 2/3rds less effective\nin stirring antibodies against A/Wellington than it is against the targeted\nstrain. That does not mean, Cox emphasized, that the current flu shot would\nbe 2/3rds less effective in actual use, should the A/Wellington strain turn\nup in the United States. People who regularly receive flu shots, she said,\nmay have higher levels of antibody protection against influenza than the\nlaboratory animals. 'We would not anticipate that the Wellington strain\nwill cause an enormous problem,' she said.\nDoris Bucher, a flu vaccine expert at New York Medical College in Valhalla,\nN.Y., said the animal tests on A/Wellington are actually encouraging,\nbecause they show that antibodies stirred up by today's vaccine will\ninhibit the new strain. 'If Wellington rushed in and took over, people\nwould have good protection with the current vaccine,' she said. Bucher's\nlab specializes in developing strains of influenza that grow well in eggs\nand hence serve as the basis for each year's flu vaccine made from eggs.\nThe current flu vaccine is made from a strain developed by her laboratory,\nand she is working right now on an A/Wellington-like strain for\nmanufacturers who will make next year's [2005] vaccines.\nWhen flu vaccines are well-matched to the prevailing flu strains, the shots\ncan prevent flu in 70 to 90 percent of vaccinated adults, according to the\nCDC. Well-matched shots may prevent flu in only 30 to 40 percent of nursing\nhome residents, but they can reduce the death rate from influenza and\npneumonia in that population by 80 percent. American manufacturers need a\n9-month lead to produce flu vaccine. That requires flu forecasters to\npredict in February what the prevailing flu strain will be November.\nIn February 2003, the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related\nBiological Products Advisory Committee selected a strain called A/Panama as\nthe target. Another strain, known as A/Fujian, was starting to emerge on\nthe World Health Organization's flu radar, but planners feared there was\nnot enough time to develop a vaccine for it. Influenza struck the United\nStates early and hard last year [2003]. The 1st cases turned up in early\nOctober 2003 in Texas, and soon anxious Americans were clamoring for\nvaccine, a foreshadowing of this year's [2004] flu shot frenzy.\nA near-record 83 million eventually had a flu shot last fall [2003]. But,\nthe predominant flu strain was not A/Panama but A/Fujian, and the vaccine\nwas only partially effective. A Colorado study for the CDC concluded last\nyear's flu shots were 52 percent effective in protecting healthy adults\nagainst flu and 38 percent effective in preventing flu among those with\nhealth conditions putting them at higher risk.\nBucher said it is reassuring that tests are showing there is less of a\nmismatch between the current flu vaccine and A/Wellington than there was\nlast year [2003] between A/Panama and A/Fujian. 'It's nothing like the\nsituation we had last year,'' she said. The issue, of course, will be\nacademic if the A/Fujian strain predominates again this year, as it did in\nthe Southern Hemisphere during most of the winter season that has now ended\nthere. Those 61 million Americans who find the vaccine will be protected.\nThere is also some evidence that the A/Fujian strain, having swept across\nthe globe last year [2003], may have lost its punch. Despite the late\nemergence of the new flu strain, influenza was unusually mild throughout\nthe Southern Hemisphere from May through October 2004. One reason may be\nthat the human population, vaccinated or not, developed its own natural\nresistance to A/Fujian when it came through last winter [2003]. 'There are\na number of factors that determine whether you will have a good, medium, or\nbad flu year, and clearly a major factor is whether the predominant strain\nhappens to be the same as the one the previous year,'' said Dr. Anthony\nFauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases. So far, there have been only isolated cases of flu detected in\nthe United States at the start of this year's flu season, and all have\nturned out to be A/Fujian. 'Things are looking pretty good, in that\nregard,'' Fauci said. 'But, that doesn't mean we won't get into trouble in\nNovember or December [2004].'\n[Byline: Sabin Russell]\n--\nJonathan Nash\n<jnash@qis.net>\n[The WHO Recommendations for Influenza Vaccine Composition for the Northern\nhemisphere for 2004-2005 (the current vaccine) are the following:\n(1) an A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like virus\n(2) an A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2)-like virus a\n(3) a B/Shanghai/361/2002-like virus b\na: The currently used vaccine virus is A/Wyoming/3/2003.

The current flu epidemic\n-- already on course to be the worst for 8 years\n-- will get worse as the infection usually peaks\nbetween January and March, they warn.\n\nThe European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS)\nsays the H3N2 Brisbane 10 flu strain that caused\na severe epidemic and killed 6 children in\nAustralia is spreading -- with the UK, Ireland,\nBulgaria and Spain experiencing it at 'medium\nintensity.' The UK Health Protection Agency and\nthe Royal College of GPs have reported a sharp\nrise in the number of flu-like illnesses over the\npast 2 weeks, with pensioners being the worst-hit.\n\nThe sharp rise left the NHS struggling to cope\nover Christmas. Thousands of GPs' surgeries close\nover this period, leaving sufferers with nowhere\nto go for help except accident and emergency\nwards. But hospitals are already under more\npressure than usual because of outbreaks of the\nwinter vomiting bug norovirus. Latest figures\nshow that among the over-65s, 45 in every 100 000\npeople now have flu, up from just 18 a week ago.\nThough it is still the 15 to 44 age group who are\nreporting the most cases, with a rate of 80 per\n100 000, it is the elderly who are most likely to die from flu.\n\nThis year's [2008] outbreak, blamed on an\nAustralian strain of the virus called Brisbane\nH3N2, is well on course to be the worst since\n1999, when 22 000 people died. However, an\noutbreak does not officially become an epidemic\nuntil the rate is higher than 200 per 100 000.\nThe last time this happened was in 1989.\n\nProfessor Steve Field, chairman of the Royal\nCollege of GPs, said: 'Older age groups are now\nshowing increases, and they have the most serious\nconsequences -- the extra load on the lungs,\npossible viral pneumonia and the increased risk\nof contracting a 2nd bacterial infection. The NHS\nis coping remarkably well in the circumstances,\nalthough there are some very desperate problems\nin the West Midlands. The outbreak is affecting\nyoung adults and many of these are health service\nworkers. When added together, there are a lot of\nproblems. The influenza vaccination programme has\nbeen good in some areas but patchy in others. It\nis these areas where the NHS will take a big hit.'\n\nJohn Heyworth, incoming president of the College\nof Emergency Medicine, said most people with flu\nwould not need to see a health professional and\nwould be fine within 2 or 3 days. But he added:\n'The bottom line is that if people can't access\ncare in the community and need to see someone,\nthey should come to accident and emergency\nbecause we don't want bad things to happen. If\nthere is any doubt, we are happy to help.'\n\nThe Health Protection Agency said: 'Although it\nis too early to predict how much further flu will\nincrease, the agency's advice is to be alert to\nsymptoms. These can include a headache, fever,\ncough, sore throat, and aching muscles and\njoints. For the majority of people, flu is an\nunpleasant, but not life-threatening, illness.\nBut it can be dangerous for certain groups, such\nas the elderly or those with heart problems,\ndiabetes or asthma and those who are immuno-compromised.'\n\nDavid Nicholson, NHS Chief Executive, said:\n'Thanks to the extra resources, staff and\nhospital capacity we've put in over the last 10\nyears, along with better planning, the NHS is well prepared for winter.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPoMED-mail\n\n\n[To put this press report in perspective, current statements on\ninfluenza surveillance in Europe are appended below.\n\no From Health Protection Report, Vol.2, no 51, 19\nDec 2008 (<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/>):\n\n'Influenza activity has started earlier this\nseason compared to recent years. Epidemiological,\nclinical and virological indicators show that\ninfluenza viruses are circulating in the\ncommunity at moderate levels. Infuenza is now\nwidespread across parts of the UK and continues to increase.\n\nThe percentage of ILI (Influenza-like illnesses)\ncases with laboratory confirmed influenza through\nGP sentinel schemes in England and Wales exceeded\nthe threshold of 30 percent in week 48 and is\ncurrently at 50.6 percent. A total of 403 samples\nhave tested positive for influenza in the\nRespiratory Virus Unit (RVU) influenza reference\nlaboratory at the HPA's Centre for Infections\n(CfI) since week 40. The vast majority of\ncirculating influenza has been influenza A(H3)\nwith 359 (89.1 percent) isolates. A further 34\n(8.4 percent) influenza A(H1) and 10 (2.5\npercent) influenza B isolates have been detected.\nAll 42 A(H3) isolates tested since week 40/08\nhave been sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir\nbut resistant to amantadine. Of the 28 A(H1)\nspecimens tested, 27 are resistant to oseltamivir\nbut sensitive to zanamivir and amantadine.\nViruses characterised at RVU show that the\ncurrent seasonal influenza vaccine is well\nmatched to circulating strains and should provide\ngood protection. The number of influenza positive\ndetections from other NHS and HPA laboratories in\nEngland and Wales has increased in the past few\nweeks and almost doubled from week 49 to week 50.\nSimilar patterns have been seen in Scotland and Northern Ireland.'\n\no From the EISS Weekly Electronic bulletin, Week 51, 25 Dec 2008\n(<http://www.eiss.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi>):\n\n'Epidemiological situation -- week 51/2008: For\nthe intensity indicator, the national network\nlevels of influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or\nacute respiratory infection (ARI) were high in\nPortugal and medium in Bulgaria, Ireland, Spain\nand the UK (England and Northern Ireland). The\nremaining 16 countries providing data reported\nlow intensity with increasing trends in Denmark,\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland.\nFor the geographical spread indicator, widespread\ninfluenza activity occurred in Portugal and the\nUK (England and Northern Ireland), while regional\nactivity was reported in Spain and the UK (Wales)\nand local activity in France and Switzerland.\nSporadic activity was observed in 10 countries\nwhile no activity was reported in Estonia,\nGreece, Hungary, Poland and Romania.

For\nthe intensity indicator, the national network\nlevels of influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or\nacute respiratory infection (ARI) were high in\nPortugal and medium in Bulgaria, Ireland, Spain\nand the UK (England and Northern Ireland).

Of\n29 A(H1N1) viruses tested, all were sensitive to\nzanamivir and 28 were resistant to oseltamivir,\nwhilst all of the 19 tested against amantadine\nwere sensitive. \n\nDavid Nicholson, NHS Chief Executive, said:\n'Thanks to the extra resources, staff and\nhospital capacity we've put in over the last 10\nyears, along with better planning, the NHS is well prepared for winter.'\n\n--\n A total of 403 samples\nhave tested positive for influenza in the\nRespiratory Virus Unit (RVU) influenza reference\nlaboratory at the HPA's Centre for Infections\n For the geographical spread indicator, widespread\ninfluenza activity occurred in Portugal and the\nUK (England and Northern Ireland), while regional\nactivity was reported in Spain and the UK (Wales)\nand local activity in France and Switzerland. But he added:\n'The bottom line is that if people can't access\ncare in the community and need to see someone,\nthey should come to accident and emergency\nbecause we don't want bad things to happen. The\nremaining 16 countries providing data reported\nlow intensity with increasing trends in Denmark,\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland.\n \n\n42 A(H3N2) viruses have been tested for antiviral\nsusceptibility so far this season; all those\ntested were sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors\n \n\nThe European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS)\nsays the H3N2 Brisbane 10 flu strain that caused\na severe epidemic and killed 6 children in\n Both B viruses tested have been\nsensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors (one was\ntested against both zanamivir and oseltamivir and\none against oseltamivir only). \n\nJohn Heyworth, incoming president of the College\nof Emergency Medicine, said most people with flu\nwould not need to see a health professional and\nwould be fine within 2 or 3 days. The number of influenza positive\ndetections from other NHS and HPA laboratories in\nEngland and Wales has increased in the past few\nweeks and almost doubled from week 49 to week 50. The current flu epidemic\n-- already on course to be the worst for 8 years\n-- will get worse as the infection usually peaks\nbetween January and March, they warn. The UK Health Protection Agency and\nthe Royal College of GPs have reported a sharp\nrise in the number of flu-like illnesses over the\npast 2 weeks, with pensioners being the worst-hit. \n\nThe Health Protection Agency said: 'Although it\nis too early to predict how much further flu will\nincrease, the agency's advice is to be alert to\nsymptoms. Viruses characterised at RVU show that the\ncurrent seasonal influenza vaccine is well\nmatched to circulating strains and should provide\ngood protection. Epidemiological,\nclinical and virological indicators show that\ninfluenza viruses are circulating in the\ncommunity at moderate levels. This year's [2008] outbreak, blamed on an\nAustralian strain of the virus called Brisbane\nH3N2, is well on course to be the worst since\n1999, when 22 000 people died. Thousands of GPs' surgeries close\nover this period, leaving sufferers with nowhere\nto go for help except accident and emergency\nwards. The NHS\nis coping remarkably well in the circumstances,\nalthough there are some very desperate problems\nin the West Midlands. All 42 A(H3) isolates tested since week 40/08\nhave been sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir\nbut resistant to amantadine. A further 34\n(8.4 percent) influenza A(H1) and 10 (2.5\npercent) influenza B isolates have been detected. The vast majority of\ncirculating influenza has been influenza A(H3)\nwith 359 (89.1 percent) isolates. Of the 28 A(H1)\nspecimens tested, 27 are resistant to oseltamivir\nbut sensitive to zanamivir and amantadine. But for 2\noseltamivir resistant A(H1N1) viruses from\nNorway, all other viruses tested have been from the UK.' Latest figures\nshow that among the over-65s, 45 in every 100 000\npeople now have flu, up from just 18 a week ago. Though it is still the 15 to 44 age group who are\nreporting the most cases, with a rate of 80 per\n100 000, it is the elderly who are most likely to die from flu. \n\nWhile the situation in the UK is becoming\nserious, there seems little justification for the\nexpression 'killer' employed by the above press report.
