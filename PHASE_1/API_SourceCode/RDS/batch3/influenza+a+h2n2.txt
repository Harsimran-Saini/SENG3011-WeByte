The threat is significant\nenough to warrant devising a preemptive vaccination strategy, the\nscientists assert in a commentary published in this week's issue of\nNature. The authors are Gary J Nabel, Chih-Jen Wei, and Julie E\nLedgerwood, all of whom work at the NIH Vaccine Research Center in\nBethesda, Maryland.\n\nThey write that H2N2 viruses have not circulated in humans for\ndecades, with the result that people younger than 50 probably have\nlittle immunity to them. But such viruses are still circulating in\npigs and birds and could jump back into humans, just as the 2009 H1N1\nvirus crossed from pigs to humans, they assert.\n\nDrawing the parallel with the 2009 pandemic, Nabel and colleagues\nnote that the hemagglutinin, or H1, component of the 2009 H1N1 virus\nis strikingly similar to the hemagglutinin of the H1N1 virus that\ncaused the great 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nThe 1918 H1N1 virus evolved into widely divergent seasonal strains\nover the decades, but a version with a very similar hemagglutinin\ncomponent has circulated in pigs for close to a century, changing\nlittle. That virus was 'poised to cross back into humans and cause a\nnew pandemic when broad protective human immunity had waned,' the\narticle says. H2N2 'could reemerge in a similar way. Governments,\nregulatory agencies, and industry should develop a preemptive\nvaccination strategy,' the researchers write.\n\nAfter causing the pandemic of 1957-58, the H2N2 virus continued to\ncirculate until it was displaced by the N3N2 virus in 1968, which\ntriggered another pandemic and has continued to circulate ever since.\nWhile H2N2 strains have not been found in humans for many years, they\nare still found in swine and birds, the scientists write. They add\nthat H2N2 strains mutate fairly slowly, as the surface proteins in\nmost bird and human strains are 92 percent identical.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2007, the authors tested 90 people for antibodies to\nH2N2 viruses. 'Our study suggests that people under 50 have little or\nno immunity, and resistance dramatically increases for those over 50,'\nthey write, while cautioning that the findings need to be replicated\nin much larger numbers of people. 'The low mutation rate for H2N2, and\nevidence of waning human immunity, make it likely that an H2N2\npandemic could arise from animals,' Nabel and colleagues assert.\n\nThe genetic similarity of existing H2N2 strains suggests that the\ntype of vaccine used decades ago would still be protective, they go on\nto say. They suggest several possible preemptive vaccination\nstrategies: manufacturing the vaccine licensed in 1957 and immunizing\nenough people globally to create herd immunity; making and stockpiling\nenough of the vaccine so supplies are ready in case of an outbreak; or\nmaking only 'master lots' of the vaccine and start production when an\noutbreak occurs.\n\nThe argument by Nabel and colleagues is taken seriously by some other\ninfluenza experts. Richard J Webby, PhD, director of the World Health\nOrganization Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of\nInfluenza in Animals and Birds, based at St Jude Children's Hospital\nin Memphis, commented, 'There is little doubt that H2 viruses pose a\npandemic threat and a defendable argument can even be made, as Dr\nNabel and team have done, that they pose more of a threat than many of\nthe other subtypes of influenza viruses circulating in birds. Although\nwe have not specifically identified an H2N2 virus in our surveillance\nefforts in birds for a number of years, H2N3 and H2N9 viruses are not\nuncommon. There is little evidence that global swine populations are\nmajor reservoirs of H2 viruses, but they are occasionally reported.'\nHe added that any virus with H2 hemagglutinin is a potential threat.\n\nMichael T Osterholm, PhD, MPH, welcomed the commentary as an\nimportant warning. 'I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reminder that just as we were\nsurprised by H1N1 returning, we shouldn't be surprised by the\npotential for H2N2 returning. I think in this case, [Nabel] has really\nprovided a very important perspective,' said Osterholm, who is\ndirector of the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease\nResearch and Policy, publisher of CIDRAP News. He said the commentary\nis a good reminder of other potential pandemic threats at a time when\nconsiderable attention is focused once again on H5N1 avian flu\noutbreaks and H5N1 cases in people. Osterholm also commented that pigs\nplayed a key role in triggering the 2009 pandemic, whereas the 1957\nvirus came from birds, adding, 'We surely have to keep our eye on the\npig population, but we know that birds can be an important source\ntoo.'\n\nH2N2 viruses were at the center of a scare in 2005, when a Cleveland\ncompany working for the College of American Pathologists included H2N2\nviruses in kits sent to more than 4600 laboratories for proficiency\ntesting.

Samples of the influenza A\n(H2N2) virus, which caused the influenza pandemic of 1957-58, were\nsent to more than 6000 labs for use in testing the labs' ability to\nidentify influenza viruses. Most of the labs were in the United\nStates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the\norganizations that administer proficiency testing reported that all\nthe samples had been destroyed. No reports of illness have been\nlinked with possible exposure to the samples, the CDC said. The virus\nhas not circulated since 1968, which means that most people now would\nhave little or no immunity to it.\n'Certification of the destruction of the H2N2 samples contained in\nthe proficiency testing kits effectively ends the immediate risk\nassociated with distribution of these kits, but it is only the 1st\nstep of the public health response,' the CDC said. A multi-agency\ntask force will investigate what caused the inclusion of H2N2 in the\ntest kits, the statement added.\nAlso today [3 May 2005], the CDC and the National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH) recommended that labs use stricter safety precautions\nwhen handling H2N2 virus samples. The agencies released a\nrecommendation that labs use Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) instead of\nBSL-2 precautions when working with the virus. A similar\nrecommendation was made for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\nviruses and for reverse-genetics research on the 1918 pandemic flu\nvirus.\nStarting last fall [2004], samples of the H2N2 virus were sent to\nlabs in 18 countries for routine testing that usually involves more\nbenign flu strains. Meridian Bioscience Inc. of Cleveland sent the\nkits on behalf of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and 3\nother US organizations that administer lab proficiency testing. Why\nthe H2N2 virus was used has not been fully explained. But the virus\nwas classified as BSL-2 at the time, which meant it could legally be\nused in the kits, CAP officials have said. In the testing, labs have\nto determine whether a virus is influenza and whether it is type A or\nB, without identifying the subtype. But Canadian government\nresearchers discovered in March 2005 that the virus they had been\nsent was H2N2, which led the World Health Organization on 12 Apr 2005\nto urge labs to destroy all the samples. Most laboratories quickly\ndid so, but a few samples were missing, which triggered an urgent\nsearch. CDC officials reported on 21 Apr 2005 that 99 percent of the\nsamples had already been destroyed. News reports on 25 Apr 2005 said\nthe last samples outside the United States had been destroyed at the\nAmerican University of Beirut in Lebanon, after they were found at\nthe Beirut airport.\nEarlier reports said H2N2 samples were sent to 3747 labs under CAP\nauspices and to about another 2700 labs certified by other\norganizations. All but about 75 labs that received the CAP samples\nwere in the United States, reports said. How many of the other labs\nwere in the United States has not been made clear.\nThe Biosafety Recommendations released today [3 May 2005] are part of\na new edition of guidelines for biomedical labs that will be\npublished in full this fall, the CDC said. In BSL-3 labs, agents are\nhandled with equipment designed to prevent any airborne contamination\nand resulting respiratory exposure for lab workers and others. With\nregard to the 1918 pandemic virus, the recommendations state, 'Any\nresearch involving reverse genetics of the 1918 influenza strain\nshould proceed with extreme caution. The risk to laboratory workers\nis unknown at the present time, but the pandemic potential is thought\nto be significant.' In recent studies, researchers have engineered\nviruses similar to the 1918 pandemic strain, H1N1, and exposed mice\nto them in an effort to learn what made the virus so deadly. The 1918\npandemic is estimated to have killed between 50 million and 100\nmillion people around the world.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n \n'Certification of the destruction of the H2N2 samples contained in\nthe proficiency testing kits effectively ends the immediate risk\nassociated with distribution of these kits, but it is only the 1st\nstep of the public health response,' the CDC said.

Because the virus is easily\ntransmitted from person to person and many people have no immunity to it,\nthe discovery has raised alarm that it could cause another deadly pandemic\nif a laboratory worker became infected, officials said. As a result, health\nauthorities were urgently working to make sure all samples are destroyed and\nto closely monitor anyone who may have come into contact with the virus for\nsigns of illness, officials said.\n'This virus could cause a pandemic,' said Klaus Stohr, the World Health\nOrganization's top influenza expert. 'We are talking about a fully\ntransmissible human influenza virus to which the majority of the population\nhas no immunity. We are concerned.' Although no infections have been\nreported, and the chances of infection are probably low, the potential\nconsequences are so grave that urgent steps were necessary, he said. 'If a\nlaboratory accident were to occur, a person could become infected. If that\nhappened, that person would likely fall ill and he or she could infect\nsomebody else. And that could mark the beginning of a global outbreak,'\nStohr said. WHO is working with the federal Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention in Atlanta and other national health agencies to contain the\nsituation, he said, adding that 'the level of concern about this virus is\nvery high.'\nThe virus, known as an H2N2 strain, killed 1 million to 4 million people\nworldwide in 1957 and 1958, including about 70 000 in the United States.\nBecause the virus has not circulated in the wild since 1968, anyone born\nafter that would have no natural immunity to it. Since then, the virus has\nbeen kept only in high-security biological laboratories. The problem arose\nwhen a private company, Meridian Bioscience Inc. of Cincinnati, sent a panel\nof virus samples to about 3700 laboratories, some in doctors' offices, to be\ntested as part of routine quality-control certification conducted by the\nCollege of American Pathologists. An additional 2750 laboratories, all in\nthe United States, received the samples as part of other certification\nprocesses and were asked to destroy them, CDC spokesman Dan Rutz said. The\npanel samples usually include only strains of influenza virus that are\nrelatively benign, Stohr said. 'We would consider this an unwise and\nunfortunate decision,' he said.\nThe 3700 samples were sent out beginning last fall, primarily to labs in the\nUnited States, although 14 were in Canada and 61 were in 16 other countries,\nStohr said. 'The people who are handling this are extremely experienced in\ndealing with potentially dangerous pathogens, and we have no reason to\nbelieve that there were any breaches,' Rutz said. 'But there's always a\nconcern about a virus to which a sizable part of the population has no\nimmunity, and we're interested in seeing to it that it's neutralized as\nquickly as possible.'\nThe mistake came to light March 25 when the National Microbiology Laboratory\nin Winnipeg, Manitoba, identified the virus. 'They were doing this routine\ntesting and identified this virus ', Rutz said. Canadian officials notified\nWHO and the CDC on Friday. 'We have requested that additional measures be\ntaken --- that the laboratories have to acknowledge receipt of the message\nin written form, to confirm that they have destroyed any of these samples,\nand that they would monitor their laboratory staff for any respiratory\ndisease,' Stohr said.\nRobert G. Webster, a flu expert at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital\nin Memphis, called the incident 'a terrible, terrible mistake. I have been\ntelling WHO for a number of years that this is a dangerous virus that is\nstill out there in more labs than they know,' he said. 'This may alert WHO\nand Homeland Security and whoever wants to know that each and every H2N2\nsample from 1957 needs to be rounded up and locked down.'\nNeither the College of American Pathologists nor Meridian Bioscience was\naware that the virus being shipped was the deadly 1957 strain, said Jared\nSchwartz, a pathologist and spokesman for the college. The college asked the\ncompany to ship a type A strain of virus, he said, and Meridian's paperwork\nindicated that this strain was benign. 'For reasons I don't understand and\nMeridian doesn't understand, the documentation they had was incorrect,' he\nsaid, adding that the source of the mislabeling was unclear. Meridian may\nhave obtained the strain from another company that had misidentified it, he\nsaid. Even had Meridian known it was the deadly H2N2 strain, Schwartz said,\ncurrent federal guidelines would have allowed the company to ship it. He\nsaid that neither the college nor the company was aware CDC was considering\nwhether to reclassify the strain as too deadly to ship. Schwartz said a\nmechanism is being established to require anyone shipping pathogens to\nnotify the CDC about what strains of virus are involved.\nWilliam J. Motto, chairman and chief executive of Meridian Bioscience, said\nhe had no comment last night.\n[Byline: Rob Stein, Shankar Vedantam, David Brown and Lucy Shackelford]\n--\n'pablo11'\n<pablo11@hotPOP.com>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 13 Apr 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource:: Eurosurveillance E-alert, Wed 13 April 2005\n<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2005/050407.asp>\n\nE-alert 13 April: Worldwide laboratory distribution of influenza A/H2N2\nvirus similar to 1957-58 pandemic strain, labs asked to destroy all samples\nimmediately\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn influenza A/H2N2 virus, similar to that which caused the 1957-8 influenza\npandemic has been inadvertently distributed in proficiency panels for\nquality control assessment to at least 3686 laboratories in Canada and the\nUnited States, and 61 laboratories worldwide, the World Health Organization\nannounced on 12 April [1]. The distribution occurred between October 2004\nand February 2005.\nThe A/H2N2 virus concerned, A/Japan/305/57 H2N2, is the same strain of virus\nthat circulated during the 1957-58 influenza pandemic. The pandemic strain\nwas highly transmissible among humans, and continued to circulate in humans\ncausing annual epidemics until 1968, after which time it vanished. An A/H2N2\nvirus is not included in current trivalent influenza vaccines, and it is\nthought that people born after 1968 have no immunity to A/H2N2 infection.\nThe virus was identified by a local laboratory in Canada and reported to the\nPublic Health Agency of Canada (PHAC, http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca), which\ninformed WHO on 26 Mar 2005. The PHAC immediately initiated appropriate\nbiosafety measures and respiratory surveillance and traced the source of the\nvirus to a panel of proficiency testing samples distributed by the College\nof American Pathologists (CAP, http://www.cap.org). This information was\npassed to WHO and the United States Department of Health and Human Services\n(HHS) on 8 Apr 2005. HHS has since learnt that additional A/H2N2 samples were\nsent to additional laboratories in the US by other proficiency testing\nproviders.\nOn 8 Apr 2005, the CAP, at the request of the US government, contacted all\nlaboratories participating in the proficiency testing and asked them to\ndestroy all samples containing A/H2N2 virus. On 12 Apr2005 the CAP further\nasked all the laboratories to send confirmation of the destruction, and to\ninvestigate and notify national authorities of any respiratory disease seen\nin laboratory staff. WHO has the addresses of all laboratories involved and\nhas passed these on to the relevant ministries of health, requesting their\ncollaboration.\nThe European Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) [2] today issued a\nlevel 2 alert to the competent public health authorities in the EU, with the\ninformation currently available from WHO.

A dangerous strain of influenza virus that caused a worldwide pandemic in\n1957 was sent to thousands of laboratories in the United States and around\nthe world, triggering a frantic effort to destroy the samples to prevent an\noutbreak, health officials revealed yesterday. An unresolved issue, discussed in previous ProMED-mail\nposts, is whether antibodies to the N2 component of influenza virus might\nprovide some degree of protection sufficient ameliorate the effects of H2N2\nvirus infection. Because the virus is easily\ntransmitted from person to person and many people have no immunity to it,\nthe discovery has raised alarm that it could cause another deadly pandemic\nif a laboratory worker became infected, officials said. As a result, health\nauthorities were urgently working to make sure all samples are destroyed and\nto closely monitor anyone who may have come into contact with the virus for\nsigns of illness, officials said. WHO is working with the federal Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention in Atlanta and other national health agencies to contain the\nsituation, he said, adding that 'the level of concern about this virus is\nvery high.' The PHAC immediately initiated appropriate\nbiosafety measures and respiratory surveillance and traced the source of the\nvirus to a panel of proficiency testing samples distributed by the College\nof American Pathologists (CAP, http://www.cap.org). The European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS, http://www.eiss.org/) has\ntoday issued an urgent questionnaire for all laboratories participating in\nthe Community Network of Reference Laboratories for Human Influenza in\nEurope Later, in 1977, a\nRussian H1N1 serotype strain that had been present in the 1950s reappeared\nand has remained in circulation together with H3N2 serotype virus since\nthat time. But there's always a\nconcern about a virus to which a sizable part of the population has no\nimmunity, and we're interested in seeing to it that it's neutralized as\nquickly as possible.' On 12 Apr2005 the CAP further\nasked all the laboratories to send confirmation of the destruction, and to\ninvestigate and notify national authorities of any respiratory disease seen\nin laboratory staff.

' The\npanel samples usually include only strains of influenza virus that are\nrelatively benign, Stohr said. On 8 Apr 2005, the CAP, at the request of the US government, contacted all\nlaboratories participating in the proficiency testing and asked them to\ndestroy all samples containing A/H2N2 virus. International response to the distribution of a H2N2 influenza\nvirus for laboratory testing: Risk considered low for laboratory workers and\nthe public. Neither the College of American Pathologists nor Meridian Bioscience was\naware that the virus being shipped was the deadly 1957 strain, said Jared\n An A/H2N2\nvirus is not included in current trivalent influenza vaccines, and it is\nthought that people born after 1968 have no immunity to A/H2N2 infection. We are talking about a fully\ntransmissible human influenza virus to which the majority of the population\nhas no immunity. The virus was identified by a local laboratory in Canada and reported to the\nPublic Health Agency of Canada (PHAC, http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca), which\ninformed WHO on 26 Mar 2005. Countries in which at least one laboratory is currently known to have\nreceived virus samples:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------- I have been\ntelling WHO for a number of years that this is a dangerous virus that is\nstill out there in more labs than they know,' he said. ' Schwartz said a\nmechanism is being established to require anyone shipping pathogens to\nnotify the CDC about what strains of virus are involved. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that a\nserotype H1N1 virus of avian origin then became predominant, infecting both\nhumans and pigs, and spreading from America to Europe with troop movements. An additional 2750 laboratories, all in\nthe United States, received the samples as part of other certification\nprocesses and were asked to destroy them, CDC spokesman Dan Rutz said. When proper biosafety precautions are taken, the risk of laboratory-acquired\ninfluenza infections is greatly reduced and the likelihood of any infections\nin these staff and the general public is low. The 3700 samples were sent out beginning last fall, primarily to labs in the\nUnited States, although 14 were in Canada and 61 were in 16 other countries,\nStohr said. ' WHO recommends that all proficiency panel specimens containing A/H2N2 be\ndestroyed immediately, and that biosafety procedures for influenza viruses\nthat are no longer circulating in humans be reviewed. The previously predominant H1N1 strain disappeared simultaneously with the\nappearance of the pandemic H2N2 strain, a circumstance not yet adequately\nexplained. He\nsaid that neither the college nor the company was aware CDC was considering\nwhether to reclassify the strain as too deadly to ship. HHS has since learnt that additional A/H2N2 samples were\nsent to additional laboratories in the US by other proficiency testing\nproviders. The pandemic strain\nwas highly transmissible among humans, and continued to circulate in humans\ncausing annual epidemics until 1968, after which time it vanished. EISS is working with\nlaboratories to improve the detection of potential pandemic viruses,\nincluding A/H2N2 viruses [2]. Although no infections have been\nreported, and the chances of infection are probably low, the potential\nconsequences are so grave that urgent steps were necessary, he said. ' The European Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) [2] today issued a\nlevel 2 alert to the competent public health authorities in the EU, with the\ninformation currently available from WHO. Meridian may\nhave obtained the strain from another company that had misidentified it, he\nsaid. The people who are handling this are extremely experienced in\ndealing with potentially dangerous pathogens, and we have no reason to\nbelieve that there were any breaches,' Rutz said. ' (For a fuller account of this interpretation of the epidemiology\nof human influenza, see: Webster RG and Kawaoka Y, Semiminars in Virology 5,\n103-111, 1994.) For reasons I don't understand and\nMeridian doesn't understand, the documentation they had was incorrect,' he\nsaid, adding that the source of the mislabeling was unclear.
