The program tests samples collected from diagnostic submissions to veterinary diagnostic laboratories. This surveillance is not conducted to define prevalence -- the goal is to identify viruses that may be circulating in swine, and gain knowledge to contribute to improved animal health diagnostics and vaccines.\n\nThe IAV-S Surveillance report for FY 2017 2nd Quarter has been posted to the web and can be viewed at https://tinyurl.com/yadsym7e.\nSome of the key points in the report include:\n- In FY 2017 Q2, 1931 samples were submitted for IAV-S surveillance from 888 accessions;\n- H1N2 was the predominant subtype;\n- over the past 8 quarters, H1N2 predominated in regions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. When Regions are recorded as 'unknown' H1N1 predominates (see map in regional section).\n\nUSDA has been able to extend the funding for this program through the use of both appropriated and emergency funding. Although producers will continue to bear the cost burden of the initial IAV-S screening test (Matrix PCR) USDA will continue to provide funding support to the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) for further testing of accessions that meet the Matrix PCR CT cutoff values (oral fluids CT less than 20, and nasal swabs and lung CT less than 25). Further testing includes subtyping PCRs, virus isolation, and sequencing of the HA and NA genes.\n\nAll IAV-S submissions are voluntary and based on clinical case submissions to veterinary diagnostic labs. Thus data are not a statistically representative sampling of the US swine population. Likewise, the information in this report cannot be used to determine regional and/or national incidence, prevalence, or other epidemiological measures, but it may help identify IAV-S trends.\n\nUSDA, AASV, and the swine industry encourage continued support for the program and the submission of samples from all geographic regions (some regions have been historically underrepresented in the report).\n\n[Byline: Harry Snelson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Regions 1 through 5 covers the whole of the lower 48 states.

The researchers exposed groups of ferrets, which are considered the best animal models for human flu, to 4 swine flu viruses isolated in Korea -- 2 H1N2 and 2 H3N2. One of the H1N2 isolates caused severe or fatal illness in the animals and spread to other ferrets housed nearby without direct contact, according to the scientists' report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/08/31/1205576109.abstract) [Abstract reproduced below. - Mod.CP].\n\nIn addition, when the scientists analyzed the virus in the ferrets that were infected secondarily, they found that it had 2 mutations and was able to spread even more readily to other ferrets. The findings come 3 years after another swine-origin flu virus, the 2009 H1N1 strain, triggered a pandemic, which the authors say marked the broadest known spread of a swine-origin strain in humans.\n\nRichard J Webby, PhD, a co-author of the study, said the newly identified virus, dubbed Sw/1204, is closely related to swine H1N2 viruses in the United States. Experts say the H1N2 subtype is fairly common in swine, and a few swine-origin H1N2 infections, called H1N2v, have been identified in humans in recent years, including 4 cases in people who were exposed to pigs at the Minnesota State Fair in August 2012 [see ProMED-mail post Influenza (85): USA: (MN) swine H1N2 influenza, human cases 20120911.1290389].\n\nAnother swine-origin virus, variant H3N2, or H3N2v, has infected nearly 300 people in the United States this summer [2012], most of whom exhibited pigs or were otherwise exposed to pigs at county and state fairs. 16 patients were hospitalized, and one person, a woman who had preexisting health problems, died [see ProMED-mail posts Influenza (82): USA A(H3N2)v, first human death 20120901.1276404, and earlier].\n\nWebby, who is with St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis [Tennessee], said Sw/1204 probably represents only a minor threat to humans, because it is related to the 2009 H1N1 strain, and therefore anyone who was exposed to the latter would have 'considerable immunity' to it.\n\nStill, the findings show the continuing pandemic potential of reassortant swine flu viruses, the researchers say. The authors write that, because swine flu surveillance is 'abysmal,' it is unclear whether swine flu subtypes other than H1N1 could spread among humans and cause serious illness. Their aim was to assess the zoonotic potential of representative Korean 'triple-reassortant' H1N2 and H3N2 viruses that are related to North American strains. 'Triple-reassortant' generally refers to flu viruses that contain genes from avian, human, and swine flu strains.\n\nWebby said it is very unusual for a swine flu virus to cause severe illness in ferrets and that swine flu viruses typically don't spread easily among ferrets, either. By comparison, ferret experiments with the 2009 H1N1 virus showed that it generally was not lethal, though it did cause a few cases of severe illness, he told CIDRAP News. 'I'd say the generalization is that the pandemic virus was a bit more able to cause disease in most [animal] models than the average swine virus,' he said. Concerning the potential risk of Sw/1204 to humans, Webby said, 'I think this particular one, the threat is fairly minor because it's a not-so-distant cousin of the pandemic virus itself, so anyone who was exposed to the pandemic virus would have considerable immunity to this particular strain.'\n\nWebby said the H1N2 viruses used in the study are 'quite closely related' to swine H1N2 strains in the United States. 'The viruses in Korea were likely imported from the US,' he said. 'We've done some risk assessments on some viruses circulating in the US and haven't seen any phenotypes with the properties of this [Sw/1204] virus.'\nAlthough the study generated a mutant H1N2 virus that spread more easily among ferrets while maintaining its virulence, Webby said the study did not violate the voluntary moratorium that leading flu researchers announced in January [2012] on studies involving the generation of H5N1 avian flu viruses with increased transmissibility in mammals.\n\n[Byline: Robert Roos]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Reference\n---------\nPhilippe Noriel Q Pascua, Min-Suk Song, Jun Han Lee, et al: Virulence and transmissibility of H1N2 influenza virus in ferrets imply the continuing threat of triple-reassortant swine viruses. PNAS, 2012; doi:10.1073/pnas.1205576109.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n'Efficient worldwide swine surveillance for influenza A viruses is urgently needed; the emergence of a novel reassortant pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus in 2009 demonstrated that swine can be the direct source of pandemic influenza and that the pandemic potential of viruses prevalent in swine populations must be monitored. We used the ferret model to assess the pathogenicity and transmissibility of predominant Korean triple-reassortant swine (TRSw) H1N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses genetically related to North American strains. Although most of the TRSw viruses were moderately pathogenic, one [A/Swine/Korea/1204/2009; Sw/1204 (H1N2)] was virulent in ferrets, causing death within 10 days of inoculation, and was efficiently transmitted to naive contact ferrets via respiratory droplets. Although molecular analysis did not reveal known virulence markers, the Sw/1204 virus acquired mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) (Asp-225-Gly) and neuraminidase (NA) (Ser-315-Asn) proteins during the single ferret passage. The contact-Sw/1204 virus became more virulent in mice, replicated efficiently in vitro, extensively infected human lung tissues ex vivo, and maintained its ability to replicate and transmit in swine. Reverse-genetics studies further indicated that the HA225G and NA315N substitutions contributed substantially in altering virulence and transmissibility. These findings support the continuing threat of some field TRSw viruses to human and animal health, reviving concerns on the capacity of pigs to create future pandemic viruses. Apart from warranting continued and enhanced global surveillance, this study also provides evidence on the emerging roles of HA225G and NA315N as potential virulence markers in mammals.'\n\nThe Korean-US research team has identified an H1N2 strain of swine influenza capable of killing ferrets and spreading among them by respiratory droplets, underlining the continuing threat of swine flu to humans amid a wave of swine-origin flu cases in Americans exposed to pigs at agricultural fairs. However, according to Richard Webby, 'the original pig virus is probably still circulating in Korea, and no one is known to have caught it. Either it doesn't do the same thing in people, or it just hasn't got loose.' This could be because a strain with the same H1 surface protein circulated before 2009, making those exposed to it immune. But this effect will disappear over time as that virus no longer circulates (New Scientist 11 Sep 2012 http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22257-threatwatch-swine-flu-evolves-under-the-radar.htm). These experiments are reigniting the debate over the risk associated withe genetic manipulation of the transmissibility of influenza viruses. - Mod.CP]\n\n[Photo of pet ferrets:\nhttp://www.ferrettradingpost.com/images/eric%20shefferman%20-%20mary%20shefferman%20-%20ferrets.jpg - Mod.JW]", "summary": "\n\nThe Korean-US research team has identified an H1N2 strain of swine influenza capable of killing ferrets and spreading among them by respiratory droplets, underlining the continuing threat of swine flu to humans amid a wave of swine-origin flu cases in Americans exposed to pigs at agricultural fairs. --------\n'Efficient worldwide swine surveillance for influenza A viruses is urgently needed; the emergence of a novel reassortant pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus in 2009 demonstrated that swine can be the direct source of pandemic influenza and that the pandemic potential of viruses prevalent in swine populations must be monitored.

The boy was at the fair on 23 to 26 Aug 2012 and became ill 4 days after he went home, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. He did not require hospitalisation.\n\nAll 4 cases linked to the fair so far involved patients who spent long hours in the Swine Barn, and all 4 recovered quickly. The 4 cases involved a strain of flu different from the one [H3N2v] that prompted national warnings in August.\n\nMinnesota health officials went on high alert last month as the new strain [H3N2v] swept across the central Midwest, sickening more than 300 people, with most cases linked to agricultural fairs. The new strain, H3N2v, has resembled ordinary seasonal flu, with symptoms that include a fever and runny nose. But public health officials watched it carefully because the flu virus can mutate quickly once it jumps from one species to another; 2 cases of that flu, and a suspected 3rd case, were reported last month in Dakota County among people who attended a live-animal market.\n\nAll 4 cases linked to the State Fair involved a different strain, known as H1N2.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to a CIDRAP News report of 6 Sep 2012 by Robert Roos (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/sep0712h1n2.html) the swine-origin H1N2 virus found in 3 [now 4] Minnesotans last week carries the matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, marking the 1st time such a virus has been found in humans, according to state and federal health officials. The variant H1N2, or H1N2v, virus is different from the swine-origin H3N2v strain that has cropped up in nearly 300 people within the past year. But the 2 are alike in that both picked up the pandemic virus's matrix gene.\n\nThe number of H3N2v cases has risen to 297, an increase of 7 since a week ago, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) new count, posted today. Nearly all the cases have been in people who were exposed to pigs, most of them at agricultural fairs this summer. Only one death, that of an Ohio woman who had other medical conditions, has been linked to the virus, but there have been 16 hospitalizations.\n\nNo ongoing human-to-human transmission of either H3N2v or H1N2v viruses has been reported, but the CDC has said that the H1N1 matrix gene might increase the transmissibility of H3N2v and that a few instances of likely human-to-human spread of that virus have been found.\n\nIn reporting the H1N2v cases in a statement today [10 Sep 2012], the CDC said the population probably has some immunity to it because of past exposure to seasonal H1N1 flu viruses. 'Genetic analysis shows that the hemagglutinin (H) of this virus is similar to human seasonal influenza viruses that circulated in people as recently as 2009, so there would likely be protective immunity against this particular virus in the human population,' the agency said.\n\nAlthough H1N2v is new in humans, the US Department of Agriculture's swine flu surveillance program has detected very similar H1N2 viruses with the 2009 H1N1 matrix gene in pigs in Minnesota and some other states since early 2010, the CDC reported. In reporting the cases last week, the MDH said 2 sick pigs at the State Fair tested positive for H1N2. Ferguson reported that the virus in the pigs was also found to contain the 2009 H1N1 matrix gene. The H1N2v cases demonstrate once again that swine flu viruses can spread to people, and they point up the importance of the CDC recommendation that people at risk for serious flu complications should avoid close contact with pigs and pig barns at fairs this season, the agency said.\n\nAlthough the recent H1N2v cases are the 1st known to contain the 2009 H1N1 matrix gene, a few other H1N2v cases have been reported in recent years. One case was reported in a Minnesota child in December 2011. Another case was reported in 2007 in an 18-month-old Michigan child who had been in a swine barn. Both of those patients recovered. In 2002 the CDC reported that a total of 11 human H1N2 cases had been detected in Wisconsin, Texas, and Nevada the previous year.\n\nThe interactive HealthMap of the state of Minnesota can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/3eo9. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to a CIDRAP News report of 6 Sep 2012 by Robert Roos (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/sep0712h1n2.html) the swine-origin H1N2 virus found in 3 [now 4] Minnesotans last week carries the matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, marking the 1st time such a virus has been found in humans, according to state and federal health officials.

These cases were reportedly associated with prolonged contact with pigs at a fair. H1N2 viruses normally circulate in pigs, not people, but rare human infections with this virus have been detected in the past. This virus is different from the H3N2v virus that, as of today, is reported to have caused 296 human infections across 10 U.S. states since July 2012. These additional human infections underscore the fact that swine influenza viruses can spread to people after close contact with infected pigs, and support the importance of ongoing surveillance for both human and swine influenza viruses.\n\nAccording to the state of Minnesota, each of the 3 people infected with the H1N2v virus had exhibited pig(s) or spent prolonged time with pig(s) at the Minnesota State Fair. Two of the 3 people had underlying health conditions that placed them at high risk of serious flu complications; one of the 2 people with high risk factors was hospitalized, highlighting again the importance of the CDC recommendation that people with high risk factors avoid close contact with pigs and pig arenas at fairs this season. All 3 people have recovered from their illnesses.\n\nPeople who are at high risk of serious flu complications include children younger than 5 years, people 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions (like asthma and other lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions). A full list of high risk factors is available on the CDC seasonal flu site.\n\nIn addition to avoiding pigs and pig arenas at fairs this year, as always, people with high risk conditions who develop flu-like symptoms should seek prompt medical attention. The H1N2v virus should be susceptible to both currently recommended influenza antiviral drugs [oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza)].\n\nCDC has confirmed the Minnesota samples as H1N2v viruses. Sequencing of the viruses indicates these H1N2 variant viruses are very similar to those found in humans previously; with the exception of the addition of the pandemic M gene. This is the 1st time this virus has included the M gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus when isolated from a person. Genetic analysis shows that the hemagglutinin (H) of this virus is similar to human seasonal influenza viruses that circulated in people as recently as 2007, so there would likely be protective immunity against this particular virus in the human population.\n\nThe University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Lab also isolated an H1N2 virus from swine sampled at the Minnesota State Fair. Sequencing at National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirmed that it matches the human isolates\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n*****\n[2]\nDate: Fri 7 Sep 2012\nSource: CIDRAP News [abridged & edited]\nhttp://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swinef= lu/news/sep0712h1n2.html\n\n\nFlu parallels: Swine-origin H1N2 has gene from 2009 H1N1\n--------------------------------------------------\nSwine-origin H1N2 virus found in 3 Minnesotans last week carries the matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, marking the 1st time such a virus has been found in humans, according to state and federal health officials.\n\nThe variant H1N2 (H1N2v) virus is different from the swine-origin H3N2v strain that has cropped up in nearly 300 people within the past year. But the 2 are alike in that both picked up the pandemic virus's matrix gene.\n\nThe number of H3N2v cases has now risen to 297, an increase of 7 since a week ago, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) new count, posted today. Nearly all the cases have been in people who were exposed to pigs, most of them at agricultural fairs this summer. Only one death, that of an Ohio woman who had other medical conditions, has been linked to the virus, but there have been 16 hospitalizations.\n\nNo ongoing human-to-human transmission of either H3N2v or H1N2v viruses has been reported, but the CDC has said that the H1N1 matrix gene might increase the transmissibility of H3N2v and that a few instances of likely human-to-human spread of that virus have been found. In reporting the H1N2v cases in a statement today, the CDC said the population probably has some immunity to it because of past exposure to seasonal H1N1 flu viruses.\n\nThe 3 confirmed H1N2v cases reported in Minnesota last week were all in people who were exposed to pigs at the State Fair. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) said today that a 4th case has since been reported and is awaiting confirmation by the CDC. MDH spokesman Buddy Ferguson said the 'presumptive positive' case is a teenage boy from outside the Twin Cities area who exhibited pigs at the State Fair from 23 to 26 Aug 2012 and got sick on 28 Aug [2012]. Ferguson said he didn't know of any connection between the teenager and the other 3 cases.\n\nAlthough H1N2v is new in humans, the US Department of Agriculture's swine flu surveillance program has detected very similar H1N2 viruses with the 2009 H1N1 matrix gene in pigs in Minnesota and some other states since early 2010, the CDC reported. In reporting the cases last week, the MDH said 2 sick pigs at the State Fair tested positive for H1N2. Ferguson reported that the virus in the pigs was also found to contain the 2009 H1N1 matrix gene.\n\nThe H1N2v cases demonstrate once again that swine flu viruses can spread to people, and they point up the importance of the CDC recommendation that people at risk for serious flu complications should avoid close contact with pigs and pig barns at fairs this season, the agency said. Those at risk include children under age 5, people over 65, pregnant women, and people who have long-term health problems such as asthma, other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immunity, and neurologic or neurodevelopmental conditions.\n\nAlthough the recent H1N2v cases are the 1st known to contain the 2009 H1N1 matrix gene, a few other H1N2v cases have been reported in recent years. One case was reported in a Minnesota child in December 2011. Another case was reported in 2007 in an 18-month-old Michigan child who had been in a swine barn. Both of those patients recovered. In 2002 the CDC reported that a total of 11 human H1N2 cases had been detected in Wisconsin, Texas, and Nevada the previous year.\n\n[Byline: Robert Roos]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[CDC has confirmed the isolation of H1N2v viruses in Minnesota from 3 people have close contact with pigs.

The virus genome consists of 6 gene segments of a seasonal influenza A(H3N2) virus (PB1, PB2, PA, NP, NA, M) and 2 gene segments of a seasonal A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (HA, NS).\n\nA general practitioner (GP) was consulted for a child aged 1 year and 7 months with influenza-like illness on [5 Mar 2018]. He had acute onset of illness on [2 Mar 2018] characterized by fever, malaise, sore throat, coughing, shortness of breath, rhinorrhea and diarrhea. No travel abroad was reported. The patient was not vaccinated against influenza, did not use influenza antivirals or any other medication, and had no underlying disease.\n\nThe specific GP participated in the sentinel influenza surveillance network. After obtaining permission from the parent accompanying the child, a nose and throat swab were collected for virus detection. Using real-time RT-PCR and MinION nanopore sequencing on [18 Mar 2018] it was confirmed that the patient was infected by a seasonal reassortant A(H1N2) influenza virus. The GP was consulted again on [8 Mar 2018] for the patient having otitis media for which antibiotics were prescribed, after which the patient fully recovered. Contact investigation revealed that the parents had symptoms of (predominantly) gastrointestinal infection in the 2 weeks preceding onset of disease in the index case. Extended contact investigation at the day care center attended by the child before disease onset, did not reveal any actual disease.\n\nEnhanced laboratory monitoring and subsequent typing of influenza samples in the city where the index lives have been put in place. As the reassortant virus genome contains a mixture of genes from currently circulating seasonal influenza viruses, no increase in virulence is expected. No mutations in the genome were observed which alter sensitivity to antiviral treatment. The genome sequence of A/Netherlands/10407/2018 was released in the GISAID EpiFlu database (Isolate_Id EPI_ISL_304183).\n\nReassortant A(H1N2) seasonal influenza viruses have been found before (reviewed in Komadina, et al. Emerg Infect Dis. 2014 Jan;20(1):6-12). Spreading of these viruses generally was limited, but in one instance continued for 3 seasons with a reassortant of former seasonal A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza virus. A reassortant of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) has only been described once before in India. In the Netherlands, the 2017-2018 influenza season is dominated by influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses but the Dutch National Influenza Center characterized around 600 influenza type A viruses, only one of which (the case reported here) was of the H1N2 subtype. There is thus no evidence for extensive spreading of the A(H1N2) virus, but laboratories should remain on alert.\n\nOn behalf of many contributors (see below)\nAdam Meijer\n\nA Meijer [1,5], C Swaan [1], M Voerknecht [2], E Jusic [1], S van den Brink [1], L Wijsman [1], B Voordouw [1,5], G Donker [3], J Sleven [4], M van Boven [1], M Haverkate [1], A Timen [1], J van Dissel [1], M Koopmans [5], T Bestebroer [5], R Fouchier [5]\n\n1 Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, the Netherlands;\n2 general practitioner participating in the NIVEL Primary Care Database sentinel surveillance coordinated by NIVEL Netherlands institute for health services research, Utrecht, the Netherlands;\n3 coordinator NIVEL Primary Care Database sentinel surveillance, NIVEL Netherlands institute for health services research, Utrecht, the Netherlands;\n4 Municipal Health Services 'Gooi en Vechtstreek', Bussum, the Netherlands;\n5 Department Viroscience, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n\n--\nDr Adam Meijer\nNational Institute for Public Health and the Environment\nBilthoven\nThe Netherlands\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 22 Mar 2018\nFrom: Adam Meijer <adam.meijer@rivm.nl> [edited]\n\nre: on GISRS Discussion Forum and Information Exchange\n\nAs discussed and agreed with the International Health Regulations regional contact point for the WHO regional office for Europe the naming of the reassortant virus that will be used in further communication is 'seasonal reassortant A(H1N2) influenza virus' further explained as consisting of HA and NS genes of human seasonal A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus and M, NA, NP, PA, PB1 and PB2 genes of human seasonal A(H3N2) influenza virus.\n\n--\nDr Adam Meijer\nNational Institute for Public Health and the Environment\nBilthoven\nThe Netherlands\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Meijer for his important contribution on the newly identified re-assortant 'seasonal reassortant A(H1N2) influenza virus' (influenza A/H1Pdm09 virus) during the current influenza season.\n\nNovel influenza viruses can arise among humans either by direct transmission from mammalian or avian sources or through genetic reassortment. The segmented nature of the influenza viral genome allows reassortment to occur in a host that is simultaneously infected with more than 2 subtypes of influenza A viruses. Although influenza viruses exhibit some host specificity, swine are susceptible to infection with viruses of avian and mammalian lineages, facilitated by the presence of receptors for both lineages in the respiratory tract. Swine can therefore serve as 'mixing vessels' for different lineages, providing an opportunity for novel reassortants to arise. The reassortant viruses may acquire mammalian adaption characteristics, thereby allowing infection of humans to occur [1].\n\nA(H1N2) viruses have been described among avian, swine, and human populations. Like A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses, A(H1N2) viruses have become established in swine herds in many regions. In contrast, A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 were the only type A viruses documented as circulating among humans as of 2009. Reassortant A(H1N2) seasonal influenza viruses have been reported previously [2].\n\nDirect cross-species transfer of swine A(H1N2) is rare and until recently was restricted to reports of single cases from the Philippines (2004) [3] and from Michigan and Minnesota in 2007 and 2011, respectively [4], and most recently from Brazil in 2017 [5]. Reassortant A(H1pdm09N2) has been detected only once in an isolated case in India [6]. Overall for the 2017-2018 influenza season in the Netherlands around 600 influenza type A viruses have been H and N subtyped, only one of which (the case reported here) was of the H1pdm09N2 subtype [GISRS Discussion Forum and Information Exchange].\n\nThe rise of H1N2 re-assortants containing genes from the H1N1pdm09 virus is a serious concern as the H1N1 Pdm09 virus is quite adapted to human-to-human transmission and presents an ideal background for spread of novel strains. There is thus no evidence for extensive spreading of the A(H1pdm09N2) influenza virus, but laboratories should remain on alert.\n\nReferences:\n1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1579108/\n2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3884707/\n3. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17429716/\n4.

The previous case was reported in Wisconsin in December 2011; 12 other H1N1v cases (without the pH1N1 M gene) have been reported since 2005, CDC reports show.\n\nThe Missouri case was found because of increased surveillance for H3N2v cases, the CDC said in its weekly flu update. The patient got sick after contact with pigs and has since recovered. The agency gave no further details about the case.\n\nThe CDC's report on the H1N1v case in Wisconsin in December 2011 said similar viruses had been found in US swine since 2010 and that the strain was susceptible to antiviral drugs.\n\nThe CDC said the total number of variant flu cases detected since July 2012 has now reached 309. That includes the 305 H3N2v cases, the Missouri H1N1v case, and 3 H1N2v cases that were recently reported in Minnesota. All 3 strains contain the pH1N1 M gene.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minnesota Department of Health reports that the number of H1N2v cases has increased to 4, as one case previously listed as probable has been confirmed. The CDC says that when state and CDC case counts disagree, the state numbers should be considered more accurate.\n\nThe 305 H3N2v cases, most of which involved people exposed to pigs at county and state fairs, were scattered across 10 states. New cases were reported this week in: Michigan, one case (6 total); Minnesota, 2 (4); Ohio, 4 (106); and Wisconsin, 2 (20). Indiana continues to lead the list with 138 cases.\n\nThe numbers of H3N2v-related hospitalizations and deaths stayed the same, at 16 and one, respectively.\n\nThe CDC said today [14 Sep 2012], as it has previously, that a few cases of likely human-to-human transmission of H3N2v have been identified but no ongoing human transmission.\n\nAside from the variant cases, flu remained at seasonably low levels in the United States last week, according to the CDC. The percentage of outpatient visits for flu-like illness stayed below the national baseline, and the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and flu was under the epidemic threshold. No flu-related pediatric deaths were reported.\n\nGlobally, flu activity was low or decreasing in most regions, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its biweekly flu update, covering the last 2 weeks of August 2012.\n\nMost countries in northern temperate regions have not started their seasonal flu reporting, but available data indicate that seasonal flu transmission has not begun in those areas, the WHO said.\n\nMost tropical countries reported low or decreasing flu trends. The exceptions are Nicaragua, which is finding mostly influenza B, and India and Thailand, which are both reporting pH1N1 and B, the WHO said.\n\nFlu activity declined in most temperate countries of the Southern Hemisphere, including Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Paraguay, and South Africa, the agency said. Argentina continues to report very low numbers of cases relative to previous seasons.\n\n[Byline: Robert Roos]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nKen Cokanasiga\n<kenc@spc.int>\nPacific Veterinary List\n\n[The number of H3N2v human cases continues to increase, going from 297 reported on 6 Sep 2012 to 305 in 5 states on 14 Sep 2012. The number of H3N2v human cases is unchanged. The virus involved in the Missouri H1N1v infection appears to be unique so far, with the acquisition of the M (matrix) gene from the pandemic 2009 H1N1 (pH1N1) virus. Fortunately so far, there is no evidence for sustained, ongoing human to human transmission with any of these variant viruses.\n\nThe count of human cases by state since August 2011 issued by the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-case-count.htm) shows 12 cases in 5 states in 2011 and 306 cases in 11 states this year (2012). - Mod.TY\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1hiS.]", "summary": "The count of human cases by state since August 2011 issued by the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-case-count.htm) shows 12 cases in 5 states in 2011 and 306 cases in 11 states this year (2012). The CDC said today [14 Sep 2012], as it has previously, that a few cases of likely human-to-human transmission of H3N2v have been identified but no ongoing human transmission. The number of H3N2v human cases continues to increase, going from 297 reported on 6 Sep 2012 to 305 in 5 states on 14 Sep 2012. A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nGlobally, flu activity was low or decreasing in most regions, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its biweekly flu update, covering the last 2 weeks of August 2012. \n\nMost countries in northern temperate regions have not started their seasonal flu reporting, but available data indicate that seasonal flu transmission has not begun in those areas, the WHO said. \n\nThe Missouri case was found because of increased surveillance for H3N2v cases, the CDC said in its weekly flu update. The number of swine-origin H3N2 (variant H3N2, or H3N2v) influenza cases in the United States has climbed by 9 in the past week, to 305, and another rare swine-origin variant, H1N1v, has cropped up in Missouri, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported today \n\nMeanwhile, the Minnesota Department of Health reports that the number of H1N2v cases has increased to 4, as one case previously listed as probable has been confirmed. That includes the 305 H3N2v cases, the Missouri H1N1v case, and 3 H1N2v cases that were recently reported in Minnesota. \n\nThe case in Missouri involves an H1N1v virus carrying the M (matrix) gene from the pandemic 2009 H1N1 (pH1N1) virus, marking only the 2nd finding of such an isolate, the CDC reported. The CDC said the total number of variant flu cases detected since July 2012 has now reached 309. The previous case was reported in Wisconsin in December 2011; 12 other H1N1v cases (without the pH1N1 M gene) have been reported since 2005, CDC reports show. New cases were reported this week in: Michigan, one case (6 total); Minnesota, 2 (4); Ohio, 4 (106); and Wisconsin, 2 (20).
