Compared to H5 and H7 viruses, of which many are of high pathogenicity in poultry (HPAIV), they are somewhat neglected. This is partially the outcome of LPAIV strains, such as H9N2, being -- in difference with HPAIV viruses -- pathogens which are not OIE notifiable, causing relatively few overt human infections though significant economic losses.\n\nIn many resource-limited regions surveillance is performed sporadically, or not at all. It is likely that H9N2 viruses are present, or endemic, in more countries, particularly in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia; Senegal seems to be a recent example. A map presenting the distribution of the virus in Eurasia and Africa, as of June 2019, is available in ref 1 below.\n\nH9N2 viruses are fairly regularly isolated from humans. The 1st reported human cases involved 2 children, in Hong Kong in 1999, who exhibited flu-like symptoms. Retrospectively, several H9N2 infections had occurred in mainland China during 1998. Subsequent human infections have been reported from Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Oman, now followed by India and Senegal.\n\nHuman H9N2 infections are generally mild and there has only been a single reported death due to the virus (a 57-year-old woman with underlying conditions, Sichuan, China, 2016; https://tinyurl.com/wj3cmqc). Human H9N2 cases are more often isolated during periods where other HPAI viruses are being surveyed for, such as H7N9 in China and H5N1 in Egypt and Bangladesh. As of June 2019, there have been a total of 59 laboratory-confirmed human H9N2 infections with over half of those being recorded since 2015 (see Table 2, Figure 2a in ref 1 below). The majority of those with confirmed infections were young children and the median age of infection was 4-years-old.\n\nRecent evidence, summarised in ref 1 below, suggests LPAI H9N2 could potentially have a major role in the emergence of the next influenza pandemic, either directly as an H9N2 subtype virus, or through the donation of internal genes to a pandemic virus.\n\nDue to the economic damage caused by enzootic H9N2, many countries including China, Israel, South Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and UAE have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry. The most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines.\n\nThe human case in Senegal, a country in which hitherto H9N2 in poultry has not been reported, is an important development and further information on the epidemiological situation of the case, specifically about outbreaks in poultry in the region, would be highly appreciated.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Presently, the H9N2 subtype AI virus has been widely spread in China and has established stable lineages in commercial chicken flocks with endemicity. Despite that the mortality caused by H9N2 generally not exceed 20 percent, it usually leads to respiratory and egg-drop symptom, as well as severe secondary infections, affecting poultry productivity. Therefore, at the current stage, vaccination is still one of the principal strategies to control H9N2 AI in China, apart from biosecurity measures (https://veterinaryresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13567-017-0453-2).\n\nIn 2018 there were 7 human cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) reported from China to WHO and 6 cases thus far in 2019. A total of 28 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) in China have been reported since December 2015 [WHO/WPRO].\n\nThe H9N2 viruses have shown sporadic transmission to humans and are donors of internal genes to other potentially pandemic sub-types such as A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 avian influenza viruses.\n\nAccording to the WHO Risk Assessment of human infection with avian influenza A virus (dated 24 Jun 2019; https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_24_06_2019.pdf): The overall public health risk from currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface has not changed, as further human infections with viruses of animal origin are expected, and the likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission of these viruses remains low. - Mod.UBA\n\nH9N2 influenza A viruses have become globally widespread in poultry over the last 2 decades and represent a genuine threat, both to the global poultry industry and also to humans, through their high rates of zoonotic infection and pandemic potential. Since they have an IVPI (intravenous pathogenicity index, in susceptible 6-week-old chickens) below 1.2, and are non-H5 and non-H7, according to OIE criteria they are not defined as 'avian influenza' and are not notifiable.\n\nH9N2 viruses are generally hyperendemic in affected countries and have been found in poultry in many new regions in recent years. Due to the economic damage caused by enzootic H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV), many countries including China, Israel, South Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and UAE have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry.\n\nThe most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines. Unlike human vaccines, H9N2 AIV vaccines are generally not as regularly assessed for their efficacy against antigenically drifted viruses and consequently are less often updated. Therefore, the virus may continue to infect and cause disease in vaccinated poultry with tentative evidence suggesting that suboptimal use of vaccination may be driving antigenic drift and/or clade replacement, and theoretically zoonotic potential and pathogenicity.\n\nA recent review (1), from which some of the above has been extracted, examines the current global spread of H9N2 avian influenza viruses as well as their host range, tropism, transmission routes, and the risk posed by these viruses to human health. The review includes a map presenting the phylogeographic range of poultry-adapted H9N2 lineages, such as BJ94, G1-W, G1-E, Y439, and their mixtures, as well as a table presenting data from the 48 countries in which the virus has been identified so far.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

The reason for notification was given as 'new strain of a listed disease in the country' and the causal agent, 'highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, serotype H9N2'. The outbreak was recorded on a farm with 16 822 susceptible '78 weeks old brown layers in deep litter' of which 4225 cases (deaths) were counted. The remaining 12 597 birds were, reportedly, killed and disposed of. The diagnosis was performed by the Accra Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) applying real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), found positive.\n\nThe OIE notification above was accompanied by Mod.CRD's commentary, including the following remark:\n'It is well known that LPAI H9N2 circulates in Africa. However, this would be the 1st time that the subtype H9N2 is characterized as a highly pathogenic strain. Further laboratory studies may be needed to fully characterize the virus. If it is indeed a highly pathogenic strain as reported, this would be quite alarming for both animal and public health.'\n\nThe reporting, by Ghana, of the case demonstrates transparency and deserves to be commended. It is relieving indeed to note that an alarming reassortment of the widespread H9N2 strain into high pathogenicity has not taken place.\n\nThe event highlights the need for continued vigilance, in Africa and elsewhere, as well as the importance of involving OIE reference laboratories in epidemiological investigations. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Dormaa, Brong-Ahafo, Ghana: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/33986.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail's posting 20180215.5628421 presented an immediate notification submitted by Ghana's chief veterinary officer on 14 Feb 2018, notifying an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza which had started on 3 Jan 2018 and was confirmed on 10 Jan 2018. \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< AVIAN INFLUENZA (58): GHANA (BRONG-AHAFO) POULTRY, HPAI H9N2 NOT, LPAI H9N2, OIE\n********************************************************************************\n The reason for notification was given as 'new strain of a listed disease in the country' and the causal agent, 'highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, serotype H9N2'.

In contrast to H5N1 AIVs, H9N2 AIVs are generally considered to have low pathogenicity in chickens, so eradicating H9N2 AIVs on farms is not a priority. During the last several decades, H9N2 AIVs have been circulating widely in the poultry population and have caused tremendous losses, especially in China [ref. 1]. H9N2 AIVs can occasionally transmit to humans [ref. 2-4]. In 2013 to 2016, 18 laboratory-confirmed human cases occurred in China. Additionally, H9N2 AIV donated its internal genes to the lethal H5N1 influenza virus in 1997 and the H7N9 and H10N8 influenza viruses in 2013. Sporadic human cases of AIV H9N2, such as the one in the above report, require detailed investigation into the possible transmission route of the virus, as there is no apparent history of contact with live poultry. - Mod.UBA\n\nReferences\n1.

However, this would be the 1st time that the subtype H9N2 is characterized as a highly pathogenic strain. Further laboratory studies may be needed to fully characterize the virus. If it is indeed a highly pathogenic strain as reported, this would be quite alarming for both animal and public health. In addition, also of concern about this report is the fact that the finding was reported to the OIE over one month after the strain was identified as highly pathogenic.\n\nTo date, naturally occurring highly pathogenic influenza A viruses that produce acute clinical disease in chickens, turkeys and other birds of economic importance have been associated only with the H5 and H7 subtypes. Most viruses of the H5 and H7 subtype isolated from birds have been of low pathogenicity for poultry. As there is the risk of a H5 or H7 virus of low pathogenicity (H5/H7 low pathogenicity avian influenza [LPAI]) becoming highly pathogenic by mutation, all H5/H7 LPAI viruses from poultry are notifiable to OIE. In addition, all high pathogenicity viruses from poultry and other birds, including wild birds, are notifiable to the OIE. http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.04_AI.pdf\n\nA Eurasian lineage of H9N2 (LPAI) viruses is currently widespread among poultry in some areas, and has become very diverse, with numerous reassortants, including some that share internal genes with H5N1 viruses. H9N2 viruses have been detected in wild birds including some terrestrial species. H9N2 viruses have been found occasionally in pigs, and might sometimes cause clinical signs in this species. They have also been detected in dogs, and by serology in cats, and infections can be reproduced experimentally in both dogs and cats, although virus replication may be limited. Serological evidence of infection was found in performing macaques in Bangladesh, and in wild plateau pikas in China. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/highly_pathogenic_avian_influenza-citations.pdf\n\nThe following comment is quoted from the article entitled 'Influenza A(H9N2) Virus, Burkina Faso' by Zecchin B, Minoungou G, Fusaro A, et al., published in Emerging Infectious Diseases. 2017;23(12):2118-2119. The full article is available at, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/12/17-1294_article\n\n'Identification of H9N2 subtype virus in West Africa, where highly pathogenic H5 strains of the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage (Gs/GD) have been widely circulating since the beginning of 2015, is a concern because of animal health implications, negative effects on local economies, and possible emergence of reassortant viruses with unknown biological properties.\n\nReassortment events between H9N2 and highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype viruses were reported in China in 2005 and 2016 and in Bangladesh in 2012. In December 2013, an H5N1 subtype virus that had an H9N2 subtype polymerase basic 2 gene was reported in a patient in Canada who had returned from China. Moreover, H5N6 subtype reassortant viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, which contain H9N2 subtype-like internal genes, were identified in China in 2015-2016.\n\nH5 strains belonging to clades 2.3.2.1c and 2.3.4.4 are currently circulating in West Africa. This finding, combined with detection of human-like receptor specificity and 2 mutations typical of human influenza viruses in the H9N2 subtype virus from Burkina Faso, might indicate emergence of a strain capable of infecting humans and warrants additional attention to the avian influenza situation in West Africa'.\n\nReaders may also be interested in the following article: 'Public health concerns of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 endemicity in Africa', by Fasanmi OG, Odetokun IA, Balogun FA, Fasina FO (2017), published in Veterinary World, 10(10): 1194-1204, available at http://www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.10/October-2017/7.pdf.- Mod CRD\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nBrong-Ahafo Region, Ghana: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2937]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Affected population: 78 weeks old brown layers in deep litter\n\nOutbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]\nSpecies / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost\nBirds / 25.12 / 25.12 / 100 / 100\n* Summary of outbreaks:\nTotal outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak 1: Dwen, Dormaa Ahenekro, Dormaa Municipal, Brong-Ahafo\n \n\nReaders may also be interested in the following article: 'Public health concerns of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 endemicity in Africa', by Fasanmi OG, Odetokun IA, Balogun FA, Fasina FO (2017), published in Veterinary World, 10(10): 1194-1204, available at http://www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.10/October-2017/7.pdf.- Mod CRD\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nBrong-Ahafo Region, Ghana: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2937] Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; quarantine; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses; by-products and waste; stamping out; disinfection; process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals\n AVIAN INFLUENZA (31): GHANA (BRONG-AHAFO) POULTRY, HPAI H9N2, NEW STRAIN, OIE\n*****************************************************************************\n The full article is available at, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/12/17-1294_article\n\n'Identification of H9N2 subtype virus in West Africa, where highly pathogenic H5 strains of the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage (Gs/GD) have been widely circulating since the beginning of 2015, is a concern because of animal health implications, negative effects on local economies, and possible emergence of reassortant viruses with unknown biological properties.

Avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in Egypt. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016 Mar [date cited]. DOI: 10.3201/eid2203.150593]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\n'In Egypt, avian influenza A subtype H5N1 and H9N2 viruses are enzootic in poultry. The control plan devised by veterinary authorities in Egypt to prevent infections in poultry focused mainly on vaccination and ultimately failed. Recently, widespread H5N1 infections in poultry and a substantial increase in the number of human cases of H5N1 infection were observed. We summarize surveillance data from 2009 through 2014 and show that avian influenza viruses are established in poultry in Egypt and are continuously evolving genetically and antigenically. We also discuss the epidemiology of human infection with avian influenza in Egypt and describe how the true burden of disease is underestimated. We discuss the failures of relying on vaccinating poultry as the sole intervention tool. We conclude by highlighting the key components that need to be included in a new strategy to control avian influenza infections in poultry and humans in Egypt.'\n\nHuman cases [H5N1]\n------------------\nThe paper states that 'During 2006-2015, the estimated number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in Egypt was 292, with a 34 per cent case fatality rate. The number of reported cases by year for 2006-2015 shows that, before the 2014-15 winter season, the annual number of cases never exceeded 40. However, in just 2 months, January and February 2015, a total of 88 cases were reported. The most recent cases occurred in persons who reported exposure to backyard poultry (70 per cent), bred domestic birds (26 per cent), slaughtered poultry (14 per cent), or were exposed to dead birds (4 per cent)...'\n\nExtent of avian influenza infection in Egypt\n--------------------------------------------\n'In Egypt, the number of reported human cases of avian influenza infection appears to be underestimated. An underestimation might result in an overestimation of the case-fatality rate, but it would certainly underestimate the extent of human infection with avian influenza viruses. Results from a controlled, serologic cohort study of persons in Egypt exposed and not exposed to poultry estimated the seroprevalence of antibodies against H5N1 (titers greater than 80) at 2 per cent. If this seroprevalence were to be extrapolated to the entire poultry-exposed population in Egypt, the true number of infections would amount to several hundred thousand. These figures are even more striking when it comes to human infection with H9N2 viruses. The seroprevalence of H9N2 antibodies detected in the same cohort study ranged from 5.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent, whereas just 1 case of H9N2 infection was reported...'\n\nProposed avian influenza control plan\n-------------------------------------\n'The avian influenza situation in Egypt is deteriorating, evident in the fact that H5N1 and H9N2 viruses are enzootic in poultry and that incidence of H5N1 and H9N2 infection is increasing. The problem is also evident in the sharp increase in human H5N1 cases and the detection of the 1st human H9N2 case. Thus, it is imperative that authorities in Egypt devise and implement an aggressive control plan to curb the spread of disease in human and animal populations. The control plan must include the following elements: 1) mapping of the unlicensed, small-scale poultry farms that have become abundant in rural areas; 2) increasing the biosecurity levels of these small farms by using inexpensive tools; 3) revamping veterinary and public health surveillance and conducting joint human-animal interface surveillance and risk-assessment exercises; 4) encouraging poultry owners to report outbreaks and providing them appropriate compensation; 5) intervening, when poultry outbreaks are reported, by culling infected poultry and setting monitoring zones around each focus point; 6) properly decontaminating infected farms; 7) encouraging the use of disinfectants in backyards where poultry are raised; 8) increasing awareness about the effects of avian influenza; 9) testing patients with suspected influenza for H5N1 and H9N2 virus; and 10) reevaluating the vaccination strategy, including that for H9N2 virus. If vaccination is to remain an important tool in the control plan, then the following aspects should be considered: 1) matching vaccine strains to currently circulating strains; 2) matching challenge strains to currently circulating strains; 3) maintaining high vaccination coverage; 4) ensuring vaccine efficacy not only in a laboratory setting but also in the field; and 5) evaluating vaccine efficacy on an annual basis.'\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n'Egypt is one of the few countries where H5N1 virus has become enzootic and is the only country with a high number of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry and cases among human. During the 2014-15 winter season, a sudden and substantial increase in human infection with H5N1 viruses was observed. There is no obvious or confirmed reason for this increase, but data indicate the following: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, and 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. However, our perspective was limited to the data available through our surveillance program, which might not be representative of the epizootiology of avian influenza virus in Egypt. Regardless of the causes of the recent increase in human H5N1 cases, this situation evolved because of the ineffective control strategy that was implemented. Controlling the situation requires a One Health approach, but certainly the greater share of responsibility now lies with the veterinary side.'\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The full publication, including figures, can be viewed at the URL above. This well written and important overview of avian influenza A(H5N1 and H7N9) in Egypt raises serious concern over the increasing prevalence of infection in poultry and humans, especially considering the probable underreporting discussed in the paper. The authors recommend the steps they feel need to be taken to address this increasing public health threat, and the problems with the vaccination program. Recommended reading! - Mod.LK\n\nThe following data, extracted (slightly edited) from the paper's chapter 'Avian influenza in poultry in Egypt', may be of interest:\n\nIn Egypt, a systematic surveillance program for avian influenza viruses has been in place since 2009. Commercial and semicommercial farms, abattoirs, backyard flocks, and live bird markets located in different governorates are sampled on a monthly basis regardless of the presence of disease symptoms in poultry. In each governorate, the same locations are continuously sampled by a poultry veterinarian, who collects one swab sample per bird; depending on the size of the poultry population, as many as 5 birds are sampled per flock. Birds are not randomly selected, and samples also are collected from sick or dead birds found onsite. Samples are mostly from chickens, but ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons, and quails also are sampled. This program enabled detection of genetic and antigenic changes in H5N1 viruses in Egypt. It provided important epizootiologic data and described the poultry sectors acting as reservoirs of H5N1 viruses. The rate of avian influenza infection during August 2009-July 2010 was 5 per cent, exclusively attributable to H5N1 infection, and was more concentrated in the commercial production sector. From August 2010 through January 2013, the positivity rate increased to 10 per cent, and the infection was detected in all poultry production sectors. In 2011, H9N2 viruses emerged and were detected by this program and other surveillance activities in Egypt. The monthly positivity rate of avian influenza infection from August 2009 through December 2014 is shown graphically (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f1) with sharp increases during the colder months (November through March). Emergence of H9N2 virus in poultry and an increase in human H5N1 cases are indicated. After the detection of H9N2 virus in 2011 the positivity rate during colder months was higher than that in the period when H5N1 was the only virus infecting poultry, exceeding 20 per cent in some months. Furthermore, co-infection with H5N1 and H9N2 viruses was frequently detected. The same seasonal pattern was seen with both strains during the period February 2013-December 2014 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f2).\n\nAmong the authors' conclusions: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. 'However, our perspective was limited to the data available through our surveillance program, which might not be representative of the epizootiology of avian influenza virus in Egypt.

There is no obvious or confirmed reason for this increase, but data indicate the following: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, and 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing.

' If vaccination is to remain an important tool in the control plan, then the following aspects should be considered: 1) matching vaccine strains to currently circulating strains; 2) matching challenge strains to currently circulating strains; 3) maintaining high vaccination coverage; 4) ensuring vaccine efficacy not only in a laboratory setting but also in the field; and 5) evaluating vaccine efficacy on an annual basis.'\n\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n The avian influenza situation in Egypt is deteriorating, evident in the fact that H5N1 and H9N2 viruses are enzootic in poultry and that incidence of H5N1 and H9N2 infection is increasing. -----------\n'Egypt is one of the few countries where H5N1 virus has become enzootic and is the only country with a high number of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry and cases among human. We summarize surveillance data from 2009 through 2014 and show that avian influenza viruses are established in poultry in Egypt and are continuously evolving genetically and antigenically.

This well written and important overview of avian influenza A(H5N1 and H7N9) in Egypt raises serious concern over the increasing prevalence of infection in poultry and humans, especially considering the probable underreporting discussed in the paper. An underestimation might result in an overestimation of the case-fatality rate, but it would certainly underestimate the extent of human infection with avian influenza viruses. The rate of avian influenza infection during August 2009-July 2010 was 5 per cent, exclusively attributable to H5N1 infection, and was more concentrated in the commercial production sector. Recently, widespread H5N1 infections in poultry and a substantial increase in the number of human cases of H5N1 infection were observed. AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (14): EGYPT A(H5N1, H9N2) CDC/EID\n********************************************************\n In Egypt, the number of reported human cases of avian influenza infection appears to be underestimated. After the detection of H9N2 virus in 2011 the positivity rate during colder months was higher than that in the period when H5N1 was the only virus infecting poultry, exceeding 20 per cent in some months. We conclude by highlighting the key components that need to be included in a new strategy to control avian influenza infections in poultry and humans in Egypt.'

Further human infections with viruses of animal origin are expected.\n- IHR compliance: all human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are required to be reported under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). This includes any animal and non-circulating seasonal influenza viruses. Information from these notifications is critical to inform risk assessments for influenza at the human-animal interface.\n\nAvian influenza A(H5) viruses\n-----------------------------\nCurrent situation: since the last update on 15 Jun 2017, no new laboratory-confirmed human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection were reported to WHO. Since 2003, a total of 859 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, including 453 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 16 countries.\nInfluenza A(H5) subtype viruses have the potential to cause disease in humans and thus far, no human cases, other than those with influenza A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses, have been reported to WHO. According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe and Asia.\n\nAvian influenza A(H7N9) viruses\n-------------------------------\nCurrent situation: during this reporting period, 24 laboratory-confirmed human cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection were reported to WHO from China. Cases were reported with likely exposure in Yunnan province for the 1st time.\n\nAs of 25 Jul 2017, a total of 1557 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, including at least 605 deaths, have been reported to WHO. The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses and the geographical distribution of human cases in the 5th epidemic wave (that is, onset since 1 Oct 2016) have been greater than in any earlier wave. This suggests that the virus has spread, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sectors are crucial. However, the number of reported confirmed cases has continued to decline over the past few weeks with only one case reported thus far with an onset of illness after 23 Jun 2017.\n\nAccording to reports received by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on surveillance activities for avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in China, positives among virological samples continue to be detected in poultry from live bird markets, commercial, and backyard farms. The agricultural authorities in China have also announced plans to commence vaccination of domestic poultry nation-wide against infection with avian influenza A(H7) viruses beginning in September 2017.\n\nRisk assessment\n---------------\n1. What is the likelihood that additional human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses will occur? Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of influenza A(H7N9) in other provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected.\n\n2. What is the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses? Even though small clusters of cases have been reported, including those involving healthcare workers, currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low.\n\n3. What is the risk of international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus by travellers? Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.\n\nAvian influenza A(H9N2) viruses\n-------------------------------\nCurrent situation: on 30 Jun 2017, one case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus was reported to WHO from China in a 2-month old female child who lives in Guangdong province, China. She had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI) on 28 Apr 2017. The patient was hospitalized on 9 Jun 2017. A sample collected from the patient on 13 Jun 2017 as part of ILI surveillance was laboratory-confirmed as positive for A(H9N2) influenza virus on 16 Jun 2017. The patient was exposed to backyard poultry prior to illness. The case has fully recovered.\n\nRisk assessment\n---------------\n1. What is the likelihood that additional human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses will occur? Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.\n\n2. What is the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses? No case clusters have been reported. Currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low.\n\n3. What is the risk of international spread of avian influenza A(H9N2) virus by travellers? Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.\n\nOverall risk management recommendations\n---------------------------------------\n- WHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface. For recommendations on safe trade in animals from countries affected by these influenza viruses, refer to OIE guidance.\n- WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n- Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighbouring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. As the extent of virus circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiological and virological surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should remain high.\n- All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.\n- It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories and reported according to international standards. Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop candidate vaccine viruses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Important links shared in the report:\nThe complete document can be accessed at the URL above:\n- WHO human-animal interface web page\nhttp://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/en/\n- Cumulative number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) reported to WHO http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/\n- Avian influenza A(H7N9) information\nhttp://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/index.html\n- WHO avian influenza food safety issues\nhttp://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/zoonose/avian/en/\nWorld Organisation of Animal Health (OIE) webpage: web portal on avian influenza\nhttp://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/web-portal-on-avian-influenza/\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) webpage: Avian influenza\nhttp://www.fao.org/avianflu/en/index.html\nOFFLU (OIE-FAO global network of expertise on animal influenza)\nhttp://www.offlu.net\n\nAccording to this report, human cases of avian influenza A/H7N9 as well as A/H9N2 have been reported in China .

The case had close contact with poultry, including sick quail, prior to her onset of illness.\n\nAvian influenza A(H9N2) viruses are known to be circulating in poultry populations in Bangladesh.\n\nFurther human cases and small clusters could occur as this virus is circulating in poultry populations across Asia and the Middle East. This virus does not seem to transmit easily between humans and tends to result in mild clinical disease; therefore, the current likelihood of community-level spread and public health impact of this virus are considered to be low.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Avian influenza subtype H9N2 is endemic in many bird species in Asia and the Middle East and has contributed to the genesis of H5N1, H7N9 and H10N8, which are potential pandemic threats. H9N2 viruses that have spread to Bangladesh have acquired multiple gene segments from highly pathogenic (HP) H7N3 viruses that are presumably in Pakistan and currently co-circulate with HP H5N1.\n\nH9N2 viruses rapidly evolve and acquire mutations that can facilitate their ability to replicate in mammalian hosts. Some H9N2 isolates have crossed to pigs and humans. Additionally, in recent years, these H9N2 viruses have enabled other subtypes to evolve and infect humans by donating their internal genes. The 1st human H9N2 infection in Bangladesh was identified in 2011, and the virus subtype was antigenically and molecularly closely related to the then-circulating avian H9N2 viruses.\n\nThe 2011 Bangladeshi H9N2 viruses emerged from multiple reassortment events that occurred over time between multiple H9N2 sublineages originating from the prototypical G1 lineage and from HP- H7N3 isolated from Pakistan. The continued evolution of these H9N2 viruses, with the steady accumulation of mutations in their genomes, has led to the increasing differentiation of Bangladeshi H9N2 viruses from other H9N2 lineages circulating in neighboring countries, leading to the generation of a new H9N2 sublineage in chicken and quail hosts in Bangladesh.\n\nThere have been only a limited number of human infections with AI H9N2, including a handful in China between 1998 and 1999, Hong Kong in 1999 (2 cases), 2003 (1 case), and 2007 (1 case), and December of 2013. In late 2014, 2 mild cases were reported out of China. In 2015, Egypt has reported 3 cases. Because of the mild nature of the disease and the reporting problems in some of the countries where the virus has been detected, incidence of human infection is likely under-reported.\n\nIn the absence of intervention, the generation of novel H9N2 clades with varying host range and pathogenicity is unavoidable and can potentially become a major public health concern. Thus, there is a need for continual monitoring and surveillance of H9N2 viruses in Bangladesh to identify the evolution and incremental adaptation of viruses to humans to be better prepared for potential future outbreaks.\n\nSources:\n- K Shanmuganatham, MM Feeroz, L Jones-Engel, et al.

During the 1990s, the virus reportedly circulated in turkeys in USA and among domestic poultry populations in several Asian and European countries, such as domestic ducks, chickens and turkeys in Germany, chickens in Italy, pheasants in Ireland, and chickens in Korea. More recently, it caused widespread outbreaks in commercial chickens in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, China, Korea, UAE, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq and Egypt. In several of these countries, vaccine has been deployed to bring the disease under control. Nevertheless, H9N2 infections have become endemic in commercial poultry in a significant number of countries and is now considered to have a near global, albeit sporadic distribution among poultry. Influenza A(H9N2) has also been identified in wild birds, domestic mammals, and, occasionally, in humans.\n\nZoonotic transmission of influenza A(H9N2) was not considered a concern until 1998-1999, when the virus was 1st isolated from pig samples; seropositive human cases were initially detected in Guangdong Province, China; and the virus was isolated from hospitalized patients in Hong Kong. More recently, human cases were reported also from Bangladesh and Egypt. Serological evidence of human infection has been reported in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and parts of North America. A map presenting the reported global distribution for influenza A(H9N2) in humans and animals from 1997 to 2013, is available at http://tinyurl.com/yc54uxws (derived from the review paper, Ref 1). In the said map, countries that detected influenza A(H9N2) in poultry (until 2013) have an orange background. Species-specific symbols were assigned to each country. When a human or animal was found to be seropositive for influenza A(H9N2), the species was colored green; if a virological sample from humans or animals tested positive, the species was colored red. Egypt, which reported its 1st human case in 2015, was obviously not signed in the (older) map.\n\nThe following comment of Mod.UBA, included in posting 20160901.4451359, is applicable: 'The crucial role of H9N2 viruses at the animal-human interface is due to the wide host range, adaptation to both poultry and mammals, and extensive gene reassortment. In China, which is regarded as an epicenter of avian influenza viruses, the H9N2 virus has been detected in multiple avian species, including chicken, duck, quail, pheasant, partridge, pigeon, silky chicken, chukar, and egret'.\n\nAs reminded in the current paper, which becomes ProMED-mail's first report on H9N2 in Burkina Faso, 3 main genetic lineages have been described among the Eurasian H9N2 subtype viruses: G1, Y280, and Y439 (Korean) lineage. In the past decade, the G1 lineage has spread mostly in gallinaceous birds across Asia, the Middle East, and eventually North Africa, where H9N2 outbreaks were reported in Libya (2006 and 2013), Tunisia (2010-2012), Egypt (2011-present) and Morocco (2016). The authors further indicate that 'H5 strains belonging to clades 2.3.2.1c and 2.3.4.4 are currently circulating in West Africa. This finding, combined with detection of human-like receptor specificity and 2 mutations typical of human influenza viruses in the H9N2 subtype virus from Burkina Faso, might indicate emergence of a strain capable of infecting humans and warrants additional attention to the avian influenza situation in West Africa. Furthermore, identification of H9N2 subtype viruses in Morocco and Burkina Faso in chickens suggests that commercial poultry trade between North and West Africa might have played a key role in spread of the virus'.\n\nThe samples from Burkina Faso, collected in Jan 2017 from a layer farm that was experiencing decreased egg production and respiratory signs, were submitted to the OIE/FAO Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (Legnaro, Padova, Italy).

The newly confirmed infection from Zhejiang province, which last reported a case on 12 Feb 2014, involves a 2-year-old girl who is hospitalized with a mild illness, according to a provincial health department statement translated and posted by FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board. Zhejiang province has the most H7N9 cases of any in China and has played a pivotal role in both outbreak waves. The other new case involves a 65-year-old woman from Guangdong province who is hospitalized in critical condition, according to an official statement translated by FluTrackers.\n\nThe new cases lift the 2-wave H7N9 outbreak total to 373, with 114 as the unofficial number of deaths. So far 237 illnesses have been detected in the outbreak's 2nd wave, which began in October, compared with 136 in the 1st wave last spring.\n\nRisk assessment updates\n-----------------------\nIn other developments, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) addressed the H7N9 threat in separate risk assessments.\n\nThe ECDC's assessment came in a broader risk assessment of human avian influenza A infection in China, dated 24 Feb 2014. The PHAC posted its updated H7N9 risk assessment today [26 Feb 2014]. The ECDC assessment summarized H7N9 events as of 18 Feb 2014, and since then, cases have continued to taper off. However, it said the brisk pace of human infections that marked the 2nd wave might point to a larger wild or domestic bird reservoir, an increase in the number of exposed people, increased transmissibility of the virus, a seasonal pattern, or a combination of factors.\n\nMeanwhile, the PHAC risk assessment update covers H7N9 developments in China through yesterday [25 Feb 2014]. The agency noted that poultry and environmental samples have been found in all areas that reported human cases, except for Jilin province and Beijing. The PHAC noted that, in the 2nd wave, cases appear to be less skewed toward older adults, though more infections continue to be detected in males. 7 pediatric cases were reported in January [2014], 3 of which involved mild illnesses, and so far no unusual clinical presentations have been reported, the agency said.\n\nSo far, the virus doesn't spread easily among people, though limited person-to-person transmission may occur when there is close contact, the update noted. The H7N9 virus bears close watching, though, because less severe cases have been seen in influenza-like illness surveillance, and the PHAC said it expects more cases to be reported as the flu season progresses.\n\nExperts eye H9N2 control\n------------------------\nIn scientific developments, researchers from China today [26 Feb 2014] suggested that H9N2 avian flu appears to be an 'incubator' for flu viruses of wild bird origin and that culling poultry infected with H9N2 might be an effective strategy for curbing the infections in humans. The team published its analysis online in The Lancet. They wrote that H7N9, plus H10N8 -- another novel avian flu virus that recently sickened 3 people, 2 fatally in China's Jiangxi province -- have a similar genetic lineage, which includes internal genes from H9N2 viruses in poultry. Reassortment between poultry H9N2 viruses and viruses from wild birds could trigger adaptation to domestic hosts, they observed. 'Poultry, especially in live markets, would have a pivotal role during the emergence of a novel influenza virus of avian origin,' the group wrote.\n\nSince many avian flu viruses in poultry can infect people, it's impossible to predict the next one that will cause an outbreak in humans, the authors said, so focusing on H9N2 control might allow officials to prevent the next event. They called on health officials to shutter live-poultry markets or periodically disinfect the establishments in China and other countries that have live-poultry markets.\n\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Our thanks to Mary Marshall.

H9N2 influenza strains have been associated occasionally with illness in children aged 9 months to 5 years in Hong Kong, with the latest occurring in December 2009. H9N2 infections in children appear to result in uncomplicated influenza-like illness, and are not associated with a known source. Patients recover, and additional cases do not occur (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/avian-flu-humans.htm).\n\nA 2013 publication by Blair and colleagues reported antibody to H9N2 in 3 percent of a study cohort in Cambodia. Exposure to poultry was not significantly associated with seropositivity. The investigators concluded, 'Although the role of cross-reactive antibodies from human seasonal influenza viruses cannot be completely excluded, our study data suggest that a number of participants may have been previously infected with the avian-like A/Hong Kong/1073/1999(H9N2) virus, likely due to as yet unidentified environmental exposures. This highlights the need for further work to elucidate the prevalence of H9N2 influenza virus infections in humans' (Blair PJ, Putnam SD, Krueger WS. Evidence for avian H9N2 influenza virus infections among rural villagers in Cambodia. J Infect Public Health. 2013 Apr;6(2):69-79. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034113000026).\n\nA later report in 2014 in rural Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia, found 9 of 21 participants who were found to have antibody to avian influenza, had H9N2 antibody over 2 years. The study cohort consisted of 800 adults (Gray GC Krueger WS, Chum C. Little evidence of subclinical avian influenza virus infections among rural villagers in Cambodia. PLoS One. 2014 May 12;9(5):e97097. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819948).\n\nIn contrast with the lack of contact transmission reported following identification of individuals infected with H9N2, D Perez and colleagues at the University of Maryland demonstrated in 2008 that some currently circulating avian H9N2 viruses can transmit to naive ferrets placed in direct contact with infected ferrets. However, aerosol transmission was not observed, a key factor in potentially pandemic strains. These scientists showed that a single amino acid residue (Leu226) at the receptor-binding site of the hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein plays a major role in the ability of these viruses to transmit. They also found that an avian-human H9N2 reassortant virus increases virulence, pathology and replication in ferrets. These results suggest that the establishment and prevalence of H9N2 viruses in poultry could pose a significant threat for humans ('Pandemic Potential Of H9N2 Avian Influenza Viruses.' ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 14 August 2008. (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080812213818.htm).\n\nBecause of its potential to evolve and possibly become more transmissible to humans, H9N2 is yet another avian flu strain which poses a public health threat.\n\nThe patient in this report also was infected with influenza B.

The case was a 3-year-old male. Avian influenza was suspected on 16 Jan 2015. Samples tested at Aswan subnational laboratory and subsequently the reference laboratory (NAMRU3) were positive for H9N2. Investigations revealed that the case had a history of contact with apparently healthy backyard poultry. H9N2 positive poultry have been detected in Egypt since 2011, yet this is the 1st confirmed human case.\n\nAlthough ubiquitous in Asian poultry, and endemic in Egyptian poultry as well, H9N2 has only rarely been reported in humans. It has been reported a handful of times, including in Hong Kong in 1999 (2 cases), 2003 (1 case), and 2007 (1 case), and most recently in December of 2013 (see http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2013/12/hong-kong-isolation-treatment-of-h9n2.html).\n\nSeveral additional human H9N2 virus infections were reported from China in 1998-99, and all known cases were mild [in children aged 9 months to 5 years]. More recently, in 2011 Bangladesh agreed to share the virus H9N2 with the US (CDC) for vaccine production, after detecting a case there.\n\nSince the virus is most common in areas where testing and surveillance are less than optimal, we really don't know how many people end up infected by it. Most cases are mild, and would be indistinguishable from ordinary flu.\n\nAlthough viewed as having at least some 'pandemic potential', perhaps more importantly H9N2 appears to play a central role in the evolution of other HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] viruses, including H5N1, H7N9, H5N6, and H10N8, all of which share several important features:\n1. They all first appear to emanate from mainland China\n2. They all appear to have come about through viral reassortment in poultry\n3. While their HA and NA genes differ -- they all carry the internal genes from the avian H9N2 virus\n\nThe avian H9N2 virus -- unlike the H5 and H7 avian viruses -- is not considered a 'reportable' disease by the OIE since it is viewed as a relatively stable LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza), not prone to evolving into a more dangerous HPAI form.\n\n[Byline: Mike Coston]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is thought to be the 1st human case of H9N2 in Egypt.\n\nH9N2 influenza viruses of domestic ducks have become established in the domestic poultry of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

'The epidemiological investigations, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures and health education against avian influenza are all ongoing,' a spokesman for the DH said. The patient's home contact in Shenzhen [Guangdong province] has remained asymptomatic.\n\nThe 51 health-care workers (HCWs) of North District Hospital (NDH) and the ambulance service remain under medical surveillance. Among them, an HCW of NDH presented with productive cough and sore throat and the respiratory specimen tested negative for the influenza A virus upon testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch (PHLSB). The officer who handled the patient upon his entry at Lo Wu Border Control Point is also asymptomatic. He has been put under medical surveillance. So far, there are no newly located contacts.\n\nAs the patient was staying in Shenzhen for the whole incubation period, the case is classified as an imported one. The CHP has passed investigation findings to the health authority of Guangdong [province] for follow-up. 'Upon analysis by the PHLSB, the genes of the virus were determined to be of avian origin. They do not show significant differences from avian influenza viruses detected in Hong Kong and the Mainland in recent years.

'We are now investigating a confirmed human case of influenza A H9N2, affecting a man aged 86,' Leung Ting-hung, controller of the city's Centre for Health Protection, told reporters. H9N2 is an avian flu subtype that mainly affects ducks and chickens but can also pass to humans, causing mild symptoms. Under Hong Kong law cases of such infection must be made public, according to Leung.\n\nSince 1999 Hong Kong has reported 7 such cases with the last one reported in 2009, Leung said. The man, who lives in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen [Guangdong province] bordering Hong Kong, was diagnosed with the disease after returning to Hong Kong on Saturday [28 Dec 2013]. He is now in stable condition in an isolation ward. 'As the temperature is cooler in recent weeks, we expect there may be other cases of avian influenza being detected,' Leung said.\n\nOn Thursday [26 Dec 2013] the city reported the 1st death from the more serious H7N9 strain of bird flu. The male victim had returned from Shenzhen, as had a woman who contracted Hong Kong's 1st reported case of H7N9. She is still in hospital in stable condition.

Rare and sporadic human cases have been reported and are generally mild respiratory tract infections. The public should avoid contact with poultry and other birds, including chickens, ducks and sparrows,' the spokesman explained. Influenza A(H9) is a local statutorily notifiable infectious disease. Two local cases were reported in 1999. One local case was respectively filed each in 2003 and 2007. An imported case was recorded in 2008 while an imported case and one with the source of infection unclassified were filed in 2009. All are mild infections and the patients have recovered. No deaths have been recorded so far.\n\nLocally, enhanced surveillance over suspected cases in public and private hospitals is under way.\n\nAs the patient was staying in Shenzhen for the whole incubation period, the CHP will inform the health authority of Guangdong of the case for necessary investigation and follow-up action.\n\nThe case will also be notified to the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Health and Family Planning Commission, and the health authority of Macau.

Local surveillance activities will be modified according to the WHO's recommendations,' the spokesman said.\n\n'All BCPs have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation,' the spokesman added.\n\n'We have enhanced publicity and health education against avian influenza.

Incidence of officially reported human cases by month, based on onset date as of 15 Mar 2016\n\nH7N9 background\n---------------\nOn 31 Mar 2013, the authorities of the People's Republic of China reported the 1st human cases of infection with the novel avian influenza A(H7N9) to the World Health Organization in line with the International Health Regulations of 2007.\n\nThe disease situation in humans continues to evolve, with new cases reported regularly by the Chinese authorities. Cases have been confined to China with the exception of tourists testing positive in other countries but nevertheless linked to China as the place of exposure.\n\nHuman H7N9 infections follow a seasonal pattern, peaking in the winter months with most cases observed between October and March and sporadic cases during the summer.\n\nHuman infection\n---------------\nThe strain of influenza A(H7N9) virus that emerged in 2013 is able to infect humans and cause severe disease. There had been no previous reports of infection of humans with viruses of the H7N9 subtype prior to this time. Information on human infection with influenza A(H7N9) is available from WHO.\n\nReports suggest most human cases had direct or indirect contact with poultry prior to the onset of disease. Case control studies suggest contact with poultry or a visit to a live poultry market in the 2 weeks prior to disease inset was a significant risk factor. In a number of cases where testing of poultry or environmental samples from markets associated with human cases was performed, H7N9 virus has been detected.\n\nMore specifically, cases have been reported in humans who:\n- visited live bird market;\n- slaughtered poultry or pigeons;\n- transported poultry;\n- brought live poultry into their home.\n\nWHO reports that there is no evidence suggesting sustained human-to-human transmission.\n\nInfluenza A(H7N9) virus appears to infect humans more easily than H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza based on its genetic properties for adaptation to mammalian cells.\n\nAround 38 percent of reported human infections have had a fatal outcome. Reports to the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest that 80 percent of human cases have had direct or indirect contact with live poultry prior to the onset of disease, including LBM visits, transportation, slaughtering and handling of poultry.\n\nThis is the 1st time that a low pathogenic (LPAI) influenza A virus of the H7N9 subtype has been identified in humans, and only subsequently in domestic poultry (chickens, domestic pigeons and a few ducks) through follow-up virological surveillance in live bird markets (LBMs) linked to human cases. Extensive poultry surveillance in neighbouring countries or those with poultry trade links to China has not detected the virus so far.\n\nOrigin of H7N9\n--------------\nInfluenza A(H7N9) evolved through several reassortment events putatively from early 2012 onwards.\n\nThe 4 parental viruses have been previously detected in wild birds (H7 virus and N9 viruses) and chickens (2 different H9N2 viruses) in Asia.\n\nThe H7N9 virus was 1st detected in March 2013 in 2 human cases in China. Since then, the virus continues to antigenetically evolve and to undergo reassortment with locally circulating H9N2 viruses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Avian influenza report\nDate: Tue 15 Mar 2016 [6-12 Mar 2016]\nSource: Centre for Health Protection [edited]\nhttp://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/2016_avian_influenza_report_vol12_wk11.pdf\n\n\nAvian Influenza Report, Volume 12, Number 11\n--------------------------------------------\nReporting period: 6-12 Mar 2016 (Week 11)\n(Published on 15 Mar 2016)\n\nSummary\n-------\n1. Since the previous issue of Avian Influenza Report (AIR), there were 3 new human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) reported by health authorities in Mainland China, including 1 case in Guangdong, 1 case in Shanghai which was imported from Anhui, and 1 case in Hubei which was imported from a neighboring province. Since March 2013 (as of 14 Mar 2016), there were a total of 731 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) reported globally. Since October 2015 (as of 14 Mar 2016), 53 cases have been recorded in Mainland China.\n\n2. Since the previous issue of AIR, there were no new human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6). Since 2014 (as of 14 Mar 2016), 9 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) were reported to World Health Organization (WHO) and all occurred in the Mainland China.\n\n3. There were no new human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) reported by WHO. From 2011 to 2015, 32 to 145 confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) were reported to WHO annually (according to onset date).\n\nThis week's highlights\n----------------------\n(Sources: WHO, National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), Mainland health authorities, Centre for Health Protection (CHP) and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE))\n\nTable 1.

Date of illness onset is unknown as the patient was hospitalized on 9 Feb 2016 with a history of recurrent productive cough with fatigue and shortness of breath during the past year. The patient has chronic underlying conditions. On 16 Feb 2016, a sample from this patient tested positive for A(H9N2) virus. The patient remains hospitalized and epidemiological investigations including contact monitoring are ongoing.\n\nA total of 28 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses, none fatal, have been detected globally. In most human cases, the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nMost human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[H9N2 is the most common subtype of influenza virus in chickens in China. It also causes a great economic loss for the poultry industry, even under the long-term vaccination programs. Recent human infections with avian in\ufb02uenza virus revealed that H9N2 is the gene donor for H7N9 and H10N8 viruses that are infecting humans too. The crucial role of H9N2 viruses at the animal-human interface is due to the wide host range, adaptation to both poultry and mammals and extensive gene reassortment. In China, which is regarded as an epicenter of avian influenza viruses, the H9N2 virus has been detected in multiple avian species, including chicken, duck, quail, pheasant, partridge, pigeon, silky chicken, chukar and egret.\n\nEpidemiological and genetic studies revealed that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the H9N2 influenza viruses could be divided into Eurasian avian and American avian lineages. The virus can be transmitted by air droplet, dust, feed, or water between birds and from chickens to humans.\n\nMaps of China can be found at http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155. - Mod.LK]\n\n[The zoonotic H7N9 virus strain, causing human infections in China, circulates mostly in live poultry markets. This virus if of low pathogenicity in poultry (LPAI H7N9): the disease symptoms in birds are slight or absent, the birds being the reservoir of the virus without becoming sick, their being infected discovered only by tests applied to apparently healthy animals. China's Ministry of Agriculture publishes monthly reports of the serological and virological systematic surveillance activities and their respective results. During Feb 2016 (most recent available report), sampling was applied in 3412 households in 19 of China's provinces. The total number of samples tested serologically for H7 was 50 129. The only province where seropositive samples were found was Henan, where 5 out of 2356 samples (0.21 percent) were found seropositive. The pathogen H7N9 was detected in 2 samples from Chickens, namely in the provinces Guangdong (one sample out of 14 976, open market), and in Zhejiang (one sample out of 301).

[The H9N2 virus belongs to a\ndifferent serotype of avian influenza A virus and\nshould not be described as a strain of H5N1\nvirus.

The patients were\nchildren who all recovered, he said. The recent\ncase returned home after spending 5 days in the\nhospital, but the child was put into isolation\nafter her samples tested positive for H9N2, said\nTsang, adding that the case was confirmed Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].\nOfficials were taking more samples from the\nmarket and family members, he said.
