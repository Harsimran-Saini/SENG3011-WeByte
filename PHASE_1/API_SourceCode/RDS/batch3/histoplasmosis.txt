The tunnels, which allow access for inspection and maintenance of the dam, were home to large colonies of bats and had not been cleaned in decades, Paige A.

However, Armstrong and colleagues said previous cases and outbreaks may simply have gone unnoticed.\n\n'These were likely not the 1st cases of histoplasmosis in the Dominican Republic,' Armstrong told Infectious Disease News. 'Identifying cases ... can be challenging, usually requiring special diagnostic methods.'\n\nThe investigators said clinicians in the Dominican Republic were largely unfamiliar with histoplasmosis before the outbreak and no laboratory had the capacity to definitively diagnose it. But Armstrong said investigators believe the outbreak increased awareness among health care providers about the disease.

'Efforts are ongoing to expand education and diagnostic capacity for histoplasmosis in the country.'\n\n_H. capsulatum_ live in the environment, particularly in soil containing large amounts of bird or bat droppings, according to the CDC. Most people who breathe in the spores never have symptoms. Armstrong and colleagues said delays in recognition and treatment in the 2015 outbreak likely contributed to an unusually high proportion of hospitalizations and deaths among the tunnel workers.\n\nHealth officials in the Dominican Republic asked the CDC on Sept. 16, 2015, to help determine what caused an outbreak of an unknown severe febrile illness. Upon arriving, investigators -- including Armstrong, then an officer in the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service -- looked at company payrolls to find workers who had been in the tunnels and reviewed records from the hospitals where they were treated. During their investigation, they interviewed workers who were still living and the immediate family members of those who had died.\n\nThey said patients were initially treated for leptospirosis, a bacterial disease endemic to the region, but their infections did not respond to penicillin. Physicians notified local health officials about the illnesses and the patients' common exposure to tunnel work.\n\n[Reference:\n1. Armstrong PA, Beard JD, Bonilla L, et al.

An outbreak of an unknown severe febrile illness occurred among tunnel workers in the Dominican Republic (DR), and resulted in several deaths. We conducted an investigation to confirm etiology and recommend control measures.\n\nMethods\n-------\n'A case was defined as fever and greater than or equal to 2 symptoms consistent with histoplasmosis in a tunnel worker, July-September, 2015. We interviewed workers and family members, reviewed medical records, tested serum and urine for Histoplasma antigen/antibody, and conducted a cohort study to identify risk factors for histoplasmosis and severe infection (intensive care).\n\nResults\n-------\n'A crew of 36 male workers removed large amounts of bat guano from tunnels without respiratory protection for a median of 24 days per worker (range: 1-25). Median age was 32 years (range: 18-62); none were immunocompromised. Thirty (83 percent) workers had illness that met the case definition of whom 28 (93 percent) were hospitalized, 9 (30 percent) required intensive care, 6 (20 percent) required intubation, and 3 (10 percent) died. The median time from symptom onset to antifungal treatment was 6 days (range: 1-11). Twenty-two of 34 (65 percent) workers had laboratory evidence of histoplasmosis infection.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n'Severe illnesses and death likely resulted from exposure to large inocula of Histoplasma capsulatum spores in an enclosed space, lack of respiratory protection, and delay in recognition and treatment. Clinician education about histoplasmosis, improved laboratory capacity to diagnose fungal infections, and occupational health guidance to protect workers against endemic fungi are recommended in the DR to prevent future outbreaks.'\n\nThe crew of 36 male workers removed large amounts of bat guano from tunnels at the Bao-Tavera Dam Complex, 2 earth-filled embankment dams located about 15 km (9.3 miles) south of Santiago in Santiago Province of the Dominican Republic; it provides municipal water and water for irrigation, and generates hydroelectric power (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bao-Tavera_Dams).\n\nMaps of the Dominican Republic can be seen at http://www.atozmapsdata.com/zoomify.asp?name=Country/Modern/Z_Domini_Pol2 and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6591.

The training took place between [16 and 19 May 2017], but only now did the symptoms begin to be felt by the group. The information was confirmed by the DF Health Department and the Fire Department.\n\nAccording to the Department, at least 18 people, including students and instructors, had headaches and a persistent fever. A total of 11 are being treated at the Hospital Maria Auxiliadora, a private institution in the Gama region, and a military man is hospitalized at the Regional Hospital of the North Wing (Hran). The other soldiers have been discharged. The briefing said 25 firefighters participated in the training. All the soldiers are in epidemiological investigation and will be monitored.\n\nIn G1, firefighters said that during the test preparation, the instructors of the corporation did not realize the amount of bats that were in the cave. In a statement, the Health Department said that a Health Surveillance team inspected the cave and that the area was isolated.

After a week of training, some military personnel began to present flu-like symptoms, with fever and respiratory discomfort, which persisted after the use of medication commonly indicated for these cases, leading them to seek medical attention for a more accurate diagnosis.\n\n'Faced with this, the CBMDF highlighted a medical epidemiologist of the corporation to follow up the cases and take the measures that the case requires.'\n\n'The information updated as of today [Fri 9 Jun 2017], indicates that 10 soldiers were hospitalized in the hospital network, and 1 has already been discharged and another 2 are expected to be discharged soon, due to the clinical picture they present.

Infection causes histoplasmosis. Although the fungus that causes histoplasmosis can be found in temperate climates throughout the world, it is endemic to the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys in the United States. Internationally, the fungus is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central America, eastern and southern Europe, and parts of Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia.\n\n'The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp environment with high organic content that is good for mycelial growth. Highly infectious soil is found near areas inhabited by bats and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been associated with construction and renovation activities that disrupt contaminated soil. In addition, travelers to endemic areas are at risk for histoplasmosis because airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet.\n\n'Most individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who develop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are exposed to a high quantity of inoculum. _Histoplasma_ species may remain latent in healed granulomas and recur, if there is impairment of cell-mediated immunity.\n\n'Approximately 90 per cent of patients are asymptomatic. If symptoms develop, onset occurs 3-14 days after exposure. Fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, abdominal pain, and chills are common symptoms; usually, histoplasmosis is self-limited. Individuals exposed to a large inoculum may develop severe dyspnea resulting from diffuse pulmonary involvement. Joint pain and skin lesions occur in 5-6 per cent of patients, mostly in females. Enlarged hilar [the hilum is part of a gland or organ through which ducts, nerves, or blood vessels enter and leave] and mediastinal lymph nodes are present in 5-10 per cent of patients. Cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and/or chest pain may be present and are related to the degree of compression on the pulmonary airway and circulation.

Pakasa N, Biber A, Nsiangana S, Imposo D, et al.\n\nAbstract\n-----\nWe describe a case series of histoplasmosis caused by _Histoplasma capsulatum_ var. _duboisii_ during July 2011-January 2014 in Kimpese, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Cases were confirmed by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and reverse transcription PCR. All patients were HIV negative. Putative sources for the pathogen were cellar bats and guano fertilizer exploitation.\n\nConclusions\n--------\nThis histology-based study identified a novel focus of _H. duboisii_ in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the city of Kimpese and its vicinity. Over a period of [about] 2 years, 36 cases were routinely detected in a single pathology laboratory in this area; all patients were HIV negative.\n\nThe putative source of infection appears to be cellar bats, _Chaerephon pumilus_, and guano fertilizer overexploitation. African histoplasmosis has previously been reported to be isolated from the intestinal contents of bats belonging to the species _Nycteris hispida_ and _Tadarida pumila_ from a cave in rural Nigeria and from soil mixed with bat guano (8).\n\nThe subsiding of new cases could be related to the incidental cessation of the use of bat guano along with the reintroduction of chemical fertilizers. This change was unrelated to any knowledge about the infection risk of guano and may be reversed when the guano accumulates again to sizable amounts.\n\nThis case series featured a high incidence of infection in women and girls and in young children, including toddlers and school-age children. Six patients were 3-7 years of age, an age when children are more tied to their mothers, sit on the ground, and may be in contact with contaminated soil. Although HIV tests were negative, other innate or acquired immunosuppression was not ruled out.\n\nDuring the 1st year of our case series, more cases were initially labeled as lymphoproliferative disorders or extrapulmonary tuberculosis, whereas in subsequent years, cases were initially suspected to be histoplasmosis infections. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that, in endemic areas, where histopathological diagnosis or advanced microbiology labs are not widely accessible, the disease may be underdiagnosed; therefore, the prevalence of African histoplasmosis may be underestimated.\n\nThe diagnosis of African histoplasmosis is made mainly by histopathology, which shows granulomatous inflammation and giant cells containing numerous large yeast cells 10-15 um in diameter, which are thick-walled and divided by narrow budding. The fungus is easily visible by GMS, Gridley, or PAS staining (4). IHC [immunohistochemistry] staining, which was performed on 12 specimens, is not specific for African histoplasmosis but to _H. capsulatum_; therefore, it may play a role in more accurate and faster diagnosis and enable exclusion of other fungal infections.\n\nIn our series, 3 samples were tested by RT-PCR, and results were positive in all 3 for _H. capsulatum_ diagnosis. Newer PCR protocols have been developed and may provide rapid and species-specific diagnosis (9).\n\nOur histopathologic observation has some limitations. IHC and the RT-PCR primers that were used are unable to differentiate between _H. capsulatum_ var. _capsulatum_ and var. _duboisii_, yet they confirmed the histoplasmosis diagnosis, and IHC together with the large size of the yeast make it specific for _H. duboisii_. Soil and the bat guano from the infected areas have not yet been tested for _H. capsulatum_ var. _duboisii_. Among the strengths of this study is that this unusual case series is unique in its extent and clustering of cases. In addition, the available data add novel epidemiologic and diagnostic information to the current knowledge about this neglected disease.\n\nFurther investigation should be conducted to understand the reservoir of the pathogen, the types of daily activities that might pose risk factors for acquiring the disease, and the mode of transmission and progression of the disease. Because diagnosis, especially in these rural areas, is challenging, seroepidemiologic surveys are needed to establish the extent of this infection.\n\n[The full journal article is available at the source URL. - Mod.ML]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Histoplasma capsulatum_, a dimorphic fungus, is found worldwide in soil enriched by bird or bat droppings.

Because contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years, appropriate measures should be taken before starting work where dirt has been contaminated by bat or bird droppings to protect the health of persons in and around the area (https://idph.iowa.gov/cade/disease-information/histoplasmosis).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "histoplasmosis", "hiv/aids"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-03-25 00:00:00", "2007-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ohio", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Clinton", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "East Feliciana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Missouri", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mississippi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Baton Rouge", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Louisiana", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6426033", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Undiag. resp. illness - Guyana (04): (BA) mine tunnel exp. histoplasmosis conf.", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6426033", "date": "2019-04-16 21:20:46", "main_text": "UNDIAGNOSED RESPIRATORY ILLNESS - GUYANA (04): (BARIMA-WAINI) MANGANESE MINE TUNNEL EXPOSURE, HISTOPLASMOSIS CONFIRMED\n**********************************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 16 Apr 2019\nSource: Kaieteur News Online [edited]\nhttps://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2019/04/16/manganese-mine-incident-mystery-illness-identified-as-histoplasmosis-infection-caused-by-fungus-found-in-droppings-of-birds-bats-and-rats-in-humid-areas/\n\n\nThe mystery illness, which was erroneously assumed to be H1N1 (swine flu) and as leptospirosis in 2 cases, affecting employees working in the Guyana Manganese Inc. tunnel in Matthew's Ridge, Region One, Barima-Waini has finally been determined to be histoplasmosis, an infection by a fungus found in the droppings of birds, bats and rats in humid areas. [Histoplasmosis is caused by a fungus _Histoplasma capsulatum_ that lives in soil enriched by bird or bat, not rat, droppings. - Mod.ML]\n\nThis was confirmed when the Ministry of Public Health held a press conference yesterday [15 Apr 2019] in its Mental Health Unit Boardroom to provide an update on the recent outbreak and related issues.\n\nSamples were collected from all patients, and initially some testing was done at the National Public Health Reference Laboratory (NPHRL). Further samples were sent to the Caribbean Public Health Agency Laboratory (CARPHA) in Trinidad for confirmation.\n\nThe results initially were negative for influenza A and B inclusive of H1N1, chikungunya, Zika and dengue. All patients underwent malaria tests in Matthews Ridge, and they were also negative.\n\nChief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr. Shamdeo Persaud provided a detailed update.\n\nRelating the developments sequentially, the CMO said that the 1st 4 cases were reported on 28 Mar [2019]; one died while receiving care at Pakera District Hospital in Region One. The following day, 4 more were brought in to Pakera District Hospital complaining of similar symptoms (fever, headaches, joint pains, mild shortness of breath). Subsequently, the 7 Chinese workers were transferred to the Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation (GPHC).\n\nAn additional 6 employees, including one Guyanese, were attended to at the Port Kaituma Hospital but later transferred to the GPHC. One of the 6 persons visited the hospital on his own. He was evaluated but not admitted.\n\nOnce the cases were reported, several teams visited the site from the regional level. The teams included the Regional Health Officer and the Regional Environmental Health Officer, along with some supporting medical staff.\n\n'In the initial stage, we weren't sure what we were dealing with, but since it was a febrile illness with respiratory symptoms, we took all the necessary precautions to restrict access to both the site and the hospital where the patients were being kept. The additional staffers that were sent to the region set up a temporary facility at the community centre in Matthews Ridge where they were seeing the regular patients,' the CMO recounted. 'Following the transfer of the patients on 3 Apr [2019], they cleaned up the Pakera District Hospital and closed down the temporary sites. Work resumed as normal at the hospital for Maternal Child Health and other services.'\n\n'Two persons are dead; one died at Pakera District Hospital and one at GPHC. Of those admitted at the GPHC, 2 were discharged. An additional person was discharged from Pakera District Hospital. Ten workers were transferred to China on Mon 9 Apr [2019]. 16 Chinese workers were under care and treatment. Following the transfer, 2 more were admitted to Pakera Hospital bringing it to a total of 18.'\n\nBlood, sputum and urine samples were collected from those that were under care, while tissue samples were collected during the post mortem from the 2 deceased. Testing for these samples was done locally at the National Public Health Reference Laboratory (NPHRL), and confirmation was done at Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) in Trinidad.\n\n'All tests were negative for influenza A & B, dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Even though [it was] reported we had 2 positive for leptospirosis, according to the NPHRL, those were later found negative through confirmation from CARPHA. On the weekend of 7 Apr [2019], a team was flown in to Matthews Ridge. The team included officers from the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health, and they did an evaluation of the work site and looked at some of the risk factors relating to the environment. A community meeting was also held with residents,' Dr. Persaud said.\n\nIt was disclosed that from 8-10 Apr [2019], 2 consultants from the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) along with the Chief Medical Officer and a team from the Ministry of Public Health visited the area. A team of 9 officers from the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), China was also part of the visiting team. 'During the visit, the team met with the hospital staff. We reviewed their procedures for infectious disease control and prevention, and we met with company officials. Interviews were conducted with the persons who were working in the mine.' A total of 23 Chinese workers were interviewed. They were working in the 4 different tunnels.\n\nThe CMO continued: 'On 10 Apr [2019], we received word from CARPHA that 5 samples were tested for histoplasmosis; 4 were positive. The Chinese CDC tested an additional 6 persons, and 5 were positive for histoplasmosis.\n\nOne person tested showed weak positive hantavirus, but this may have been because of a past exposure to that germ.\n\n'Currently, we are monitoring persons at Matthews Ridge. During the last 2 days, 2 persons developed fever, and they were admitted to Pakera District Hospital and are under close observation and treatment for hantavirus, which is a fungal infection. [Hantavirus infection is a viral, not fungal infection. - Mod.ML] We also took samples from them, and they are presently being processed for shipment to CARPHA.'\n\nMeanwhile, the absence of safety gear for workers was highlighted. Interviews were done with employees who had not developed any illness. And this revealed the shortcomings. Officials were told that the safety gear was in the country but was not on site. They had not cleared customs at the wharf at that time. However, that claim was never confirmed. Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Consultant Gwyneth King said, 'Our information to date is that the workers were not wearing [any] personal safety gear. That is to say that they were not wearing respirators, so they were exposed to breathing in the fungus. If you have to do a job like that, you need to wear personal safety gear; otherwise, you could expose yourself.'\n\nKing said that officials will be working within the confines of the Occupational Safety and Health Act to see what action, if any, can be taken against the company for this major inadequacy. However, they are only now going through their findings and preparing the report.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[As I assumed in my moderator comments in the last ProMED-mail post on this outbreak, the cause of the acute respiratory illness in workers in manganese mine tunnels in Guyana is apparently histoplasmosis.\n\nWe were initially told (ProMED-mail post (Undiagnosed resp. illness - Guyana: (Barima-Waini) manganese mine, fatal, RFI 20190401.6396933) that workers at a manganese mining company in Guyana, owned by a subsidiary of Chinese company Bosai Minerals Group Guyana Company Limited, developed what was said to be an influenza-like illness with 'respiratory discomfort, rash, and high-grade fever.' More than a dozen miners were affected, and 2 of the workers died. Post-mortem examinations on the 2 dead miners initially were said to have 'revealed that they died from haemorrhagic pneumonia as a result of leptospirosis;' we now learn the diagnosis of leptospirosis was erroneous.\n\nInitially, we were told that all infected persons were exposed to one common area, without evidence of person-to-person transmission (that is, presumably there were no secondary cases), but we were not told what that common area was. We were subsequently told the common area is the 'Matthews Ridge tunnel site.'\n\nManganese mines are usually open pits, which are subject to flooding that could lead to exposure to leptospirosis if there is also rat infestation. However, tunnels could be infested with bats and their guano, which would place mine workers at risk for histoplasmosis, a fungal pulmonary infection that follows unprotected inhalation of large inocula of _Histoplasma capsulatum_ spores. The fungus lives in soil fertilized by bird or bat droppings. Contaminated soil can remain potentially infectious for years. Microconidia spores become airborne when the contaminated soil is disturbed, for example, by digging in contaminated soil. Most infected individuals remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic illness is primarily caused by an intense exposure, and the severity of disease is related to the number of spores inhaled.\n\nProMED-mail previously reported on a histoplasmosis outbreak in tunnel workers in the Dominican Republic (see 'See Also's' below).\n\nSymptoms of histoplasmosis usually include non-specific flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, muscle aches, dry cough, and chest discomfort); potentially fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may occur when larger inocula are inhaled (http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1047573 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7244706?dopt=Abstract). The pulmonary infection can disseminate throughout the body, and immunocompromised individuals may develop a severe form of histoplasmosis called progressive disseminated disease.\n\nHistoplasmosis cannot be transmitted from person to person or from animals to people. The diagnosis can be made by culture of the organism from sputum or tissues, by serology, or by tests for antigen in urine and serum specimens.

Its topography is mountainous with karst formations and caves. La Cueva del Rio La Venta is apparently a major tourist attraction in this area (http://ropewiki.com/Rio_La_Venta_Expedition). A map showing the location of Chiapas can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/r75zAe75Lak.\n\n_Histoplasma capsulatum_, a dimorphic fungus that grows in a mycelial form at ambient temperatures and grows as yeast at body temperature in mammals, is found worldwide in soil enriched by bird or bat droppings.

The spores can travel distances downstream from the source in currents of air. Because of the presence of bats in caves, cave exploration is a known risk factor for histoplasmosis, which is sometimes known as 'cave fever' (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10403317).

The illness was eventually identified as a respiratory infection called histoplasmosis, or 'cave disease,' caused by spores from bird or bat droppings in damp soil.\n\n[She] of Paradise, NL, travelled to Cuba with her husband on 27 Apr [2019], but her fever-like symptoms didn't appear until 21 May [2019], weeks after she returned home. X-rays showed nodules in her lungs and tests showed low blood counts. Her condition baffled local doctors, who initially thought her lung infection could be some form of pneumonia. The clue to her illness came from a chance meeting she'd made on the trip with a family of Newfoundlanders who had a mutual friend. [She] and her husband had travelled with the group on a tour that included cave diving in the Matanzas province of Cuba.\n\nBack in Canada, a number of their new friends had also fallen ill. [She] and the travellers informed their doctors that they knew each other and were experiencing the same symptoms, and their illness was identified as a respiratory infection called histoplasmosis, or 'cave disease.' [She] said pinpointing the source of her condition offered some relief from what she called a terrible, alarming health issue that she feared might have been cancerous. 'You didn't want to be too excited about the fact that somebody else was sick, but at least cancer was off the table,' [she] said by phone Wednesday [3 Jul 2019].\n\nEastern Health, [her] local health authority, has issued an advisory for travellers heading to the Americas, Africa, East Asia and Australia to avoid contracting the disease. Histoplasmosis is a treatable disease, contracted by breathing in airborne spores where bird or bat droppings are disturbed in damp soil. Eastern Health described its symptoms as including 'cough and chest pain, shortness of breath, fever and chills, headaches and flu-like illness.' The disease is treatable and most people who contract it never show symptoms, but it can be serious for infants or people with compromised immune systems. The health authority said the advisory was issued after a low number of histoplasmosis cases were confirmed in the Eastern Health region.\n\nAn exact number of cases could not be provided for privacy reasons, but [the patient] said she's heard of at least 5 others.\n\nWhile the disease is treatable, it is rare in Newfoundland, making treatment more complicated. [The patient] said she's waiting to receive an anti-fungal medication that had to be approved from outside of the province, and she's been told she'll have to take the drug for treatment for the next 3 months to a year. [The patent] said she's still experiencing fatigue and a persistent cough, and her voice is still scratchy and strained from an illness she contracted from what was one of the most breathtaking excursions on her vacation. 'It was absolutely amazing,' she said of the cave. 'It was so pristine and so nice-looking when we went in.'\n\n[She] said she'd advise other travellers to do a thorough background check on the regions they're visiting and any planned excursions. 'It's without a doubt that you have to go and you have to research the excursion that you're going on,' she said. 'You have to know the region, the areas, 100%. [She] wrote a Facebook post about her experience that's been shared thousands of times, and she said people as far as France have written to her about experiencing similar, undiagnosed symptoms after travelling abroad.\n\n[Byline: Holly McKenzie-Sutter]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Histoplasma capsulatum_, a dimorphic fungus that grows in a mycelial form at ambient temperatures and as yeast at body temperature in mammals, is found worldwide in soil enriched by bird or bat droppings.

That was the case in Quebec, where more than a dozen people became ill with a pneumonia-like infection after the exterior brick of a century-old house was removed as part of a renovation.\n\nThe outbreak, which occurred in May [2013], was reported Thursday [2 Jan 2014] in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly morbidity and mortality report [1].\n\nFourteen people -- including workers, residents of the house and neighbours -- developed symptoms of histoplasmosis, a fungal disease carried in the droppings of bats and birds. Two of the workers were admitted to hospital and the regional public health department was called in to deal with the outbreak.\n\n'We had a declaration from a family doctor who had seen 2 cases, and he was astute enough to realize that something was probably going on at (their) work,' said Dr Jean-Luc Grenier, a medical consultant at the Laurentians Public Health Department and a co-author of the CDC report. The home was owned by a married couple who lived on the ground floor of the 2-storey house and rented the upper floor to 2 tenants. The couple had decided to renovate because the exterior brick walls were cracked and in danger of falling.\n\n'There were probably some bats that were able to live there in between the bricks and the (interior) walls,' Grenier said of the home, located in Saint-Eustache, Quebec, northwest of Montreal. Over the years, bat droppings containing histoplasmosis spores would have built up inside the walls, he said. As the bricks were pulled down, clouds of dust carrying the dried spores would have become airborne and easily breathed in by anyone nearby.\n\nGrenier said an investigation determined 30 people had been exposed to the spore-laden dust. Of those, 14 got sick with symptoms of histoplasmosis infection, which include high fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath. Those affected included 6 masonry workers, the 2 homeowners, a visitor to the house, 2 neighbours whose bedroom faced the demolition site, and 3 debris sorters. The 2 renters within the home did not get sick.\n\nThe debris sorters weren't located in Saint-Eustache, but in the Lanaudiere region many kilometres away, and were unwittingly exposed to histoplasmosis spores. 'Those bricks, I don't know why, but they decided to recycle them,' Grenier said. 'So before knowing there was an outbreak, the bricks were brought in a container to another region far away.' There, 2 workers cleaned the bricks so they could be reused. 'So they were brushing them to take off the dirt. Those 2 were very sick also because they were exposed directly. They didn't wear any masks.'\n\nTo remove the health risk, all the bricks taken for recycling were buried, while heavy rains over a few days at the renovation site would have washed away any lingering spores, Grenier said.\n\nAll of those sickened recovered and none needed treatment with antifungal medication. Typically, the body's immune system is able to get rid of the infection, although that isn't always the case: people with compromised immune function, such as those being treated for HIV or some cancers, usually need drug treatment. In rare cases, histoplasmosis can be fatal, even with antifungal therapy. 'It depends on the dose you get into your lungs and your immune system,' Grenier said. 'If, for instance, a neighbour had been an old man with immunosuppression, he could get the disease and die.'\n\nWhile the fungus is widely present in soil, cases of histoplasmosis infection are rare in Canada and usually involve construction work that stirs up clouds of dried-up aerosolized spores that people end up inhaling. That's why workers and their employers need to strictly adhere to labour regulations requiring that protective masks or respirators be worn while doing jobs that produce potentially harmful, breathable forms of dust, he said. In this case, the workers had been given masks but didn't wear them continuously because the weather was hot. 'The principal message is for workers, because it's workers who probably (have) the most potential to be exposed.'\n\n[Byline: Sheryl Ubelacker]\n\n[Reference\n---------\n1.

The diagnosis of histoplasmosis was confirmed in 4 persons: in 2 hospitalized masons by a positive serum and a positive urinary HC antigen test and in 2 debris sorters by a positive urinary HC antigen test. 11 others only had a clinical diagnosis of histoplasmosis. A strong correlation was found between a diagnosis of histoplasmosis and exposure to demolition dust containing bat or bird droppings, and with the handling of contaminated debris away from the work site.\n\nThe editorial note from the MMWR publication is extracted below:\n'A wide range of activities have been associated with histoplasmosis outbreaks: construction, maintenance, renovation, excavation (4-6); caving (7); school activities or day camp (8); search for treasure (9); and agricultural activities (10), among others. The common variable inherent in these activities is the exposure to bird or bat droppings (1) or contaminated soil.\n\n'When buildings, particularly old houses, have previously sheltered colonies of bats or birds, appropriate measures should be taken before starting renovation work to protect the health of persons in and around the area.\n\n'In this investigation, the confirmation of a diagnosis of histoplasmosis for debris sorters who did not work at the demolition site but handled contaminated materials away from the site demonstrates that the radius of exposure might be greater than expected. As a result, protective measures should be recommended to all workers who might be exposed to contaminated material.\n\n'The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. First, a conservative approach to risk assessment was adopted by including persons such as residents of the house in the high exposure scenario, and by including clinical cases that could be related to an etiology other than histoplasmosis. Second, the small number of persons involved in this outbreak limits the power of analysis and the conclusions that can be drawn from the investigation. Moreover, the even smaller number of symptomatic persons who were tested for HC antigen reduces the specificity of the diagnosis. Despite these limitations, the high relative risk shows a strong correlation between demolition dust exposure and the onset of disease.\n\n'This outbreak highlights the importance for employers to understand the health risks associated with renovation of old houses in areas where bats or birds roost. Employers should also be made aware of the recommended health measures for their workers, such as wearing a respirator (1).'\n\nThe full report, table, graph, and references are available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6251a1.htm?s_cid=mm6251a1_w.

About 100 of the prison's 1800 inmates have been affected.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health believes the illness has been caused by [_Histoplasma capsulatum_], a fungus found in some Illinois soil that can be inhaled. However, some false-positive tests initially led authorities to believe the illness was caused by the adenovirus.\n\nDepartment of Corrections spokesman Tom Shaer says the illness is not contagious and the prison has not seen a new case in a week.\n\n[Byline: Samantha Jeffreys]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is not stated in the posting whether any construction or demolition was done in or around the prison, which could have produced aerosolization of the infectious spore form of this pathogen. With a clinical attack rate of about 5 percent and the knowledge that most cases of acute histoplasmosis are asymptomatic, it is likely that most of the prison population became infected.\n\nAs a review, the following was obtained from Medscape (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/299054-overview#showall):\n\n_Histoplasma capsulatum_ is a dimorphic fungus that remains in a mycelial form at ambient temperatures and grows as yeast at body temperature in mammals. Infection causes histoplasmosis. Although the fungus that causes histoplasmosis can be found in temperate climates throughout the world, it is endemic to the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys in the United States. Internationally, the fungus is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central America, eastern and southern Europe, and parts of Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia.\n\nThe soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp environment with high organic content that is good for mycelial growth. Highly infectious soil is found near areas inhabited by bats and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been associated with construction and renovation activities that disrupt contaminated soil. In addition, travelers to endemic areas are at risk for histoplasmosis because airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet.\n\nMost individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who develop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are exposed to a high quantity of inoculum. _Histoplasma_ species may remain latent in healed granulomas and recur, if there is impairment of cell-mediated immunity.\n\nApproximately 90 per cent of patients are asymptomatic. If symptoms develop, onset occurs 3-14 days after exposure. Fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, abdominal pain, and chills are common symptoms; usually, histoplasmosis is self-limited. Individuals exposed to a large inoculum may develop severe dyspnea resulting from diffuse pulmonary involvement. Joint pain and skin lesions occur in 5-6 per cent of patients, mostly in females. Enlarged hilar [the hilum is part of a gland or organ through which ducts, nerves, or blood vessels enter and leave] and mediastinal lymph nodes are present in 5-10 per cent of patients. Cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and/or chest pain may be present and are related to the degree of compression on the pulmonary airway and circulation.

His symptoms included backache, fever and rigors. He was admitted to a private hospital in Pretoria 5 days later with progressively worsening dyspnoea, a non-productive cough, and pleuritic chest pain.\n\nTogether with 8 other persons, the index patient had gone on an expedition to the Sterkfontein cave complex on 11 May 2012 (exactly 2 weeks prior to the onset of his symptoms). The expedition group had accessed 'Bat Cave' through the cavern roof via a fixed ladder.\n\nThey had crawled into areas of the cave that were not often explored and noticed fine, soft dirt on the cave floor that was easily aerosolised.\n\nThe group wore hard hats but no masks and stayed underground for approximately 5 hours. Four other members of the group also developed an acute influenza-like illness approximately 2 weeks after the expedition; one other person was admitted to the same private hospital with a diagnosis of acute community-acquired pneumonia.\n\nThe 2 hospitalised patients were treated empirically for an acute community-acquired pneumonia, and the attending clinician elected to add intravenous liposomal amphotericin B once histoplasmosis was deemed a possible diagnosis.\n\nThe 3 other patients were treated with oral itraconazole as outpatients. Urine specimens from the hospitalised patients were submitted to the NICD-NHLS for _Histoplasma capsulatum_ antigen testing; however, the investigational assays were negative for both patients. Sputum samples from both patients have not yielded growth of _H. capsulatum_. Despite the absence of laboratory-confirmation of _H. capsulatum_ in this cluster of cases, acute pulmonary histoplasmosis remains the most likely diagnosis given the common exposure history and compatible clinical features.\n\nThe 1st outbreak of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis (APH) in South Africa was described in the former Transvaal Province in 1953 among 3 cave-explorers; this was followed by the description of 2 more outbreaks.\n\nCases were also described among miners who had entered old, disused mine shafts in the then Transvaal Province in the 1960s.\n\nTwo outbreaks were described in the former Cape Province in 1963 (Cango caves) and 1979 (De Hoop caves), and another outbreak was described more recently in the 1990s. _H. capsulatum_ was also isolated from environmental samples and from white-tailed rats that had been exposed to aerosols from cave soil samples in the former Transvaal Province.\n\nSeveral laboratory tests are currently available for the diagnosis of APH. Culture of _H. capsulatum_ from a sputum sample would definitively establish the diagnosis of APH but is only positive among 10-15 percent of immunocompetent patients. The organism may be detected in Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smears in up to 40 percent of patients with APH. A complement fixation test can also establish the diagnosis of APH retrospectively by detecting a 4-fold increase in antibody titres between acute and convalescent sera; however, this test is not available in South Africa. The precipitin assay to detect H and M bands is also not currently available. However, an investigational assay that detects polysaccharide antigen in urine has recently been introduced by the Mycology Reference Laboratory at NICD-NHLS (+27 11 555 0325); this test is still being validated and requires submission of a urine specimen that has been refrigerated after collection. The sensitivity of a well-validated urine antigen assay for diagnosis of APH is reported to be 20 percent.\n\nThe vast majority of patients with APH develop a mild, self-limiting illness; however, patients who have been exposed to a large fungal inoculum or are immunosuppressed may develop an acute symptomatic illness that may become progressively worse. Mild-to-moderate APH does not usually require treatment, but oral itraconazole for 6-12 weeks may be indicated for patients who have symptoms for over one month. Patients with moderately-severe or severe APH may require amphotericin B for 1-2 weeks followed by oral itraconazole for a total of 12 weeks (Wheat LJ, et al. Clin Infect Dis 2007).\n\nPrevention:\nCave-explorers should be made aware of the risk of APH before entering caves where cases have occurred previously or where the risk is unknown. The use of N95 particulate respirators may also be considered to minimise exposure, especially among persons at risk for disseminated disease.\n\nSource: Centre for Opportunistic, Tropical and Hospital Infections and Division of Public Health Surveillance and Response, NICD-NHLS.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Clinically diagnosed infection with the fungus _Histoplasma capsulatum_ is a rare infection in immunocompetent people, and cases may easily be missed because of the mild and transient symptoms. _Histoplasma capsulatum_ is found worldwide in soil and especially soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings.

Multiple outbreaks have been reported following travel to the Americas, but reports of pulmonary histoplasmosis in short-term immunocompetent travelers to Africa are rare.\n\nA biology student was referred to our unit with suspected pulmonary histoplasmosis following her return from a field trip in the Ugandan rainforest. The patient informed us that several of her multinational student colleagues on the same expedition had developed a similar illness. Using an alert in ProMED-mail and a questionnaire forwarded to each of the symptomatic students, we accumulated data on the other cases involved in this apparent outbreak of pulmonary histoplasmosis.\n\nOf 24 students 13 developed respiratory symptoms following the expedition. Chest X-ray appearances were often suggestive of miliary tuberculosis but in most cases a final diagnosis of histoplasmosis was made (confirmed with serology in 5 cases, clinically diagnosed in 6, and retrospectively suspected in 2). Detailed questioning indicated that the likely source was a large hollow bat-infested tree within the rainforest.\n\nThis is an unusual outbreak of histoplasmosis following short-term travel to Africa. Pulmonary histoplasmosis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of an acute febrile respiratory illness in travelers returning from endemic areas or reporting activities suggesting exposure.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nShamsudeen Fagbo\n<oloungbo@yahoo.com>\n\n[As noted in the abstract, the original alert regarding this outbreak was posted on ProMED-mail and written by Lucy Cottle, the 1st author on this paper.

Infection causes histoplasmosis. Although the fungus that causes histoplasmosis can be found in temperate climates throughout the world, it is endemic to the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys in the United States. Internationally, the fungus is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central America, eastern and southern Europe, and parts of Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia.\n\n'The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp environment with high organic content that is good for mycelial growth. Highly infectious soil is found near areas inhabited by bats and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been associated with construction and renovation activities that disrupt contaminated soil. In addition, travelers to endemic areas are at risk for histoplasmosis because airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet.\n\n'Most individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who develop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are exposed to a high quantity of inoculum. _Histoplasma_ species may remain latent in healed granulomas and recur, if there is impairment of cell-mediated immunity.\n\n'Approximately 90 per cent of patients are asymptomatic. If symptoms develop, onset occurs 3-14 days after exposure. Fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, abdominal pain, and chills are common symptoms; usually, histoplasmosis is self-limited. Individuals exposed to a large inoculum may develop severe dyspnea resulting from diffuse pulmonary involvement. Joint pain and skin lesions occur in 5-6 per cent of patients, mostly in females. Enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are present in 5-10 per cent of patients. Cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and/or chest pain may be present and are related to the degree of compression on the pulmonary airway and circulation. Paratracheal involvement may cause cough or dyspnea because of compression on the trachea or bronchi.'\n\nAfrican histoplasmosis is a systemic infection caused by the fungus _Histoplasma capsulatum_ var. _duboisii_ which occurs, with very few exceptions, only on the central part African continent, most commonly in west and central Africa, particularly Nigeria, Senegal, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Angola. The _duboisii_ variety has yeast cells that average about twice the size of _H. capsulatum_ var. _capsulatum_. In general, the _duboisii_ variant is recognized when presenting with dissemination to skin, bone, and lymph node rather than the primary lung form. Both variants are more likely to disseminate in the presence of immune suppression.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Uganda can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/1wa6. - Mod.LL]", "summary": "Pulmonary histoplasmosis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of an acute febrile respiratory illness in travelers returning from endemic areas or reporting activities suggesting exposure.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nShamsudeen Fagbo\n<oloungbo@yahoo.com>\n\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\n'The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp environment with high organic content that is good for mycelial growth. \n\nAfrican histoplasmosis is a systemic infection caused by the fungus _Histoplasma capsulatum_ var. _duboisii_ which occurs, with very few exceptions, only on the central part African continent, most commonly in west and central Africa, particularly Nigeria, Senegal, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Angola. \n\nA biology student was referred to our unit with suspected pulmonary histoplasmosis following her return from a field trip in the Ugandan rainforest. \nOutbreaks of histoplasmosis have been increasingly reported in association with travel to endemic areas.

Laboratory-confirmed histoplasmosis was diagnosed in one camp counselor. DCHD and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (NDHHS) investigated the extent and source of the outbreak to prevent further infections.\n\nHistoplasmosis is a common fungal infection in the United States (1) and is a cause of respiratory illness outbreaks in endemic areas, which include areas in the midwestern states, and particularly the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys (2). Illness usually is acquired from inhalation of soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings (2); human-to-human transmission does not occur. Symptoms include fever, headache, and respiratory symptoms, although infected persons can remain asymptomatic (2). Most patients will recover regardless of treatment, but severe disease can lead to respiratory failure and should be treated; immunocompromised patients are at high risk for developing histoplasmosis that spreads throughout the body (2).\n\nAll camp counselors and camp attendees' parents were informed of the outbreak. Counselors were requested to complete a questionnaire to report their demographic information, activities, campsite assignments, and symptoms. All camp attendees' parents were administered a separate Internet-based questionnaire regarding their child's week of attendance and symptoms. Campsite assignments were obtained from camp administrators.\n\nSerum and urine samples from all counselors were tested by enzyme immunoassay for _Histoplasma capsulatum_ antigen to detect active infection. Parents of all attendees were mailed a letter explaining the symptoms of histoplasmosis, treatment and testing indications, and that testing could be performed free of charge if they desired.\n\nA confirmed case of histoplasmosis was defined as a serum or urine test positive for _H. capsulatum_, regardless of the person's symptoms, at any time after that person's arrival at camp. A suspected case was defined as illness comprising self-reported fever and at least one additional symptom (headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or cough) in a camp counselor or attendee beginning 3 days or more after camp arrival during 21 May-27 Jun 2012, regardless of that person's test results.\n\nAmong the 32 counselors, 19 (17 confirmed, 2 suspected) (59 percent) had illness meeting the case definition, 11 (34 percent) were symptomatic with fever and at least one additional symptom, and 10 (31 percent) sought medical care for their symptoms. No hospitalizations or deaths occurred. Median age of the counselors was 20 years (range: 18-23 years). No specific activities or campsite assignments were associated with illness when confirmed and suspected cases were combined; however, when suspected cases were excluded, digging fire pits was associated with increased risk for illness among persons with confirmed illness (risk ratio [RR] = 2.7; Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.01).\n\nCamp activities had occurred in a wooded park with 12 campsites, 9 of which were open, dirt-floor shelters with roofs supported by posts. During 21-25 May 2012, counselors participated in a precamp clean-up week. Activities included raking leaves, cleaning picnic tables, digging fire pits, and moving firewood; counselors did not wear personal protective equipment while cleaning. They reported observing bat guano on picnic tables and dirt floors in 2 of the shelters. Day camps began on 4 Jun 2012, each lasting from Monday through Friday. Campers were aged 6-14 years (median: 9 years); each was assigned to one campsite where activities included cooking on wood-fired grills and eating at picnic tables. Camp activities included nature walks, outdoor games, wilderness skill training, archery, and arts and crafts; all campers participated in these activities, but none participated in high-risk activities (e.g., digging in dirt, digging fire pits, raking leaves, or cleaning campsites).\n\nOf 797 children attending camps, questionnaires were completed on 142 (18 percent), and laboratory testing was performed on 21 (3 percent). Laboratory or questionnaire data were obtained for 153 (19 percent) children, of whom 17 (11.1 percent) had illness meeting the case definition for histoplasmosis (5 confirmed, 12 suspected). A multilevel logistic regression model with a random effect for campsite was used to compare illnesses among 18 children assigned to the 2 campsites where guano was identified, 32 children assigned to 2 campsites 20 yards or less from campsites with guano, and 92 children assigned to 8 campsites 21 yards or more from campsites with guano (referent group). Compared with the referent group, children assigned to campsites with guano had 2.4 times the odds of illness (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-11.4), and children assigned to campsites 20 yards or less from campsites with guano had 2.2 times the odds of illness (95 percent CI = 0.5-8.2). A decreasing trend in illness occurred with increasing distance from campsites with guano (Cochran-Armitage test p-value = 0.04).\n\nDuring a visit by DCHD and NDHHS personnel on 26 Jun 2012, bat guano was noted on picnic tables and dirt floors at 2 campsites. At that time, DCHD and NDHHS recommended closing these campsites, and the areas were fenced off. Soil samples of all campsites and other areas of the park were obtained for _Histoplasma_ testing; results are pending.\n\nThe probable infection source in this outbreak was campsite contamination of soil and picnic tables by bat guano, which likely became aerosolized during camp activities or clean-up before camper arrival. No other potential sources of infection were identified. Subsequent to this investigation, the city parks and recreation division relocated the day camp to a different park. The health department provided recommendations to the city's parks and recreation division regarding prevention of bat roosting, procedures for inspecting and identifying potentially contaminated areas, and procedures to mitigate biohazardous sites contaminated with _Histoplasma_ (3). Persons living in endemic areas should be aware that exposure to aerosolized soil or guano in sites with bird or bat droppings can lead to histoplasmosis, should avoid such exposures, and should seek professional assistance for cleanup efforts.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Lung infection can occur after a person inhales aerosolized microscopic fungal spores, usually after disturbing, e.g., digging, contaminated soil.\n\nMost individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. The symptoms of histoplasmosis are non-specific and similar to pneumonia from any cause. However, the pulmonary infection can disseminate throughout the body, and immunocompromised individuals may develop a severe form of histoplasmosis called progressive disseminated disease.

During the trip I examined an active 'Bat Tree.' As a consequence, I developed a case of histoplasmosis that came very close to killing me, requiring long hospitalization and recuperation. Considering the number of 'Eco' trips that are now taken to Panama, Costa Rica, and similar localities, I wonder if participants do, or should receive a specific warning to avoid disturbing bats and their immediate environment.\n\n--\nEllicott McConnell, Ph.D.\n<eck9611@gmail.com>\n\n[Histoplasmosis occurs worldwide and is endemic in the Midwestern and central United States, Mexico, Central and South America, parts of eastern and southern Europe, parts of Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia. _H. capsulatum_ var. _duboisii_ is found in central and western Africa.\n\nAlthough rare in travelers (less than 0.5 percent), inhalation of spores (conidia) found in soil contaminated with bat guano or bird droppings aerosolized during activities that disturb the contaminated soil, such as spelunking, mining, construction, excavation, demolition, roofing, chimney cleaning, farming, or gardening, can lead to clusters of cases with attack rates of greater than 50 percent. Histoplasmosis can occur among workers, as well as among persons not directly involved in the soil-disruption process, including travelers in the area because airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet in air currents.\n\nIn addition to imported histoplasmosis in travelers returning home from an endemic area, immigrants or expatriates from endemic areas may experience reactivation of latent disease if they become immunosuppressed due to HIV infection or other underlying conditions (Norman FF, et al. Imported histoplasmosis: two distinct profiles in travelers and immigrants.

Among symptomatic patients, the commonest clinical presentation is acute pneumonia (1-3). Persons with compromised immune systems are at risk for disseminated histoplasmosis, a severe illness requiring antifungal therapy that is often characterized by fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss (2,4). _H. capsulatum_ is endemic in the Ohio River and Mississippi River valleys, where it is found in soil enriched with bird droppings and bat guano (1,5-7). During November 2012 to February 2013, histoplasmosis was diagnosed in 4 Montana residents by 4 different physicians. No epidemiologic links among the cases were identified. Each patient's medical records were reviewed, and their exposure and travel histories were obtained. 3 patients reported no recent travel outside of Montana and likely were exposed in Montana, which is west of areas where _H. capsulatum_ is recognized as endemic (5,6). One patient reported recent travel to California, where she was exposed to potting soil containing bat guano. Low clinical suspicion, probably related to lack of history of exposure to areas where _H. capsulatum_ is known to be endemic, likely delayed diagnosis and appropriate therapy for 3 patients. Health-care providers should be aware of the possibility of histoplasmosis in Montana and consider the diagnosis in patients with clinically compatible illnesses.\n\nPatient 1\n---------\nA woman aged 59 years with a history of breast cancer who was treated with chemotherapy and radiation in 2002 was evaluated in February 2011 for left parotid gland swelling (table [see source URL - Mod.LL]) A computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous (IV) contrast revealed a 2-cm lesion in the tail of the parotid gland. On 6 Apr 2012, the patient underwent a fine needle aspiration of her left parotid gland; cytology revealed atypical lymphoepithelial cells. In October 2012, the patient reported continued swelling behind her left ear, which eventually developed into a weeping lesion. She reported no fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, cough, or difficulty breathing. On 11 Nov 2012, she underwent a left parotidectomy. Histopathology revealed lymphoepithelial cysts and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with rare yeast forms consistent with _H. capsulatum_. A follow-up urine histoplasma antigen enzyme immunoassay (EIA) on 7 Dec 2012 was negative. The patient was referred for treatment of histoplasmosis and started on itraconazole therapy.\n\nThe patient was a retired administrator and had never lived outside southwest Montana. She reported engaging in walking, fishing, and gardening, and had multiple bird feeders. She did not report any exposures to caves or bats. In May 2012, the patient visited Sacramento, California, where she participated in the potting of plants using soil labeled as containing bat guano. No other persons exposed to the same potting soil during her trip were known to have become ill. Other than the trip to Sacramento, the patient had not traveled outside of Montana for several years.\n\nPatient 2\n---------\nAn adolescent boy aged 17 years sought care in November 2011 with complaints of fatigue. Following a positive heterophile antibody test, he was diagnosed with mononucleosis. Over the next 9 months, the patient continued to experience fatigue, headaches, and night sweats, and had a 5-pound (2.3 kg) weight loss. In September 2012, he sought follow-up care and was noted to have clinically significant anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. On 19 Sep 2012, a CT scan of the pelvis with IV contrast revealed extensive mesenteric and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. At that time, a chest radiograph, complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests were within normal limits. His Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin IgM was 11.7 U/mL (normal = 0-43.9 U/mL) and IgG was 539.0 U/mL (normal = 0-21.9 U/mL). On 27 Dec 2012, he underwent a lymph node biopsy of an anterior cervical lymph node and a submandibular node that revealed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with yeast forms consistent with _H. capsulatum_. A follow-up urine EIA on 15 Jan 2013 was negative. The patient was started on itraconazole therapy.\n\nThe patient had lived in south west Montana since birth. He reported frequent outdoor recreational activities, including exploring caves, trundling (rolling large rocks or boulders down hillsides), wakeboarding, camping, hiking, and snowboarding. He also worked as a landscaper during the summer of 2012. He did not report any known exposures to bats or bird droppings. His last travel outside of Montana was to Omaha, Nebraska, in 2007.\n\nPatient 3\n---------\nA man aged 79 years with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II, tobacco use, and colon cancer treated with a partial colectomy in 2003 experienced fatigue and fever on 3 Jul 2012, and was evaluated in an emergency department on 8 Jul 2012; a chest radiograph was normal. Because of persistent fevers noted when the patient was reevaluated on 18 Jul 2012, the patient underwent a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis without IV contrast; the scan revealed a left lower lobe pneumonia and mild pulmonary fibrosis of the right lung base. Laboratory analysis of a blood specimen revealed a mild leukocytosis and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 81 mm/hr (normal: 0-20 mm/hr). The patient was started on moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 10 days. On reevaluation on 25 Jul 2013, the patient was noted to be afebrile and clinically improved. On 10 Oct 2012, the patient underwent a follow-up CT scan of the chest without IV contrast, which revealed a 3 cm by 1.3 cm oval opacity in the posterior left lower lung and a 4 mm high-density nodule in the right lower lung consistent with a calcified granuloma. At this time, the patient's leukocytosis had resolved, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 42 mm/hr. In November 2012, the patient underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the left lower lung lesion that demonstrated a granulomatous pneumonitis.\n\nIn December 2012, a positron emission tomographic scan of the chest demonstrated mediastinal and subcarinal lymphadenopathy and a left lung nodule that had increased glucose uptake. The patient then underwent mediastinoscopy with tissue biopsy. In February 2013, the biopsy specimen was culture-positive for _H. capsulatum_. The patient was referred for treatment of histoplasmosis.\n\nThe patient was a rancher and lived in eastern Montana. He reported travel more than 30 years earlier to Canada and Europe but reported no travel since that time outside of eastern and south central Montana. During the 2 weeks before illness onset, he reported mowing grass in a pasture and attending a local rodeo. He did not report any exposures to bird droppings, bat guano, caves, or potting soils.\n\nPatient 4\n---------\nA woman aged 76 years with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II experienced nasal congestion, nonproductive cough, headaches, chest pressure, shortness of breath, and wheezing on 17 Jan 2013; 4 days later, the patient was evaluated in an emergency department. She did not report any fever or myalgias. On examination, she was noted to be afebrile, had bilateral expiratory wheezing, and was hypoxic with a pulse oximetry oxygen saturation of 77 percent on room air. The patient tested positive for influenza A using a rapid diagnostic test and was hospitalized for additional care. She underwent CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with IV contrast, which revealed bibasilar patchy infiltrates along with retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy and rectal wall thickening. The patient's urine tested positive for histoplasma antigen by EIA. When discharged from the hospital, she was referred for treatment of histoplasmosis, and started on itraconazole therapy.\n\nThe patient lived in south western Montana and was a retired custodian. She enjoyed reading indoors, and engaged in no outdoor activities other than planting flowers in outdoor flowerpots each spring. She denied known exposures to bird droppings, bat guano, bat guano-containing potting soil, or caves. She reported no travel outside of Montana in the several years before her diagnosis.\n\nEditorial note\n--------------\n3 of 4 patients with diagnosed histoplasmosis reported no recent travel and likely acquired their infections in Montana. Although patient 1 likely acquired her infection in Montana before traveling out of state, the possibility also exists that she acquired infection in California following exposure to bat guano-containing potting soil. Each of the 4 patients had immunocompromising conditions present before symptom onset, increasing their risk for _H. capsulatum_ disease (2). Patient 2 might have acquired infection during a cave exploration-related bat guano exposure. The lack of recent travel history to recognized areas with histoplasmosis endemicity likely contributed to diagnostic delays for 3 patients; of these, 2 patients also had unusual clinical presentations, likely further contributing to diagnostic delays.\n\n_H. capsulatum_ culture from body fluids and tissues provides the strongest evidence of histoplasmosis, but is insensitive (8). Patient 3 was diagnosed after _H. capsulatum_ isolation from a pulmonary nodule biopsy. The absence of recent travel outside of Montana for this patient suggests that the infection was acquired in Montana. Clinical evidence for patients 2 and 4 suggests their Histoplasma infections also were acquired in Montana.\n\nPatients 1 and 2 were diagnosed by histopathology performed by different pathologists. Histopathology provides presumptive evidence of infection, but specificity depends on pathologist experience (8). Urine antigen detection also is used to diagnose disseminated histoplasmosis (2,8,9), but its sensitivity is greater among immunocompromised persons (93.1 per cent compared with 73.3 per cent) (9). The specificity of urine EIA for histoplasmosis has been shown to be 99 per cent in both healthy and immunocompromised persons (8,9), although false-positives are possible among patients with other endemic fungal infections (2). Why patients 1 and 2 had negative urine EIA tests following histopathologic diagnoses is unclear. Although patient 2 likely was immunocompromised when he developed disease, his immune system might have recovered by the time of EIA testing.\n\nThe recognized zone of histoplasmosis endemicity extends from the Ohio River Valley west into North Dakota and South Dakota (6). States further west, including Montana, are not typically considered areas where histoplasmosis is endemic. However, 2 recently published studies provide limited data that histoplasmosis endemicity might extend into Montana and other western states (5,10). The 4 cases described in this report provide additional evidence that histoplasmosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of clinically compatible illness in Montana residents.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. First, confirmation of the diagnosis by isolation of _H. capsulatum_ in culture was not performed for 3 patients. Second, the source of each patient's infection could not be determined with certainty; patient 1 likely acquired her infection in Montana, but also could have acquired her infection from exposure to bat guano-containing potting soil in California. Similarly, one or more patients might have had reactivation of latent disease after _H. capsulatum_ infection acquired from an area when histoplasmosis was endemic many years before symptom onset. Environmental studies could help determine if _H. capsulatum_ is endemic in Montana (5,6).\n\nA total of 3 patients experienced diagnostic delays, likely in part because none reported recent travel to areas where _H. capsulatum_ is endemic. Health-care providers should be aware of the possibility of _H. capsulatum_ in Montana and the potential for histoplasmosis in patients with clinically compatible illnesses, even in the absence of a history of travel outside of Montana.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The exposure could have been years and even decades before. I personally participated in the care of a patient with disseminated histoplasmosis whose sole exposure was riding across the USA on a troop train during World War II, fully 35 years before presentation.\n\nAs a review, the following was obtained from Medscape (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/299054-overview#showall):\n\n'_Histoplasma capsulatum_ is a dimorphic fungus that remains in a mycelial form at ambient temperatures and grows as yeast at body temperature in mammals. Infection causes histoplasmosis. Although the fungus that causes histoplasmosis can be found in temperate climates throughout the world, it is endemic to the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys in the United States. Internationally, the fungus is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central America, eastern and southern Europe, and parts of Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia.\n\n'The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp environment with high organic content that is good for mycelial growth. Highly infectious soil is found near areas inhabited by bats and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been associated with construction and renovation activities that disrupt contaminated soil. In addition, travelers to endemic areas are at risk for histoplasmosis because airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet.\n\n'Most individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who develop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are exposed to a high quantity of inoculum. _Histoplasma_ species may remain latent in healed granulomas and recur, if there is impairment of cell-mediated immunity.\n\n'Approximately 90 per cent of patients are asymptomatic. If symptoms develop, onset occurs 3-14 days after exposure. Fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, abdominal pain, and chills are common symptoms; usually, histoplasmosis is self-limited. Individuals exposed to a large inoculum may develop severe dyspnea resulting from diffuse pulmonary involvement. Joint pain and skin lesions occur in 5-6 per cent of patients, mostly in females. Enlarged hilar [the hilum is part of a gland or organ through which ducts, nerves, or blood vessels enter and leave] and mediastinal lymph nodes are present in 5-10 per cent of patients. Cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and/or chest pain may be present and are related to the degree of compression on the pulmonary airway and circulation. Paratracheal involvement may cause cough or dyspnea because of compression on the trachea or bronchi.'\n\nIf 4 cases were diagnosed, since most cases are asymptomatic, there should have been many more infected Montanans. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/64j_.]", "summary": "Second, the source of each patient's infection could not be determined with certainty; patient 1 likely acquired her infection in Montana, but also could have acquired her infection from exposure to bat guano-containing potting soil in California.

Histoplasmosis, which can be acquired from\nsoil contaminated with bird or bat droppings, occurs worldwide and is\none of the most common pulmonary and systemic mycoses in the USA (1).\nHowever, among international travelers returning from areas in which\nhistoplasmosis is endemic, histoplasmosis is rare, accounting for\nless than 0.5 percent of all diseases diagnosed in this group (1,2).\n\nDuring February-March 2008, the Pennsylvania and Virginia departments\nof health investigated a cluster of respiratory illness among 3\nmission groups that had traveled separately to El Salvador to\nrenovate a church. This report summarizes the results of the\ninvestigation. Of 33 travelers in the 3 mission groups for whom\ninformation was available, 20 (61 percent) met the case definition\nfor histoplasmosis.\n\nPersons who reported sweeping and cleaning outdoors (relative risk\n(RR) = 2.1, 95 percent confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-3.6), digging\n(RR = 2.6, CI = 1.1-6.1), or working in a bird or bat roosting area\n(RR = 1.8, CI = 1.3-2.4) had a greater risk for illness. The\nfindings emphasize the need for travelers and persons involved in\nconstruction activities to use personal protective equipment and\ndecrease dust-generation when working in areas where histoplasmosis\nis endemic. Clinicians should consider histoplasmosis as a possible\ncause of acute respiratory or influenza-like illness in travelers\nreturning from areas in which histoplasmosis is endemic.\n\nOn 13 Feb 2008, the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH)\nnotified the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) of a cluster of 9\npersons with respiratory illness. The 9 persons were among 11 members\nof a Pennsylvania-based mission group who had been renovating a\nchurch in Nueva San Salvador, El Salvador, during 20-27 Jan 2008. 2\nother mission groups, from Virginia (16 members) and from\nPennsylvania (8 members), had traveled separately to assist with\nrenovations of the same church during 3-10 Jan 2008 and 2-10 Feb\n2008, respectively. After arrival, mission members immediately began\nrenovation activities at the church. Renovation projects varied among\nthe mission groups and included cleaning of indoor and outdoor\nrenovation sites, electrical and plumbing installation, construction\nof additional rooms, roof replacement, and septic tank excavation.\nMission members remained in El Salvador for the entire trip, but also\nvisited local markets and churches and took a 1 day trip to either a\nbeach or lake.\n\nThe initial report from PADOH indicated that all 9 persons from the\ninitial cluster, upon returning from El Salvador, had presented to\ntheir health-care providers with respiratory symptoms. One of these\npersons was diagnosed with suspected histoplasmosis based on physical\nexam and a chest radiograph. To search for additional cases of\nillness among the mission groups, PADOH and VDH contacted the trip\norganizers and leaders.\n\nA case of histoplasmosis was defined as 1) a laboratory-confirmed _H.\ncapsulatum_ infection or 2) self-reported fever and 2 additional\nsymptoms (i.e., headache, cough, chest pain, or difficulty breathing)\nbeginning at least 24 hours after arrival in El Salvador, in any\nmission group member who traveled to El Salvador during 3 Jan - 10\nFeb 2008. Laboratory-confirmation was defined as either a urine or\nserum _Histoplasma_ antigen enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test result\nof greater than 0.6 ng/mL.\n\nAll participants from each mission group were administered a standard\nquestionnaire through their church pastors or through telephone\ninterviews. Information collected included demographics, illness,\nunderlying health conditions, protective measures used, and potential\nexposures. Medical records of hospitalized patients also were\nreviewed, and a retrospective cohort study of the mission members was\nconducted.\n\nStatistical differences between proportions were assessed using\nchi-square and Fisher's exact tests of significance, when\nappropriate. Mean ages were compared using a t-test. Relative risk\nand 95 percent confidence interval estimates were calculated using\nPoisson regression analysis with robust variance.\n\nInformation was collected from 33 (94 percent) of the 35 mission\ngroup participants. 20 persons (12 males and 8 females) met the case\ndefinition for histoplasmosis, for an overall attack rate of 61\npercent. The 20 cases included histoplasmosis in 5 (36 percent) of 14\npersons from the Virginia mission group, 9 (82 percent) of 11 persons\nfrom the 1st Pennsylvania mission group, and 6 (75 percent) of 8\npersons from the 2nd Pennsylvania mission group (Figure [for figure\nand tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). 7 (35 percent) of the 20 ill\npersons met the case definition through laboratory-confirmed\nhistoplasmosis based on urine specimens tested by EIA. The other 13\n(65 percent) ill persons met the case definition through the symptom\ncriteria, but 8 of these 13 persons had urine specimens that tested\nnegative by EIA. No participants had paired serologic antibody test\nresults available. Median time from symptom onset to specimen\ncollection date was 6 days (range: 1-28 days).\n\nIncubation periods could not be calculated because exact dates of\nexposure were not available; however, the median number of days\nbetween arriving in El Salvador and onset of symptoms was 12 (range:\n3-25 days). Primary symptoms reported among the 20 ill persons\nmeeting the case definition included fatigue (100 percent), fever or\nchills (95 percent), and headache (95 percent) (Table 1). 19 (95\npercent) of the 20 ill persons visited a health-care provider, and 6\n(30 percent) required hospitalization for their illness; all\nsubsequently recovered. Because the clinical manifestation of\nhistoplasmosis partly depends on the underlying health and immune\nstatus of the host, mission members were asked about their underlying\nmedical conditions. 3 ill persons reported a history of cancer, none\nreported a history of chronic lung disease, and none were current smokers.\n\nDifferences in age (p=0.13), sex (p=0.44), and membership in mission\ngroup (p=0.06) were not statistically significant. Digging (RR =\n2.6), sweeping or cleaning outdoors (RR = 2.1), and septic tank\nexcavation (RR = 1.7) were associated with increased risk for illness\n(Table 2). For those persons who reported 2 or 3 high-risk exposures,\ndefined as digging, sweeping indoors, or sweeping outdoors, the\nrelative risk for illness was elevated (RR = 2.6), compared with\nthose who reported no such high-risk exposures. In addition, those\npersons who worked in an area where bird or bat excrement was\nobserved or where birds or bats were roosting had a higher attack\nrate than those who did not work in such areas. Sample size was not\nsufficient to stratify the analysis by mission group. None of the\nparticipants reported wearing a mask as personal protective equipment\nwhile working at the church site.\n\n[Byline: Warren KA, Weltman A, Hanks C, et al]\n\nEditorial Note:\n---------------\n_H. capsulatum_, the fungal causative agent of histoplasmosis, is\nendemic in the midwestern and central USA, Mexico, Central and South\nAmerica, parts of eastern and southern Europe, parts of Africa,\neastern Asia, and Australia (1). The fungus grows in the soil and its\ngrowth is thought to be enhanced by bird and bat excrement.\n\nDisruption of soil that contains bird or bat excrement is the primary\nmeans of aerosolization of and exposure to spores. Several reports\nhave documented occupationally acquired outbreaks specifically\nassociated with construction or renovation activities (4,5). However,\npersons not directly involved in the soil-disruption process,\nincluding travelers in the area, also are at increased risk because\nairborne spores can travel hundreds of feet (6). A histoplasmosis\noutbreak involving approximately 250 college students visiting a\nresort hotel in Mexico was associated with ongoing construction at\nthe hotel (6).\n\nThis is the 1st report of an outbreak of histoplasmosis among\nvolunteer workers performing construction activities abroad. Evidence\ngathered during this investigation is consistent with previous\nresearch and revealed that performing outdoor activities,\nparticularly those that cause soil disruption and spore\naerosolization, increased the risk for acquiring histoplasmosis.\nSpecifically, the 2 activities with the highest relative risk for\nillness were digging and sweeping outdoors.\n\nHistoplasmosis infections typically are asymptomatic or cause mild\nsymptoms from which persons recover without antifungal or other\ntreatment; persons with more severe forms of the infection (i.e.,\nacute pulmonary, chronic pulmonary, and progressive disseminated\nhistoplasmosis) are recommended for treatment with antifungal agents,\nsuch as amphotericin B (7). In this outbreak, the high overall attack\nrate among an otherwise healthy cohort, along with illness severe\nenough to require health-care services (including hospitalization),\nsuggests substantial exposure to fungal spores during the renovation\nactivities. In addition, working in an environment harboring bird or\nbat excrement likely increased the risk for acquiring histoplasmosis.\n\nUltimately, the cause of this outbreak might be that the volunteers\nwere not aware of the risk for histoplasmosis and therefore took no\nprecautions, such as using personal protective equipment or taking\ncare to decrease dust generation when working in this area of endemic\ndisease. Although persons living or working in areas of endemic\nhistoplasmosis might have previous health education and training\nabout the risk and prevention of this disease, volunteers who travel\nto and work in these areas are likely to have limited, if any,\ntraining on disease risk and prevention.\n\nMultiple laboratory tests, including culture, histopathology,\nserology, and EIA antigen tests, can be used to diagnose\nhistoplasmosis. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests depend\non factors that include the patient's clinical syndrome, type and\ntiming of specimen collection, fungal burden, and the host's immune\nstatus (8). In general, testing of convalescent serum samples offers\nthe highest sensitivity for subacute and chronic pulmonary disease,\nand antigen testing (i.e., a quantitative, 2nd-generation EIA),\nappears to be one of the most sensitive tests for acute pulmonary\nhistoplasmosis (8). However, the EIA antigen test is less sensitive\nin milder infections when the fungal burden is lower (8,9). In this\noutbreak, 5 of 7 patients with a positive urine EIA test required\nhospitalization.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations.\n1st, information about exposures and illness were ascertained via\nself-report, which might be associated with recall bias and\nsubsequent exposure and disease misclassification. 2nd,\nmisclassification of disease status is possible, given the negative\nantigen test results and given that infection with other respiratory\npathogens (e.g., influenza virus) could not be ruled out for all ill\npersons. Finally, the majority of diagnostic specimens were tested by\nHistoplasma EIA only. Because EIA test sensitivity increases with\nincreasing illness severity (8,9), specimens collected from persons\nwith less severe disease might have tested falsely negative.\n\nPersons in areas of endemic histoplasmosis who perform certain jobs\nor activities, such as construction and farming, are at risk for\nacquiring histoplasmosis (10). Travel clinics and organizers of group\ntravel to areas of endemic histoplasmosis should be informed about\nthe risk for histoplasmosis among travelers with potential exposure\nto _H. capsulatum_. Clinicians should consider a diagnosis of\nhistoplasmosis when evaluating a patient who has acute febrile\nrespiratory illness and has traveled to an area in which\nhistoplasmosis is endemic.\n\nClinicians also should inquire about the patient's activities in the\narea of endemic disease. If histoplasmosis is suspected, consultation\nwith laboratory experts is recommended to ensure the proper\ncollection and referral of blood and urine specimens. Depending on\nthe patient's clinical presentation, antigen testing for\n_Histoplasma_, convalescent serologic testing to detect antibodies,\nor culture might be performed to diagnose histoplasmosis. Travelers\nto areas of endemic histoplasmosis who visit caves or areas with high\nconcentrations of bird or bat excrement, or who perform\ndust-generating activities, should consider using personal protective\nequipment (e.g., respirators) and dust-suppression strategies (e.g.,\nkeeping surfaces wet) to reduce their potential exposure to _H. capsulatum_.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Infection causes histoplasmosis. Although the\nfungus that causes histoplasmosis can be found in temperate climates\nthroughout the world, it is endemic to the Ohio, Missouri, and\nMississippi River valleys in the United States. Internationally, the\nfungus is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central\nAmerica, eastern and southern Europe, and parts of Africa, eastern\nAsia, and Australia.\n\nThe soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp\nenvironment with high organic content that is good for mycelial\ngrowth. Highly infectious soil is found near areas inhabited by bats\nand birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit\nthe disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby\nenriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can\nbecome infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through droppings.\nContaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Outbreaks\nof histoplasmosis have been associated with construction and\nrenovation activities that disrupt contaminated soil. In addition,\ntravelers to endemic areas are at risk for histoplasmosis because\nairborne spores can travel hundreds of feet.\n\nMost individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who\ndevelop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are\nexposed to a high quantity of inoculum. _Histoplasma_ species may\nremain latent in healed granulomas and recur, if there is impairment\nof cell-mediated immunity.\n\nApproximately 90 percent of patients are asymptomatic. If symptoms\ndevelop, onset occurs 3-14 days after exposure. Fever, headache,\nmalaise, myalgia, abdominal pain, and chills are common symptoms;\nusually, histoplasmosis is self-limited. Individuals exposed to a\nlarge inoculum may develop severe dyspnea resulting from diffuse\npulmonary involvement. Joint pain and skin lesions occur in 5-6\npercent of patients, mostly in females. Enlarged hilar and mediastinal\nlymph nodes are present in 5-10 percent of patients. Cough,\nhemoptysis, dyspnea, and/or chest pain may be present and are related\nto the degree of compression on the pulmonary airway and circulation.\nParatracheal involvement may cause cough or dyspnea because of\ncompression on the trachea or bronchi.'\n\nAfrican histoplasmosis is a systemic infection caused by the fungus\n_Histoplasma capsulatum_ var. _duboisii_ which occurs, with very few\nexceptions, only on the central part African continent, most commonly\nin west and central Africa, particularly Nigeria, Senegal, the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo, and Angola.

Humans are\ninfected by inhalation of the mycelial fragments and microconidia of the\norganism. After the emergence of HIV infection, histoplasmosis has become\none of many troublesome opportunistic infections among patients with AIDS.\nPatients receiving immunosuppressive agents are also predisposed to _H.\ncapsulatum_ infection (1). Although the organism is found worldwide, cases\nof histoplasmosis are rarely encountered in Taiwan; only a few, imported,\ncases have been reported in this decade (2-7). We report the 1st indigenous\ncase of disseminated histoplasmosis in Taiwan.\nIn November 2005, a 78 year old man with underlying rheumatoid arthritis\nwas sent to the emergency department with generalized weakness and poor\nappetite of several weeks' duration. He had received oral therapy with\nprednisolone (5mg twice daily), hydroxychloroquine (200mg twice daily),\nsulfasalazine (1000mg twice daily), and methotrexate (MTX) (15mg weekly)\nfor 4 months. Physical examination disclosed mild icteric sclera and\nmultiple ecchymoses on the extremities. A chest radiograph showed bilateral\ninterstitial micronodules and a fibrocalcified pattern. Abdominal\nultrasonography indicated splenomegaly. The patient was admitted with the\ntentative diagnosis of MTX-induced thrombocytopenia.\nBone marrow aspiration (figure 1 [see original URL. - Mod.LL]) and biopsy\nwere performed because of refractory thrombocytopenia and the presence of\nyoung blood cells on the peripheral blood smears. Intravenous amphotericin\nB (0.7 mg/kg/day) was administered because disseminated histoplasmosis was\nhighly suspected because of the bone marrow findings. Four weeks later, the\nfungal culture of the bone marrow showed growth of mold (figure 2A and B\n[see original URL. - Mod.LL]). The microorganism was subsequently\nidentified as _H. capsulatum_ by PCR assay (8). No _H. capsulatum_ was\ncultured from the patient's peripheral blood or sputum.\nConclusions:\nA variety of laboratory tests for diagnosis of histoplasmosis, including\nfungal culture, histopathology, serologic tests, antigen detection, and\nmolecular methods, have different sensitivities based on clinical\nmanifestations and host status (9). The standard for diagnosis is isolation\nof _H. capsulatum_ from culture. However, it usually requires as much as 4\nweeks to grow and has a low sensitivity rate (15 per cent) in self-limited\nhistoplasmosis. The knobby appearance of macroconidia and microconidia\nindicated by Lactophenol Cotton Blue Stain (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria,\nCA, USA) of the mold form from fungal cultures is characteristic of _H.\ncapsulatum_ (10).\nIn histopathology, histoplasmosis is impressive, with its numerous\novoid-shaped microorganisms in infected tissue. However, without sufficient\nexperience, one could misidentify _Blastomyces dermatidis_, _Candida\nglabrata_, _Cryptococcus neoformans_, _Penicillium marneffei_, _Leishmania_\nspp., _Pneumocystis jirovecii_, or _Toxoplasma gondii_ as _H. capsulatum_\n(11). Despite a characteristic form, specific DNA probing is usually\napplied for faster definitive identification (12).\nIn areas where histoplasmosis is not endemic, including Taiwan, serologic\ntests, antigen detection reagents, and specific DNA probes for diagnosis of\nhistoplasmosis are not universally available. Among serologic tests,\nimmunodiffusion and complement fixation for anti-Histoplasma antibody\ndetection are widely applied; sensitivity rates are 95-100 per cent and\n82-90 per cent for pulmonary and disseminated histoplasmosis, respectively.\nSome limitations occur, including the need for 2 to 6 weeks for antibody\nproduction after infection, impaired production of antibodies in\nimmunosuppressed patients, and presence of cross-reaction mainly due to\nparacoccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and aspergillosis (9).\nAntigen detection in serum and urine is the most useful method of\ndiagnosing histoplasmosis because it provides early diagnosis before\nculture and antibody production, monitors response of therapy, and detects\nrelapse. The sensitivity rates of antigen detected are 25-75 per cent in\npulmonary histoplasmosis and 82-95 per cent in disseminated histoplasmosis.\nCross-reactions may occur in cases of paracoccidioidomycosis,\nblastomycosis, African histoplasmosis, and _P. marneffei_ (9).\nAlthough the environment in Taiwan is suitable for _H. capsulatum_ to grow,\nhistoplasmosis has been rarely encountered. In a survey of histoplasmin\nskin tests conducted in Taiwan in the 1950s, only 7 (0.19 per cent) of 3589\nschoolchildren tested positive, and the author concluded histoplasmosis\nprobably does not exist in Taiwan or is very rare (13). The 1st possible\ncase of histoplasmosis in Taiwan was reported in 1977; however, the\ndiagnosis was doubtful because it was based only on histopathologic\nfindings in a cervical lymph node biopsy specimen, without definitive\nfungal culture or molecular identification (2).\nNo further cases of histoplasmosis were reported in Taiwan until this\ndecade, when 6 cases were reported (3-7). The clinical characteristics of\nthese cases are summarized in the appendix table [see original URL. -\nMod.LL]. All cases include a history of travel or residence outside Taiwan,\nwhere the patients might have acquired the infection; furthermore, most of\nthe patients had underlying HIV infections. Diagnoses were mostly based\nonly on histopathologic or morphologic findings in fungal cultures because\nthe serologic tests, antigen detection reagents, and commercial DNA probes\nfor diagnosis of histoplasmosis were not available in Taiwan. In contrast\nto these cases, our patient had never traveled outside Taiwan and did not\nhave an HIV infection.\nTo confirm the identification of _H. capsulatum_ on the basis of\nhistopathologic and fungal form findings, we applied a specific PCR assay\nas previously described (8), and the results were definitive.

The 1st possible\ncase of histoplasmosis in Taiwan was reported in 1977; however, the\ndiagnosis was doubtful because it was based only on histopathologic\nfindings in a cervical lymph node biopsy specimen, without definitive\nfungal culture or molecular identification (2). However, without sufficient\nexperience, one could misidentify _Blastomyces dermatidis_, _Candida\nglabrata_, _Cryptococcus neoformans_, _Penicillium marneffei_, _Leishmania_\nspp., _Pneumocystis jirovecii_, or _Toxoplasma gondii_ as _H. capsulatum_\n(11). 1st, the diagnostic rate of histoplasmosis might be\nmarkedly decreased because of the lack of serologic and antigen testing\nkits and reagents, which are useful for diagnosis of self-limited and\nnon-disseminated histoplasmosis. the patient might have had histoplasmosis for years and it became\ndisseminated because of immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis\nor 2) the patient was reinfected with the calcified lesions that resulted\nfrom prior histoplasmosis. Diagnoses were mostly based\nonly on histopathologic or morphologic findings in fungal cultures because\nthe serologic tests, antigen detection reagents, and commercial DNA probes\nfor diagnosis of histoplasmosis were not available in Taiwan. Among serologic tests,\nimmunodiffusion and complement fixation for anti-Histoplasma antibody\ndetection are widely applied; sensitivity rates are 95-100 per cent and\n82-90 per cent for pulmonary and disseminated histoplasmosis, respectively. The true\nprevalence of histoplasmosis in non-disease-endemic regions might be\nunderestimated because of the paucity of diagnostic tools and familiarity\nwith histoplasmosis. Antigen detection in serum and urine is the most useful method of\ndiagnosing histoplasmosis because it provides early diagnosis before\nculture and antibody production, monitors response of therapy, and detects\nrelapse. With increasing immunocompromised hosts resulting from\nimmunosuppressive therapy and HIV infections, as well as improved\ndiagnostic tests, histoplasmosis might be an emergent infectious disease in\nTaiwan in the future. In a survey of histoplasmin\nskin tests conducted in Taiwan in the 1950s, only 7 (0.19 per cent) of 3589\nschoolchildren tested positive, and the author concluded histoplasmosis\nprobably does not exist in Taiwan or is very rare (13). He had received oral therapy with\nprednisolone (5mg twice daily), hydroxychloroquine (200mg twice daily),\nsulfasalazine (1000mg twice daily), and methotrexate (MTX) (15mg weekly)\nfor 4 months. Some limitations occur, including the need for 2 to 6 weeks for antibody\nproduction after infection, impaired production of antibodies in\nimmunosuppressed patients, and presence of cross-reaction mainly due to\nparacoccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and aspergillosis (9).
