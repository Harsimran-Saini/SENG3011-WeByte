Both the manufacturer and the IBTS have confirmed the assay has a limit of detection for HBV of the order of 4 IU/mL. In addition, in terms of screening for HBV markers we test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen.\n\nFor clarification purposes, the transmission of HBV in this case was due to a donation obtained in the pre-ID NAT window period, when the level of HBV DNA in the donor's blood was below the limit of detection of even this extremely sensitive assay. The window period for the UE assay is of the order of just 15 days. The IBTS introduced ID NAT testing in 2009, in order to avail of this shorter window period and hence earliest possible detection of HBV infection. As mentioned in your comments, the serological window period is significantly longer.\n\nA full investigation has been conducted into this case. During this investigation it was demonstrated that the assay performed within the expected level of sensitivity. In addition, the investigation demonstrated that all aspects of laboratory testing and donor screening were satisfactory. The IBTS will continue to employ the most advanced technologies and safest screening strategy available to maintain the safety of the blood supplied to the people of Ireland.\n\n--\nDr. Niamh O'Flaherty\nConsultant Microbiologist\nIrish Blood Transfusion Service\n<Niamh.O'Flaherty@ibts.ie>\n\n[ProMED thanks Dr. O'Flaherty for the quick response.

Hepatitis C has been on the rise in the state since 2009. The spread is mostly resulting from exposure to infected blood when drug users share needles or other drug paraphernalia.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between the opioid epidemic and the surge in new cases of hepatitis B and C. Prescription pain pills are often liquefied with heat and then injected with a needle. State health officials are encouraging North Carolinians to help stop the spread of hepatitis B and hepatitis C by not sharing needles or other injection equipment and by talking to their physician or local health department about getting tested. Hepatitis B, and less often hepatitis C, can also be spread through sex with an infected partner.\n\nMost hepatitis cases in North Carolina have been in white males ages 21 to 40, with western border counties like Wilkes impacted the most. Adults born between 1945 and 1965 are also more likely to have hepatitis C. Preliminary data shows 172 new cases of hepatitis B and 186 new cases of hepatitis C were reported in North Carolina in 2016. In 2014, there were 110 new cases each of type B and type C reported. The CDC estimates the actual number of infections is likely 7 times higher than the number of reported cases of hepatitis B and 14 times higher for hepatitis C.\n\nAn estimated 110 000 to 150 000 North Carolinians have a chronic hepatitis C infection, and 25 000 to 66 000 have a chronic hepatitis B infection.

That issue leaves community leaders looking at new options to combat the consequences of the epidemic. There continues to be growing concerns that the drug abuse problem in southwest Virginia opens the region up to blood-borne pathogens, like hepatitis B and C, as well as HIV.\n\nAlice Asher is an epidemiologist for the CDC based in Atlanta. She said rural communities are beginning to report increased cases of hepatitis C, which is an infectious disease transmitted through contact with blood. 'We're just seeing communities that really didn't have hepatitis C are reporting large portions of their populations getting it. Again, it goes back to the opioid use epidemic,' Asher said.\n\nIt has been a continuing problem. In 2015, the Lenowisco Health District, consisting of Lee, Wise, and Scott Counties, a region that only makes up about 1.1 percent of Virginia's population had about 33 percent of the state's recorded hepatitis B cases. Today [Wed 28 Jun2017]; the region continues to record cases at a rate higher than the state average.\n\nIt is especially concerning to health officials because this area has a storage of doctors to treat infectious diseases. Dr Sue Cantrell said there are a few located in the Tri-Cities area or Roanoke Valley, but many people who need the services do not have the transportation to get there. Right now, they are using telemedicine services through the University of Virginia.\n\nCantrell serves as the district health director for Lenowisco and is the acting director for the Cumberland Plateau district. 'We really feel like there is a need for primary care doctors to become competent and confident that they can provide good care for people with hepatitis C,' she said.\n\nFor many of these reasons, health leaders are now trying to create an emergency response plan to be ready should the numbers increase rapidly. One consideration is to institute syringe service problems where those using IV drugs can exchange dirty needles for clean ones. A new law set to go into effect on [Sat 1 Jul 2017], makes the option legal in Virginia.\n\n'One of the really important components of a well-run syringe service program is offering ongoing screening for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV are identified as having those infections can take steps to either get treated and reduce their risk of spreading those infections to other people,' Cantrell said.\n\nAll southwest Virginia counties are eligible for the program.\n\n[Byline: Olivia Bailey]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B can be prevented by a vaccine that has been available in the USA since 1982 and has been part of universal immunization in childhood for most of that time.

The IBTS said the infection occurred after the blood donation was made in the 'window period' when the virus cannot be detected, even by the most sensitive tests available. The case is 'not an ongoing patient safety incident' and could not be attributed to a testing failure, according to Minister for Health Simon Harris. 'This is a very rare situation which the IBTS is dealing with in a sensitive manner with the patient impacted.'\n\nDr Stephen Field, IBTS medical and scientific director, described the incident as a 'rare, one in 2 million event' with no implications for blood that will be transfused to patients in the future. He said the IBTS has tested 1.2 million donations to date and 'there has been no other confirmed transfusion transmitted infection of hepatitis B.' It is possible for infected blood to pass as negative for a period of about 15 days, according to Dr Field. Similar cases have arisen in the UK and other countries.\n\nThe donated blood tested negative for the presence of hepatitis B before the transfusion, as the virus was not picked up by the screening equipment used. The IBTS said the incident 'represents a donation made in the window period when the presence of the virus cannot be consistently detected even by the most sensitive tests available.'\n\nThe red blood cells from the donation were transfused into a patient during a medical procedure, which resulted in the patient later contracting hepatitis B -- a virus that infects the liver. The Health Service Executive became aware of the issue when the original blood donor tested positive for the Hepatitis B virus, and the IBTS was informed. The blood transfusion service then carried out a follow up test of an archived sample taken from the blood donor, using the same method and the blood sample came back negative for the presence of hepatitis B.\n\nFollowing an additional DNA test of the sample results came back positive for the hepatitis B virus.\n\nThe IBTS said the patient is being managed appropriately by a medical team. Most people with normal immune systems will clear the virus, but those infected early in life are more likely to develop chronic infection. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted through exposure to infected blood and body fluids such as semen and vaginal secretions. The most common routes of transmission relate to close contact (such as sexual, mother to child, household) with an infected individual, sharing of needles for injecting drug use, or exposure to the virus in a healthcare setting.\n\n[Byline: Jack Power, Paul Cullen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[What is likely being described here is a red blood cell transfusion obtained from an asymptomatic patient with hepatitis B during the 'window period' when the standard screening test (hepatitis B surface antigen) has waned to undetectable levels but before anti-HBs (hepatitis B surface antibody) has developed. Blood transfused during this period can be infectious. ProMED would appreciate knowing if even in retrospect, the blood was positive for IgM anti-HBc (IgM antibody against hepatitis B core antigen) which, short of the HBV DNA assay, is the only HBV marker found during this period. There is an earlier 'window period' which occurs before HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) is detectable in the blood and while the patient is always asymptomatic but less information is available regarding infectivity at that stage.\n\nThe WHO publication 'Screening Donated Blood for Transfusion Transmissible Infections' published in 2010 (text and references available at http://www.who.int/bloodsafety/ScreeningDonatedBloodforTransfusion.pdf) discusses the screening of blood for transfusion for hepatitis B:\n\n'Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a member of the hepadnavirus group and is an enveloped DNA virus. HBV is transmissible by the parenteral route and may be found in blood and other body fluids. Once in the bloodstream, the virus travels to the liver where it replicates in hepatocytes.\n\nHBV is endemic globally and hyper-endemic in parts of the world. It is difficult to determine the total number of cases of transfusion-transmitted HBV globally.\n\nTransmissibility: While HBV is present in the bloodstream, the levels of the virus itself are variable. In recently infected individuals, viral DNA is normally present, although not always at high levels. Chronically infected individuals may either be infectious (viral DNA present) or non-infectious (viral DNA absent) and viremia would generally be expected to be very low or absent entirely. Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) indicates infection with HBV, but does not in itself distinguish between recent and chronic infections.\n\nThe distinction between acute and chronic infection is not relevant to blood screening; all HBsAg positive donations should be considered to be at high risk of transmitting HBV and should not be released for transfusion. Additionally, some studies indicate that even when HBsAg is negative, some individuals may have low levels of detectable viral DNA which will be transmitted by blood and may cause infection in the recipient.\n\nThe use of unscreened HBV-infected blood and blood products will result in the transmission of HBV in the vast majority of cases. In general, the earlier in life that HBV is acquired, the more likely the individual is to develop chronic infection which then has a higher probability of progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nScreening: The serology of HBV is complex. A number of different serological markers develop during the course of infection, including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). In addition, HBV DNA can be detected in the majority of cases, although in HBsAg negative phases of infection the DNA levels are generally relatively low and the viremia may be transient.\n\nThe methods used to identify the presence of HBV employ the following screening targets:\nSerological markers:\n- Hepatitis B surface antigen\n- Hepatitis B core antibody, in some situations\nViral nucleic acid: HBV DNA.\n\nHepatitis B surface antigen: Hepatitis B surface antigen is the prime marker used in blood screening programs. It normally appears within three weeks after the first appearance of HBV DNA and levels rise rapidly. It can thus be detected easily by most of the highly sensitive HBsAg assays available. The presence of HBsAg may indicate current or chronic infection and thus potential infectivity. Most blood transfusion services screen donated blood for HBsAg using sensitive immunoassays. Particle agglutination assays are still available and used in some countries, although they are less sensitive than immunoassays or even simple/rapid assays.\n\nHepatitis B core antibody: Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen is produced later in acute infection, after the appearance of HBsAg, and marks the start of the immune response to HBV infection. In general, anti-HBc persists for life, irrespective of whether the infection resolves or progresses to chronicity. In the vast majority of cases of hepatitis B, the detection of anti-HBc has limited value as HBsAg is already present. In some cases, however, during the resolution of the infection, HBsAg may decline to below detectable levels. Although anti-HBs usually then appears relatively rapidly, there may be a short period of time prior to its appearance when anti-HBc is the only detectable circulating serological marker of infection, even though the individual may still have low viremia and would thus be potentially infectious [the classical HBV 'window period.' - Mod.LL]\n\nIf anti-HBc screening is introduced for routine use, it would be necessary to distinguish between individuals who are anti-HBc reactive because of previous, resolved, natural HBV infection, and are thus non-infectious, from those who have unresolved HBV infection and are thus potentially infectious. In a population with a high prevalence of infection, the number of blood donors with evidence of natural, resolved infection is likely to be significant, resulting in the potentially unnecessary discard of many blood donations. As the presence of anti-HBs is protective, anti-HBs testing of all anti-HBc reactive donations would therefore be required to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious individuals. In general, a level of anti-HBs at 100 mIU/mL is usually accepted as the minimum protective level in the context of blood screening; donations that are HBsAg negative, anti-HBc reactive with anti-HBs levels of 100 mIU/mL or more are generally considered to be safe and acceptable for release for clinical or manufacturing use.\n\nAnother important consideration is that anti-HBc assays often demonstrate a high level of non-specificity. This, together with the problems associated with the confirmation of anti-HBc reactivity, often results in a situation where anti-HBc reactivity is identified in the absence of any other markers of HBV infection and where the majority of this reactivity is actually non-specific and does not reflect HBV infection. Thus, although anti-HBc screening may have advantages in some situations, the problems associated with the performance of anti-HBc assays and the complexity of dealing with HBV immune individuals may outweigh any potential benefits.\n\nAlanine aminotransferase: Testing for raised liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels was originally introduced in some countries prior to the identification of hepatitis C and the introduction of HCV screening in an attempt to reduce the incidence of what was then called post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis (PTNANBH). ALT is an enzyme found predominantly in the liver. It circulates naturally at low levels in the bloodstream, but is released in high quantities as a result of liver damage; this is often, but not exclusively, due to viral infection.\nALT is a non-specific marker of infection. With the advent of HCV screening, screening for raised ALT levels provides no identifiable benefit in terms of improving blood safety.\n\nHepatitis B virus DNA: The detection of HBV DNA further reduces the risk of HBV transmission through the transfusion of infected blood donated during the acute window period: that is, when the results of HBsAg assays are negative, but HBV DNA is positive. Low levels of HBV DNA have also been detected in the blood of individuals after the resolution of acute HBV infection and the disappearance of HBsAg or in so-called chronic occult HBV infection.\n\nRecommendations\n---------------\nTo minimize the risk of HBV infection through the route of transfusion:\n1. Screening should be performed using a highly sensitive and specific HBsAg immunoassay (EIA/CLIA [enzyme immunoassay/chemiluminescent immunoassays]).\n2. Screening using a highly sensitive and specific HBsAg rapid assay or particle agglutination assay may be performed in laboratories with small throughput, in remote areas or in emergency situations.\n3. Screening for anti-HBc is not recommended as a routine. Countries should determine the need for anti-HBc screening based on the prevalence and incidence of HBV infection.\n4. Screening for ALT is not recommended.'\n- Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39.]", "summary": "promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[What is likely being described here is a red blood cell transfusion obtained from an asymptomatic patient with hepatitis B during the 'window period' when the standard screening test (hepatitis B surface antigen) has waned to undetectable levels but before anti-HBs (hepatitis B surface antibody) has developed.

Increase in acute hepatitis B infections -- Pasco County, Florida, 2011-2016. Notes from the field: Increase in acute hepatitis B infections -- Pasco County, Florida, 2011-2016\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn April 2016, CDC noted an increase in acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in Pasco county, Florida, through the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by HBV, which is transmitted through blood, semen, or other body fluids and is usually an acute, self-limiting illness in adults; however, some infected adults develop chronic HBV infection. HBV infection is preventable by vaccination. The Florida Department of Health (DOH-Florida) confirmed the local surveillance data; although Pasco county has fewer than half a million residents, in 2016, it had the highest number (87) and rate (17.28 per 100 000 population) of acute HBV infections among all Florida counties. From 2011 to 2016, the number of acute HBV-infected persons in Pasco County who met the national case definition* increased from 1.5 to 17.28 per 100 000 residents (p less than 0.001).\n\nIn mid-July 2016, DOH-Florida and Pasco County Department of Health (DOH-Pasco) epidemiologists initiated weekly conference calls to discuss strategies for preventing further infections within the county. Epidemiologic case surveillance data were reviewed to determine which risk factors were driving the increases in acute HBV infections. As of February 2017, among 275 cases of acute HBV infection reported in Pasco County during 2011-2016, risk factor information was ascertained for 221 (80 percent) patients. Among these, more than half (N = 113; 51 percent) reported some type of drug use, including 86 (39 percent) who reported injection drug use in the 6 months preceding symptom onset (Table, [available at the source URL above - Mod.LL]) and 42 (19 percent) who reported incarceration for 24 hours or longer during that time. Overall, 55 percent of reported HBV infections occurred in men and 45 percent in women. The observed increase in acute HBV infection related to injection drug use in Pasco county was similar to that seen in other Southern urban counties (1) and paralleled national trends in opioid use and overdose deaths (2).\n\nSince September 2016, DOH-Pasco epidemiology staff members have been collaborating with HIV and Sexually Transmitted Diseases program personnel and clinical staff to establish targeted outreach for testing and hepatitis B vaccination programs for persons at risk, including at a methadone clinic, at free health care clinics, and via a mobile medical unit operated by the Pasco County Public Defender's Office. Law enforcement personnel helped to identify areas where drug users congregate, and DOH-Pasco worked with local jails and hospitals to identify and test persons who are at the highest risk for acquiring HBV infection. These efforts have resulted in administration of more than 300 hepatitis B vaccine doses in communities with persons at high risk for infection. One local hospital is now sending specimens to CDC for molecular characterization of HBV to delineate transmission networks in the county, using CDC's Global Health, Outbreak, and Surveillance Technology (3). HBV surveillance data available for January-April 2017 indicated an 80 percent decrease in the number of acute cases of HBV infection compared with the same period in 2016. The decline likely represents a saturation of HBV among risk populations, the impact of hepatitis B vaccination and other interventions, or a combination of these factors. Pasco county is continuing enhanced HBV surveillance and prevention activities.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal, Wolters Kluwer Health's journal, Medical Journal of Dr D Y Patel University, calls for a 'rigorous review of the deaths following vaccination with PV [1].'\n\nThe pentavalent [vaccine] is a combination of DPT vaccine and two more vaccines, [one] against Haemophilus Influenza type B (Hib) and [another against] Hepatitis B. In December 2011, the [PV] vaccine was introduced in India's immunisation programme to replace DPT vaccine in a staged manner with a view to add protection against Hib and Hepatitis B, without increasing the number of injections given to infants. At that time too, several public health experts had questioned the rationale behind introducing the vaccine and its adverse effects.\n\nIn their latest paper, Jacob Puliyel, head of Pediatrics, St Stephens Hospital in New Delhi, and V. Sreenivas, professor of Biostatistics at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, say sporadic reports of 'unexplained deaths' following immunisation with PV had been a matter of concern. To investigate the issue, Puliyel, Sreenivas, and their colleagues undertook a study to find out if these deaths were merely coincidental or vaccine induced. The authors obtained data of all deaths reported from April 2012 to May 2016 under the Right to Information Act.\n\nData on deaths within 72 hours of administering DPT and PV from different states were used. For the study, the authors say they assumed that all deaths within 72 hours of receiving DPT are 'natural deaths'. Using this figure as the baseline, they presumed that any increase in the number of deaths above this baseline among children receiving PV must be caused by the vaccine. 'If a state introduced PV in 2014, then data on DPT doses, PV doses, and deaths following vaccination were noted from that year on. This ensured that the deaths were all reported from the state using the same surveillance system,' they said.\n\nThe analysis of the data provided by the government revealed that there were 237 deaths within 72 hours of administering the PV - twice the death rate among infants who received DPT vaccine. Extrapolating the data, the authors say they estimated that vaccination of 26 million children each year in India would result in 122 additional deaths within 72 hours, due to the switch from DPT to PV. 'There are likely to be 7,020 to 8,190 deaths from PV each year if data from states with better reporting, namely Manipur and Chandigarh, are projected nationwide,' their report says.\n\nThe authors, however, say while the study looks at the short-term increase in deaths (within three days of vaccination) it does not calculate the potential benefits of PV on infant mortality, for example by protection against lethal diseases like _Haemophilus influenzae_. In spite of the data presented in this paper (from a large cohort) the authors point out that the evidence is merely circumstantial and 'not conclusive'. 'These findings of differential death rates between DPT and PV do call for further rigorous prospective population-based investigations,' the study concludes.\n\n[1.

Serious adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are rare. However, coincidental sudden\u2010infant\u2010death\u2010syndrome (SIDS) deaths do occur temporally associated with vaccination. In 2010, the Government of India (GoI) introduced a new standard operating procedure (SOP) to report AEFI. There have been stray newspaper reports of deaths soon after the administration of the pentavalent vaccine (PV) which was introduced by the GoI in December 2011. This study was conducted to examine if there is an epidemiological signal from the data collected passively under the new SOP. Materials and Methods: We used data provided by the GoI on the number children who received three doses of diphtheria\u2010tetanus\u2010pertussis vaccine (DTP), the number receiving PV and the number of deaths in the vaccinated within 72 h. Results: After PV was introduced in the states, 45 million infants received DTP vaccination and 25 million received PV. There were 217 deaths within 72 h after DTP was administered and 237 following PV. There were 4.8 deaths per million vaccinated with DTP (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2-5.5) and 9.6 deaths (95% CI: 8.4-10.8) per million vaccinated with PV (odds ratio 1.98 (95% CI 1.65\u20102.38) There were 4.7 additional deaths (95% CI: 3.5-5.9), per million, vaccinated with PV instead of DTP (P < 0.0001). Discussion: Deaths following DTP vaccination would include the natural rate of deaths within that window period, plus deaths if any, caused by DTP. For purposes of this study, we assumed that all the deaths associated with DTP are coincidental SIDS deaths. Taking that as the base rate of SIDS, we look for any increase in the death rate after PV. This study demonstrated an increase in reports of sudden unexplained deaths within 72 h of administering PV compared to DTP vaccine. Whether improvements in AEFI surveillance system or other factors contributed to this increase cannot be ascertained from this study. Conclusion: These findings do not warrant deviation from current vaccination schedule, but the differential death rates between DTP and PV do call for further rigorous prospective population\u2010based investigations.'\n\nPentavalent vaccine (PV) is a combined vaccine that protects against 5 diseases, namely diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis plus hepatitis B and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B (Hib) infections. PV is at present recommended by WHO and its introduction is supported by Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) funds. PV carries several different brand names (e.g., ComBE Five, Pentavac PFS, Easyfive, Pentaxim (DTaP), Shan5, and Quinvaxem) as a consequence of being manufactured by different companies.\n\nSeveral of the brands have been withdrawn temporarily: Shan5, manufactured by Shanta Biotechnic in India, was temporarily withdrawn in 2010 because of the presence of a white sediment sticking to glass vials containing Shan5 vaccine (http://www.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/shan5_who_statement_27july10.pdf). Easyfive, manufactured by Panacea, was temporarily withdrawn in 2011 due to deficiencies in quality systems found at the company's Lalru manufacturing site in India (http://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/newsstory_dtp_hepb_removed_prequal_list/en/).\n\nUnexplained deaths have been noted to be associated with PV in the past. The authors of the referenced study above cite a study by WHO that investigated sudden unexplained deaths associated with PV in Sri Lanka and Vietnam (Quinvaxem) and serious AEFI in Bhutan (Easyfive): WHO found the AEFI were unlikely to be related to the vaccine (http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/topics/pentavalent_vaccine/Jul_2013/en/). For some cases, additional clinical information (e.g., autopsies) allowed another cause of death to be identified.\n\nPV (Pentavac), manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, when introduced in India to replace DTP in 2011 (http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/topics/pentavalent_vaccine/Jul_2013/en/) was also associated with sudden unexplained deaths following its use (http://www.dadychery.org/2012/05/01/pentavalent-vaccines-part-ii-haiti/). It is apparent that several of the PV brands have been associated with sudden unexplained deaths, as some of the referenced study's authors said in an open letter to WHO in 2012, 'The reactions in India suggest that the cause of the problem is unrelated to the brand or manufacturer or lot of the vaccine' (http://www.dadychery.org/2012/05/01/pentavalent-vaccines-part-ii-haiti/). The brand or brands of PV used in the referenced study above in India are not specified in the journal article.\n\nIn the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) by the Government of India, the pentavalent vaccine comes in a liquid form in a vial that contains 10 doses. Each dose is 0.5 ml to be given by intramuscular injection (http://www.searo.who.int/india/topics/routine_immunization/Pentavalent_vaccine_Guide_for_HWs_with_answers_to_FAQs.pdf). Reconstitution with a diluent is not required with this pentavalent vaccine; use of an incorrect or contaminated diluent has led to adverse reactions with other types of vaccines.\n\nThe referenced study above compared the rate of sudden unexplained death within 72 hours following PV versus that following diphtheria\u2010tetanus\u2010pertussis (DTP) vaccine from 2012 to 2016 in different states in a large cohort, based on adverse effects following immunization (AEFI) data from the Indian government surveillance system. Deaths associated with DPT were accessed after PV was introduced in a particular Indian state to ensure that all deaths following vaccination were investigated and reported using the same type of protocol. The referenced study found unexplained deaths within 72 hours following PV to significantly exceed deaths following DTP and, although rare, the 4.7 excess deaths per million vaccinated following PV require a detailed medical explanation. - Mod.ML]\n\n[While the article in question (abstracted above) presents the summary data findings, it would be nice to see the actual data tables, disaggregated by year and State (in India) to see if there are State associations or annual associations.

The WHO Global hepatitis report, 2017 indicates that the large majority of these people lack access to life-saving testing and treatment. As a result, millions of people are at risk of a slow progression to chronic liver disease, cancer, and death.\n\n'Viral hepatitis is now recognized as a major public health challenge that requires an urgent response,' said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. 'Vaccines and medicines to tackle hepatitis exist, and WHO is committed to helping ensure these tools reach all those who need them.'\n\nIncreasing mortality, new infections\n-----------------------------------------------\nViral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015, a number comparable to deaths caused by tuberculosis and HIV. But while mortality from tuberculosis and HIV has been declining, deaths from hepatitis are on the increase.\n\nApproximately 1.75 million people were newly infected with HCV in 2015, bringing the global total of people living with hepatitis C to 71 million.\nAlthough overall deaths from hepatitis are increasing, new infections of HBV are falling, thanks to increased coverage of HBV vaccination among children. Globally, 84 percent of children born in 2015 received the 3 recommended doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Between the pre-vaccine era (which, according to the year of introduction can range from the 1980s to the early 2000s) and 2015, the proportion of children under 5 years of age with new infections fell from 4.7 percent to 1.3 percent. However, an estimated 257 million people, mostly adults born before the introduction of the HBV vaccine, were living with chronic hepatitis B infection in 2015.\n\nHepatitis B levels vary widely across WHO regions with the WHO African Region and WHO Western Pacific Region sharing the greatest burden.\n\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 6.2 percent of population (115 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 6.1 percent of population (60 million people)\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 3.3 percent of population (21 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 2 percent of population (39 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.6 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 0.7 percent of population (7 million people)\n\nToday, unsafe injections in health care settings and injecting drug use are considered to be the most common routes of HCV transmissions. HCV prevalence by WHO region is:\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 2.3 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.5 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 1 percent of population (11 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 1 percent of population (7 million people)\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 1 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 0.5 percent of population (10 million people)\n\nThere is currently no vaccine against HCV, and access to treatment for HBV and HCV is still low.\n\nWHO's Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis aims to test 90 percent and treat 80 percent of people with HBV and HCV by 2030. The report notes that just 9 percent of all HBV infections and 20 percent of all HCV infections were diagnosed in 2015. An even smaller fraction - 8 percent of those diagnosed with HBV infection (1.7 million people) were on treatment, and only 7 percent of those diagnosed with HCV infection (1.1 million people) had started curative treatment during that year [2015].\n\nHBV infection requires lifelong treatment, and WHO currently recommends the medicine tenofovir, already widely used in HIV treatment. Hepatitis C can be cured within a relatively short time using the highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).\n\n'We are still at an early stage of the viral hepatitis response, but the way forward looks promising,' said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of WHO's Department of HIV and the Global Hepatitis Programme. 'More countries are making hepatitis services available for people in need - a diagnostic test costs less than USD 1 and the cure for hepatitis C can be below USD 200. But the data clearly highlight the urgency with which we must address the remaining gaps in testing and treatment.'\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 demonstrates that despite challenges, some countries are taking successful steps to scale-up hepatitis services. China achieved high coverage (96 percent) for the timely birth dose of HBV vaccines, and reached the hepatitis B control goal of less than 1 percent prevalence in children under the age of 5 in 2015. Mongolia improved uptake of hepatitis treatment by including HBV and HCV medicines in its National Health Insurance scheme, which covers 98 percent of its population. In Egypt, generic competition has reduced the price of a 3-month cure for hepatitis C, from USD 900 in 2015, to less than USD 200 in 2016.

In a few cases, HBV reactivation in patients treated with DAA medicines resulted in serious liver problems or death.\n\nAs a result, we are requiring a Boxed Warning, our most prominent warning, about the risk of HBV reactivation to be added to the drug labels of these DAAs directing health care professionals to screen and monitor for HBV in all patients receiving DAA treatment. This warning will also be included in the patient information leaflet or Medication Guides for these medicines.\n\nDirect-acting antiviral medicines are used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, an infection that can last a lifetime. These medicines reduce the amount of HCV in the body by preventing HCV from multiplying, and in most cases, they cure HCV. Without treatment, HCV can lead to serious liver problems including cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death (see List of Direct-Acting Antivirals).\n\nHealth care professionals should screen all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection before starting treatment with DAAs, and monitor patients using blood tests for HBV flare-ups or reactivation during treatment and post-treatment follow-up. It is currently unknown why the reactivation occurs.\n\nPatients should tell your health care professional if you have a history of hepatitis B infection or other liver problems before being treated for hepatitis C. Do not stop taking your DAA medicine without first talking to your health care professional. Stopping treatment early could result in your virus becoming less responsive to certain hepatitis C medicines. Read the patient information leaflet or Medication Guide that comes with each new prescription because the information may have changed. Contact your health care professional immediately if you develop fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, yellow eyes or skin, or light-colored stools, as these may be signs of serious liver problems.\n\nWe identified 24 cases of HBV reactivation reported to FDA and from the published literature in HCV/HBV co-infected patients treated with DAAs during the 31 months from 22 Nov 2013 to 18 Jul 2016. This number includes only cases submitted to FDA, so there are likely additional cases about which we are unaware. Of the cases reported, 2 patients died and 1 required a liver transplant. HBV reactivation was not reported as an adverse event in the clinical trials submitted for the DAA approvals because patients with HBV co-infection were excluded from the trials. The trials excluded these patients in order to specifically evaluate the safety of DAAs, including their effects on the liver, in patients infected with only HCV and without the presence of another virus which affects the liver (see Data Summary).\n\nWe urge health care professionals and patients to report side effects involving DAAs and other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the 'Contact FDA' box at the bottom of the page.\n\nList of Direct-Acting Antivirals (DAAs)*\nBrand name / Active ingredient(s) / Drug Manufacturer\n-----------------------------------------------------\nDaklinza / daclatasvir / Bristol-Myers Squibb\nEpclusa / sofosbuvir and velpatasvir / Gilead Sciences\nHarvoni / ledipasvir and sofosbuvir / Gilead Sciences\nOlysio / simeprevir / Janssen\nSovaldi / sofosbuvir / Gilead Sciences\nTechnivie / ombitasvir and paritaprevir and ritonavir / Abbvie\nViekira Pak / dasabuvir and ombitasvir and paritaprevir and ritonavir / Abbvie\nViekira Pak XR / dasabuvir and ombitasvir and paritaprevir and ritonavir / Abbvie\nZepatier / elbasvir and grazoprevir / Merck Sharp Dohme\n\n*DAA regimens not requiring use in combination with interferon.

These medicines are not known to cause immunosuppression, but HBV reactivation may result from a complex interplay of host immunologic responses in the setting of infection with 2 hepatitis viruses. HBV reactivation was not reported as an adverse event during the clinical trials supporting the applications for the DAA approvals because HBV co-infection was one of the exclusion criteria. Patients with HBV co-infection were excluded in the initial phase 3 trials to allow a characterization of drug safety, including potential liver adverse reactions, in the presence of one hepatitis virus before conducting a more complicated safety evaluation of the drugs in patients infected with 2 hepatitis viruses.\n\n12 of the 24 cases eventually received antiviral treatment active against HBV, either tenofovir or entecavir. 6 cases did not report whether the patients received HBV treatment. The remaining 6 patients did not receive HBV treatment, and the reports did not contain sufficient information to assess why HBV treatment was not initiated. Treatment for HBV was reported to have been delayed in at least 5 of the 12 cases, and 1 patient died. Possible delays in HBV treatment occurred in at least 3 other cases, and 1 of these patients required a hepatic transplantation. With HBV treatment, most patients had improvement in HBV DNA, and in other signs and symptoms such as elevated transaminases, and malaise or fatigue.\n\nIn 8 of the 24 cases, when transaminases started to rise, an adverse drug reaction caused by DAA hepatotoxicity was the initial diagnosis, and the medicines were discontinued. As the condition of patients deteriorated or failed to improve, HBV reactivation was considered among the likely diagnoses. Thus, a common sequence of events was initiation of DAA-based HCV treatment, rapid drop of HCV RNA to undetectable levels within 1-2 weeks after normalization of transaminase levels (if they were elevated), followed by a rise in HBV DNA with or without increase in transaminases between weeks 4-8.\n\nThe patients who developed HBV reactivation were heterogeneous in terms of HCV genotype. These patients were also heterogeneous in terms of baseline HBV disease, fitting into 3 general categories of patients: those with detectable HBV viral load (n=7), those with positive HBsAg and undetectable HBV viral load (n=4), and those with negative HBsAg and undetectable HBV viral load (n=3). For the remaining 10 patients, HBsAg status was either not known or baseline HBV could not be interpreted.'\n\nReferences:\n1.

These patients were also heterogeneous in terms of baseline HBV disease, fitting into 3 general categories of patients: those with detectable HBV viral load (n=7), those with positive HBsAg and undetectable HBV viral load (n=4), and those with negative HBsAg and undetectable HBV viral load (n=3). HBV reactivation was not reported as an adverse event in the clinical trials submitted for the DAA approvals because patients with HBV co-infection were excluded from the trials. In a few cases, HBV reactivation in patients treated with DAA medicines resulted in serious liver problems or death. These medicines are not known to cause immunosuppression, but HBV reactivation may result from a complex interplay of host immunologic responses in the setting of infection with 2 hepatitis viruses. For the remaining 10 patients, HBsAg status was either not known or baseline HBV could not be interpreted.'\n\nReferences:\n \n\nWe urge health care professionals and patients to report side effects involving DAAs and other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the 'Contact FDA' box at the bottom of the page. Possible delays in HBV treatment occurred in at least 3 other cases, and 1 of these patients required a hepatic transplantation. The remaining 6 patients did not receive HBV treatment, and the reports did not contain sufficient information to assess why HBV treatment was not initiated. Stopping treatment early could result in your virus becoming less responsive to certain hepatitis C medicines. Of the cases reported, 2 patients died and 1 required a liver transplant.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "hepatitis b", "hepatitis c", "hepatitis d"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-01-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2016-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "HBsAg", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Courjon J ,", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4480806", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis B - Uganda (02)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4480806", "date": "2016-09-11 17:03:10", "main_text": "HEPATITIS B - UGANDA (02)\n*************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 10 Sep 2016\nSource: NTV [edited]\nhttp://ntv.co.ug/news/health/10/sep/2016/hepatitis-b-epidemic-affects-hundreds-families-northern-uganda-14157#sthash.aiIgqo99.dpbs\n\n\nLocal leaders are now calling on government to embark on a mass vaccination in northern Uganda to control the spread of hepatitis B, which has become endemic in northern Uganda and has wreaked havoc in many families, forcing children out of school.\n\nA resident of Pebuka in Alebtong district are among those for whom the disease has had far-reaching impact.

Through 1 Sep 2016, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported 29 cases of acute hepatitis B, more than twice as many as the 12 cases that occurred in 2014. In a typical year, Maine would have fewer than 10 hepatitis B cases. So far in 2016, Maine has a rate of 2.2 hepatitis B cases per 100 000 persons, more than twice the national average in 2014, the most recent year for which federal statistics are available. Of the cases, 11 were in Penobscot County, 5 in Hancock County, and the remaining counties had 2 or fewer cases each.\n\nThe Maine CDC says sharing needles is a major risk factor for hepatitis B, a viral infection that causes liver damage, with symptoms that include fever, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, dark urine and jaundice. During a May update on hepatitis B, nearly 90 percent of those infected were IV drug users, according to the Maine CDC.\n\nJohn Martins, Maine CDC spokesman, said the state is accelerating its public education on hepatitis B and encouraging vaccination. Adults can be vaccinated for hepatitis B, and there are 13 locations across the state that offer free vaccinations. 'The Viral Hepatitis Program has been active with many projects, including the distribution of materials to educate (health care) providers on prevention, testing and immunization requirements. There have been vaccination clinics and other training activities as well,' Martins said in an email response to questions.\n\nThe state epidemiologist, Dr. Siiri Bennett, wasn't available for comment Fri [2 Aug 2016].\n\nMaine experienced a record 272 drug overdose deaths in 2015 - most caused by heroin or the abuse of prescription opioids - and the state this year [2016] is on pace to break last year's record, with 189 cases through 30 Jun [2016]. Dr. Dora Anne Mills, vice president of clinical affairs at the University of New England and a former Maine CDC director, said needle exchange programs and vaccinations should be boosted as much as possible to limit the spread of hepatitis B. 'This disease is entirely preventable,' Mills said. 'To vaccinate would cost pennies compared to the cost of treating hepatitis B.'\n\nMills said the needle exchange programs - where users can get access to clean needles - are effective and should be expanded. Currently, Maine has needle exchange programs in Portland, Augusta, Ellsworth, Bangor, Machias and Lewiston. A bill encouraging the expansion of needle exchange programs was approved by the Legislature this year [2016] and survived a veto by Gov. Paul LePage, but so far there have not been any new needle exchange programs created. The bill originally included USD75 000 in funding to expand needle exchange programs, but the funding was later stripped from the bill. 'They are very efficient at not only reducing the risk for hepatitis C, B and HIV, but also helping people get into treatment,' Mills said.\n\nDr. Caroline Teschke, director of India Street Clinical Services in Portland, which runs the needle exchange program, said the program helps, but it's difficult to prove how many cases have been prevented. She said those who come in to get needles are encouraged to get vaccinations if they haven't previously been immunized. 'It is extremely important that anyone at risk of infectious hepatitis get this vaccination,' Teschke said. 'We do a lot of public education and pass out personal hygiene kits. You can also get hepatitis B by sharing toothbrushes.'\n\n[Byline: Joe Lawlor]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since hepatitis B (unlike HIV or hepatitis C) can be prevented by vaccination, it would be interesting to know the immunization status of the acute HBV cases.

According to the Maine Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 15 cases of acute hepatitis B were confirmed in Maine between 1 Jan 2016 and 16 May 2016, a rate of 1.1 cases per 100 000 persons.\n\nThe primary risk factor for new cases of acute hepatitis B in Maine in 2016 is injection drug use. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is 100 times more infectious than HIV and 10 times more infectious than hepatitis C virus. In addition, HBV can survive on open air surfaces for up to 7 days and in sealed containers for up to 3 months. If individuals are injecting drugs, it is important that they maintain their own injection kit and do not: Share injection equipment; Inject others and then inject self or; Inject on contaminated surfaces.\n\nHealth officials say that persons at high risk for hepatitis B should be screened and vaccinated for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, if susceptible. In addition, patients diagnosed with hepatitis C should be vaccinated for hepatitis A and B.\n\nNo cost hepatitis A and B vaccine is available for high risk patients through the Maine CDC Adult Viral Hepatitis Program in 13 counties.

'We're worried about it, and the state is also worried about it,' she said. 'Once you get it, you have it forever. There's not a lot that can be done, so prevention is a big thing.'\n\nThe reality is if Swain County Health Department saw 21 cases in 2015, there are probably many more cases that are going unreported. Frost added that hepatitis B can also be passed from mother to baby. 'Most people don't know they have it so they can pass along to others,' she said. 'People only go to the ER when they're sick, so they're passing it around without knowing. There's no telling how many cases go unreported.'\n\nUnfortunately, Frost said there is probably a strong correlation between the increase in hepatitis cases and the drug problems plaguing Swain and other communities.\n\nHepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. According to the CDC, it is transmitted when blood, semen, or another body fluid from a person infected with the virus enters the body of someone who is not infected. This can happen through sexual contact; sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment; or from mother to baby at birth. The virus can affect people differently -- some people have an acute, or short-term, illness but others can get a long-term, chronic infection. Risk for chronic infection is related to age at infection. The CDC reports that about 90 percent of infected infants become chronically infected, compared with 2 to 6 percent of adults. Chronic hepatitis B can lead to serious health issues, like cirrhosis or liver cancer.\n\nAccording to the CDC, chronic HBV infection results in an estimated 2000 to 4000 deaths per year in the USA. There are several antiviral medications for persons with chronic infection but there is no cure. The good news is there is a vaccine to prevent HBV.\n\n[Byline: Jessi Stone]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although not specifically stated, it is likely that the report is referring to new cases of acute hepatitis B infection rather that the discovery of cases of chronic infection.

In a statement issued here, the Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) said that unvaccinated healthcare workers were responsible for the spread of the virus.

'Majority of our doctors, nurses and paramedics are not vaccinated against HBV as they have not been offered. Some of them have been partially immunized and quite a few have received all 3 doses of vaccine but have not checked their antibody titer to confer 100 percent protection,' claimed Dr. Hassan.\n\nAlthough, he said, HBV vaccine is currently administered to all children and infants as part of universal immunization program but majority of adults especially those at high risk are unprotected and should be vaccinated. Blood banks, unsafe therapeutic injections and unhygienic dental clinics continue to be important modes of transmission, he said.\n\nAn estimated 2 billion persons worldwide have been infected and more than 400 million are chronic carriers of which 40 million are in India.\n'The best way to protect high risk groups is vaccination and it is obligatory on state to vaccinate HCWs on priority to protect public health,'\nhe added.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HeathMap Alert\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[No direct information is given to support the alleged nosocomial transmission.\n\nAs previously noted regarding this 'outbreak' of hepatitis B, it is difficult to assess how many of the patients have acute hepatitis B and how many have chronic infection when diagnosed. They can be differentiated serologically by the presence of IgM anti-hepatitis B core antigen in the blood in acute cases. When hepatitis B is acquired in adulthood, generally 5-10 percent of those affected will be chronic carriers with a risk of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. However, if the disease is acquired neonatally from vertical transmission from infected mother to neonate, the risk of that individual being a chronic carrier can be 95 percent. The hepatitis B vaccine is quite effective and safe in preventing infection. In chronically infected individuals, there are a number of medications that can be useful in treatment include lamivudine, tenofovir, and adefovir, all used in HIV treatment as reverse transcriptase inhibitors.\n\nSpread of hepatitis B in the health care setting can occur from provider to patient and vice versa. Overall the HBV carrier rate in the country is around 4 percent but it is unclear how many of these are health care professionals. Unlike airborne spread diseases, HBV requires parenteral transmission in the health care setting and, at least in the developed world, is by far more likely to be transmitted from patients to health care workers than the reverse.

Six chronic carriers of hepatitis B were identified: 2 surgeons, 1 dialysis nurse, 1 pediatric ICU nurse, 1 pharmacist and 1 orderly. Three of the six were HBeAg-positive. Two of the HBeAg-positive chronic carriers also had circulating hepatitis B virus DNA and accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total patient contacts. Two hundred thirteen patients were exposed 450 times to these six hepatitis B carrier staff without evidence of hepatitis B acquisition over a 6-month follow up. One-hundred nineteen control patients, exposed 789 times to noncarrier health care deliverers, were also negative. Another 33 patients were exposed to three additional individuals who were in the prodrome of acute hepatitis B: an intensive care nurse, a dental hygienist and a medical student. These patients showed no evidence of hepatitis B during 6 months of follow-up, nor did 25 separate control patients. Thus, 246 patients were exposed a total of 483 times to nine health care personnel who had either acute or chronic hepatitis B. No evidence of hepatitis B transmission was found. One-hundred forty-four controls revealed similar results after 814 exposures. Based on the number of exposures to chronic carriers alone, the risk of hepatitis B transmission is estimated to be less than 1%. Our data suggest that, with observation of appropriate hospital technique, the risk of hepatitis B transmission by health care workers is relatively low, even in the high risk settings of surgery or renal dialysis performed by an HBeAg-positive hepatitis B virus DNA-positive carrier. Available accumulated data do not support the automatic exclusion of chronic HBsAg carrier health care workers from any area of primary patient care.'\n\nNevertheless, the HBV immunization of health care workers and the appropriate use of infection control to prevent blood to blood exposures in the nosocomial setting will decrease transmission in this arena.\n\nMaps of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46718. - Mod.LLbbbb]", "summary": "Our data suggest that, with observation of appropriate hospital technique, the risk of hepatitis B transmission by health care workers is relatively low, even in the high risk settings of surgery or renal dialysis performed by an HBeAg-positive hepatitis B virus DNA-positive carrier. -----------\n'A prospective study was designed to determine the risk of hepatitis B transmission from health care deliverers to patients in the hospital setting.

The person, 28, was indicted on charges of tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit, federal officials announced Tuesday, 16 Feb 2016.\n\nThe indictment accuses the former employee of Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, Colorado, of tampering with a syringe containing pain medication there and knowingly acquiring the medication 'by deception and subterfuge.' He did so, officials allege, 'with reckless disregard for the risk that another person will be placed in danger of bodily injury, and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to such risk.'\n\nEarlier in February 2016, Swedish Medical Center said a former employee could have exposed patients to hepatitis and HIV, but did not name the employee or detail how the patients could have been put at risk. The employee, officials said, could have stolen narcotic pain medication intended for patients. The hospital said about 2900 patients should get tested for the viruses, adding that it had no evidence of any patient exposure but wanted to be cautious.\n\nAccording to state regulators, the former employee allegedly removed a syringe containing the pain medication fentanyl from an anesthesia cart and replaced it with another labeled syringe 'in the beginning stages of a surgical procedure' on 22 Jan 2016. Prosecutors say the replacement syringe contained another substance. The former employee's urine later tested positive for fentanyl, regulators said in an order suspending his license in January 2016.\n\nA lawyer says he is representing 14 people who are among the former surgery patients the hospital said should get tested.

The research, released by the CDC on Thu, 28 Jan 2016, found that acute hepatitis B rose 114 percent in Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia from 2009-2013, even as incidence remained stable nationally. Injection drugs were a factor in 3/4 of cases in those states from 2010 onward.\n\n'I wish I could say this is a surprise, but it's not,' said Van Ingram, executive director of the Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy. 'All of the blood-borne pathogens are a concern because of how they spread ...9 in 10 people who abuse prescription pills or heroin are injecting them intravenously, and many are using dirty needles.'\n\nHepatitis B spreads when someone comes in contact with blood, semen or other bodily fluids from an infected person. For some patients, it's a short-term illness, but others develop long-term, chronic infections. The CDC study found a total of 3305 cases of acute hepatitis B in the 3 Appalachian states from 2006-2013. About 2.2 million Americans live with chronic hepatitis B, which can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.\n\nUnlike hepatitis C, which can be spread in similar ways, hepatitis B can be prevented with a vaccine, which is recommended for infants at birth, people with multiple sex partners and injection drug users, among others. But federal surveys show that hepatitis B vaccination coverage is low among adults nationally. Researchers say they fear the rising hepatitis B cases in Appalachia could foreshadow a larger, national problem. Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the USA, federal statistics show, with more than 47 000 drug overdose deaths in 2014, about 19 000 linked to prescription pain pills and 10 600 tied to heroin.\n\nCDC researchers also pointed to a large outbreak of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in the rural southeastern Indiana county of Scott in 2015. With 185 cases, it was Indiana's worst-ever HIV outbreak, fueled mostly by addicts shooting up the powerful painkiller Opana (oxymorphone). Health officials say it's essential to work on preventing blood-borne diseases among addicts in hard-hit states and across the nation.\n\n'The increase in (hepatitis B infections in Appalachia) has the potential to impede the nation's hepatitis B elimination strategy,' researchers wrote in the study, adding that better vaccination coverage, testing for the disease, and educational campaigns targeting addicts 'are urgently needed.'\n\nStates in the study have been trying to prevent further spread of the disease. Tennessee has partnered with county jails since 2012 to increase hepatitis B vaccination among inmates. West Virginia has collaborated with addiction centers on hepatitis prevention training and is establishing a pilot hepatitis B vaccination project in the 17 counties with the highest incidence. And Kentucky has boosted awareness campaigns and education for health care providers.\n\nIn addition, the Kentucky General Assembly in 2015 passed a law giving local communities the authority to institute needle exchange programs, which Ingram called an important weapon in the fight against hepatitis B and C and HIV. Louisville and Lexington have already started exchanges, and Ingram said they've been approved in 3 counties in other parts of the state.\n\nHealth officials also expect to see more programs nationally, since Congress effectively lifted the nation's long-standing ban on federal funding for needle exchange programs. Though the funds still can't be used for syringes themselves, they can go toward the costlier expenses associated with these programs, such as staff, vans, and substance abuse counseling. 'These programs do more than just give out needles,' Ingram said.\n\n[Byline: Laura Ungar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The age range of the cases would be of interest, since universal vaccination of newborn infants began in 1991 with adolescent recommendations following, although vaccination was available commercially beginning in 1982.

Our study has found that a large number of monks have been infected by the virus,' said noted specialist PK Agrawal, talking to TOI. 'The virus is primarily bloodborne or sexually transmitted.

Those born after 1993 would be at low risk of hepatitis B because the Centre made it compulsory to vaccinate them. Older citizens, however, are still at risk and need to be targeted.\n\nMeanwhile, Doon Women Hospital has also confirmed that, on an average 1 patient is diagnosed with the virus every day at the hospital and if awareness is not spread the disease might become an epidemic. 'Hepatitis B can be deadlier than AIDS because people are not aware that the end result of the virus is cancer. In the initial stage, mild jaundice is observed among the patients followed by cirrhosis in liver and then carcinoma, said Sunita Singh, senior pathologist at the hospital. 'The virus has a higher chance of spreading through all the surgical interventions where blood is involved, even in hospitals. Awareness is crucial,' Singh added. According to her, all the women diagnosed with the virus in the hospital had contracted it from their husbands, showing the fast pace at which hepatitis B was spreading.\n\nPK Agrawal has claimed that he has identified cases from the age group of 4 to 80. 'Clearly, age has no relevance and the best solution is to get immediately vaccinated,' he said. As per experts, the virus is fast spreading among Jaunsari and Muslim communities because of their tradition of multiple partners and less awareness about the virus. Experts feel that in the coming days, hepatitis B will be a major killer as far as communicable diseases are concerned.\n\n[Byline: Shivani Azad]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from Healthmap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In many reports such as this, it is difficult to assess how many of the patients have acute hepatitis B and how many have chronic infection when diagnosed. They can be differentiated serologically by the presence of IgM anti-hepatitis B core antigen in the blood in acute cases. When hepatitis B is acquired in adulthood, generally 5-10 percent of those affected will be chronic carriers with a risk of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. However, if the disease is acquired neonatally from vertical transmission from infected mother to neonate, the risk of that individual being a chronic carrier can be 95 percent. The hepatitis B vaccine is quite effective and safe in preventing infection. In chronically infected individuals, there are a number of medications that can be useful in treatment include lamuvidine, tenofovir and adefovir, all used in HIV treatment as reverse transcriptase inhibitors.\n\nDehradun is the capital of the Indian state of Uttarakhand in northern India, which can be seen on a map at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttarakhand#/media/File:India_Uttarakhand_locator_map.svg - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/321.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from Healthmap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In many reports such as this, it is difficult to assess how many of the patients have acute hepatitis B and how many have chronic infection when diagnosed.

There was a 25 percent increase in the number of people diagnosed with hepatitis C in the ACT in 2013 and a 5 percent increase in hepatitis B cases. The blood-borne viruses cause inflammation of the liver, and can be spread through the sharing of drug-taking equipment, like unsterilized syringes or needles.

'That's an age point of 40 years of age, at which there's a an increase of liver cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer and early death.'\n\nMr Didlick said there should be greater awareness of the vaccines for hepatitis A and B, and testing for hepatitis needed to be ramped up. 'A diagnosis of hepatitis C, or any other blood-borne virus, can lead to better management, and also the prevention of onward transmission.'But Mr Didlick said those at risk of hepatitis often do not seek treatment, due to the stigma surrounding the viruses in the community.\n\n'People living with hepatitis B or hepatitis C are often silenced both by themselves, and by external factors,' he said. 'We need governments and key public health officials to choose to address the invisibility of viral hepatitis. Not only will that shine a light on a neglected epidemic but it will also encourage affected communities to speak out and seek help.'\n\nHe said the most marginalised parts of the community were at the greatest risk of contracting the virus. 'The most at risk for hepatitis C are people who inject drugs, have a history of injecting drugs, also people in our prison system.'\n\nMr Didlick also called on the Federal Government to give patients better access to the latest treatments for the virus. 'There are advanced new hepatitis C medicines in use in other parts of the world right now that are not available here,' he said.

The health department said in 2014, there were 2 confirmed cases of acute hepatitis B during the entire year. In just the 1st 5 months of 2015, there have been 5 confirmed cases, 2 of which were co-infected with hepatitis C.\n\nHepatitis B is a viral illness. The county said it can cause yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark urine, fatigue, and fever. In some cases, the infection can persist, causing liver failure and even death. In the USA, hepatitis B is mostly spread through needles and sexual intercourse.\n\n'Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccination. Since 1991, all children have been advised to receive the 3-shot series for hepatitis B. Anyone using IV drugs should be tested for immunity to hepatitis B and if they are not immune, they should be vaccinated', Dr. Eric Frizzell of the Pinehurst Medical Clinic said.\n\nThe county said the current cases are primarily among young adults who are injecting prescription drugs, particularly Opana or other opiate\nmedications. The county said it believes it's being spread through either directly sharing needles, or sharing the 'cooked' Opana or other opiate with multiple people dipping their needles into a spoon containing the liquid to be injected.\n\n'The Moore County Health Department investigates each reported case of hepatitis B in an attempt to identify close contacts, whether they are through needle-sharing, sexual intercourse, or household contacts', said Kim Duffy, Communicable Disease Nurse for the Moore County Health Department. 'Each case and their contacts are offered confidential testing, counseling and education about this highly contagious virus and what they can do to stop the further spread of the disease.'\n\nIn 2013, the CDC estimated there were a total of 19 000 cases of hepatitis B in the USA.\n\n[Byline: Emily Spain]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As with previous posts regarding hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B is easily spread through sharing needles among illicit drug users, and increasing transmission of all 3 of these viruses have been reported in 2015 among this cohort. Since hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccination, it would be interesting to know the immunization status of the acute HBV cases.

The Moore County (North Carolina) Health Department said it has noticed a significant increase in the number of acute hepatitis B cases among young adults so far in 2015. The county said it believes it's being spread through either directly sharing needles, or sharing the 'cooked' Opana or other opiate with multiple people dipping their needles into a spoon containing the liquid to be injected. Since 1991, all children have been advised to receive the 3-shot series for hepatitis B. Anyone using IV drugs should be tested for immunity to hepatitis B and if they are not immune, they should be vaccinated', Dr. Eric Frizzell of the Pinehurst Medical Clinic said. The health department said in 2014, there were 2 confirmed cases of acute hepatitis B during the entire year. \n\nIn 2013, the CDC estimated there were a total of 19 000 cases of hepatitis B in the USA. Since hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccination, it would be interesting to know the immunization status of the acute HBV cases. \n\nOxymorphone (Opana, Numorphan, Numorphone) or 14-Hydroxydihydromorphinone (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymorphone) is a powerful semi-synthetic opioid analgesic (painkiller) initially developed in Germany in 1914, patented in the USA by Endo Pharmaceuticals in 1955 and introduced to the United States market in January 1959 and other countries around the same time. \n\n'Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccination.

'Those who give birth at home don't go to hospitals unless they are sick,' said Dr Lhamo. 'They don't go to hospital because they are not aware of the vaccines and that is a problem.'\n\nHepatitis B is usually transmitted from infected people through blood or body fluids. The lack of education is a contributor to its spread.

About 25 percent of the patients who suffer from viral hepatitis will develop liver cancer if they are not treated. Vaccination is considered the most effective method to prevent it.\n\nFigures from the WHO show that the hepatitis B virus is responsible for about 1 million deaths annually.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The seroprevalence rate of active, almost all chronic, hepatitis B in one area of Viet Nam was recently also reported in\nDo SH, Yamada H, Fujimoto M, et al: High prevalences of hepatitis B and C virus infections among adults living in Binh Thuan province, Vietnam. Hepatol Res. 2015; 45(3): 259-68. The abstract (edited) is reproduced below.\n\n'Abstract\n--------\nViet Nam is one of the countries with the highest mortality from liver cancer, which is mostly attributed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. For planning preventive strategies against these infections, we investigated prevalences of HBV and HCV infections among adults living in Binh Thuan, Viet Nam.\n\nOur study consisted of a serological survey for HBV and HCV infections and a questionnaire survey on their risk factors. The sample size was calculated based on anticipated rate of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Subjects were randomly sampled using a multistage method. Confirmation and family-tree surveys were conducted to examine persistent HBV infection and intrafamilial HBV transmission, respectively.\n\nA total of 509 adults, comprised of 230 men (45.2 percent) and 279 women (54.8 percent), were enrolled. Prevalences of HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody, and hepatitis B core antibody were 15.3 percent, 60.3 percent, and 71.7 percent, respectively. Most HBV DNA positive sera were classified as genotype B (75.3 percent) and C (11.7 percent). Of HBsAg positive subjects, 96.7 percent were persistently infected and 1 acutely HBV infected person was identified. Family-tree surveys suggested that horizontal extrafamilial HBV transmission might have been frequent. Prevalences of anti-HCV and HCV RNA were 3.3 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. HCV genotype 6a was prominent (55.6 percent).\n\nIn Binh Thuan, prevalences of HBV and HCV infections are high, HBV genotype B and HCV genotype 6a are predominant, and horizontal HBV transmission may still occur. Therefore, raising the coverage of a universal HBV vaccination program may be an effective liver cancer control in Vietnam.'\n\nA vaccine to prevent hepatitis B was first available in the spring of 1982, more than 40 years ago. It seems clear that a universal HBV vaccination program is not in use in Viet Nam or in the other countries mentioned in the post, as such seroprevalence rates were probably about the same for decades. Such programs, used perinatally, will decrease the acquisition rate of HBV infection, vertically or horizontally, leading to a substantially lower chronic carrier rate of HBV and parallel substantially lower amount of HBV-associated cirrhosis and liver cancer.

The content of the ProMED-mail post entitled 'Hepatitis B & C - Australia: increasing incidence' archive number 20131110.2048183 was largely concerned with estimations of the number of people with viral hepatitis who remain undiagnosed and, perhaps, the rising incidence of deaths from primary liver cancer, to which viral hepatitis is a major contributor. As far as I can see, however, the HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmissible infections in Australia Annual Surveillance Report 2013 does not really indicate increasing incidence of hepatitis B and C. The following are excerpted from the report summary (p. 7):\n\n- The per capita rate of diagnosis of hepatitis B infection in Australia in 2008 to 2012 was stable at around 31 per 100 000 population. The rate of diagnosis of newly acquired hepatitis B infection steadily declined in Australia from 1.2 in 2008 to 0.8 per 100 000 population in 2012.\n\n- The per capita rate of diagnosis of hepatitis C infection declined from 52.5 in 2008 to 44.2 per 100 000 population in 2012.\n\nOne increasing statistic related to the number of newly acquired hepatitis C notifications is this:\n\n- The reported annual number of diagnoses of newly acquired hepatitis C infection increased from 365 to 466 in 2008 to 2012 and accounted for 4.6 percent of new hepatitis C diagnoses in 2012.\n\nThis statistic may vary, however, according to the level of scrutiny applied to new notifications to identify newly acquired cases. And unlike HIV, we don't have the number of specimens tested for viral hepatitis, to give an indication of how testing rates might be affecting diagnosis rates. Then, to counter the interpretation that the increase in newly acquired cases identified indicates rising incidence of transmission:\n\nThe proportion of people seen at needle and syringe programs [NSPs] who reported having injected drugs for 5 years or less was stable in 2008 to 2012 at around 10 percent. Within this group, hepatitis C prevalence declined from 28 percent in 2008 to 17 percent in 2012.\n\nGiven the strong association of viral hepatitis transmission with injecting drug use, I would also draw attention to the attached article by Iversen et al. 2013 (Reduction in HCV incidence among injection drug users attending needle and syringe programs in Australia: a linkage study) published in the American Journal of Public Health [Am J Public Health. 2013 Aug; 103(8): 1436-44. doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2012.301206.

BioKangtai, Tiantan Biological Products and Dalian Hissen Bio-Pharm failed to meet the 2010 good manufacturing practice (GMP) code for all pharmaceutical manufacturers by the deadline at the end of 2013.

Li Guoqing, a senior CFDA official, said vaccine supplies are sufficient to meet market demand.\n\nThe authority has clarified that vaccines produced before the deadline can still be sold.

Bernhard Schwartlander, China representative for the international health body, made these points during an interview with China Daily on Thursday [26 Dec 2013].\n\n'Given that the hepatitis B virus is still around, it's important for babies to get vaccinated,' he said. The WHO Beijing office met with the National Health and Family Planning Commission on Thursday [26 Dec 2013] to discuss the latest developments surrounding incidents in which 11 newborns have died after being inoculated against hepatitis B. According to Schwartlander, it's difficult to establish a causal link between the vaccines and the babies' deaths, since nearly all infants in China receive the vaccine as part of a very successful vaccination program.\n\nStatistics from the commission showed that more than 16 million babies were born in China last year [2012], and 90 percent of them were covered by the program that offers hepatitis B vaccinations free of charge. 'Without the immunization coverage, there might be a rapid increase of the disease,' Schwartlander warned.\n\nChina initiated the hepatitis B vaccinations in 2002 under a nationwide immunization program that began in 1978 and aims to protect children from preventable diseases. The vaccines, which guard against more than 10 diseases, are all manufactured domestically, said Zhao Kai, a vaccine expert and academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Schwartlander called the program 'very successful,' saying that hepatitis B prevalence among Chinese children under the age of 5 is now below 1 percent. But he conceded that some risks from the vaccination cannot be avoided.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine, and most recipients have no problems with it. Severe problems are extremely rare. Dangerous allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1 million doses. 'Medical education is important for the public to fully understand the benefit and risk of the vaccine, thus enabling them to make the right choice,' Schwartlander said. It's important for governments to keep alert to problem vaccines and take preemptive measures, such as suspending the products during investigations, he said. But 'vaccines produced by other registered manufacturers should be trusted,' he added.\n\nHealth authorities in Gansu [province] said on Friday [27 Dec 2013] they are investigating a new hepatitis B vaccine-related death, the 11th such infant death since November [2013]. In the latest case, a baby in Lanzhou died after receiving the vaccination manufactured by the Dalian Hissen Bio-Pharm Inc. Earlier, in Loudi, Hunan province, a 2-month-old boy died on Wednesday [25 Dec 2013] after receiving a hepatitis B shot produced in Beijing. Most of the other deaths occurred after vaccinations from products made in Shenzhen [Guangdong province] by the BioKangtai biotech firm. The use of all BioKangtai hepatitis B vaccines has been suspended nationwide.\n\n[Byline: Shan Juan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The hepatitis B vaccines are perhaps the most secure of all virus vaccines.

They are based on data from 8434 Canadians aged 14 to 79. The study, published Wednesday [20 Nov 2013] by Statistics Canada, found 0.4 per cent of people surveyed were infected with hepatitis B and 0.5 per cent were infected with hepatitis C. Half of the people with hepatitis B said they were unaware of the infection; 70 per cent of the people with hepatitis C said they did not know they were infected.\n\nExperts have been warning that Canada is facing an unrecognized health care crisis with hepatitis C, because undetected and untreated infections in the baby boom generation will trigger a surge in cases of liver failure and liver cancer. The chairman of the board of the Canadian Liver Foundation suggests the new estimates are actually unhelpful, because they give a falsely reassuring sense of the scope of the problem. 'I think they're actually harmful, and counterproductive. Because I think it's minimizing the true state of affairs,' said Dr Morris Sherman, a hepatologist (liver specialist) at Toronto General Hospital. The survey estimates 138 600 Canadians have hepatitis C. But Statistic Canada's own website reports that the number of diagnosed cases of hepatitis C in the country -- it is a reportable disease -- is nearly 300 000, Sherman notes. The Canadian Health Measures Survey is designed to test a representative sample of Canadians for a range of different conditions -- things like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. It does not include 1st nations people living on reserves, prison inmates, members of the Armed Forces or people living in some remote regions.\n\nTo get a good idea of the scale of the hepatitis B and C problems, the survey would need strong representation from certain population groups that typically don't agree to take part in this kind of a study, says Dr Mel Krajden, a hepatitis C expert with the British Columbia (BC) Centre for Disease Control. Those groups include injection drug users, the homeless, 1st nations people, prison inmates and immigrants from parts of the world where hepatitis B and C infections are more common than they are in Canada. Those include South Asia, China and Eastern Europe.\n\n'The study wasn't designed to specifically understand the epidemiology of [hepatitis] B and C. Unless you sample these populations correctly, you may not accurately estimate what's going on,' Krajden says. He notes it is typically extremely hard to accurately sample these groups. In particular, immigrants from some parts of the world where rates of these infections are high may be distrustful of this type of study and refuse to take part, he says. Krajden says British Columbia knows the hepatitis C status of about one quarter of its population, because a lot of testing has been done there. About 1.4 per cent of the province's total population is hepatitis C positive; among baby boomers, where the risk is greatest, the rate is 3 per cent, he says. Krajden says BC rates may be higher than other provinces, because there are higher rates of injection drug users there. While he called the new data 'a step in the right direction,' he too believes the estimates in this new report are artificially low.\n\nIn related news Wednesday [20 Nov 2013], Janssen Inc. announced that Health Canada has approved its new hepatitis C drug Galexos (its generic name is simeprevir). Doctors who treat people with hepatitis C have been anxiously awaiting approval of this and another pending new drug as they are expected to be significantly easier for patients to take and should have a higher success rate. But the new drugs are expected to be very costly, and experts worry that may slow their adoption.\n\n[byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem. It can cause chronic liver disease and chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. An effective vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 per cent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and was the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer.\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the commonest viruses that infect the liver. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, and the numbers are increasing. Hepatitis C is found worldwide with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 per cent and above. The main mode of transmission in these countries is attributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment. No vaccines are available to provide protection, but effective (but expensive) treatments are becoming available (as reported in the above press report). There are at least 6 genotypes of hepatitis C virus, and they may respond differently to treatment. Careful screening is necessary before starting the treatment to determine the most appropriate approach for the patient. Previously, combination antiviral therapy with interferon and the drug ribavirin has been the basis of hepatitis C treatment.

The statistics were revealed in the Kirby Institute's Annual Surveillance Report 2013 released at the Australasian HIV & AIDS Conference in Darwin this week.\n\nThe report found that almost 400 deaths in 2012 were related to hepatitis B-related liver disease despite the rate of diagnosis of newly acquired hepatitis B infection declining among those aged 30 years or older as well as reducing substantially among people aged 15-29 since 2003. In 2012, NSW had the highest number of diagnoses of hepatitis B infection, with 34.7 percent of the national total.\n\nHepatitis NSW CEO Stuart Loveday said that if not diagnosed and managed properly, hepatitis B infection can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or liver failure. 'Deaths from primary liver cancer are climbing faster than any other cause of cancer death in Australia, and untreated chronic hepatitis B is a major contributor,' Loveday said. 'An estimated 383 deaths in 2012 were attributable to hepatitis B-related liver disease. 'It is important to remember that many people with hepatitis B don't experience any symptoms at all, so getting tested is critical.'\n\nProfessor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Australian National University Narci Teoh said treatments currently available for hepatitis B were highly effective, well tolerated, and very simple to administer. 'We can tailor and individualise those treatments to people,' Professor Teoh said. 'It is critical for people with hepatitis B to be informed and start a conversation with their doctor in order to understand what this virus does and how to look after themselves and their liver.'\n\nLoveday said vaccination was the simplest way to prevent contracting hepatitis B. 'While most children born in Australia have been vaccinated, if you think you might be at risk of contracting hepatitis B, consult your doctor about getting vaccinated,' he said.\n\nThe Annual Surveillance Report also found that an estimated 310 000 people living in Australia in 2012 had been exposed to hepatitis C, with it thought that 173 500 had chronic hepatitis C infection and early liver disease, 51 500 had chronic hepatitis C infection and moderate liver disease, and 6500 were living with hepatitis C related cirrhosis. The other 80 000 people believed to have to have been exposed have cleared their infection.\n\nThe Kirby Institute estimates that almost 80 percent of all infections for hepatitis C occur among people who inject drugs, with only one percent of those people currently receiving treatment. Unlike other types of hepatitis, there is currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C, and medication is the only way to manage the disease.\n\nIn February 2013, the previous Labor federal government announced it will provide more than AUD 220 million [one Australia dollar is equivalent to 0.93 US dollars at the current date] over 5 years to subsidise [treatment with] hepatitis C medications boceprevir (Victrelis) and telaprevir (Incivo) through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).\n\nIt is believed that 10-15 percent of all people living with HIV in Australia may also have hepatitis C and that co-infection remains a serious issue.\n\n[Byline: Serkan Ozturk]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B virus infection can be prevented by vaccination.

Nursing Director Margaret Howe stated that the department has already seen 17 acute cases of hepatitis B this year [2013], when, typically, there are 2-3 acute cases a year. Acute cases are considered 'new' and not people who have previously contracted the disease.\n\nShe said the amount of intravenous drug use in Harrison County is contributing to the increase. 'After contracting hepatitis, you can't donate blood, organs, tissue or anything,' Howe said.\n\nHepatitis B is a blood disease and can be transmitted through sharing bodily fluids and blood, such as in sex, sharing needles, and exposures on the job. The disease can also be transmitted from mother to child. Howe said hepatitis B can lead to liver failure and death if combined with an autoimmune deficiency.\n\nCurrently, there is a vaccine for hepatitis A and B, but none for C. The hepatitis B vaccine is typically given at birth, and most schoolchildren should have full immunity with it. Even with the vaccine, Howe said some precautions are necessary: Do not share personal items, and be cautious of tattoo shops.\n\n[Byline: Ashley Walter]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused hepatitis B virus. It can cause chronic liver disease and chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982 and is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences.\n\nHepatitis B virus can cause an acute illness with symptoms that last several weeks, including yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Hepatitis B prevalence is highest in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. Less than one percent of the population in western Europe and North America is chronically infected, the low level being attributable to comprehensive vaccination programmes. In addition, implementation of blood safety strategies, including quality-assured screening of all donated blood and blood components used for transfusion, can prevent transmission of hepatitis B virus. The increase in acute cases of hepatitis B in West Virginia is being attributed to an increase in intravenous drug misuse locally in the Clarksburg area.\n\nClarksburg is a city in and the county seat of Harrison County, West Virginia, United States, in the north-central region of the state.

The commission also said half of 700 000 deaths caused by viral hepatitis [B?] every year globally are Chinese. According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 100 000 Chinese people are infected every year. Vaccination has proven to be the most effective way to prevent [hepatitis B virus infection].\n\nThe World Health Organization said Sunday [28 Jul 2013] in a report that through vaccination, China has reduced the chronic infection rate in children aged below 5 from 10 percent to less than one percent. China started to vaccinate children [in] 1992 and has offered free vaccination to newborns since 2005. Some 68 million children below 15 had been vaccinated by 2011. The rate of hepatitis B surface antigen carriage for children under 15 was slashed to 0.97 percent in 2006 from 9.7 percent in 1992, when vaccination started, said Yang Weizhong, a deputy director of China CDC.\n\nDespite the efforts, the number of hepatitis B carriers will remain enormous for 3 to 4 generations, Zheng Yingjie, associate professor at the Shanghai-based Fudan University School of Public Health, told the Global Times. Zheng, an expert on prevention of hepatitis B, said maternal-neonatal transmission is the main cause. 'If a baby is infected, the condition can only be controlled but not cured. That's why the infection rate in age groups above 20 will not see an immediate decline,' said Zheng.\n\nHepatitis B carriers and patients in China have suffered discrimination at different stages of life, especially in employment, though laws and regulations have been amended in recent years to ban employment discrimination against those carriers. 'This was partly caused by improper policies in the past, and the government has realized it,' Zheng said. 'Discrimination also comes from ignorance of the disease, so public health education is very essential. Three to 4 people out of 50 might be hepatitis B carriers; they can be friends or family.'\n\n[Byline: Duan Wuning]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause an acute illness with symptoms that last several weeks, including yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In highly endemic areas, HBV is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth or from person to person in early childhood. Perinatal or early childhood transmission may also account for more than 1/3rd of chronic infections in areas of low endemicity, although in those settings, sexual transmission and the use of contaminated needles, especially among injecting drug users, are the major routes of infection. HBV can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. HBV is not spread by contaminated food or water and cannot be spread casually in the workplace.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B. Care is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Some people with chronic hepatitis B can be treated with drugs, including interferon and antiviral agents. Treatment can slow the progression of cirrhosis, reduce incidence of HCC, and improve long term survival. Treatment, however, is not readily accessible in many resource-constrained settings. Liver cancer is almost always fatal and often develops in people at an age when they are most productive and have family responsibilities. In developing countries, most people with liver cancer die within months of diagnosis. In high-income countries, surgery and chemotherapy can prolong life for up to a few years.\n\nHepatitis B vaccine is the mainstay of hepatitis B prevention. WHO recommends that all infants receive the hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours. Hepatitis B vaccine contains HBsAg (hepatitis B virus surface antigen) adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. The HBsAg is prepared from yeast cells employing recombinant DNA technology. The vaccine has an excellent record of safety and effectiveness. Since 1982, over one billion doses of hepatitis B vaccine have been used worldwide. In many countries, where 8-15 percent of children used to become chronically infected with hepatitis B virus, vaccination has reduced the rate of chronic infection to less than one percent among immunized children.

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2013; Epub ahead of print]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nSeronegative hepatitis -- non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis -- is poorly characterized but strongly associated with serious complications. We collected 92 sera specimens from patients with non-A-E hepatitis in Chongqing, China between 1999 and 2007. 10 sera pools were screened by Solexa deep sequencing. We discovered a 3780-bp contig present in all 10 pools that yielded BLASTx E [basic local alignment search tool] scores of 7e-05-0.008 against parvoviruses. The complete sequence of the in silico-assembled 3780-bp contig was confirmed by gene amplification of overlapping regions over almost the entire genome, and the virus was provisionally designated NIH-CQV. Further analysis revealed that the contig was composed of 2 major ORFs [open reading frames]. By protein BLAST, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to the replication-associated protein of bat circovirus and the capsid protein of porcine parvovirus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NIH-CQV is located at the interface of _Parvoviridae_ and _Circoviridae_. Prevalence of NIH-CQV in patients was determined by quantitative PCR. 63 of 90 patient samples (70 per cent) were positive, but all those from 45 healthy controls were negative. Average virus titer in the patient specimens was 1.05 e4 copies/microL. Specific antibodies against NIH-CQV were sought by immunoblotting. 84 per cent of patients were positive for IgG, and 31 per cent were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78 per cent of healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM. Although more work is needed to determine the etiologic role of NIH-CQV in human disease, our data indicate that a parvovirus-like virus is highly prevalent in a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis.\n\nMost viral hepatitis are secondary to infection by known hepatotropic viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis delta virus (HDV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Other hepatitis-associated viruses, including CMV [cytomegalovirus], Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, human herpesvirus 6, human parvovirus B19V (B19V), and adenoviruses, may cause liver injury, ranging from mild and transient elevation of aminotransferases to acute hepatitis and occasionally acute liver failure. Despite the number of hepatitis viruses and hepatitis-associated viruses, etiology cannot be determined in 10-20 per cent of the cases of acute hepatitis, in 30 per cent of cases of cryptogenic chronic liver diseases, in hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, and in a large proportion of cases of acute liver failure. Patients with acute seronegative hepatitis have fewer parenteral risk factors, more severe bilirubin and transaminase elevations, and worse hepatocellular synthetic function than patients with hepatitis C. Moreover, seronegative hepatitis is more strongly associated with serious complications, especially bone marrow failure and childhood fulminant hepatitis.\n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has had an increasing impact on biological research and clinical diagnosis, because it provides high-resolution genome-scale data rapidly and reliably. The 1st application of NGS for pathogen discovery in a patient who died of a febrile illness after solid-organ transplantation led to the identification of an arenavirus. NGS based platforms, such as 454 and Solexa deep sequencing, have been applied successfully to the investigation of emerging human pathogens, resulting in major discoveries of new human viruses.\n\nIn the present study, we established an experimental and analytic procedure for identifying virus identification in human specimens based on Solexa deep sequencing. We applied the method to screen for potential viral infection in human sera specimens and discovered a human virus in Chinese patients who had seronegative hepatitis. From its genome organization and phylogeny, the virus is unusual, because it is evolutionarily at the interface of the parvovirus and circovirus families, perhaps having emerged from interfamilial recombination. The virus was highly prevalent in a patient population, and active infection in seronegative hepatitis cases was suggested by the presence of viral DNA in the blood and serology. However, more work is needed to establish a firm disease association.\n\n[Interested readers should access the original text at the source URL above to view the data, figures, and references.

Phylogenetically NIH-CQV appears to lie at the interface of parvoviruses and circoviruses. The genome of NIH-CQV has no homology to any known viruses in GenBank.\n\nAlthough comparative analysis revealed that the Rep and CP proteins of NIH-CQV have limited homologies with circoviruses and parvoviruses, respectively, the overall genome organization of NIH-CQV has the basic characteristics of viruses in _Parvoviridae_.\n\nNIH-CQV has a small, compact linear DNA genome with 2 tandemly arranged major ORFs encoding Rep and CP proteins, respectively, and a pair of ITRs [inverted terminal repeats] at the left and right ends of the genome. In silico promoter prediction suggested that transcription of the rep and cp was regulated by a single promoter upstream of the rep, because there was no apparent promoter sequence immediately upstream of cp. A pre-mRNA encoded by a single promoter that is processed by alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation to generate multiple mRNAs had been reported for other parvoviruses, such as B19V and Aleutian mink disease virus. By amino acid sequence analysis, CP protein of NIH-CQV is minimally homologous to porcine and goose parvovirus VP1. The homologous region is mainly in the N terminus of CP and contains the conserved PLA2-like motif, which is present in the N-terminal extension of the VP1 unique region of members of _Parvoviridae_. The phylogenetic tree constructed using amino acid sequences of CP of NIH-CQV and VP1 of other representative viruses in _Parvoviridae_ showed that NIH-CQV represents a deeply rooted lineage between 2 groups: (i) human and animal parvoviruses and (ii) insect parvoviruses. Thus, NIH-CQV appears to be a parvovirus-like virus.\n\nHowever, NIH-CQV also has features shared by members of the _Circoviridae_ family. First, a BLASTp search revealed that the Rep of NIH-CQV is more related to circoviral Rep than to those of other viruses. Second, NIH-CQV appears to have an ambisense genome because there are bidirectional putative promoters in the intergenic region between the rep and 15-kDa protein and because rep and 15-kDa protein arranged head-to-head flank the intergenic region, which is a feature of circoviruses. Finally, sequencing and alignment of the inverse PCR products indicated the existence of the circular genome of NIH-CQV in the clinical samples. The circular form of NIH-CQV genome might represent a subviral DNA or an intermediate structure of viral replication, as reported for other parvoviruses.\n\nTherefore, NIH-CQV appears to be a 'hybrid' virus, perhaps formed by interfamilial recombination between a parvovirus and a circovirus. This idea was supported further by whole-proteome phylogenetic analysis, which showed NIH-CQV located between _Parvoviridae_ and _Circoviridae_.\n\nBoth recombination and a high mutation rate are often cited as key in evolutionary innovation. For many viruses, recombination allows single-step acquisition of multiple genetic changes, and a high mutation rate enhances adaptation to new hosts. These processes are critical driving forces in viral evolution and lead to viral emergence, host-switching, and adaptation, which often result in disease outbreaks. Recent studies had demonstrated that small eukaryotic ssDNA [single stranded DNA] viruses have high rates of nucleotide substitutions and genetic recombination, which may surpass rates seen in RNA viruses. These observations may explain the extensive diversity seen in ssDNA viruses. Parvoviruses (family _Parvoviridae_) and circoviruses (family _Circoviridae_) are both ssDNA viruses that infect a wide variety of animal species, including mammals, birds, and insects. Although horizontal gene transfer and high mutation rates have been documented in these viruses, cross-species viral transfers resulting from interfamilial recombination and leading to a infection in the new host species are not common.\n\nA high rate of viral evolution has been reported for emerging parvoviruses. Canine parvovirus (CPV) is one well-characterized example. CPV emerged from feline panleukopenia parvovirus or a closely related virus, differing at several amino acid residues. Sequences of the viruses collected at time points before and after host-switching suggest that the emergence of CPV was dependent on a high mutation rate and positive selection of the major capsid gene. Our deep-sequencing data showed that NIH-CQV has a high substitution mutation rate throughout its genome. However, the impact of selective pressures, as measured by the Ka/Ks ratio, appeared to vary depending on location. The cp gene contained three regions in which the Ka/Ks ratio exceeded 1, suggesting positive selection. These substitutions would be presumed to enhance fitness. In contrast, selective pressure on the rep of NIH-CQV appeared to be dominated by purifying selection, because the average Ka/Ks ratio for the rep from 14 patients was only 0.42. The Ka/Ks ratios for the regions encoding the PLA2 motif in the CP protein or P-loop nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) in the Rep proteins were lower than in other regions, as is consistent with strong purifying selection and functional importance of this region in viral replication.\n\nNIH-CQV exhibited remarkable genetic heterogeneity within patients, indicating the presence of closely related variants or quasispecies in NIH-CQV-infected individuals. The Ka/Ks ratios of both viral cp and rep were greater in patients classified as having chronic hepatitis than in those with acute hepatitis, suggesting greater variation or more diversity of quasispecies of NIH-CQV over time. For hepatitis viruses C and E, diversification of quasispecies during infection is driven by the interaction between the viruses and host immune response and may be associated with different clinical outcomes. With a limited number of serial samples from a single individual, we were unable to conclude whether quasispecies dynamics of NIH-CQV in patients correlated with disease.\n\nDespite technological advances in molecular biology, an etiology cannot be determined in as many as 20 per cent of hepatitis cases. As of yet, no causative agent may be defined in a significant proportion of patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, whose disease therefore is characterized as 'cryptogenic'. Additional hepatitis agents have been suspected. Over several decades, several human viruses, such as GB virus C, Torque teno virus, and SEN virus, have been putatively claimed to be hepatitis viruses, but subsequent investigation revealed no conclusive association between these viruses and liver disease. Therefore, the etiology of non-A-E hepatitis remains unresolved. In this study, we applied NGS methodology to virus discovery and identified a parvovirus-like virus in the sera samples collected from a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis. Our results showed that 28 per cent of patients were positive for both NIH-CQV-specific IgM and viral DNA, suggesting recent infection in patients. Most patients and healthy controls were positive for virus-specific IgG, suggesting that exposure was common in the population studied. The patients who yielded positive specimens suffered from symptoms of hepatitis with a wide range of liver dysfunction, including acute and chronic hepatitis. There was no difference between patients diagnosed with acute versus or chronic hepatitis with respect to detection of NIH-CQV DNA, but viral DNA was not detected in healthy controls.\n\nAlthough these findings are suggestive of an etiologic relationship, our study has limitations. By electron microscopy, we observed virus-like particles in NIH-CQV qPCR [quantitative PCR]-positive sera which cosedimented with viral DNA, but we were unable to confirm their identity by immunogold labeling with our antisera. In addition, because of the limited availability of samples, we had insufficient material for viral propagation and isolation in cell culture, and efforts are in progress to detect viral proteins in a few liver biopsy tissue blocks. Additionally, with the limited number of samples available, we cannot exclude the possibility of reactivation of a latent virus in the course of liver inflammation.\n\nIn general, parvoviruses cause systemic infection, but clinical manifestations of the infection are varied and may depend on specific tissue tropisms as well as on host immunologic competency. For 2 human pathogenic parvoviruses, B19V and HBoV, clinical symptoms range from none to acute systemic manifestations involving skin and joints to subtle persistence of infection; in immunocompromised populations, B19V chronic infection causes pure red cell aplasia. In addition, coinfection of parvoviruses with other viruses, especially related DNA viruses, can lead to synergy and more severe clinical symptoms in the affected host. Because of the complexity of disease associations, more comprehensive epidemiology and in vitro studies are needed to establish a pathogenic role of NIH-CQV in hepatitis.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The authors report the identification of a virus, designated NIH-CQV, in patients with non-A/B/C/D/E hepatitis.

'Positive results have been reported for HIV, but OSDH Data Security Policy regarding HIV disclosure prohibits public reporting of numbers less than 3,' the 2 agencies stated in a statement posted that day.\n\nThis confirmation came after the 1st round of results from the testing. On 28 Mar 2013, public health officials announced they were notifying current and former patients of the practice that they may have been exposed to bloodborne viruses at Harrington's Tulsa and Owasso offices and urged them to be tested.\n\nThe Oklahoma State Department of Health's Public Health Laboratory completed the testing for 3122 people; 3235 people as of 18 Apr 2013 had visited county health departments to have blood drawn for testing, and an unknown number of others have sought testing through private health care providers, the statement says. It says that based on current Oklahoma disease prevalence data for hepatitis B and C and HIV, health officials know some of the positives probably resulted from infection exposure not related to the Harrington practice. The most recent data available indicates an estimated 4944 people are living with HIV/AIDS in Oklahoma and as many as 68 000 Oklahomans may be infected with hepatitis C.\n\n'We understand these 1st reported test results may be of concern,' said THD Director Dr. Bruce Dart.

A physician with the Victorian Infectious Diseases Service, Benjamin Cowie, said liver cancer cases were expected to double to about 2500 a year if more was not done to tackle the underlying causes. Hepatitis B and C virus infections were the primary causes of liver cancer, with hepatitis B the most significant single cause of cancer worldwide, after tobacco, Dr Cowie said.\n\nHepatitis B affected about 200 000 Australians, most of them Aboriginal or born overseas in countries where there was an epidemic. Hepatitis C affected about\n230 000 Australians and was most commonly caused by drug users sharing needles. Dr Cowie is among a group of experts to use a viral hepatitis conference in New Zealand today [10 Sep 2012] to urge governments and health professionals to set new targets for the number of people receiving treatment.\n\n'A substantial scaling up of resources and efforts is needed to stop these epidemics in their tracks,' the experts said. 'Otherwise liver cancer will continue to be among the fastest increasing causes of cancer death in Australia and New Zealand.' Targets include ensuring that at least 80 per cent of people with hepatitis B or C are diagnosed and that 5 per cent of people with hepatitis C and 10 per cent of those with hepatitis B receive antiviral treatment every year. It is estimated that one in 3 people with hepatitis B and one in 4 with hepatitis C are undiagnosed. They may not have symptoms of the disease, but without treatment, their condition can progress to liver cancer or liver failure.\n\nOnly 2 per cent of Australians who have hepatitis C and 3 per cent with hepatitis B receive medical treatment. Dr Cowie said part of the problem was long waiting lists. 'If you are living with hepatitis B and have undiagnosed cirrhosis and wait for a year to be seen, you have a 2 to 3 per cent chance of getting liver cancer. From a human rights perspective, I think that is unacceptable in rich societies like Australia and New Zealand.'\n\nExperts said new drugs to treat hepatitis C offered improved efficacy and had less toxicity. 'We need to be exploring not just sending people to hospital and waiting for liver clinics but getting these treatments into the community, and that means supporting general practitioners and nurses to take a greater role,' Dr Cowie said before today's [10 Sep 2012] 8th Australasian Viral Hepatitis Conference 2012. More than 10 000 Australians and New Zealanders are diagnosed with hepatitis C each year and 7000 with hepatitis B. The 'Auckland statement' calls for new hepatitis C infections to be halved by 2016, including by introducing needle and syringe programs in prisons, where the transmission rate for infection is of concern.\n\n[Byline: Kate Hagan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by direct blood-to-blood contact or semen and vaginal fluid of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same as those for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Unlike HIV, the hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences and is the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer.\n\nStrangely, immunisation is not mentioned in the above report as one of the measures that might be deployed in the fight against liver cancer.\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water. Diagnosis of acute infection is often missed because a majority of infected people have no symptoms. Specialized tests are needed to evaluate patients for liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis C does not always require treatment. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C, and they respond differently to treatment. However, combination therapy with interferon and several new drugs are proving successful with some types of hepatitis C. There is no vaccine available at present. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1z_*.]", "summary": "Targets include ensuring that at least 80 per cent of people with hepatitis B or C are diagnosed and that 5 per cent of people with hepatitis C and 10 per cent of those with hepatitis B receive antiviral treatment every year.

The investigation revealed practices that could have exposed patients to infectious material.\n\nAccording to the OSD, the investigation of the practice of W. Scott Harrington, D.M.D. so far has found numerous violations of health and safety laws and major violations of the State Dental Act. Dental Board investigators have been assisted by agents from the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration concerning the maintenance, control and use of drugs on the premises. The dentist and dental office voluntarily discontinued practicing upon the beginning of the investigation. The dentist is cooperating with investigators through his attorney. The State Board of Dentistry has been working very closely with the State Health Department on this investigation. The investigation is multifaceted and ongoing.\n\nPatients who had procedures at Dr. W. Scott Harrington's dental practice, located at 2111 S. Atlanta Place in Tulsa or at 12806 E. 86th Place N. in Owasso, Oklahoma, will begin to receive letters in the mail. The notification includes patients who have visited Dr. Harrington since 2007 and recommends they be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV are serious medical conditions, and infected patients may not have outward symptoms of these diseases for many years. As a precaution, and in order to take appropriate steps to protect their health, it is important for these patients to get tested.

Dr. Wayne Harrington, an oral surgeon with a practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is being investigated by the state dental board, the state bureau of narcotics and the federal Drug Enforcement Agency because one of his patients recently tested positive for hepatitis C and HIV without known risk factors other than receiving dental treatment.\n\nUpon hearing of the infected patient, the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry conducted a surprise inspection of Harrington's practice on 18 Mar 2013, allegedly finding numerous problems, including regular use of a rusty set of instruments on patients with known infections, and the practice of pouring bleach on wounds until they 'turned white.'\n\nCalls to Harrington's office were directed to an operator, who told ABC News the clinic no longer took voice-mails. The operator said patients were being referred to another clinic but did not disclose the clinic's name.\n\nSusan Rogers, executive director of Oklahoma's Board of Dentistry, called the incident a 'perfect storm.' On top of his many violations in sanitary practice, the dentist was a Medicaid provider, which means he had a high proportion of patients with HIV or hepatitis, she said. Harrington and his staff told investigators that he treated a 'high population of known infectious disease carrier patients,' according to a complaint filed by the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry. He allegedly allowed unlicensed dental assistants to administer medication, according to the complaint. These assistants were left to decide which medications to administer and how much was appropriate. Drug cabinets were unlocked and unsupervised during the day, and Harrington did not keep an inventory log of drugs, some of which were controlled substances. One drug vial had expired in 1993.\n\n'During the inspections, Dr. Harrington referred to his staff regarding all sterilization and drug procedures in his office,' the complaint read. 'He advised, 'They take care of that. I don't.''\n\nHarrington allegedly re-used needles, contaminating drugs with potentially harmful bacteria and trace amounts of other drugs, according to the complaint. Although patient-specific drug records indicated that they were using morphine in 2012, no morphine had been ordered since 2009. The instruments for infected patients were given an extra dip in bleach in addition to normal cleaning methods, but they had red-brown rust spots, indicating that they were 'porous and cannot be properly sterilized,' according to the complaint.\n\nThe Tulsa Health Department said Harrington's patients will receive letters by mail notifying them of the risk and steps to obtain free-of-charge testing. While 7000 patients may have been exposed, Joseph Perz, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said it's 'extremely rare' to see dental transmission of HIV and hepatitis B or C. In July 2012, 8000 persons in Colorado were notified that their dentist had reused needles, potentially exposing them to the blood-borne viruses. But not a single case was identified, according to the CDC. Dental transmission is not impossible, however. Perz cited a dental fair 3 years ago in which hepatitis B was transmitted between patients. In July 2012, more than 1800 veterans who received dental care at a St. Louis VA Medical Center were warned that improper cleaning of dental tools may have exposed them to HIV and hepatitis.\n\nThe Tulsa Health Department has set up a hotline at (918) 595-4500 for people with questions.\n\n[Byline: Sydney Lupkin]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Some 7000 patients who since 2007 received treatment at a dental practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma will begin to receive letters recommending that they be tested for the presence of the blood-borne pathogens hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 12 million Pakistanis are infected with hepatitis, the major causes for the spread of which include frequent use of\ntherapeutic injections, re-use of syringes, inappropriate sterilisation practices and poor hospital waste management.\n\nIn Pakistan, many patients have lost their lives at the hands of quacks, who are known for mismanagement of hepatitis. 'Pakistan needs to institute strictest possible laws to end quackery so that unwary patients don't end up losing their lives. Mismanagement of hepatitis B and C can lead to liver cancer. It is, therefore critical that only qualified specialists be consulted for treatment,' Dr. Tashfeen Adam, head of the department of gastroenterology at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) stated on the eve of World Hepatitis Day here on Friday [27 Jul 2012]. He said, there has been a 25% increase in the number of hepatitis patients reporting this year, as compared to last year, and attributed the same to rising public awareness.\n\nSharing relevant data, PIMS spokesman Dr. Waseem Khwaja disclosed that between 350 to 400 patients suffering from various digestive diseases are treated in the Out-Patient Department of Gastroenterology at PIMS every day. Sixty percent of these patients are diagnosed with hepatitis, and 2% new cases are diagnosed while screening of surgical cases. Moreover, 2300patients have been admitted and treated for complications of hepatitis like bleeding, drowsiness, infections and coma, since January 1, 2012, and five percent of the hospital's emergency is occupied by patients suffering from complications of hepatitis.\n\nDr. Waseem said, 3500 patients of hepatitis C are receiving free interferon therapy from Zakat and Pakistan Baitul-Mal funds at PIMS. Two types of free interferon injections are being provided to hepatitis C patients. The executive director of PIMS Dr. Mehmood Jamal also stressed the need for patients to consult qualified doctors for treatment of hepatitis.\n\nResearch by WHO shows that hepatitis can be acute or chronic, and may result in serious complications or even death. Viral hepatitis affects 1 in every 12 people worldwide. It affects those close to them too. Around 500 million people worldwide are chronically infected with two types of blood-borne hepatitis: hepatitis B and C. Approximately 1 million people die each year from related complications, most commonly from liver diseases including liver cancer.\n\nIn the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 17 million people are living today with hepatitis C infection, and approximately 4.3 million people are infected with hepatitis B infection every year.\n\nThe key message of World Hepatitis Day is that hepatitis is preventable. Everyone can get this disease, yet it rarely affects those who consciously guard against it. Hepatitis is caused by a group of viruses that infect the liver through either consumption of contaminated food and water or exposure to unsafe blood and infected body fluids.\n\nEveryone has a role to confront hepatitis. At the community and individual level, certain behavioral practices increase the risk of these infections substantially, for example reuse of razor blades and injection syringes, by traditional healers and tattooists and harmful behaviors such as sharing needles and drug abuse. Provision of safe food and water would greatly prevent hepatitis A and E. Within health facilities, screening of blood and blood products, safe injection practices and clean dental work can significantly reduce the risk of infection from hepatitis B and C.\n\nOn the occasion of World Hepatitis Day, WHO's Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Dr. Ala Alwan has urged policy-makers, civil society, and health professionals to combine efforts to confront this silent epidemic. In a message, Dr. Alwan has drawn attention to the fact that the chronic nature of hepatitis B and C infection calls for strong focus on screening, care and treatment. 'With early detection and appropriate management, it is possible to change the quality of life of millions of people who are living with this disease,' he has stressed.\n\n(By Shahina Maqbool)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from Health Map alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[Viral hepatitis is the leading cause of liver cancer and cirrhosis worldwide.

The higher rate of detection was due to the increasing number of testing centres. But Bhutan also has hepatitis A and C, the Bhutanese daily quoted Wangchuk as saying. Hepatitis B infection can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. The virus is spread through blood transfusion, unsafe sex or sharing of needles contaminated by the virus.\n\nThere is currently no government awareness campaign, but patients are provided free medical treatment, the health ministry's chief programme officer Tandin said last week.

Only 10 percent to 20 percent of hepatitis cases are detected, said Rino Gani, head of the Indonesia Liver Research Association (PPHI). 'Not everyone knows about the status of their infection and not everyone has had themselves examined,' Rino said at a news conference ahead of World Hepatitis Day on 28 Jul 2012. Hepatitis takes a long time to show symptoms, but the disease can cause liver cirrhosis and cancer, Rino said. 'The damage only becomes known when it is already too late and not much can be done,' Rino said. One of the problems is money, Rino said. Tests and treatment are only affordable for a small segment of society. Another is stigma. People who know they are infected often do not seek out treatment because they do not want people to know about their condition. Since the disease does not cause them pain, they are able to ignore it.\n\nAccording to H.M. Subuh, a director at the Health Ministry, rapid detection tests cost between Rp 30 000 [USD 3.18] and Rp 50 000 [5.29], and more sophisticated tests cost Rp 100 000 to Rp 150 000. [One USD approximates to 9445 Indonesian Rupiah]. 'The problem is that after someone is declared hepatitis B or C positive, another series of tests have to be undergone and the costs is about Rp 2 million [USD 211.75] and has to be done repeatedly before being eligible for therapy' which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of rupiah, he said. The government's Jamkesmas health insurance scheme covers treatment for poor people, he added. Rino said an alternative to expensive therapies was needed. He praised a partnership between the University of Indonesia and the University of Kobe in Japan to develop an herbal-based cure for hepatitis C.\n\nA 2007 Health Ministry study found that 9.4 percent of Indonesians, or about 30 million people, were positive for hepatitis B or C. Globally, 170 million people are infected, and the disease[s] causes 1.5 million deaths annually. Several groups are especially vulnerable to hepatitis, including health workers, intravenous drug users and children whose mothers are infected, Rino said. Soldiers also carry a high risk of infection because of bleeding during exercise or sharing razors. Unsterile tattooing can also spread hepatitis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus and more than 240 million have chronic (long-term) liver infections. About 600 000 people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by direct blood-to-blood contact or semen and vaginal fluid of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same as those for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Unlike HIV, the hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and is the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer. (For more detailed information, see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html).\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Every year, 3-4 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. More than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases every year. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.

L. Anithakumari, Deputy District Medical Officer for Communicable Disease Control, told The Hindu here on Monday that 9 cases had been confirmed through ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test in the past 3 months. 30 more cases tested positive in the antigen card test. However, unofficial reports say the number is much higher. When the official data show that only 2 died of the infection in the past 4 months, the unofficial figure puts it at 5 at least.\n\nDr. Anithakumari said Hepatitis-B infection had been a major health problem at Pramadom and surrounding villages from 2003. The graph rose in 2011, with 14 patients testing positive in the ELISA test and 50 others in the card test. She said an expert team from the Government Medical College, Alappuzha, would visit the affected areas on Wednesday [2 May 2012] to study the cause of infection. She said a policy should be evolved to extend psychological support to the affected people and others. The Health Department had launched public awareness programmes and disease prevention measures. The doctor said the infection resolved itself in most people. But 5 to 10 per cent of the people developed chronic infection.\n\nKurien Oommen, former District TB Officer, says about two-thirds of the people with chronic Hepatitis-B infection are carriers of the virus who do not develop symptoms, but can transmit it to others. Children are at a much higher risk for chronic infection. The Health Department organised a public awareness camp at the indoor stadium at Pramadom on Monday [30 Apr 2012]. Leela Rajan, block panchayat president, inaugurated the camp. H. Salimraj, Additional District Magistrate, delivered the keynote address. P.N. Vidyadharan, District Programme Manager, National Rural Health Mission, who were among the doctors who took classes at the camp, said Rs. 119 000 lakh [USD 3 602 834] had been allocated for the ward-level health care committees in the Pramadom panchayat for disease-prevention activities.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person, not through casual contact. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 2 billion people worldwide have been infected with the virus, and about 350 million live with chronic infection. An estimated 600 000 persons die each year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis B. About 25 percent of adults who become chronically infected during childhood later die from liver cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by the chronic infection.

This vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing hepatitis B virus infection and its chronic consequences. Hepatitis B is endemic in many parts of India. Most people in the region become infected with hepatitis B virus during childhood.

While the officials does not discount other causes like sex work, men who have sex with men (MSM) and infected mothers passing it on to their children during childbirth, they feel that private labs should be brought under the scanner to check the spread of such communicable diseases.\n\nDr A.S. Pradeepkumar, [deputy] director of Public Health Services (PH) says that cases of hepatitis B have doubled compared to last year [2011]. Clusters of such cases were mostly found in Malappuram, Kozhikode and Kollam according to him. Other places, where many cases of hepatitis B were reported are Changnacherry and Pathanamthitta.\n\nIn the case of Kottayam district, most cases have been identified in Athirampuzha panchayat, says District Medical Officer Dr N.M.Aysha Bhai. Precautionary measures such as awareness campaigns to educate the people about this disease were held in the Kottayam Medical College Hospital. Infected patients were transferred to different hospital and vaccinations were given to their relatives, she said.\n\nThe lack of awareness about the disease is also hampering the initiatives to check the spread of the disease. Kottayam District Medical Media Officer Domy.J feels that campaigns were not effective as people were not interested. 'They thought that it was a water borne disease and not a blood-borne disease', he said. 'All want to undergo tests and get vaccinated. But we do not have the budget to give vaccinations to everyone and moreover we have only [enough] vaccine for children below 5 years,' says Domy. Some officials feel that tackling hepatitis B was an issue that needed state level planning and response. But no protocols were put in place.\n\nReacting to the allegations against the private labs by the government medical authorities, a microbiologist at a private lab said, 'We do not re-use medical instruments due to fear of losing our jobs. It's the government hospitals that follow such unsafe practices. They accused us to save their skin,' the micro-biologist alleged.\n\nClinical pathologists who work in premium private labs such as DDRC, Dianova and Premier say they use only auto-disposable syringes. They also follow strict safety guidelines and diligently use incinerators to destroy used needles. The medical waste is collected by an IMA-led agency IMAGE (Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly).\n\nDr Punnen Kurian Venkadathu, Director of Tropical Institute of Ecological Sciences (TIES), Kottayam feels that there could be some truth in allegations by the government health authorities. 'Some private companies sell recycled syringes in bulk for a song to these private labs. If an auto-disposable syringe is sold for Rs.2 [USD 0.036] each in the market, these private companies will recycle the used syringes and sell it for 50 ps [paise - 50 ps is equal to 0.5 rupees, or 0.01 USD] each,' says Dr Punnen.\n\nAccreditation of clinical labs is not at present mandatory in the state. A lab can be set up if you have certification from a local body. While many of the premium clinical labs have opted for the voluntary accreditation programme under the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL), several others that operate in rural areas and towns do not have them. The proposed Kerala Clinical Establishments (Registration, Regulation and Accreditation) Bill now plans to make the accreditation mandatory and also has provisions for grading the labs.\n\n[Byline: Lydia Jose]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by contact with the blood or other body fluids (i.e., semen and vaginal fluid) of an infected person.

Kitgum district MP (Member of Parliament)\nBeatrice Anywar said 12 cases of hepatitis B had been confirmed at St.\nJoseph's Hospital, Lacor. She said the patients were from Kitgum town\ncouncil, Muchuni and Adelang. Hepatitis B is an infectious disease\ncaused by hepatitis B virus which affects the liver and causes\nhepatitis.\n\nAbout a quarter of the world's population, over 2 billion people, have\nbeen infected with the hepatitis B virus. This includes 350 million\nchronic carriers of the virus. Transmission of hepatitis B occurs\nthrough exposure to blood or body fluids such as semen and vaginal\nfluids of infected people. Other risk factors include working in a\nhealth care setting, blood transfusions, dialysis, acupuncture,\ntattooing and extended overseas travel. The infection is preventable\nby vaccination. Infection at birth is a major route of infection in\ndeveloping countries.\n\nAnywar named Acholi, Karamoja and Lango as the regions suspected to be\nharbouring the virus. She was concerned about the lack of reagents for\ntesting and appealed to the government to provide the reagents.\n\nAnywar urged the Ministry of Health to provide Parliament with a\nstatement on the spread of the disease and the steps being taken to\nfight it, a request to which health state minister Richard Nduhuura\nobliged.\n\nGulu MP Betty Aol Ocan said the disease was also reported in Gulu\nwhere seven people had died.\n\nMbarara Municipality MP Medard Bitekyerezo said western Uganda was\nalso affected.

There are\nmore cases of liver cancer in Santa Clara and San Francisco counties\nthan anywhere in the United States. Largely caused by hepatitis B\nvirus (HBV) infection, liver cancer is lethal.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), it kills nearly 750\n000 people each year. The 5 year survival rate after diagnosis is just\n15 per cent. The good news is that most cases of liver cancer can be\nprevented. There is an effective and safe vaccine for HBV that the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO call the 1st\n'anti-cancer' vaccine. HBV is also easily diagnosed with a simple\nblood test. The challenge is to educate, test and vaccinate as many\npeople as possible, especially those at greatest risk.\n\nHBV, which can appear in either chronic or acute form, is responsible\nfor 80 per cent of liver cancers. HBV is called a 'silent killer'\nbecause most people with chronic infection often have no symptoms. By\nthe time they realize they have the disease, it is too late for\neffective treatment. Sometimes people only find out about the disease\nwhen they are diagnosed with liver cancer. Untreated, HBV can also\nlead to cirrhosis and liver failure.\n\nHBV is transmitted much the same way as HIV/AIDS. It is only\ntransmitted through blood or semen, but it is 100 times more\ninfectious than HIV. It cannot be transmitted through casual contact.\nNo one is immune, but liver cancer is especially prevalent in people\nfrom Asia and the Pacific Islands. The statistics are staggering.\nAsians and Pacific Islanders make up 4.5 per cent of the US population\nbut account for more than 50 per cent of chronic hepatitis B cases.\nRecent immigrants are at greater risk. Two-thirds of those infected\nare unaware that they have HBV. Many acquired the virus at birth from\nmothers who were unaware they were carriers. In Santa Clara County,\nwhere an estimated one-third of the population is of Asian descent,\nabout 35 000 live with chronic HBV [infection]. A quarter of those\nwith chronic HBV will die from liver cancer.\n\n[byline: Nancy Dickenson]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmai.org>\n\n[Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people have been infected with the\nhepatitis B virus (HBV), and more than 350 million have chronic\n(long-term) liver infections. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been\navailable since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 per cent effective in\npreventing HBV infection and its chronic consequences, and is the 1st\nvaccine against a major human cancer.\n\nThe likelihood that an HBV infection will become chronic depends upon\nthe age at which a person becomes infected, with young children who\nbecome infected with HBV being the most likely to develop chronic\ninfections. About 90 per cent of infants infected during the 1st year\nof life develop chronic infections; 30 per cent to 50 per cent of\nchildren infected between one to 4 years of age develop chronic\ninfections. About 25 per cent of adults who become chronically\ninfected during childhood die from HBV-related liver cancer or\ncirrhosis. About 90 per cent of healthy adults who are infected with\nHBV will recover and be completely rid of the virus within 6 months.\n\nHepatitis B is endemic in China and other parts of Asia. Most people\nin the region become infected with HBV during childhood. In these\nregions, 8 per cent to 10 per cent of the adult population are\nchronically infected. Liver cancer caused by HBV is among the first 3\ncauses of death from cancer in men, and a major cause of cancer in\nwomen. High rates of chronic infections are also found in the Amazon\nand the southern parts of eastern and central Europe. In the Middle\nEast and Indian sub-continent, an estimated 2 per cent to 5 per cent\nof the general population is chronically infected, whereas less than 1\nper cent of the population in western Europe and North American is\nchronically infected. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people\nby contact with the blood or other body fluids (semen and vaginal\nfluid) of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same for\nthe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but HBV is 50 to 100 times\nmore infectious. HBV is not spread by contaminated food or water, and\ncannot be spread casually in the workplace.\n\nLiver cancer is almost always fatal, and often develops in people at\nan age when they are most productive and have family responsibilities.\nIn developing countries, most people with liver cancer die within\nmonths of diagnosis. In higher income countries, surgery and\nchemotherapy can prolong life for up to a few years in some patients.\n\nAll children and adolescents younger than 18 years old and not\npreviously vaccinated should receive the vaccine. People in high risk\ngroups should also be vaccinated, including: persons with high-risk\nsexual behaviour; partners and household contacts of HBV infected\npersons; injecting drug users; persons who frequently require blood or\nblood products; recipients of solid organ transplantation; those at\noccupational risk of HBV infection, including health care workers; and\ninternational travellers to countries with high rates of HBV.

It is a major global health problem and\nlikely to be endemic throughout Nepal. Hepatitis B virus infection\ncan cause an acute illness with symptoms that last several weeks,\nincluding yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine,\nextreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. People can\ntake several months to a year to recover from the symptoms. Hepatitis\nB virus can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later\ndevelop into cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer. The likelihood\nthat an hepatitis B virus infection will become chronic depends upon\nthe age at which a person becomes infected, with young children who\nbecome infected with hepatitis B virus being the most likely to\ndevelop chronic infections. About 90 percent of infants infected\nduring the 1st year of life develop chronic infections; 30 percent to\n50 percent of children infected between 1 to 4 years of age develop\nchronic infections.

The deceased ranged in age from\n63 to 83.\n\nInvestigators with the Division of Public Health said all 8 underwent\nblood-glucose monitoring at the center, and residents who have diabetes\nwere 15 times more likely to be involved in the outbreak than other\nresidents. The investigators said Glen Care staff sometimes stored glucose\nmonitors together and didn't label them with residents' names. The devices\nalso weren't disinfected after each use, according to investigators.\n\n'If you get contamination that isn't even visible on the glucometer, that\ncan get on the glove (or) get on the lancing device (and) then be\nintroduced in the person,' said Dr Megan Davies, North Carolina's state\nepidemiologist.\n\nHepatitis B virus is a virus that can cause severe liver problems, and it\nis typically transmitted by exposure to blood or body fluids. Symptoms\ninclude fever, extreme fatigue, loss of appetite, vomiting, dark urine and\nyellowish skin. The state recommended that Glen Care store glucose meters\nin residents' rooms, disinfect them after each use, and switch to\nsingle-use needles for these devices.\n\nGlen Care officials said on Thursday [11 Nov 2010] that the center's staff\nweren't responsible for the hepatitis outbreak. Medical technicians said\nthey had never used glucose monitors on different patients. 'I don't\nbelieve these loving, caring people shared the same pen on different\npatients,' said Anne Kornegay, vice president of Kornegay Healthcare, which\nowns the assisted living center. Kornegay suggested the outbreak was caused\nby people coming in from outside or by residents sharing drinks or having sex.\n\nState investigators said they couldn't determine the source of the\noutbreak, noting the center is open to relatives and other visitors and\nthat residents are free to come and go. Davies called the situation tragic\nand said Glen Care needs to strengthen its infection-control practices.\n\nThe state Division of Health Service Regulation has already issued a\n6-point corrective plan to Glen Care for infection control. By Fri 19 Nov\n2010, the facility must appoint a staff member to coordinate\ninfection-control measures at the facility, provide staff training on\nproper procedures and have a registered nurse or pharmacist observe\nblood-glucose monitoring of patients at least once a week.\n\nGlen Care officials said they already have infection-control measures in\nplace, but in response to the state's corrective plan, they said they now\nwash their medical instruments with a bleach solution instead of just soap\nand water.\n\nAll residents at the center were tested for hepatitis B in October [2010],\nhealth officials said, and 27 people who weren't immune to the virus were\nvaccinated. A separate state investigation will determine how Glen Care\nwill be penalized. Based on preliminary findings, the center could be fined\nbetween USD 1000 and USD 20 000 for each violation.\n\n[byline: Bruce Mildwurf]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nZach Lutwick\nSocial Worker\n<zach.lutwick@gmail.com>\n\n[Nosocomial hepatitis B infections have occurred repeatedly as a result of\nlapses in infection control procedures, often accompanied by transmission\nof hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus.

In March [2009], the state said 5 of Dr.\nParvez Dara's patients were found to have hepatitis B and that nearly\n2800 patients should get tested for it. There are now 29 positive\ncases, plus 68 others who tested positive for antibodies but cannot\nbe definitely linked to the outbreak, according to the state Health\nDepartment. The state is aware of nearly 1400 patients who have been\ntested so far.\n\nOn 12 Aug 2009, state epidemiologist Dr. Christina Tan sent a letter\nto 2000 more patients and to patients in the 1st group who had yet to\nget tested urging them to do so. In July 2009, the department\nresponded to an Associated Press open records request by declining to\nrelease any information about the test results, citing the ongoing\ninvestigation. The department quietly released the test results on\nits Web site 1 Sep 2009, nearly 3 weeks after sending out the letter\nto patients. Health Department spokeswoman Donna Leusner said the\ninvestigation is ongoing, but a report was prepared at the request of\nthe Board of Medical Examiners, which suspended Dara's license in April 2009.\n\nA spokesman for Dara criticized the health department for releasing\nthe test results while the investigation is still open, saying it was\na 'rush to judgment.' 'There are a number of possible medical reasons\nthat explain why hepatitis B may have developed among patients --\nparticularly those being treated for cancer with chemotherapy,' said\nDara spokesman Tim White.\n\nHealth inspectors visited Dara's office in March [2009] and described\nconditions there as unsanitary. The inspectors said they found blood\non the floor of a room where chemotherapy was administered, blood in\na bin where blood vials were stored, unsterile saline and gauze, and\nopen medication vials. Inspectors also cited problems with\ncross-contamination of pens, refrigerators and countertops; use of\ncontaminated gloves; and misuse of antiseptics, among other health\ncode violations.\n\nFollowing the inspection, county health officials sent a 28 Mar 2009\nletter to Dara's patients warning them of the risk and suggesting\nthey be tested for the liver diseases hepatitis B and hepatitis C and\nfor HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], the virus that causes AIDS\n[acquired immune deficiency syndrome].\n\n'Evidence gathered at this time suggests that since 2002, some clinic\nstaff provided care in a manner that put patients at risk for\ninfection caused by blood-borne viruses, including hepatitis B\n[virus],' the 12 Aug 2009 letter told patients. 'The investigation to\ndate suggests that the hepatitis B infections identified may be\nassociated with the method by which medications were administered and\nprocedures performed at the practice.'\n\nDara, originally from Pakistan, has been practicing at his Toms\nRiver, New Jersey, office for 23 years and has been a licensed\noncologist in New Jersey since 1980.

The inspectors said they found blood\non the floor of a room where chemotherapy was administered, blood in\na bin where blood vials were stored, unsterile saline and gauze, and\nopen medication vials. There are a number of possible medical reasons\nthat explain why hepatitis B may have developed among patients --\nparticularly those being treated for cancer with chemotherapy,' said\n In July 2009, the department\nresponded to an Associated Press open records request by declining to\nrelease any information about the test results, citing the ongoing\ninvestigation. There are now 29 positive\ncases, plus 68 others who tested positive for antibodies but cannot\nbe definitely linked to the outbreak, according to the state Health\nDepartment. The investigation to\ndate suggests that the hepatitis B infections identified may be\nassociated with the method by which medications were administered and\nprocedures performed at the practice.' The investigation conducted by the Health Department into this\nincident has revealed evidence of serious lapses in the\nadministration of medication and poor standards of general hygiene\nand cleanliness. Inspectors also cited problems with\ncross-contamination of pens, refrigerators and countertops; use of\ncontaminated gloves; and misuse of antiseptics, among other health\ncode violations. In March [2009], the state said 5 of Dr.\nParvez Dara's patients were found to have hepatitis B and that nearly\n2800 patients should get tested for it. On 12 Aug 2009, state epidemiologist Dr. Christina Tan sent a letter\nto 2000 more patients and to patients in the 1st group who had yet to\nget tested urging them to do so. The department quietly released the test results on\nits Web site 1 Sep 2009, nearly 3 weeks after sending out the letter\nto patients. Health Department spokeswoman Donna Leusner said the\ninvestigation is ongoing, but a report was prepared at the request of\nthe Board of Medical Examiners, which suspended Dara's license in April 2009. A spokesman for Dara criticized the health department for releasing\nthe test results while the investigation is still open, saying it was\na 'rush to judgment.'

The doctors -- father and son -- had used\nthe same syringes and needles on multiple patients, police said.\n\nAfter raiding underground warehouses in Modasa, police and pollution\ncontrol officials seized recycled medical waste, most of it packaged\nand ready for supply to clinics or hospitals. A similar seizure of\nrecycled medical waste took place in other parts of Gujarat,\nincluding Ahmedabad. In Modasa, Surat, Rajkot and Ahmedabad,\nofficials discovered makeshift packaging units where recycled\nneedles, syringes, pediatric droppers, intravenous drips and other\nequipment were being sorted, simply washed and neatly repackaged for sale.\n\nFive Ahmedabad-based pharmaceutical companies were also found\nrepackaging used medical waste in the same unsafe manner, and the\nGujarat pollution control board has issued closure notices against\nthem. Investigators found that medical waste pickers collected used\nneedles and other equipment from hundreds of private hospitals,\nthousands of doctors and some government hospitals and then sold them\nto underground recycling gangs who traded in them.\n\nScientists from Pune's National Institute of Virology identified the\nkiller virus as a 'dangerously mutated strain' of hepatitis B [virus]\nthat can kill its victims in an unusually short time. Jay Narayan\nVyas, Gujarat's health minister, said his department was sure the\ninfection spread fast because of the use of infected syringes or\nneedles by private doctors and that his government would take\nstringent action against those responsible. 'The situation turned\nworse because private doctors and hospitals are not under a\nregulatory mechanism. In the absence of any legal obligation and\nrelated punitive measures of dereliction, the private medical\npractitioners use substandard facilities and equipment,' Mr Vyas said.\n\nThe practice of recycling medical equipment is not a new problem in\nIndia. The Indian Clinical Epidemiology Network said that up to 31.6\nper cent of the 3 billion to 6 billion injections administered in the\ncountry annually were done with used equipment and carried the\npotential risk of spreading such blood-borne viruses as those causing\nhepatitis and AIDS. The authorities in Gujarat were aware that many\nclinics in the state were unsafe but had failed to act sooner because\nof the 'high regard for doctors,' said Dr Ramesh Shah, secretary of\nthe Gujarat Pollution Control Board.\n\n'This entire saga of medical waste trading is disgusting, and we will\nnot spare the offenders. I am aghast that doctors can risk lives like\nthis for the cost of small change.' Some experts said that in the\nabsence of a regulatory mechanism, similar outbreaks are bound to\noccur in the future.\n\n'There is no law under which it could be mandatory for Gujarat's 13\n000 private medical practitioners to reveal where they bought their\nequipment. In this situation, many culprits -- including doctors and\ninfected equipment suppliers -- are slipping out of the police\ndragnet,' said one Ahmedabad-based pollution control officer. 'We\nhave no idea how many thousands of infected needles or syringes may\nalready be in use in medical clinics across the state.

The virus can be transmitted via unprotected sex or\nsharing of contaminated needles. Pregnant mothers also tend to pass it on\nto their babies.\n\nSabarkantha district official M Thennarasan told the BBC that another 26\npeople had been admitted to a local hospital with symptoms of hepatitis B.\nWomen and children have been among the dead. 'We have had teams from Delhi\nand the state who are investigating the cause of the spread of the\ndisease,' he said. 'Preliminary investigations show the presence of a\nmutant virus in patients.

He said around 1000 samples of various villages\ncould not be tested due to shortage of staff in the Civil Hospital.\nHe said villages including Aacher Khoso, Dhegano Chandio, Lukar\nBrohi, Shakar Brohi, Ramzan Brohi, Ghar Gajoo and Moosa Panhwar were\nmost affected by the disease in the district.\n\nTalking to this correspondent, Abdul Haleem Chandio, a resident of\nvillage Laiq Chandio, said 35 people, including women and children,\nhad died due to the disease during the last 3 years, and 39 people\nout of the population of 85 were suffering from Hepatitis B in the\nvillage.\n\nHaji Khan Chandio, a resident of village Dhegano Chandio, said 7\npeople, including women and children of a family, had died due to\nthis disease in the last 3 years, and 200 people out of the\npopulation of 800 [25 percent] were suffering from Hepatitis B in the\nvillage.\n\nAbdul Riaz Khoso, a resident of village Aacher Khoso, said 20 people,\nincluding women and children, had died of the disease during the last\n3 years. 80 people out of a population of 200 [40 percent] are\nsuffering from Hepatitis B in the village, he said.\n\nA survey conducted by this correspondent revealed that thousands of\ncases of hepatitis B and C exist in the district, but there was no\none to scan them. People have been left to die, and there seems to be\nno help forthcoming. There is a dire need that the Health Ministry\ntake immediate notice of the situation and send medical teams to\ncombat this scourge. A large quantity of medicine [for treatment] of\nhepatitis B and C is also required immediately.\n\nIt has been learned that PKR 1.5 lakh [about USD 1900] are required\nfor one patient's treatment, which poor patients cannot afford and so\nare worried about their dark future. When this correspondent visited\nthe affected villages of the district, the villagers complained that\nthey had not received even one tablet from the Civil Hospital and\nthat the tests were also not being conducted free of cost. The tests\nare expensive and beyond the reach of poor villagers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[The hepatitis B and C disease situation in the Naushahro Feroze\nDistrict of Sindh province of Pakistan is remarkably similar to that\nin Badin District of Sindh province (see: Hepatitis B & C - Pakistan:\n(SD) 20081201.3773). It is evident that hepatitis B and C disease is\nat least a provincial problem, and possibly a national problem.\n\nHepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused\nby hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the\nmost serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver\ndisease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the\nliver and liver cancer. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between\npeople by contact with the blood or other body fluids (i.e. semen and\nvaginal fluid) of an infected person. In developing countries, common\nmodes of transmission include: perinatal (from mother to baby at\nbirth), early childhood infections (non-apparent infection through\nclose interpersonal contact with infected household contacts), unsafe\ninjections practices, blood transfusions, and sexual contact. A\nvaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis\nB vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing HBV infection and its\nchronic consequences. A more detailed description is available at:\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html>.\n\nHepatitis C virus is a major cause of acute hepatitis and chronic\nliver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis C\nvirus is spread primarily by direct contact with human blood. The\nmajor causes of hepatitis C virus infection worldwide are use of\nunscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that\nhave not been adequately sterilized. No vaccine is currently\navailable to prevent hepatitis C, and treatment for chronic hepatitis\nC is too costly for most persons in developing countries to afford.\nThus, from a global perspective, the greatest impact on hepatitis C\ndisease burden will likely be achieved by focusing efforts on\nreducing the risk of hepatitis C virus transmission from nosocomial\nexposures (e.g. blood transfusions, unsafe injection practices) and\nhigh-risk behaviors (e.g. injection drug use).

Health authorities started calling\npatients of the dentist on Tuesday [17 Jun 2008]. The dentist has\npractised in Alberta since 2001. Dr Gerry Predy, vice-president of\nCapital Health, said the chance the disease was transmitted to any of\nthe dentist's 1400 patients is very low -- somewhere between one in\n10 000 and one in 100 000. 'We don't anticipate that this is\nsomething people should be overly concerned about,' said Predy.\n\nAlthough the chances are small, officials decided to inform the\npublic upfront rather then having it be found out later where it\ncould 'generate concern beyond what it should generate.' Predy said\nit took until now for an expert panel to determine how to handle the\nsituation, complete a risk analysis, and compile a list of his\npatients. 'He wasn't putting anyone else at risk by virtue of this\ntime frame that's elapsed,' Predy said.\n\nHe said the 37-year-old dentist has been co-operative and gave\npermission for his name to be released so that his current and past\npatients can be tested as a precaution. But that's as much\ninformation Predy was willing to give. He responded to some questions\nfrom reporters, including whether the dentist would be able to\npractise again, by saying some details must be withheld to protect\nthe dentist's medical privacy.\n\n'There's a number of complexities following this situation,' Predy\nsaid, adding that the situation is very unique. 'Not just the\nindividual has hepatitis B, but some of the other circumstances\naround it.' He wouldn't clarify what he meant.\n\nDr Jonathan Skuba, president of the Alberta Dental Association and\nCollege, said this particular scenario has never happened before in\nthe province. There are no current rules forcing dentists to get\ntested for infectious diseases, but if they find out they have one it\nmust be reported. 'No health profession in Alberta has required blood\ntesting of their health practitioners,' Skuba said. 'Knowing the\nnature of viruses and infections it would almost become impossible\nbecause someone could register, test negative, and a week later test positive.'\n\nPredy suggested the dentist's patients wait until Capital Health\nnurses get in touch with them, although they can contact the\ndepartment if they have questions. He said the number of hepatitis B\ncases has been decreasing. In the 1990s, there were around 30 cases\nper year compared to between 5 and 10 right now. During follow ups in\nresponse to these cases, he said no one has revealed they'd recently\nhad dental work. Predy said children above 10 and adults up to the\nage around 28 are likely immune to hepatitis B as a result of\nelementary school vaccinations. Also, dental students are now\nrequired to get the shots. 'Vaccine given at that age is highly\neffective, probably over 99 per cent.'\n\nHepatitis B is a disease of the liver caused by a virus. Most people\nwho get hepatitis B recover in about 3 months. Other people get over\ntheir illness but do not get rid of the virus and become carriers who\nwill have the hepatitis B virus for the rest of their life, though\nthey won't have any symptoms. They often do not know they are\ncarriers and may spread the hepatitis B virus to others. In a small\nnumber of people, the disease is severe enough to cause death.\n\n[Byline: Jordan Jackle]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Hepatitis B is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the\nliver.

The health district\nrecommended that patients who had procedures requiring injected\nanesthesia at the clinic between March 2004 and 11 Jan 2008 contact\ntheir primary care physicians or health care providers to get tested\nfor hepatitis C as well as hepatitis B and HIV.\n\nAt that time, the health district had received notification of 3\nacute cases of hepatitis C in January 2008 and has identified a total\nof 6 further cases; 5 of these cases had procedures requiring\ninjected anesthesia on the same day. Following a joint investigation\nwith the Nevada State Bureau of Licensure and Certification (BLC) and\nwith consultation from the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, the health district determined that unsafe injection\npractices related to the administration of anesthesia medication\nmight have exposed patients to the blood of other patients. Genetic\ntesting on 4 of the cases contracting infection on the same day has\nidentified that they likely came from a common source. The patient\nthat had a procedure on a different day did not share a common source\nas did the other 4. This indicated that the problem that allowed\ndisease transmission to occur was not a one-time event but had\nrecurred over an extended period. Investigation of the clinic\npractices identified common practices that would allow disease to be\ntransmitted in this manner.\n\nSince that report, it transpires that more than 90 cases of hepatitis\nC virus infection have been identified, and more than 50 000 patients\nare being recalled for testing. Thus, this outbreak may become the\nlargest outbreak of hepatitis C virus infection in the USA. Up to the\npresent, the largest hepatitis C outbreak was a consequence of\nmalpractice at a clinic in Nebraska. In November 2002, ProMED-mail\n(see, Hepatitis C, clinic-acquired cluster - USA (NE) (02), archive\nnumber 20021120.5857) reported that 612 patients at the Fremont\nOncology Clinic had been sent letters advising them of risk of\nhepatitis C virus infection as the result of a faulty procedure. In\ntotal, 81 of 485 patients who responded tested positive for hepatitis\nC virus infection. Mod.MPP commented at the time that an attack rate\nof 17 percent (81/485) suggested that unsafe injection practices were\noccurring over a period of time rather than as a unique event.

The health district is recommending that\npatients who had procedures requiring injected anesthesia at the\nclinic between March 2004 and 11 Jan 2008 contact their primary care\nphysicians or health care providers to get tested for hepatitis C as\nwell as hepatitis B and HIV.\n\nThe health district received notification of 3 acute cases of\nhepatitis C in January 2008 and has identified a total of 6 cases to\ndate; 5 of the cases had procedures requiring injected anesthesia\non the same day. Following a joint investigation with the Nevada\nState Bureau of Licensure and Certification (BLC) and with\nconsultation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the\nhealth district determined that unsafe injection practices related to\nthe administration of anesthesia medication might have exposed\npatients to the blood of other patients. The exposures did not result\nfrom the [other] medical procedures performed.\n\nThe cluster of illnesses came to the attention of the health district\nin January 2008. These cases were reported to the health district by\narea physicians. Nevada law requires that medical providers notify\npublic health officials when they identify a number of different\ndiseases, including hepatitis C. The common link between cases was\nidentified through the routine investigation of the cases reported by\nmedical providers, which includes an interview of the patient. Most\npeople infected with hepatitis C virus do not develop symptoms and do\nnot know that they have been infected. As a result, these infections\nwould not have been reported to the health district. An infection\nwith hepatitis C that results in the patient developing symptoms\n(acute disease) is rare, so it is an unusual occurrence that brought\nthis problem to the attention of the health district. On average, 2\ncases of acute hepatitis C are reported each year in Clark County;\n6 cases have been identified in relation to this investigation.\n\nA syringe (not a needle) that was used to administer medication to a\npatient was reused on the same patient to draw up additional\nmedication. The process of redrawing medication using the same\nsyringe could have contaminated the vial from which the medicine was\ndrawn with the blood of the patient. The vial, which was not labeled\nfor use on multiple patients, was then used for a 2nd patient (with a\nclean needle and syringe). If that vial was contaminated with the\nblood of the 1st patient, any subsequent patients given medication\nfrom that vial could have been exposed to bloodborne pathogens. [At\nthis point in the original text, the process of contamination is\nillustrated by downloadable diagram. - Mod.CP]\n\nOf the 6 known cases, 5 had procedures on the same day. Genetic\ntesting on 4 of the cases from that day has identified they likely\ncame from a common source. The patient that had a procedure on a\ndifferent day does not share a common source as the other 4. This\nindicates that the problem that allowed disease transmission to occur\nwas not a one-time event but had recurred over an extended period.\nInvestigation of the clinic practices identified common practices\nthat would allow disease to be transmitted in this manner.\n\nThe unsafe injection practices associated with these cases were\nidentified during the investigation conducted in mid-January 2008.\nThe injection practices that led to the exposure have been\ncorrected, so no new patient exposures should be occurring. As it can\ntake several months for the symptoms of hepatitis C to appear,\nadditional cases might be identified despite no ongoing transmission\nof disease. The investigation revealed practices that could have\nexposed patients to the blood of another patient.\n\nAlthough hepatitis C was the focus of the investigation, hepatitis B\nand HIV can be transmitted in the same manner. It is unknown how many\npeople were infected at the clinic. Hepatitis C, B and HIV are\nroutinely found in the population. A significant number of people\nmight have been infected prior to their procedure. Although testing\ncan determine whether a person is infected, it cannot determine the\nsource of the infection.\n\nHepatitis C, B or HIV can result in a range of disease severity and\ncan eventually result in death. It is important that patients speak\nwith a physician or health care provider if they have one of these\ndiseases. A physician will be able to address specific risks for\nserious illness and develop a plan to monitor patients' health.\n\nOn average, 2 cases of acute hepatitis C are identified each year in\nClark County. Most people who become infected with hepatitis C\ninitially have mild or no symptoms and do not know that they have\nbeen infected unless they are tested by a doctor. Only a small\npercentage of people infected with hepatitis C develop acute disease\nand have any outward signs of infection.\n\nThe Southern Nevada Health District is responsible for investigating\nreports of illness in our community in order to take steps to protect\nthe health and well-being of the public. Once notified of a\nreportable disease, the health district begins an investigation and\nworks with the appropriate agencies to address any issues identified\nand make recommendations to help prevent this type of situation from\noccurring again.\n\nWhen proper injection practices are followed, medical procedures,\nincluding colonoscopies or similar procedures, are generally safe.\nAll health care professionals and medical facilities should follow\nsafe injection practices and infection control procedures.

Among investigated cases, there are 3 cases in\nwhich the parents didn't know when their children died. He quoted the\ncase of a child's death in Dong Anh district, Hanoi during the recent\nlunar New Year. The child's parents left their baby at home alone for\n16 hours during the cold weather and when they returned, the child\nhad died already. Doctors determined that the child died because of\nbleeding pneumonia, not vaccine.\n\nJean [Marc Olive], chief representative of the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) in Viet Nam, confirmed that post-vaccination\ndeaths of babies caused by other reasons, not vaccinations, is\ncommon, especially for newborn babies. In the 1st 28 days in life,\nbabies are prone to death because of various reasons. If a death\ncoincides with a vaccination, the vaccination is easily [blamed] as\nthe reason, but without the vaccination, the child might still have died.\n\nSince 2007 many post-vaccination child deaths have been reported in\nViet Nam. After each case, the Health Ministry performed an\ninvestigation but it has only just announced results.\n\nLast year [2007] Viet Nam recorded 29 cases of serious shock and\ndeath after vaccination. A total of 15 cases were determined to be\ncoincidences (caused by other reasons, not vaccination); 10 cases\nwere without specific reasons: one was self-protection shock; and\nonly 3 were due to vaccination service mistakes.\n\nDr Hien also explained why most of the post-vaccination deaths are\nrelated to hepatitis B vaccine. He said this vaccine was added to the\nnational expanded vaccination programme in 2003. The number of babies\nvaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine has increased highly so the\nnumber of complications also increases. In 2006, the percentage of\nnewborn babies who were injected with this vaccine in the 1st 24\nhours was 66 percent and thus the number of child deaths after\nhepatitis B vaccination increased.\n\nThe Health Ministry confirmed that the post-vaccination complication\npercentage is still at an acceptable threshold for all kinds of\ncurrent vaccines.\n\n[Because parents were] [f]rightened by post-vaccination deaths, the\nproportion of vaccinated children in Viet Nam last year [2007] fell\nfrom 96 percent to 81\npercent. The percentage of newborn babies who got the 1st hepatitis B\ninjection within the 1st 24 hours plunged from 66 percent in 2006 to\n28 percent in 2007. The ratio of children who got all 3 injections\nalso declined from 98 percent to 71 percent.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-MBDS Rapporteur Vern Weitzel\n\n[The newswire above provides final diagnoses for the 29 cases of\nserious shock and death reported in Viet Nam during 2007 that were\ntemporally associated with receipt of the hepatitis B vaccine (HBV)\n[see ProMED refs. below]. 15 cases were 'determined to be coincidences\n(caused by other reasons, not vaccination)', 10 cases were 'without\nspecific reasons', one was self-protection shock (?), and only 3 were\ndue to vaccination service mistakes. Of the 7 cases where infants had\nserious shock following vaccinations this year (2008) 5 were\ncoincidental, one was caused by a service mistake, and one had no\nclear reason.\n\nMore information on these conclusions would be greatly appreciated as\nthey are difficult to 'judge' based on the newswire descriptions.\n\nThe current scientific literature does not support a theory of a\ntemporal association of HBV receipt with sudden death in infants.\n\nIn a letter to the editor, Zinkaa et al. described a 13-fold increase\nin deaths temporally associated with receipt of vaccine during the\nperiod 2001 through 2004 following receipt of the hexavalent vaccine\n(6 antigens) as compared with the number of deaths reported during the\nperiod 1995 though 2000 following receipt of the pentavalent vaccine\n(5 antigens). The difference between the 2 vaccines was the addition\nof the hepatitis immune globulin in the later period. While there were\nneuropathologic findings on autopsy, they were not felt to be\ncontributing to the death of the infants and actual numbers of deaths\nwithin 24 hours of receipt of the vaccine did not surpass that\nexpected by chance alone (see ref 1).\n\nVon Kreis et al. used standardized mortality ratios for deaths that\noccurred within 1-28 days following administration of either of the 2\nhexavalent vaccines in the 1st and 2nd year of life using the\nrespective annual rates for sudden unexpected deaths (SUDs) from the\nnational vital statistics. Their analysis did not show a cause-effect\nassociation with receipt of the vaccine and SUD, although there was a\npossible trend association with one of the 2 vaccines, thereby\nsuggesting the need for enhanced surveillance for sudden deaths\ntemporally associated with receipt of the vaccine (see ref 2).\n\nBalci et al. reported on a pair of identical twins with simultaneous\nsudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) 48 hours after receipt of 2nd dose\nOPV [oral polio vaccine], 2nd dose DPT [diphtheria, pertussis,\ntetanus] and 1st dose of HBV (see ref 3).\n\nDiMiceli et al. review the reports to the USA-based vaccine adverse\nevents reporting system (VAERS) addressing the issue of anaphylactic\nreactions following receipt of the recombinant HBV in yeast sensitive\nindividuals. There were 11 reports of probable anaphylactic events out\nof 107 reports of 'yeast allergy' with no deaths. Age group of\naffected individuals ranged from 10 to 64 years of age, with no\ninfants in this reported group (see ref 4).\n\nErickson et al. studied reviewed records on more than 300 000 births\nduring the period 1993 to 1998. In this cohort, 67 percent had\nreceived HBV at birth while only 72 (5 percent) of neonates who died\nwere HBV-vaccinated at birth (p less than 0.01). They found no\nsignificant difference in the proportion of HBV-vaccinated (31\npercent) and unvaccinated (35 percent) neonates dying of unexpected\ncauses (p = 0.6). They were not able to identify a plausible causal or\ntemporal relationship between HBV administration and death for the 22\nvaccinated neonates who died unexpectedly (see ref 5).\n\nThat being said, the reports of increased deaths temporally associated\nwith receipt of HBV vaccine in Viet Nam raised the question as to\nwhether there was a possible vaccine manufacture-associated event\nongoing in Viet Nam.\n\nThis moderator has not forgotten the 'major increase' in SIDS reported\nin the USA following receipt of DTP (the USA refers to the vaccine as\nDTP and not DPT) vaccine in the late 1970s during the early stages of\nimplementation of a new monitoring system to address adverse events\ntemporally associated with the receipt of vaccinations. (In the early\ndays this system was referred to as ARMS -- 'adverse reaction\nmonitoring system'.) At the time, statistical analyses did not support\nthe apparent observed increase in SIDS reports within 24 hours\nfollowing receipt of the vaccine (daily expected numbers of SIDS\ndeaths were projected, taking into account seasonality). While there\nwere many more SIDS cases reported with a history of vaccine receipt\nin the 24 hours preceding the event, the numbers of cases of SIDS\nreported on a daily basis for these days were within the expected\nrange, and the numbers of cases reported on a daily basis as one got\nfurther from date of receipt of vaccine were lower than actually\nexpected).\n\nIn response to this observation, major studies were commissioned. In\n2002 there was an Institute of Medicine (IOM) review panel to\n'definitively' address the issue of temporal association of vaccine\nreceipt with SIDS and 'sudden unexpected deaths in infancy' (SUDI).\nThe committee reviewed epidemiologic evidence focusing on 3 outcomes:\nSIDS, all SUDI, and neonatal death (infant death, whether sudden or\nnot, during the 1st 4 weeks of life). Based on this review, the\ncommittee concluded that the evidence favors rejection of a causal\nrelationship between some vaccines and SIDS; and that the evidence is\ninadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between other\nvaccines and SIDS, SUDI, or neonatal death (see ref 6 below).\n\nThrough the highly perceptive and sensitive retrospectoscope, it is\nlikely that the observed 'association' of SIDS with receipt of DTP\nvaccine may well have been a function of the implementation of a new\nreporting/monitoring system that led to an increased awareness of any\nadverse event following receipt of vaccine.\n\nOf additional note in the IOM study above was the committee statement\non HBV vaccine and association with SIDS or SUDI. HBV is the only\nvaccine administered during the neonatal period in the USA. The\ncommittee reviewed data on neonatal death following receipt of HBV\nfrom a single unpublished controlled observational study and from a\nsingle published report describing VAERS data. The committee concluded\nthat given the limitations of these data sources for assessing\ncausality, the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal\nrelationship between HBV and neonatal death.\n\nIf the data mentioned in the newswire above are conclusive in ruling\nout the possibility of a temporal association of sudden infant deaths\nwith receipt of the HBV, one can't help but wonder if these reports\nwere coincident with the implementation of a more sensitive adverse\nevent following immunization (AEFI) reporting system in Viet Nam.\nPRO/MBDS would greatly appreciate receiving information from the\nofficial report on the results of the investigations on these deaths.\n\nFor maps of Viet Nam with provinces, see\n<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/vietnam_admin01.jpg>\nand <http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Viet Nam can be accessed\nat <http://healthmap.org/promed?v=14.9,108.5,5>.\nThis map shows other outbreaks in Viet Nam and surrounding countries\nthat have been reported on ProMED-mail.

The Health Ministry\nhas immediately halted the use of the vaccine nationwide while they\nascertain the causes of the infants' deaths. Since the vaccine is\ndistributed through the World Health Organization (WHO) channels, the\nagency is embarrassed and says it will investigate the deaths.\nHepatitis B is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the liver.\nThe virus, which is called hepatitis B virus (HBV), can cause lifelong\ninfection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure,\nand death.\nHepatitis B vaccine is available for all age groups to prevent hepatitis B\nvirus infection. Dr Do Si Hien, chairman of Viet Nam's National Vaccination\nProgramme, said that between 23 Apr and 7 May [2007], a total of 4 infants\nwent into shock after being given the vaccine. According to statistics,\nusually only one case of hepatitis B vaccine shock is found for every one\nmillion people vaccinated against the disease, he added.\nAccording to Hien, children under 12 months of age have been vaccinated\nagainst hepatitis B under the national vaccination programme since 1997,\nwith the programme expanding to all regions of the country by 2003. With\nclose to 1.5 million children being vaccinated annually, hepatitis B\nvaccine has been used on millions of Vietnamese children to date. Hien\nurged parents to remain calm, saying that these were extremely unusual\ncases that related to only 2 batches of Hepatitis B vaccine manufactured by LG.\nWHO said it supports, as a precautionary measure, the nationwide temporary\nsuspension of the drug produced by South Korea's LG Life Sciences and\ndistributed in Viet Nam through a UN [United Nations] system. The global\nhealth body has also 'recommended the temporary [suspension of\ndistribution] and use of specific lots of the Euvax B vaccine produced by\nLG because of these recent reports,' said WHO spokesperson Dida Connor.\nDrugs from the same lots had been shipped to 24 countries, but no other\nadverse reactions had been reported to date from any of them, she said. WHO\nwill send a team of international experts to Viet Nam as early as this week\n[14-18 May 2007] to investigate the cases, said Connor. 'WHO, UNICEF and\nthe government are taking this very seriously,' she said. 'We're making all\nefforts to ensure a full, prompt investigation. 'This doesn't mean that we\nhave any information that is conclusive about the potential cause of this\nat this stage. WHO will send out further advice pending the outcome of this\ninvestigation.' Connor said the LG vaccine had been used for some years and\nthat WHO had received no reports of deaths or serious reactions from any\nother countries.\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[Hepatitis B vaccine is an inherently safe vaccine for both children and\naduls. (For instance, in China the aim is to administer hepatitis B vaccine\nto all infants within 24 hours of birth). Only rarely is there any serious\nallergic reaction to hepatitis B vaccine. The recombinant vaccines that are\nlicensed for use in the United States and elsewhere are synthesized by\n_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (common bakers' yeast), into which a plasmid\ncontaining the gene for HBsAg has been inserted. Purified HBsAg is obtained\nby lysing the yeast cells and separating HBsAg from the yeast components by\nbiochemical and biophysical techniques. Persons allergic to yeast should\nnot be vaccinated with vaccines derived by this methodology.\nThe fatal incidents in Viet Nam are more likely to be attributable to\ndefective individual vaccine vials rather than a systematic deficiency of\nan entire vaccine batch. The outcome of the investigation of this incident\nis awaited with much interest. - Mod.CP]\n..................cp/ejp/sh\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The rare warning, which is upsetting many immigrant\nfamilies already dealing with severe health problems, follows the discovery\nof a strange, small cluster of hepatitis-positive dialysis patients\nidentified this month [May 2006].\n'There are 8 patients we are investigating with new infections,' said Dr\nMichael Finkelstein, an associate medical officer with Toronto Public\nHealth. 'Certainly, I would classify that as a significant number. In other\nhemodialysis units, you can see, occasionally, a patient becoming positive,\nbut even then they are not that common.' It's not clear how dialysis\npatients who use the facilities run by Scarborough Hospital would have\nbecome infected with the hepatitis B or C [virus infection] that's showed\nup in recent routine tests. 'We don't know how this happened,' said Sherian\nMondesir, a spokeswoman for Scarborough Hospital. She added that 'we can't\nsay it's necessarily linked to our practices.'\nLike other dialysis centers, Scarborough Hospital uses clean, modern\nequipment. No source of possible contamination has been identified, but\nofficials are now taking many precautions, such as testing staff members\nand testing and retesting all of the dialysis patients. While hepatitis\noften lies dormant or is treatable, it can also lead to disabling liver\nfailure, and even death. That's why the public health department has\ncirculated letters in English, Chinese, Tamil and Tagalog (or Filipino)\nwarning patients they should guard against any further spread of hepatitis,\nwhich may have been disseminated during dialysis treatments.\nExperts say it's unlikely that the cluster will grow far beyond the 8\ncases, but the news has caused panic in some families. Infection is a\nconstant worry for all hemodialysis patients, who spend up to 5 hours a\nday, 3 times a week, having their blood pumped through plastic tubes and\ncleaning machines, in rooms full of other people with kidney disease\ngetting the same treatment.\nThe hepatitis virus [hepatitis B and C viruses] is carried in the blood,\nbut can survive outside the body for days. It can pass between hosts\nthrough sex, intravenous needles, and contaminated hospitals. That's why\ngreat care is taken to make sure all facilities and equipment are kept free\nof even small traces of blood. Yet traces can always remain, and it's\ndifficult to pinpoint causes of infection. Ms Mondesir said the hospital\ncontinues 'to follow our infection control and safety measures,' but staff\nare now being more vigilant. She said she is confident that Scarborough\nHospital's dialysis equipment is clean, and this view is supported by Dr\nFinkelstein. 'There is no evidence that the equipment itself is an issue,'\nhe said, but he added there could be any number of possible other sources\nof infection. 'There is blood in the environment,' he said, adding that\nsmall amounts of blood can linger on machines, people's hands, medical\ninstruments, tubing, and clamps.\nBecause it is uncommon to see this cluster of new infections, Dr\nFinkelstein drafted the letter that was circulated to dialysis patients\nthis week. He said the initial case came to the attention of public health\nauthorities on 'the very last working day of April [2006],' and that\nauthorities worked as quickly as possible to investigate further and warn\naffected patients.\nAfter officials determined the 1st individual was a dialysis patient at\nScarborough Hospital, they probed more deeply. The hospital had just\ngathered its annual blood samples, so public health authorities were poised\nto take a closer look, and when they did, they discovered the cluster. No\none yet knows when or how the infections occurred, or when new infections\nmight show up. 'It can take up to 6 months for some of these infections to\nbe detectable in a lab sample,' Dr Finkelstein said.\n[byline: Colin Freeze]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 21 May 2006\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: AM640 Toronto Radio, Sat 20 May 2006 [edited]\n<http://www.640toronto.com/news/metro.cfm?cat=7428218912&rem=38425>\n\nHepatitis outbreak in Scarborough Hospital\n------------------------------------------\nEight confirmed cases of hepatitis B and C in a Scarborough hospital have\nofficials trying to piece together how the virus was spread.

The letter continues to say\nthat the hospital detected the infections and that they 'occurred in the\npast year.'\nAccording to Dr Gordon Nagai, who works in the Scarborough Regional\nDialysis Program, the results are startling. 'I think it's important to\nknow this is the 1st time we've ever found anything in 10 years,' Nagai\nsaid. 'But clearly, it's a very unusual circumstance, so we're quite\nconcerned why something has changed.' Nagai told CTV's Monica Matys that\nthey are searching for the source of the infection. A staff member could be\nthe source, and the entire staff is being tested. However, the infection\ncould be coming from another place. 'It's definitely not a problem with the\nmachines; that's been identified,' Nagai said. Every dialysis patient is\nbeing tested for both hepatitis B and C. As a further precaution, they are\nalso testing for HIV during regular dialysis sessions.\n'All the measures seem to indicate that we're looking after the problem\nquite adequately,' Nagai said. 'This has been reviewed by internal people\nand been reviewed by public health. So at the moment, we're quite confident\nthat everything is being done to contain the problem.'

Just after the infectious event, the virus\nload is zero. It will then increase passing a range of concentrations below\nthe detection limit of the NAT. The time during which virus is present in\nthe blood or plasma but is not detectable with NAT early during infection\ndepends upon the kinetics of the virus multiplication and the detection\nlimit of the NAT and is extremely difficult to determine. The attainable\ndetection limit of NAT in blood transfusion services is limited by the fact\nthat blood transfusion services tend to perform (and regulatory authorities\nup to now only require) NAT of pooled samples in order to make NAT testing\naffordable.\nTo my knowledge, anti-HBc testing is obligatory for every single blood\ndonation in Japan and several other countries. First introduced to\nrecognize individuals at elevated risk for HIV in the mid-1980s, this test\nsoon became a surrogate marker for hepatitis C virus infection as well. As\nsensitive and specific tests have been introduced into the blood\ntransfusion system for both viruses, continued routine use of anti-HBc\ntesting is now being justified for its possible effect on prevention of a\nfew hepatitis B virus infections.\nGermany has not introduced anti-HBc testing as yet, mainly because early\nstudies demonstrated the variability of results obtained with different\ntest kits for the same donor (1, 2). The low specificity of the test is\nconfirmed by the fact that in states where all donors with specific\nanti-HBc (i.e., former hepatitis B virus infection) have been screened out\nyears ago, the positivity rate for anti-HBc remains in the range of one\npercent. This is either a high rate of non-specificity or an unfavorable\ndonor epidemiology. Quality and comparability of tests may have improved\nsince the original studies were performed, but I am not aware of medium- or\nlarge-scale studies to answer this question.\nAccording to US estimates, 50 000 donations and possible long-term donors\nhave to be sacrificed in order to detect one anti-HBc-positive donation\nwith a low level of hepatitis B virus DNA. The authors of that study\ncarefully avoided any possible link to infectiousness of the blood.\nTherefore the net benefit of anti-HBc testing with respect to prevention of\ninfection and disease in the recipient is almost completely unknown if both\nhepatitis B virus NAT and anti-HBc testing are performed. The net effect\nmay depend upon background prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection, which\nis higher in countries with high background prevalence and very low in\ncountries with a very low background incidence of hepatitis B virus infection.\nReferences:\n(1) Caspari G et al.

The\ncase involves a 75-year-old man who became infected with HBV after\nreceiving a blood transfusion in 2000 at a hospital in Nagasaki Prefecture.\nAfter the man developed the symptoms of HBV infection, the Red Cross\ninitiated an investigation into the case.\nThe inquiries revealed that the blood used in the transfusion had come from\n8 donors, one of whom was later found to have HBV, but with a viral load so\nlow it slipped through the improved Nucleic Acid Test blood-testing system\nintroduced in autumn 1999. The revelation raises concerns that HBV-infected\nblood donated by carriers with a low viral load can slip through current\nsafety tests, opening the way for the spread of the disease. Medical\nexperts said the Red Cross will have to review its testing system and\nimprove its accuracy, as the donor's blood passed all of the society's tests.\nThe donor had donated blood several times over the past 5 years and has not\ndeveloped the symptoms of HBV infection, the Red Cross said. Detailed\nanalyses that the society conducted on samples of blood newly drawn from\nthe donor showed that the viral count was one-third the minimum level that\ncould be detected by the current testing system. Red Cross researchers also\nfound minute amounts of the virus in blood samples from the donor held for\nreference at the time of donation. According to the society, the Nagasaki\nman is the only person to have contracted HBV infection from blood donated\nfrom the donor. However, it admitted that the follow-up investigations\ncould not cover all recipients of blood from the HBV carrier, as some of\nthem are dead.\nThe Red Cross has so far believed that HBV-infected blood that could slip\nundetected through the current testing system would be limited to blood\nfrom persons who are in the early stages of infection called the 'window\nperiod.'

City/County Health Director Bob\nHarrington said he decided to make the outbreak public amid concerns it\nwill continue to spread through sex, contact with blood or body fluids or\nintravenous drug use. 'Anybody who thinks they might have any risk at all\nshould come in and get tested,' Harrington said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sending a prevention\nexpert to Casper to provide support, according to a release from the\nWyoming Department of Health. Hepatitis B virus is a liver virus that\ncauses jaundice, abdominal pain and nausea, among other symptoms. Of those\ninfected, 30 percent show no signs or symptoms, according to the CDC.\nHarrington said 8 infected patients have checked into the hospital with\n'crushing fatigue' since the outbreak began. There were 59 confirmed\nhepatitis B cases in Natrona County from 1999 to 2002. In all of Wyoming,\nthere were 88 cases of hepatitis B in 2002. The number of hepatitis C\npatients was much higher, reaching 408 in Wyoming in 2002. Hepatitis B is a\ngreater concern because it is easily transmitted through sexual contact,\nwhereas hepatitis C is generally only transmitted through blood, said Clay\nVan Houten, Hepatitis Coordinator for the state Health Department. The CDC\nteam is curious to see which of the hepatitis B strains is infecting\nCasper, Van Houten said.\nHepatitis C virus, a liver virus not related to hepatitis B virus, can lay\ndormant for long periods of time. Many of those infected with hepatitis B\nvirus may have been carrying hepatitis C virus for a while, Harrington\nsaid. 'In combination they make for a much more serious illness,'\nHarrington said. Health department officials have been tracking patients\nand their contacts. Harrington said officials are investigating another 30\npeople who may have been exposed. 'We get new cases coming into health care\nfacilities regularly,' he said.\nCity/County health officials will start giving the hepatitis B vaccine for\nfree, or a suggested donation [there is no hepatitis C vaccine - Mod.CP].\nSince 1 Mar 2003, the county has given 778 shots to children from 0 to 8\nyears old and 156 to those older than 19, he said.

These concerns have led to significant\nreductions in the uptake of HB vaccine in France, and misinformation on this\nsubject may spread to other countries. Since the scientific data do not\nsupport the idea that HB vaccine causes or exacerbates MS, and since\nuniversal childhood and/or adolescent immunization with HB vaccine is now a\npolicy in 85 countries, this has the potential to cause significant damage to\nimportant public health programmes.\nHB immunization of health care workers, which has been recommended in most\ncountries, became mandatory in France in 1991, ensuring HB immunization of\nhundreds of thousands of young and middle-aged adults, many of them women who\nare in the age group at the highest risk of MS. More recently, one\nneurologist publicized the fact that he had seen several cases of MS or\ndemyelinating disease in women who had received HB vaccine. This was picked\nup by anti-vaccination groups, and a number of patients with MS now claim\nthat their disease was caused or exacerbated by HB vaccine...\n...An association between MS exacerbations and infectious diseases has been\nsuggested, but there is little evidence to support this. Aside from\nhypotheses and individual case reports, there is no actual evidence\nsupporting a causal association between MS exacerbations and any vaccine.\n\n(1) There is no evidence of an association between hepatitis B virus (HBV)\ninfection and MS or other demyelinating diseases. Globally, there are 350\nmillion chronically infected carriers of HBV and 2 000 million persons have\nevidence of past infection. The geographical incidence and prevalence of HB\nare the opposite of those for MS, Scandinavia and Northern Europe having the\nhighest rates of MS and the lowest rates for HBV infection, while sub-Saharan\nAfrica and Asia have the lowest rates of MS and the highest rates of HBV. If\nthe virus does not cause MS, it is unlikely that the vaccine, which is the\nsurface coat of the virus, could do so.\n(2) Published and unpublished studies looking for an increased rate of MS,\nexacerbations of MS, or other demyelinating disease in recipients of HB\nvaccines have found no such increase. Among the more than 550 million\nindividuals who have been immunized with HB vaccines since 1982, no evidence\nof a causal association with MS or other demyelinating diseases has ever been\ndemonstrated...\n(3) Analysis of the reported cases in France: The results of an official\npharmacovigilance study on the neurological tolerance of all HB vaccines\navailable in France (Engerix B, GenHevac and HB-VAX DNA) were presented to\nthe National Commission of Pharmacovigilance in December 1994 and in December\n1996. The data showed the following: ...

For these reasons, WHO has called\nfor all countries to include routine HB immunization in their national\nimmunization programmes. More than 85 countries have done so and many more\nare planning for the introduction of the vaccine. HB vaccines are safe, more\nthan 90% effective in preventing disease, and very cost-effective.

HB causes an\nestimated 4 million acute infections worldwide each year, and currently there\nare more than 350 million chronic carriers of HBV, approximately 25% of whom\nwill die from cirrhosis of the liver or primary liver cancer, diseases which\nkill more than 1 million persons per year. Among the more than 550 million\nindividuals who have been immunized with HB vaccines since 1982, no evidence\nof a causal association with MS or other demyelinating diseases has ever been\ndemonstrated...\n \nDuring the past year, articles in the French popular press and television\nprogrammes have raised concerns among the French public that hepatitis B (HB)\nimmunization may be linked to new cases or flare-ups of multiple sclerosis\n *\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed. The results of an official\npharmacovigilance study on the neurological tolerance of all HB vaccines\navailable in France (Engerix B, GenHevac and HB-VAX DNA) were presented to\nthe National Commission of Pharmacovigilance in December 1994 and in December\n1996. HB immunization of health care workers, which has been recommended in most\ncountries, became mandatory in France in 1991, ensuring HB immunization of\nhundreds of thousands of young and middle-aged adults, many of them women who\nare in the age group at the highest risk of MS. The geographical incidence and prevalence of HB\nare the opposite of those for MS, Scandinavia and Northern Europe having the\nhighest rates of MS and the lowest rates for HBV infection, while sub-Saharan\nAfrica and Asia have the lowest rates of MS and the highest rates of HBV. This was picked\nup by anti-vaccination groups, and a number of patients with MS now claim\nthat their disease was caused or exacerbated by HB vaccine...\n... The epidemiological patterns of\nthe notified cases were similar to those expected in a similar non-vaccinated\npopulation in terms of age distribution, gender ratio, and the nature and\nseverity of neurological symptoms.

Globally, there are 350\nmillion chronically infected carriers of HBV and 2 000 million persons have\nevidence of past infection. More recently, one\nneurologist publicized the fact that he had seen several cases of MS or\ndemyelinating disease in women who had received HB vaccine. Aside from\nhypotheses and individual case reports, there is no actual evidence\nsupporting a causal association between MS exacerbations and any vaccine. Published and unpublished studies looking for an increased rate of MS,\nexacerbations of MS, or other demyelinating disease in recipients of HB\nvaccines have found no such increase.

Both procedures often involve the cutting of cuticles,\nwhich can produce some blood loss. If instruments are not cleaned between\nclients, transmission would be possible. It is instructive to visit 'nail\nshops' which specialize in manicures to see just how this might work.\nManicurists often sit at stations using one set of instruments, and they can\n'treat' a large number of clients in a very short time. Given the lower\ntransmissibility of HCV, I would think it extremely unlikely with this virus.\n\nAnother bit of information that might be helpful: Last year sometime\nthe magazine Consumer Reports did a study of commercial manicures. Among the\nstandards that they defined for a 'good' manicure was that the manicurist did\n*not* use scissors or other sharp objects to cut cuticles. I don't recall\nwhether this was because of concern about transmission of disease or for other\nreasons.
