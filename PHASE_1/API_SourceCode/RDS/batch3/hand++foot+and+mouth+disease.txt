With children back at school, there is a rapid increase in cases, and parents are being urged to look out for the signs.\n\nHFMD is a common, mild illness caused by a type of virus called an enterovirus. It gets its name from the non-itchy rash that develops on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet. It can also cause ulcers in your mouth and make you feel generally unwell, although some people have no symptoms.\n\nAccording to the Health Service Executive (HSE), the disease is very contagious and is common in children under 10 years of age. However, adolescents and adults can also be affected. The 1st symptoms of HFMD include fever and feeling unwell, loss of appetite, sore throat, and small red spots in the mouth, throat, and skin. Later symptoms include the following:\n\nMouth lesions\nAfter 1-2 days, red spots in the mouth will develop into painful ulcers, particularly around the tongue, gums, and inside of the cheeks. It may be difficult to eat, drink, and swallow.\n\nSkin rash\nAny red spots on the skin will turn into a non-itchy rash over the following 1-2 days. The spots are flat or raised, sometimes with blisters, and smaller than chickenpox sores. The rash develops on the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, and between the fingers and toes. In some cases, spots also develop on the buttocks and genitals.\n\nTo prevent HFMD,\n- Always wash your hands after going to the toilet and handling nappies, and before preparing food. If your child has HFMD, encourage them to wash their hands regularly;\n- Avoid sharing utensils with people who are infected with HFMD; and\n- Make sure that shared work surfaces are clean.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] China (Hong Kong)\nDate: Thu 8 Nov 2018\nSource: Ejinsight [edited]\nhttp://www.ejinsight.com/20181108-chp-probes-enterovirus-71-infection-warns-of-hfmd-outbreak/\n\n\nThe Department of Health's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) has launched an investigation into a case of severe enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection involving a primary school student. At the same time, the CHP urged the public and institutions to observe strict personal and environmental hygiene following the outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) at a primary school in Tuen Mun.\n\nThe EV71 patient, an 11-year-old boy with good past health, had been having a fever, coughing, and a runny nose since [10 Oct 2018] before he was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on [3 Nov 2018], the CHP said.\n\nHe developed convulsion and upper-limb weakness on [4 Nov 2018] and was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit on the same day. The CHP said he remained in critical condition.\n\nThe patient's rectal swab specimen tested positive for EV71 upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnoses were EV71 infection and encephalomyelitis.\n\nInitial inquiries found that the boy had no travel history during the incubation period. His father showed symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection recently, although he is now in a stable condition. The boy's other home contacts have remained asymptomatic.\n\nThe CHP's investigations revealed that there is an HFMD outbreak at Po Leung Kuk Fong Wong Kam Chuen Primary School in Tuen Mun, where the boy attended.\n\nAt least 8 boys, aged 11 to 12, have developed HFMD symptoms since [28 Oct 2018]. They all received medical attention and needed no hospitalization. They are now in stable condition.\n\nUpon the CHP's recommendation, the school suspended classes for Primary 5 and 6 students from Thursday [8 Nov] to 21 Nov [2018], according to the school's website. The school has been placed under medical surveillance.\n\nA spokesman for the CHP said EV71 is one of the causative agents for HFMD, and the infection can be transmitted from person to person by direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of the infected.\n\nThere have been 48 recorded cases of EV71 infection, including 3 with severe complications, in Hong Kong this year [2018], compared with 38 (2 with severe complications) last year [2017], according to official data.\n\nThe spokesman said although the usual peak season for HFMD and EV71 infection is from May to July, a smaller peak may also occur from October to December.\n\nAs young children are more susceptible, parents should be mindful of their health and physical condition, the spokesman said, adding that 'institutional outbreaks may occur where HFMD can easily spread among young children with close contact.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common disease in children caused by enteroviruses such as coxsackieviruses and enterovirus 71 (EV71).

He said the disease is highly contagious and is usually contracted by children, but adults can also become infected.\n\nHFMD is caused by the coxsackievirus, which is usually in a person's urine, saliva, and intestines. Children contract the virus easily because they sometimes put toys in their mouth that they share with others while playing. The virus can also spread through coughing, and when an infected person touches an object the virus remains on it. 'The virus is very, very easily spread,' Schobbe explained.\n\nThe symptoms usually start with a sore throat. Young children may sometimes experience a fever, and sores usually appear at the back of the inside of their mouth. The infected person can also develop rashes on the face and foot. The rashes, Schobbe explained, can turn into blisters that can spread and also lead to lesions on the buttocks, knees, and elbows as well as on different parts of a person's body.\n\nBy the time a person starts to experience symptoms, especially rashes on the skin, trace amounts of the virus would have already been left for others to come in contact with.\n\nIf a parents or guardians see that their child has a fever and/or sore throat, Schobbe advised them to keep the child at home so that the infectious cycle can be broken more easily. The Health Department is also advising persons to be hygienic by washing their hands, especially if a person is caring for someone that is infected. Schobbe also advised that toys be separated and disinfected on a regular basis so that the virus is not spread more easily amongst children. He cautioned that the virus can spread to another island if an infected person travels to that island.\n\n'It is very important for everyone to understand that, although this one ailment might cause some discomfort, the ailment is not dangerous at all. There is no danger of anyone dying from it; there is no reason to be highly alarmed,' Schobbe said.\n\nThere is no vaccine for the virus, and there is no real treatment for it, he noted. 'The only thing that can be done is to support an infected child, as a sore throat may hinder a child's will to eat.' He suggested popsicles, ice cream, or lozenges to help soothe the throat, as well as sufficient fluids/liquids.\n\nParents who see symptoms in their child are urged to take their child to the doctor so that the diagnosis can be confirmed. When visiting a house doctor with a child, parents are advised to walk with the child's vaccinations cards, so that the healthcare official knows that the child is properly vaccinated. 'It's important to realise that a person or child does not need to have all the symptoms. A person can have some of the symptoms and still have the virus, and people with a little bad luck will have all the symptoms,' Schobbe said.\n\nSchobbe stressed that there is no reason to panic, as the sickness can be over within 7-10 days, and it is not life-threatening in any way. For additional information, persons may contact the St. Eustatius Health Department at +599 318 2891.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute and highly contagious viral exanthem that commonly affects children younger than 5 years. The infection can be symptomatic, and the clinical manifestations include mild fever with a characteristic vesicular eruption on the hands, feet, and oral cavity. Historically, HFMD is known as a self-limited disease process. However, recurrent outbreaks over the last 2 decades in the Asian and Pacific populations have caused severe illness and debilitating complications, even death. In addition, North American outbreaks were recently documented and have affected unexpected numbers of healthy adults and children [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376252/].\n\nHFMD is an acute viral illness commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) and enterovirus 71 infections. Recently, atypical HFMD has been reported in association with CV-A6, an uncommon enterovirus strain [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5843477/]. It is unclear whether there are significant differences in the disease course and outcome of HFMD depending on the pathogen responsible.\n\nBecause treatment is mainly supportive, recognition and prevention play a vital role in limiting spread of HFMD and decreasing outbreaks. One way that physicians can help is to identify affected patients and educate them on preventive measures. Enteroviruses are shed in the stool for many weeks after initial infection, so good hand hygiene should be made a mandatory practice, especially in healthcare settings, daycare centers, and other places where outbreak is common. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend all affected patients and their close contacts to practice the following: frequent hand washing, especially after changing diapers and using the restroom; frequent disinfection of commonly used surfaces and objects; and avoiding close contact with infected individuals. These recommendations are simple tasks that play an important role in preventing further spread of infection.\n\nSt. Eustatius is an island in the Caribbean.

As the new academic year has just started, possible outbreaks may occur everywhere in the city; therefore, parents should take their children to nearby medical clinics when their children have symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease. Moreover, the child should be kept at home to prevent the spread.\n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease is usually caused by enterovirus.

It is caused by several enteroviruses, such as coxsackieviruses A6, A10, A16 and enterovirus 71. In most cases, HFMD follows a benign and self-limiting course.\n\nIn Viet Nam, the epidemiology of HFMD is complex, but EV71 is responsible for nearly half of the infections in those who have tested positive for HFMD. Typically, HFMD sporadically occurs across Viet Nam but remains most concentrated in the Southern and Central provinces.\n\nIn Viet Nam, HFMD occurs throughout the year, but the peak season is from March until May and September to December. Children can get HFMD at all ages, but children below 3 years are more susceptible, as they have not developed immunity against the virus.\n\nHFMD caused by coxsackievirus (A16) is usually mild, and children will recover spontaneously after 7-10 days. Sometimes the disease can last a bit longer, but severe complications are rare. Mouth sores may cause children to refuse to eat and drink, resulting in dehydration, fatigue, and low blood sugar. If that is the case, the child needs to be admitted to the hospital to receive fluids and food intravenously.\n\nHFMD caused by EV71 can be more serious, with sometimes severe complications. The most common ones are neurological (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis), but, fortunately, these are rare.\n\nThe viruses can be found in the nasal secretions, saliva, fluid in the sores, and stools. HFMD spreads through close contact, coughing and sneezing, or touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. A person is most contagious during the 1st week after the onset of symptoms. After recovery, the virus can persist in the body for weeks, meaning that a child can still spread the disease.\n\nOther children may not show any symptoms, but they may still transmit the virus to others.\n\nPortions of this comment are taken from:\nhttps://vietnamnews.vn/life-style/463227/hand-foot-mouth-disease-in-children.html#:~:text and https://www.who.int/vietnam/news/detail/07-09-2011-hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-in-viet-nam. - Mod.LK\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nVietnam: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/152]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease has raised alarm in Ho Chi Minh City, with up to 640 new cases reported in the last week of September 2020, highest compared to previous months.

HFMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by nasopharyngeal secretions such as saliva or nasal mucus, by direct contact, or by fecal-oral transmission.\n\nChild care settings are the most common places for HFMD to be contracted because of the bathroom training, diaper changes, and that children often put their hands into their mouths. Children who do not attend a preschool or kindergarten were found to be more susceptible to the disease. HFMD is contracted through nose and throat secretions such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, as well as fluid in blisters, and stool.\n\nEarly detection of HFMD is important in preventing an outbreak in the pediatric population. However, most cases are diagnosed clinically and lab tests are not indicated. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture.\n\nThe illness typically begins with a fever and feeling generally unwell. This is followed a day or 2 later by flat discolored spots or bumps that may blister, on the hands, feet, and mouth, and occasionally buttocks and groin region. Signs and symptoms normally appear 3-6 days after exposure to the virus.\n\nPreventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures have been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD. Protective habits include hand washing and disinfecting surfaces in play areas. Breast-feeding has also shown to decrease rates of severe HFMD, but it does not reduce the risk of acquiring infection by EV-A71 (Koh WM, Bogich T, Siegel K, et al. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2016; 35(10): e285-300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5130063/).\n\nMedication is usually not needed as HFMD is a viral disease that typically resolves on its own. Disease management focuses on achieving symptomatic relief for fever and pain. Infection in older children, adolescents, and adults is typically mild and lasts approximately one week, but may occasionally run a longer course. Rarely, viral or 'aseptic' meningitis can occur with hand, foot, and mouth disease, but it is rare. It causes fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain and may require the infected person to be hospitalized for a few days (https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/complications.html). HFMD is usually mild, with few complications, but the EV-71 HFMD strain can be fatal because of its severe complications, which include neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular problems. It is also more infectious than the Coxsackie virus, the most common cause of HFMD.\n\nHFMD occurs in all areas of the world. It often occurs in small outbreaks in nursery schools or kindergartens. Since 1997, large outbreaks of HFMD associated with enterovirus 71 have been reported mostly in children in East and Southeast Asia (https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/outbreaks.html). Outbreaks usually occur during the spring, summer, and fall months. Typically HFMD occurs in children less than 5 years old, but can occasionally occur in adults. HFMD should not be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also known as hoof-and-mouth disease) which mostly affects livestock. - Mod.UBA\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of England, United Kingdom: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/64749]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nPreventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. \n\nThe young mother was told her daughter had hand foot and mouth disease [HFMD] and was sent home that night with medicine. \n\n[The woman] and her daughter were waiting in the emergency room overnight before her daughter was taken to Puffin Ward at around 2:30 pm on [26 Nov 2018].

Several different viruses, including coxsackie viruses and enteroviruses, can cause the symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease.\n\n'I have never seen this before,' said Dr Roanna Kessler, medical director of the wellness center at Johns Hopkins University's Homewood campus, which has been hit hard by the outbreak. So far, 129 students at the north Baltimore campus have been diagnosed with the illness.\n\n'In previous years we have usually seen it in only a handful of people.' Outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease are common in the fall, winter, and spring, especially at elementary schools and daycare centers. Small children are especially susceptible because they have never been exposed before to the viruses that cause it.\n\nTeens and young adults can also develop hand-foot-mouth disease but it usually doesn't cause widespread outbreaks like it does among young kids.\n\nBut so far this year [2018], Johns Hopkins, Princeton, Dartmouth, West Virginia University, Lehigh University, Wesleyan University in Connecticut and Mars Hill University in North Carolina have all reported outbreaks. Florida State University battled an outbreak in 2016.\n\nIt's not clear why so many older teens and young adults are being affected, Kessler said.\n\n'We are wondering if it is a strain that people were not exposed to when they were younger,' she said. Medical journals have carried reports of a mutated strain of coxsackievirus A6 causing severe outbreaks in Asia and Europe.\n\nHand-foot-mouth disease is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in older children and adults. Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in older children and adults.\n\nKessler also wonders if the unusually warm fall weather experienced across the eastern United States has helped the virus stay around and spread more than it normally would.\n\nBut college campuses -- where students share bathrooms, desks, equipment, and where they frequently share food and drink, embrace, and kiss -- are perfect grounds for spreading infectious diseases of all kinds.\n\nUsually, freshmen are prone to 'mono,' [infectious mononucleosis] Kessler said. Mononucleosis is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus. This year [2018], it may be hand-foot-mouth disease, she said.\n\nMost people with hand-foot-mouth disease recover after a few days. There's no specific treatment for it and the universities are telling students to stay in their dorms or at home if they have symptoms. That's not difficult to get them to do, Kessler said.\n\n'It is very upsetting for them, especially if they develop lesions around the face,' she said. 'They usually self-isolate in that situation because they don't want to be seen out and about.'\n\nSevere rashes on the hands can also make nails fall out, she said. Students have complained that lesions in the mouth make it uncomfortable to eat and drink, and this strain is causing genital rashes as well, adding to the embarrassment.\n\n'It's bad enough when little toddlers get it,' Kessler said. Johns Hopkins has put up signs and distributed information about the virus.\n\n'Facilities has been doing extra cleaning in affected areas,' a spokesman added. 'We are giving out disinfectant wipes at the health center to any student with symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease, so they can wipe down areas that they may have touched.'\n\n[Byline: Maggie Fox]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The occurrence of numerous cases of hand-foot-mouth disease in young adults across the United States as documented by the report above is a cause for concern, since the HFMD epidemiology is different from the conventional, much younger (infant/toddler) age group.\n\n'Recently, severe worldwide outbreaks of HFMD have occurred, caused by a strain of coxsackievirus that is less common than EV (enterovirus) 71 or CV (coxsackievirus) A16. This newly recognized strain, CV A6, affects both children and adults. The CV A6 strain was first identified in Finland in 2008 during a major outbreak of HFMD. Later outbreaks were detected across Asia and Europe.' (https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-in-adults/article/681170/)\n\n'Diagnosis of HFMD can often be made by analyzing stool samples or by taking swab samples of the oropharynx for the virus. Typically, the virus that causes HFMD features an incubation period of 4 to 6 days, which is quickly followed by symptoms such as a sore throat with vesicles, fever, malaise, and hand vesicles. During the 1st week, patients are most contagious; however, many patients remain infectious for 4 to 8 weeks following symptom onset due to residual stool shedding. Although complications (such as viral meningitis and encephalitis) associated with the disease are not common, temporary fingernail and toenail loss sometimes occurs.'\n\nDue to the high prevalence of HFMD in infants and children, most clinicians are well-versed in managing the disease in the pediatric population. However, with more adults being affected by HFMD, many clinicians may not be fully aware of how to identify and/or manage these patients due to the lack of information regarding adult approaches. Fortunately, many of the diagnosis and treatment strategies for pediatric HFMD generalize to adult patients. Symptom management may be the most optimal treatment strategy, particularly in the majority of mild HFMD cases, to help manage ulcer pain and fever.'

To date [17 Oct 2018], all provinces and cities across the country have reported multiple cases of this infectious disease, Lao Dong newspaper reported.\n\nThe Ministry of Health asked local authorities to provide guidance, organize campaigns aimed at fighting the spread of the disease and encourage local residents to join efforts to manage the disease. Besides this, healthcare agencies must actively follow up on the disease's development and map out solutions to quickly detect and address infectious cases.\n\nData from the General Department of Preventive Medicine, under the ministry, show that the country reported 53 529 infected people as of September 2018, down 25.3% year-on-year. Of these cases, more than 25 800 were admitted to hospitals, down some 20% versus the year-ago period, and 6 people died of the disease in 5 provinces and cities in the south.\n\nHowever, HCMC, Hanoi, Long An, Dong Nai, Binh Duong, Danang and Quang Ngai have seen a surging number of HFMD patients in recent weeks.\n\nIn HCMC, nearly 400 infected people were admitted to hospitals between 28 Sep and 4 Oct 2018, raising the total number of HFMD inpatients in the city to more than 4000 cases in the January to September [2018] period, according to the municipal Preventive Medicine Center.\n\nMeanwhile, Pediatrics Hospital in Can Tho City has admitted nearly 500 infected children during the first 2 weeks of October [2018], doubling the figure of the year-ago period.\n\nNotably, in the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai, the Kindergarten May 1, which is in Ia Yok Commune, Ia Grai District, had to shut down temporarily to prevent the disease from spreading after as many as 27 children were infected. According to the Ia Grai Health Division, the number of HFMD patients is rapidly increasing, amounting to 40 cases at the start of this month [October 2018], mainly found in the Ia Yok Commune.\n\nApart from that, Quang Ngai Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital in the central region is heavily overloaded because of HFMD. Statistics from the provincial Center for Disease Control revealed that more than 1300 infected cases have been recorded this year [2018], up 2-fold against last year's [2017] figure.\n\nAs the number of HFMD patients is escalating across the country, many hospitals are overloaded and working at full capacity to cope with the disease. The health ministry has called on the local people, especially mothers, to actively adopt preventive measures in their daily activities, such as washing their hands with soap, sterilizing home appliances regularly and paying attention to personal and public hygiene.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] USA - Connecticut\nDate: 17 Oct 2018\nSource: Patch.com [edited]\nhttps://patch.com/connecticut/naugatuck/increase-coxsackie-virus-naugatuck-public-schools\n\n\nAn increase in Coxsackie virus has been reported in Naugatuck [Connecticut] Public Schools.

International Medical Case Reports Journal 2018;11:277-282.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nIntroduction: The clinical and pathological correlation between hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and ocular complications has not yet been established. However, individual case reports indicate a trend that may be the emergence of a new burden of the previous self-limiting virus. This virus is particularly prevalent in childcare centers and poses an infectious disease risk for this workplace.\n\nObjectives: The primary objective of this case report is to describe an unusual clinical record of a patient who developed central serous retinopathy while unwell with HFMD. Discussion of management strategies for this workplace, its staff, and visitors is also included.\n\nMethods: This was an observational case report that was identified and reported retrospectively. For comparison, a search of the literature to identify similar ocular complications of HFMD was also undertaken. Results from this search, in addition to international data and prevention and management strategies, are also provided.\n\nResults: A total of 13 individual case reports with ocular associations, including this clinical record, were identified in the literature worldwide. The median age was 33 years, and 3 patients (23%) were female. No treatment or management guidelines for ocular complications of HFMD have been identified.\n\nConclusion: Severe and potentially life-threatening complications of a seemingly harmless childhood illness are represented sporadically in the literature. The requirement for research and evaluation into this emerging occupational hazard area is necessary for improved prevention, management, and treatment strategies to be developed.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Borrowed from Mod.LK: 'Enteroviruses are the causative agents of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD); included in the enteroviruses are polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Enterovirus 71, a non-polio enterovirus, has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in southeast Asia over the past several years. Complications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, and myocarditis. Most deaths from HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.'\n\nHFMD most often occurs in the spring and fall and is most frequently seen in young children, infants, and toddlers. It is characterized by fever and a blister-like rash affecting the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, along with blisters inside the mouth. (It is unrelated to foot and mouth disease, which affects livestock.)\n\nThere are no tests indicated in obvious cases of HFMD. The diagnosis is made based on the typical symptoms and signs found on examination. This is because the diagnostic laboratory tests that are available generally take 2 to 3 weeks to get results, and generally the symptoms of the illness will have resolved already by this time. - Mod.UBA\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nVietnam: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/152\nConnecticut, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/210\nQueensland, Australia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/285]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1] Viet Nam\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n UBA\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nVietnam: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/152\n HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE UPDATE (10): VIET NAM, USA (CONNECTICUT), AUSTRALIA (QUEENSLAND)\n*********************************************************************************************\n \n\nIn HCMC, nearly 400 infected people were admitted to hospitals between 28 Sep and 4 Oct 2018, raising the total number of HFMD inpatients in the city to more than 4000 cases in the January to September [2018] period, according to the municipal Preventive Medicine Center. \n\n[Byline: Brian McCready]\n\n--\n Of these cases, more than 25 800 were admitted to hospitals, down some 20% versus the year-ago period, and 6 people died of the disease in 5 provinces and cities in the south.\n\n \n\nThe Ministry of Health asked local authorities to provide guidance, organize campaigns aimed at fighting the spread of the disease and encourage local residents to join efforts to manage the disease. \n\nData from the General Department of Preventive Medicine, under the ministry, show that the country reported 53 529 infected people as of September 2018, down 25.3% year-on-year. \n\n'There has been an increased occurrence of the Coxsackie virus, also known as hand-foot-mouth disease, in our student population.

Of the hospitalizations, 38 had severe diseases (grade 2B1 or above) (PMID: 23194699), and one was fatal. Sequence analysis of the viruses collected from a subset of severe patients revealed that all enterovirus A71 strains belonged to subgenogroup C4.\n\nEnterovirus A71 exists as a single serotype but is genetically divided into several genogroups (including C and B) and subgenogroups (e.g., C1 to C5 and B1 to B5). Subgenogroup replacement in endemic localities is a common phenomenon and is often associated with large outbreaks. Of note, a switch from C5 to C4 in 2011 coincided with an explosive outbreak in Viet Nam, which resulted in more than 200 000 hospitalizations and over 200 fatal cases between 2011 and 2012. While there has been no evidence demonstrating the difference in terms of virulence between viruses of different (sub)genogroups, in Viet Nam the replacement of C4 by B5 in 2013 coincided with a decrease in the numbers of reported cases and the proportion of cases with severe illness (http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/). Hence, the re-emergence of subgenotype C4 after an absence of 6 years causing disease among a likely unprotected birth cohort of children born after 2012 is of concern.\n\nAn inactivated vaccine for EV-A71 has been licensed in China but has not been implemented anywhere outside of China. Currently there is no clinically proven effective antiviral drug available to offer the affected patients. IVIg [intravenous immunoglobulin G] is widely used to empirically treat patients with severe illness. Randomized controlled trials to assess the clinical effectiveness of current treatment approaches (including IVIg) are thus urgently needed.\n\nPrepared by Le Nguyen Thanh Nhan (1), Nguyen Thanh Hung (1), Truong Huu Khanh (1), Ngo Ngoc Quang Minh (1), H.

As it is closely related to poliovirus, EV71 has been the focus of much research.\n\nAlthough hand-foot-mouth disease typically presents with mild symptoms of skin rash and fever, sometimes it can develop into a more severe, life-threatening condition.\n\nThese severe neurological complications can have serious effects, including brainstem encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary oedema, and cardiopulmonary failure. In some cases, infection of the nervous system by EV71 can cause long term neurologic and psychiatric disorders.\n\nSince there are currently no effective prophylactic or therapeutic agents against EV71, there has been a keen interest in determining how EV71 achieves its neurological effects.\n\nTo determine the molecular mechanisms used in EV71 infection, researchers at the National University of Singapore analysed the proteins present in human cells infected with EV71.\n\nFurther analyses were conducted on proteins whose levels were found to change during infection with EV71. These included inactivating the genes encoding the target proteins prior to infection with EV71.\n\nIt appeared that the human protein prohibitin (PHB) was needed by EV71 in order to enter motor neuron cells. Prohibitin is associated with a vast array of functions, such as regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, transcription, mitochondrial protein folding, and as a cell-surface receptor.\n\nThe researchers demonstrated that prohibitin is present on the surface of motor neuron cells and used by the EV71 virus to gain access to motor neuron cells. Once inside the cell, EV71 uses mitochondrial prohibitin to obtain the energy required to replicate and cause further infection.\n\nA current anti-cancer drug, rocaglamide, is known to inhibit the activity of prohibitin. The researchers therefore tested whether rocaglamide had any effect on the infection of neuronal cells with EV71.\n\nRocaglamide was found to significantly reduce levels of the virus in neuronal cells compared with untreated cells. In addition, administration of rocaglamide prolonged the life of mice infected with EV71 and reduced the amount of virus present in their spinal cord and brain compared with untreated, EV71-infected mice.\n\nThe researchers commented, 'This study identifies prohibitin as the 1st host factor that is specifically involved in EV71 infection of the CNS. Prohibitin is a druggable target (targeted by rocaglamide) and as such, it is hoped that our work paves the way towards an effective treatment able to prevent the neurological complications associated with EV71 infections.'\n\nIt is hoped that treatment with rocaglamide may help prevent or limit the neurological complications of EV71 infection.\n\nThis research also opens up the possibility of developing new treatments for EV71 infection that target prohibitin. Further studies are required to explore the potential of anti-prohibitin treatments in the management of EV71 infection.\n\nCitation: Too IHK, Bonne I, Tan EL, et al.

As of 24 May 2018, 15 outbreaks involving 59 persons had been reported this week. In the last 4 weeks, most outbreaks occurred in kindergartens and child care centres as well as primary schools.\n\nAs for EV71 infection, while only one case of infection was recorded per month in February and March this year [2018], the number of cases increased to 7 in May 2018, bringing the total to 9 cases this year [2018].\n\n'HFMD occurs throughout the year. Apart from a summer peak from May to July, a smaller peak may also occur from October to December. As young children are more susceptible, parents should stay alert to their health. Institutional outbreaks may occur where HFMD can easily spread among young children with close contact,' a spokesman for the CHP said.\n\n'We have issued letters to doctors, child care centres, kindergartens and primary and secondary schools to alert them to the latest situation. Schools are reminded to follow the Guidelines on Prevention of Communicable Diseases on preventive and control measures as well as management of outbreaks, which should be reported to the CHP for prompt follow-up,' the spokesman added.\n\nHFMD is typically a benign and self-limiting disease.

This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. EV-71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in Southeast Asia over the past several years. EV 71 is a non-polio enterovirus.\n\nComplications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, and myocarditis. Most deaths in HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. It is characterized by fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks.\n\nEV71 is one of the pathogens associated with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). It was responsible for large HFMD outbreaks in Taiwan (1.5 million cases) and Malaysia (Sarawak, 2628 cases) in the late 1990s. In 2008 and 2011 large outbreaks were also described in China (490 000 cases) and Viet Nam (110 000 cases) http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/index.html\n\nMost people with HFMD recover fully after the acute illness. HFMD is usually a mild disease, and nearly all patients recover in 7 to 10 days without medical treatment, and complications are uncommon. Dehydration is the most common complication of HFMD infection caused by coxsackieviruses; it can occur if intake of liquids is limited due to painful sores in the mouth. Rarely, patients develop 'aseptic' or viral meningitis, in which the person has fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain, and may need to be hospitalized for a few days.\n\nHFMD caused by EV71 has been associated with meningitis and encephalitis, and on occasion can cause severe complications, including neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory problems. Cases of fatal EV71 encephalitis have occurred during outbreaks [http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd.information.sheet/en/].\n\nInterventions are tailored to the severity of the disease and consist of antipyretics, sedatives, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), milrinone, haemofiltration and, occasionally, provision of respiratory support.\n\nOutbreak control measures are targeted at interrupting virus transmission from person to person, as well as through contact with contaminated surfaces (such as toys) or fomites. Therefore, health education messages focus on personal hygiene and good sanitation, including recommendations for frequent hand washing, proper disposal of soiled diapers and regular disinfection of soiled surfaces. The transmission of EVs is most efficient in crowded settings, and, therefore, during outbreaks, most countries in the region have adopted social distancing measures, such as closures of childcare facilities and schools and cancellation of public functions involving children https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4033151/. However, the optimal timing for implementation of these measures is unclear, whether early, as soon as an HFMD case is reported, or later following confirmation of EV71 as the causative agent. In addition, the effectiveness of distancing measures, which have substantial socioeconomic implications, is uncertain. - Mod.UBA\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nHong Kong: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children.

Children with the virus typically have a fever, sore throat, a red rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, mouth sores, and loss of appetite. There is no specific treatment other than to let the illness run its course. The best prevention is practicing good sanitation and hygiene.\n\nTim McLaughlin, an epidemiologist with the Public Health department, said the 14 cases reported from 4-10 Feb 2018 were the most he has seen in a single week. Figures for last week [week of 12 Feb 2018] are not yet available, but Mr McLaughlin said it looked as though the spread of the disease had slowed down. Most children were out of school last week and that may be a factor, he said\n\n'14 in a week is a lot,' Mr. McLaughlin said. 'It also tells me there are more cases out there.'\n\nAs a consequence, he said, he is more closely monitoring the spread of the disease, which is not uncommon this time of year.

But preschools are seeing the problem.\n\nBri Bergstrom, the owner of the Montessori School of Cayman, said 3 of her students came down with the illness 3.5 weeks ago. It was the 1st such outbreak at the school, she said, adding that no other students have since been affected.\n\n'It seems to be going around,' Ms Bergstrom said. 'It's almost impossible to avoid sometimes, things coming into the school.'\n\nShe and others operating schools and preschools said that they have increased their efforts to keep classrooms and play areas sanitary by cleaning more often and doing thorough deep cleaning.\n\n'Even when the flu is going around, we always amp up the sanitation,' Ms Bergstrom said.\n\nAt the Treasure Garden, a preschool with 35 students, teacher Tonie-Ann Broomfield said 6 pupils have contracted the disease over the past 2-3 weeks. Some of the students, she said, showed no outward symptoms, such as a fever, before breaking out in a rash. She said the staff is being more vigilant.\n\n'As soon as we check their temperature and it's above 100 deg F [37.8 deg F], we call the parents and ask them to take them to the doctor,' Ms Broomfield said, adding that the child is kept isolated from other children until they are picked up.\n\n[Byline: Mark Muckenfuss]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand-foot-mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the _Enterovirus_ genus (group), which includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and other enteroviruses.\n- Coxsackievirus A16 is typically the most common cause of hand-foot-mouth disease in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses can also cause the illness.\n- Enterovirus 71 has also been associated with cases and outbreaks (https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/outbreaks.html) of hand-foot-mouth disease, mostly in children in East and Southeast Asia.

Important outbreaks with brain stem encephalitis and high mortality rates have been described in Europe in the 1970s (Bulgaria and Hungary in 1975 and 1978 respectively), in Malaysia in 1997 and Taiwan in 1998 and in Asia-Pacific region, including China and Korea. Recently, EV-A71 epidemics have been reported in European countries, such as the Netherlands, France, Spain. EV-A71 infection causes hand-foot-mouth disease, herpangina, fever, and usually resolves spontaneously and do not need specific treatment, however, can sometimes induces a variety of neurological complications, including encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, pulmonary edema, and acute flaccid paralysis that can be fatal.

No one else wants to go through that; I especially don't as a parent,' said Prak.\n\nThe enterovirus family of viruses is the culprit behind hand, foot and mouth disease. Mostly it affects children, but the virus can spread to adults, too.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is a common condition among young children.\n\nWhen a person is infected with the virus, their symptoms will change as it develops.\n\nA fever, loss of appetite, a sore throat and a general sense of malaise will strike 1st. About a day later, painful red sores will form in the mouth, while flat, red spots will appear on the hands, soles of the feet, elbows, knees, genitalia and buttocks.\n\nJust last week, New York Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard found himself on the disabled list after coming down with hand, foot and mouth disease [see following report].\n\nUnfortunately for sufferers, there is currently no cure for the condition, and it must simply be left to run its course. This can take up to 10 days. Painkillers can be taken to ease the discomfort and lower the fever, while mouthwash can be used to numb the mouth.\n\n'It's a miserable virus,' Dr. Melissa Aquilo of Patient First told NBC 12.\n\nThe majority of individuals with hand, foot and mouth disease recover without complications. But in some cases, aseptic meningitis and encephalitis can develop. In such instances, urgent medical help must be sought, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is spread when contagious nose and throat fluids, feces or liquid from the blisters touch the eyes, mouth or nose. The virus is also transferred through close contact, including changing a baby's diapers and hugging. Inhaling an infected person's sneeze or cough is another mode of transmission. That makes it particularly easy for the virus to spread among children, said Dr. Aquilo.\n\n'They share their toys. Their toys have their germs on. They don't wash their hands as well as most adults should. If they put a toy in their mouth and set the toy down and another child plays with it, we'll see a little outbreak in daycares in that kind of situation,' she said.\n\nIt's, therefore, important to wash hands and practice good hygiene at all times, as some carriers don't experience symptoms but can still pass the condition on.\n\n[Byline: Kashmira Gander]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The viruses that cause HFMD are spread through close personal contact, through the air from coughing, and the feces of an infected person. Contaminated objects can also spread the disease. Some people may carry and pass on the virus despite having no symptoms of disease.\n\nHFMD is caused commonly by enteroviruses including coxsackieviruses, polioviruses, echoviruses and other viruses in this group. The disease is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild, self-limiting disease with few complications. However, HFMD can also be caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71), as it is with these cases in Missouri.

Mets Manager Mickey Callaway recalled thinking when he received the news. 'I guess it's very uncommon in adults, period. It's kind of odd. Maybe it's the 1st D.L. [disabled list] stint in baseball with hand, foot and mouth. I don't know.'\n\nJohn Ricco, the Mets assistant general manager who is part of the triumvirate leading the team during General Manager Sandy Alderson's medical leave, announced Syndergaard's ailment before Sun 22 Jul 2018 night's game against the Yankees in the Bronx was rained out.\n\nRicco said he had a final announcement to make: Syndergaard had received a diagnosis of hand, foot and mouth disease and was expected to miss a start. The team thought Syndergaard, 25, had been exposed to the virus on Thu 19 Jul 2018, when he was helping run a children's baseball camp in New Jersey. The illness commonly affects children younger than 5 and can be spread through contact.\n\nAnd then Ricco revealed Syndergaard's puzzling ailment. The Mets believe the infection was behind Syndergaard's diminished velocity during his latest start on Friday [20 Jul 2018]. Callaway pulled Syndergaard after 84 pitches because he was showing signs of fatigue.\n\n'We knew he was having trouble breathing,' Callaway said. 'I put my hands on his legs to talk to him when he came out, and I said, 'Hey man, is everything O.K.?'

The report shows that in April the province reported a total of 38 918 cases of statutory infectious diseases. Among them, the number of reported cases of hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD] in the province was 15 447 cases. The Anhui Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission reminded [the reader] that Anhui has entered the season of high incidence of HFMD. The patients are mainly children under 5 years of age. Parents are advised to take preventive measures.\n\nCategory C infectious diseases - a total of 9037 cases were reported without deaths. The top 3 diseases reported were hand-foot-mouth disease, other infectious diarrhea, and mumps, accounting for 92.81 percent of the total reported cases of C-type infectious diseases.\n\nChildren can be vaccinated with EV71 vaccine to prevent EV71 virus causing severe HFMD and death.\n\n[Byline: Lu Xianhong, Guan Fei]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n\n[Anhui is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the eastern region of the country. The province is located across the basins of the Yangtze River and the Huai River, bordering Jiangsu to the east, Zhejiang to the southeast, Jiangxi to the south, Hubei to the southwest, Henan to the northwest, and Shandong for a short section in the north.\n\nIn mainland China, significant increases in HFMD morbidity and mortality have caused an enormous burden on the public health system. Nationwide epidemics of HFMD started in 2008, beginning with an outbreak in Anhui province that spread rapidly to other provinces. In total, 488 955 young children suffered in this epidemic that had 1165 severe cases and 126 fatal cases. In response to these large outbreaks, HFMD was listed as a category C notifiable disease in China in May 2008.\n\nHFMD has recently emerged in the Asia-Pacific region as the most severe epidemic disease affecting children. A number of outbreaks of EV71 HFMD in the Asia-Pacific region have been reported since 1997. Over the years, outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia, Taiwan, mainland China, Australia, and Singapore among other areas in the region, making EV71 a public health threat to children in Asia. According to the statistics from National Health and Family Planning Commission of China from 2008 -- 2013, more than 9 million cases of HFMD were reported, resulting in around 2700 reported deaths. For the period 2008 -- 2012, around 80 percent of the severe cases and over 90 percent of fatal cases were caused by EV71.\n\nIn December 2015, the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) approved the 1st vaccine against EV71, an inactivated (killed) vaccine made by the Institute of Medical Biology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The vaccine developed by the institute showed vaccine efficacy of 97.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 92.9 percent - 99.0 percent). Overall, the team identified 155 confirmed cases of EV71-associated HFMD with 4 occurring in the vaccine group and 151 in the placebo group. This vaccine targets children aged 6--71 months, with each child requiring a total of 2 doses one month apart.\n\nA 2nd vaccine, also an inactivated vaccine, developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd was approved January 2016. The vaccine developed by Sinovac showed a 97.5 percent vaccine efficacy (6 month) and a 94.8 percent vaccine efficacy (12 month) against EV71-associated HFMD cases and 89.3 percent (6 month) and 88.0 percent (12 month) for EV71-associated cases. This vaccine targets children aged 6--35 months, with each child requiring a total of 2 doses 1 month apart.\n\nSome questions remain: Will Chinese manufacturers make the vaccine available to other countries with EV71 outbreaks? Cross-protection of the vaccines against pandemic virus strains? How will they incorporate EV71 vaccine into the EPI? Can the vaccine be co-administered with other vaccines? How do you standardize the vaccine quality control and evaluation of EV71 vaccines?\n\n(Excerpted from https://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2016/01/Severe-Hand-Foot-and-Mouth-Disease-HFMD-is-now-vaccinepreventable-at-least-in-China#.Wv8PIu4vypo) - Mod.LK\n\nA map of China: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155\n\n]", "summary": "The vaccine developed by Sinovac showed a 97.5 percent vaccine efficacy (6 month) and a 94.8 percent vaccine efficacy (12 month) against EV71-associated HFMD cases and 89.3 percent (6 month) and 88.0 percent (12 month) for EV71-associated cases.

It can also cause mouth ulcers, making those who catch it feel generally unwell.\n\nHighly contagious, the condition is common in children under 10 years of age. However, adolescents and adults can also be affected.\n\nGenerally, HFMD is a mild and short-lasting illness, and treatment is usually not needed as the body's immune system clears the virus, and symptoms go away after about 7-10 days.\n\nThe 1st symptoms include fever and feeling unwell, loss of appetite, lethargy, sore throat and small red spots in the mouth, throat and skin. The sores can be extremely painful. There may also be a rash on the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, and occasionally on the buttocks. The rash will 1st look like flat red spots and that will then become raised and may blister.\n\nThe viruses causing it are spread through coughs or sneezes.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for the condition. As it is caused by a viral infection, it cannot be treated with antibiotics.\n\nSymptoms can be eased by resting, drinking plenty of fluids and taking children's paracetamol to relieve pain and bring down a temperature. The pain of mouth ulcers can be numbed with anaesthetic mouthwashes or sprays.\n\nComplications can include dehydration, infection of the sores and -- much more rarely -- viral meningitis, which is an infection of the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. In even rarer cases, it can lead to encephalitis, an infection that causes the brain tissue to swell and become inflamed, sometimes leading to brain damage death.\n\nAs it is extremely contagious, a child diagnosed with HFMD must be kept at home until they have fully recovered.\n\nMake sure that proper hand washing techniques are followed by everyone who comes in contact with the child infected.\n\n[Byline: Denise McNamara]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A Healthmap/ProMED of Ireland can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39]\n\n******\n[2] HFMD Biweekly Report\nDate: Tue 5 Dec 2017\nSource: WHO [edited]\nhttp://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd_biweekly_report_20171205a.pdf?ua=1\n\n\nHand, Foot and Mouth Disease Situation Update Number 528; 5 Dec 2017) Surveillance summary in the Western Pacific Region\n-------------------------\nThis surveillance summary includes information from countries and areas where transmission of HFMD occurs and case counts are routinely reported.\n\nCountries in the temperate zone.\n----------------------------\nChina (no update).

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has also been associated with cases and outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease. Less often, EV71 has been associated with severe disease, such as encephalitis. Several types of enteroviruses may be identified in outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease; however, most of the time, one or 2 enteroviruses are identified.\n\nSince the initial description of EV71 in 1974 [1], outbreaks of infection with this virus have occurred periodically throughout the world [2-8]. EV71 infection manifests most frequently as the childhood exanthem known as 'hand, foot, and mouth disease' (HFMD), and it is clinically indistinguishable from HFMD caused by Coxsackie virus A16 (CA16). A molecular study of the evolution of human enteroviruses has shown that EV71 and CA16 have a close genetic relationship, and, together with CA7 and CA14, they form a distinct genetic subgroup within cluster A of the _Enterovirus_ genus of the family Picornaviridae [9]. Despite the close genetic relationship between EV71 and CA16, EV71 has a propensity to cause neurological disease during acute infection [2, 3], a feature not observed in CA16 infections. Children under 4 years of age are particularly susceptible to the most severe forms of EV71-associated neurological disease, including meningitis, brain-stem and/or cerebellar encephalitis, and poliomyelitis-like paralysis. The neurological complications of EV71 infection may occasionally cause permanent paralysis or death. Several large epidemics of severe EV71 infection in young children, including numerous cases of fatal brain-stem encephalitis, have recently been reported in Southeast Asia [10-12; excerpted and edited from Peter McMinn et al.

However, it can sometimes occur in older children and adults. It usually starts with a fever, reduced appetite, sore throat, and a feeling of being unwell (malaise). One or 2 days after the fever starts, painful sores can develop in the mouth, often in the back of the mouth, as small red spots that blister and can become ulcers. A skin rash with red spots, and sometimes with blisters, may also develop over 1 or 2 days on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; it may also appear on the knees, elbows, buttocks or genital area. Dehydration may occur because blisters in the mouth create pain with swallowing. Some people, especially adults, may show no symptoms at all, but they can still pass the virus to others.

Recently some cases have also been reported in Lahore, the 2nd biggest metropolitan city of Pakistan.\n\nThe Health department has been investigating this outbreak internally, but so far, no news has been shared on mass media. The disease is mild and has affected under 5 children of play group and Kindergarten.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a self-limiting contagious illness caused commonly by enteroviruses affecting mostly infants and children aged less than 5 years. Numerous non-polio enteroviruses as coxsackie viruses A16, A4, A5, A9, A10, B2 and B5 and enterovirus 71 are associated with HFMD. However, the most common causes are coxsackie virus A16 (CAV 16) and enterovirus 71 (EV 71).\n\nThe virus is shed in saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, blister fluid, and feces of an infected person. HFMD is spread from one person to another through close contact, coughing and sneezing, contact with feces and blister fluids, and touching objects or surfaces contaminated with the virus. An infected person is most contagious during the 1st week of illness https://www.cdc.gov/features/handfootmouthdisease/index.html. The incubation period is generally 3 to 5 days. The epidemiological pattern varies by geographical region and climate, but the incidence of infection is higher in the summer and autumn months in temperate climates while remaining prevalent year-round in tropical climates.\n\nHFMD presents as fever, rash on hands and feet, and vesicles in the mouth (known as herpangina), conjunctivitis, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, acute respiratory problem and myopericarditis. It should be noted that infection with EV 71 may result in complications without producing clinically-evident HFMD. The rash does not itch. The illness is usually mild and resolves spontaneously within 7 to 10 days without any treatment.\n\nHFMD is treated symptomatically as there is no specific treatment or vaccine. Patients should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Early diagnosis and isolation is the key to prevent spread of HFMD.\n\nThe above information relates to cases from 2 densely populated districts of Punjab Province in Pakistan.

'The virus can spread, even when there are no symptoms, through feces, from diaper changes and respiratory secretions. The contagion occurs in the first 3 days of contact and then the symptoms appear,' said the Secretary of Health.\n\nThey also warn that the disease can be confused with the common cold, flu or stomach infections, as it manifests with flu-like symptoms.\n\nRecommendations\n---------------\nAmong the recommendations issued by health authorities are:\n- frequent hand washing and the use of individual cutlery;\n- shared toys such as in day-care centers should be disinfected regularly because the virus can live on these objects for several days;\n- avoid kissing others;\n- sneeze into your [tissue or handkerchief];\n- and go to the doctor with any symptoms;\n- avoid self-medication and notify childcare organizations, so that preventive measures can be taken to avoid further spread of the disease, especially to family members and childcare workers.\n\nOnce treated, symptoms should disappear in a week and there is little risk of morbidity or mortality, as long as symptoms are promptly treated, the authorities state.\n\nHighest number of cases\n-----------------------\nIn Mexico, the region with the highest number of registered cases is Tlaxcala (about 100), where the Ministry of Health (Sesa) promoted training for the population in general, nursery managers and educational institutions, to identify signs and symptoms.\n\nThe Secretary of Health in Tlaxcala, Alberto Jonguitud Falc\u00f3n, reported that the patients are mainly inhabitants of the municipalities of Apizaco, Tlaxcala and Chiautempan. He explained that the State Commission for the Protection against Health Risks (Coeprist) supervises the chlorination and disinfection of water tanks and cisterns; 'We have carried out an exhaustive verification of the educational establishments and also verified chlorination in the water wells of localities that register cases.'\n\nIn the Mixteca region of Oaxaca, where approximately 80 cases have been reported, education authorities have asked parents and school authorities to be alert.\n\nHidalgo is the state with the 3rd-highest number of cases, reporting 61. The public policy director of the Health Ministry, Concepci\u00f3n Carmona Ramos, said the outbreak has been concentrated in the central area, including the regions of Pachuca, Mineral de la Reforma, Tizayuca and the Tula-Tepeji, among others. She emphasized that since it is not a disease subject to epidemiological surveillance, a comparison with other years cannot be made; however, it is clear that its prevalence has increased in 2017. The official commented that, as schoolchildren are the most affected, there is constant coordination with the Ministry of Public Education, to carry out case control and surveillance.\n\nThe State of Mexico has registered 40 cases, including 20 in Quer\u00e9taro, 5 in Tamaulipas, and 3 in Zacatecas.\n\nThe 1st outbreak was detected in the United States. The coxsackie virus is named after the city of Coxsackie, New York, where it was 1st discovered, although there are no data from the time when this occurred.\n\nInfections occur throughout the year, but in colder climates, outbreaks of coxsackie virus occur more often in summer and fall.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nKathryn Soderholm\n<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>\n\n[Coxsackie virus A16 is the most common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses can also cause the illness. The virus is a member of the family _Picornaviridae_, genus _Enterovirus_, which also includes polioviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.\n\nCoxsackie virus is highly contagious.

The illness spreads by person-to-person contact with an infected person's nasal secretions or throat discharge, saliva, fluid from blisters, stool, respiratory droplets sprayed into the air after a cough or sneeze.

It usually starts with a fever, reduced appetite, sore throat, and a feeling of being unwell (malaise). One or 2 days after the fever starts, painful sores can develop in the mouth, often in the back of the mouth, as small red spots that blister and can become ulcers. A skin rash with red spots, and sometimes with blisters, may also develop over 1 or 2 days on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; it may also appear on the knees, elbows, buttocks or genital area. Dehydration may occur because blisters in the mouth create pain with swallowing. Some people, especially adults, may show no symptoms at all, but they can still pass the virus to others.

Compared to the same period in 2016 (3999 cases and 6 deaths), the number of cases is greater by 31 percent.\n\nHFMD is typically a benign and self-limiting disease. Most common in young children, it presents as fever, oral lesions and rash on the hands, feet and buttocks. The oral lesions consist of rapidly-ulcerating vesicles on the buccal mucosa, tongue, palate and gums. The rash consists of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, fingers and soles, which generally persist for 7 to 10 days, and maculopapular lesions on the buttocks.\n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the Enterovirus genus (group).

EV 71 is a non-polio enterovirus.\n\nComplications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage and myocarditis.

Its most common causes are coxsackie virus A16 (CAV 16) and enterovirus 71 (EV 71).\n\nInfection with EV71 is usually asymptomatic or associated with a mild non-specific illness. More severe presentations do occur, particularly in children. Presentations include exanthems (including HFMD), herpangina, conjunctivitis, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, acute respiratory problem and myopericarditis. It should be noted that infection with EV 71 may result in complications without producing clinically-evident HFMD. This occurred in the context of a large outbreak of EV 71 in Bulgaria.\n\nEV 71 is transmitted through direct contact with discharge from the nose and throat, saliva, fluid from blisters or the stools of an infected person. Cases are most infectious during the 1st week of acute illness but may continue to shed virus in stool for weeks. The incubation period is 3-5 days. The epidemiological pattern varies by geographical region and climate, but the incidence of infection is higher in the summer and autumn months in temperate climates while remaining prevalent year-round in tropical climates.

Most common in young children, it presents as fever, oral lesions and rash on the hands, feet and buttocks. The oral lesions consist of rapidly-ulcerating vesicles on the buccal mucosa, tongue, palate and gums. The rash consists of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, fingers and soles, which generally persist for 7-10 days, and maculopapular lesions on the buttocks.\n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the Enterovirus genus (group). This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.\n\nEnterovirus 71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in Southeast Asia over several years. EV-71 is a non-polio enterovirus. Complications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage and myocarditis.

EV71 infection can cause illness ranging from mild through to serious with life threatening complications. Outbreaks have been reported in Asia over many years.\n\nSpread is from person to person through contamination of hands or objects (for example, toys) with infected faeces.

In people with hand-foot-mouth disease, direct contact with fluid from blisters on the infected person can also spread the virus.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n------------------\nEV71 is one of many possible viruses that cause hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD].

If diagnosed, a child will need a doctor's note to return to school.\n\nMs. Parlato said the outbreak is 'not unique' to Watertown, as there have been a number of cases across the state.\n\nIn addition to the cleaning, a number of precautions have been put into effect. Administrators, teachers, nurses, athletic directors, and coaches will be speaking to students with a consistent message about the importance of maintaining good hygiene, including frequent hand washing and not sharing personal items, such as water bottles and utensils. The administration also asked that parents remind their children at home 'about these important and appropriate precautions.'\n\n[Byline: Jim Taylor]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Coxsackieviruses belong to the family Picornaviridae and the genus Enterovirus, which also includes poliovirus and echovirus. Enteroviruses are among the most common and important human pathogens. Coxsackie viruses share many characteristics with poliovirus. With control of poliovirus infections in much of the world, more attention has been focused on understanding the nonpolio enteroviruses such as coxsackie virus.\n\nCoxsackieviruses are nonenveloped viruses with linear single-stranded RNA. Coxsackieviruses are divided into group A and group B viruses based on early observations of their pathogenicity in mice. Group A coxsackieviruses were noted to cause a flaccid paralysis, which was caused by generalized myositis, while group B coxsackieviruses were noted to cause a spastic paralysis due to focal muscle injury and degeneration of neuronal tissue. At least 23 serotypes (1-22, 24) of group A and 6 serotypes (1-6) of group B are recognized.\n\nIn general, group A coxsackieviruses tend to infect the skin and mucous membranes, causing herpangina, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), and hand, foot and mouth (HFM) disease. Group B coxsackieviruses tend to infect the heart, pleura, pancreas, and liver, causing pleurodynia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and hepatitis.

It's considered a minor illness, like the common cold.\n\nFamilies in the district were alerted after the cases of HFMD were confirmed.\n\nIn young children symptoms of HFMD are mild and usually resolve in 7-10 days, according to a fact sheet from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. HFMD usually starts with a fever, poor appetite and a sore throat. 1-2 days after the fever starts, painful sores usually develop in the mouth, beginning as small red spots that blister and often become ulcers. A skin rash also develops, usually on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\n\nSymptoms usually appear 3-7 days after exposure. HFMD is spread by contact with discharges from the nose or throat or the feces of infected people, according to the fact sheet.\n\nThe best way to prevent the spread of illness is to wash hands often, Heidelmeier said.\n\nParents in the district were reminded that if their child is experiencing a fever or rash on their hands, feet, and/or mouth, they should be kept home from school until at least 24 hours after the fever breaks and exposed vesicles are dry. Students will be checked by school health assistants to make sure the lesions are dry before being allowed back at school, Heidelmeier added.\n\n[Byline: Carol Spaeth-Bauer]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See map of Wisconsin, United States at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/250. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] Arizona (Yavapai County)\nDate: Wed 5 Oct 2016\nSource: Daily Courier [edited]\nhttp://www.dcourier.com/news/2016/oct/05/hand-foot-mouth-disease-outbreaks-require-vigilanc/\n\n\nLittle kids and nasty germs just seem to go together.\n\nLocal health officials say there is now some outbreaks of a common childhood ailment known as hand-foot-mouth disease, one caused by the coxsackie virus.\n\nIt is a fairly benign, yet easily transmittable, illness that occurs most often in preschool-age children.\n\nThe illness manifests itself in small blisters around the mouth, hands, and feet, and is usually preceded by a slight fever, usually not a high fever but one that can last for a few days, said local health officials.\n\nThere is no treatment for this ailment, but it rarely requires more than a few days home and some over-the-counter medications to lower the fever and treat any discomfort, health officials said.\n\n'It is a fairly mild disease with fever, some blisters, and it is self-limiting. It goes away after a while; usually the incubation is 3-6 days,' said Yavapai County Community Health Services Epidemiologist Stephen Everett.\n\nHe said his department has been advised by several local day care and preschools that they have some outbreaks. The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not require tracking of this illness because it is a common childhood ailment that tends to run its course without complications.\n\nOf course, Everett said he always advises families to consult with their family physicians when a child is ill just to be certain that they get proper care, and if other symptoms arise they are attended to immediately. In rare cases, Everett said this can spread into the spinal cord and cause a mild form of meningitis.\n\nAs for prevention, Everett said the key to preventing contagious illnesses of this type are to keep children home from daycare or preschool when they spike any level of fever. The condition is most contagious when a child has a fever, he said.\n\nMost preschool and day care administrators are aware when outbreaks occur to do thorough cleanings of all communal toys and gathering places, and to be cautious when changing diapers as the virus is also found in a child's stool, he said. Regular handwashing with young children is always advisable, he noted.\n\nYavapai Regional Medical Center Marketing and Communications Director Ken Boush advised on Tue 4 Oct 2016, that the hospital's PhysicanCare Ponderosa Pediatric practice reported a recent increase in this ailment among their young patients.\n\nEverett said the condition is most common in summer, spring, and fall, with the virus typically becoming dormant come the winter months.\n\nOutbreaks are 'not unusual,' Everett said. 'We have them every year. What we try to stress, and some parents have a hard time with this, is do not send kids to school if they have a fever... they spread disease,' Everett said, noting the flu can spread in the same way. 'It's tough for parents because if their kid isn't in daycare, they're not at work ... But it's important.

In most cases, the disease is mild and self-limiting, but more severe clinical presentation with neurological symptoms such as meningitis, encephalitis and polio-like paralysis may occur.\n\nIn the 1st 6 months of 2016, China and Japan are reporting different patterns of the viral disease compared with last year [2015].\n\nIn China through 30 Jun, a total of 1 305 593 cases of HFMD including 122 deaths were reported in 2016. This includes 452 668 cases reported in June alone. This compares with the same period in 2015 when China reported 984 699 cases of HFMD and 28 deaths.\n\nThe reverse is true in Japan this year to date. Japan saw a big HFMD year in 2015; however, so far this year the numbers are way down. Through the 1st 7 months of the year, Japan has reported 17 387 HFMD cases. This compares to the same period in 2015 when the country reported 216 971 cases of HFMD.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the Enterovirus genus (group). This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the commonest cause of HFMD in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Enterovirus 71 has also been associated with HFMD and outbreaks of this disease.\n\nEV-71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in South East Asia over the several years. EV 71 is a non-polio enterovirus.\n\nComplications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage and myocarditis. Most deaths in HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.\n\n[byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See discussion of HFMD in earlier posts by this moderator.\n\nA map of China can be accessed at https://sites.google.com/site/chinamapsite/, and of Japan at https://binged.it/2bpy0W5. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155.]", "summary": "\n\n[byline: Bernama]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See ProMED-mail: Hand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia: alert 20160618.4295321 for more information on HFMD in Malaysia this year (2016). \n\n[byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See discussion of HFMD in earlier posts by this moderator.

Other genotypes include coxsackievirus A16 (CAV16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71).

In 2012, an extensive outbreak of HFMD occurred; the incidence rate was 3-fold higher than the average incidence rate of 58.15 cases per 100 000 population or more than 36 000 cases; the 2012 outbreak included 2 fatal cases of EV71 encephalitis.\n\nGenerally, the clinical manifestations of HFMD were fever; drooling, and refusal to eat (among young children); painful lesions in the mouth, especially on the soft palate; and vesicular rashes on the palms and feet.\n\nExcerpted from\nPuenpa J, Chieochansin T, Linsuwanon P, et al: Hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus A6, Thailand, 2012.

It's typical in child care facilities.'\n\nDaycare operations and preschools can be ripe ground for communicable diseases that travel by close personal contact, proximity to dirty diapers and shared saliva or mucus on toys and other surfaces.

'It can be spread pretty easily,' Schilling said.\n\nSymptoms are a general feeling of being unwell, a fever, painful sores in the throat and mouth, and rash and blisters on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, according to Schilling. Mouth and throat sores can affect a baby or child's appetite, so intake of fluid and food should be encouraged.\n\n'There's no specific treatment,' Schilling said. 'Take comfort measures and watch them. If they don't eat or drink for a time, call a health care provider.' Comfort measures can include mouthwashes or sprays that numb mouth pain and over-the-counter medications other than aspirin to relieve pain and fever. Aspirin should not be given to children.\n\nVaccinations have not been developed for HFMD, and there is no treatment.\n\nPrevention tips\n---------------\nThe Centers for Disease Control give tips for lessening the risks of sharing or contracting HFMD:\n- Keep children home from school or daycare if they have symptoms.\n- Wash hands often with soap and water, especially after changing diapers and using the toilet.\n- Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and soiled items, including toys.\n- Avoid close contact such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups with people with hand, foot and mouth disease.\n- If a person has mouth sores, it might be painful to swallow. However, it is important for people with hand, foot and mouth disease to drink enough liquids to prevent dehydration (loss of body fluids).

The number of HFMD cases in week 22 of 2016 was 592, compared with 568 cases reported in the previous week. There have been a total of 913 cases in the prefecture from 1 Jan [2016] through 19 Jun [2016]. According to the department, reports from 34 medical organizations counted 292 cases of the disease during the week from 13-17 Jun [2016].

The 18 241 infections so far is the 2nd highest for the 1st 21 weeks of a year, exceeded only by the 21 102 in 2012. In contrast, the median number for the 1st 21 weeks over the past 5 years is 8193.\n\nAssociate Professor Chong Chia Yin, senior infectious disease consultant at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said more than 200 children have been hospitalised at KKH for HFMD this year [2016]. She said: 'Most of these children were admitted for fever and poor feeding, mild dehydration or febrile fits due to their high fever. None suffered serious complications.'\n\nSerious complications are rare, but the infection could damage the brain, lungs or heart. Symptoms of HFMD include fever, ulcers in the mouth and tongue, blisters on hand, feet and bum, poor appetite and lethargy. A child can get dehydrated from not drinking enough because it hurts to do so.\n\nDuring an outbreak of HFMD in 2000-2001 associated with the more dangerous EV71 strain, there were 7 deaths.\n\nThe current epidemic has been fuelled in part by parents who send their sick kids to childcare centres, and refuse to take them home when asked to. Marjorie Zaccheus, principal of Presbyterian Community Services Tampines Childcare Centre, which has been hit by a spate of cases, said that when she suspects a child has HFMD, she keeps them away from other children and asks their parents to take them home. 'The parents say they are coming but they don't turn up until closing time. Others don't answer the phone,' said Madam Zaccheus. She said holding full-time jobs is no excuse.\n\nThe children are checked for fever and ulcers or rash when they arrive. But Madam Zaccheus said sometimes, the person bringing the child is not a parent or guardian. 'In these cases, I have to accept them. I have no alternative.' But the centre, which has 79 children, does not have the resources to effectively quarantine a sick child. It had 20 cases in the last month and a half.\n\n[A parent], 38, whose daughter, aged 3, was one of the 20 infected, said: 'It's irresponsible for parents to leave a sick child here.' He added: 'Not only is the child already uncomfortable because of the sickness, they would feel lonely and isolated if they have to be separated from the other children.' Despite the high rates of infection at the centre, many parents have chosen not to keep their children away.\n\nAdults too can get HFMD, and it is usually more severe. [The parent] recalls when his wife caught the infection from their infant son some years back. She was sick in bed for a week with a high fever and had a hard time eating because her mouth was full of ulcers.\n\n[byline: salma@sph.com.sg and rkurohi@sph.com.sg]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See discussion of HFMD in Singapore in ProMED-mail post Hand, foot & mouth disease - Singapore 20160505.4203981. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/150.]", "summary": "\n\n[byline: salma@sph.com.sg and rkurohi@sph.com.sg]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See discussion of HFMD in Singapore in ProMED-mail post Hand, foot & mouth disease - Singapore 20160505.4203981.

There has been no vaccine or medication available at peak season for the disease.\n\nThe Department of Preventive Medicine under the Ministry of Health on 12 May [2016] warned parents of an outbreak of the disease during the hot weather.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease, or HFMD, is a contagious illness that is caused by different viruses. Infants and children younger than 5 years old are more likely to get this disease. Symptoms usually begin with a fever, reduced appetite, sore throat, and a feeling of being unwell. A day or 2 after the fever starts, painful sores can develop in the mouth. A skin rash with flat red spots may also develop on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Sometimes, a rash also occurs on the knees, elbows, and buttocks. This rash may blister but won't itch.\n\nHFMD infection cases are recorded year round, yet it escalates in March to May and September to October.\n\nThe Ministry of Health said that although since the beginning of the year [2016] cases of HFMD have decreased by 23.2 percent compared to the same period last year, most cities and provinces in the country have reported cases. Meanwhile, there is no vaccine to prevent the disease, but people can take simple steps like washing hands often and practicing good hygiene to reduce the risk of infection.\n\nTo minimize HFMD cases amongst children, parents should keep personal hygiene by washing hands many times a day for kids; adults should wash their hands before cooking, carrying babies, after going to the toilet, and not let babies put their hands into mouths, and regularly disinfect house floors and toys. Preschools must clean floors and disinfect toys. Ill kids should be isolated at home to prevent transmission to others.\n\n[Byline: Minh Khang]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the past decade, HFMD has become more predominant in the Asia-Pacific region and has become a pressing problem for global public health.\n\nIn Viet Nam, HFMD circulates year-round in most provinces, with 2 associated peaks, from March to May and from September to December, as stated above. The southern region is the most affected area and accounted for over 60% of cases for the whole country.\n\nIn 2011 Viet Nam experienced a significant increase in HFMD activity with 112 370 cases and 169 deaths reported from 63/63 provinces.\n\nThe response of the Viet Nam Ministry of Health included: (1) strengthened surveillance, early detection and treatment; (2) enhanced communication on HFMD preventive measures, including a national campaign to prevent and control HFMD; (3) improved clinical management of cases and hospital infection control practices through training of hospital staff; and (4) training of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and public health staff to raise awareness and reduce morbidity and mortality.\n\nWHO has developed and disseminated WPRO (Western Pacific region) guidelines on clinical management and a public health response to HFMD.\n\nWHO has provided technical support to the Ministry of Health to:\n- establish sentinel surveillance;\n- improve clinical case management, particularly for severe cases requiring intensive care;\n- improve laboratory diagnosis;\n- identify risk factors for severe cases and deaths;\n- evaluate control and prevention measures;\n- support the conduct of research studies.\n\n(Excerpted from http://www.wpro.who.int/vietnam/topics/hand_foot_mouth/factsheet/en/). - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/152.]", "summary": "\n\nWHO has provided technical support to the Ministry of Health to:\n- establish sentinel surveillance;\n- improve clinical case management, particularly for severe cases requiring intensive care;\n- improve laboratory diagnosis;\n- identify risk factors for severe cases and deaths;\n- evaluate control and prevention measures;\n- support the conduct of research studies. \n\nThe response of the Viet Nam Ministry of Health included: (1) strengthened surveillance, early detection and treatment; (2) enhanced communication on HFMD preventive measures, including a national campaign to prevent and control HFMD; (3) improved clinical management of cases and hospital infection control practices through training of hospital staff; and (4) training of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and public health staff to raise awareness and reduce morbidity and mortality.

There were 1052 HFMD cases from 17 Apr to 23 Apr this year [2016], which is the highest number since mid-October 2013, when 1247 weekly cases were reported, according to MOH figures.\n\nThe numbers started increasing in February this year [2016]: there were 587 cases reported from 7 Feb to 13 Feb, rising to 756, 2 weeks later. The number of cases rose above the 900-mark in early March, before hitting the current high late last month [April 2016]. As of 23 Apr, 12 166 cases in total have been reported to MOH so far this year. In contrast, 8835 cases were reported between January and 25 Apr last year [2015].\n\nInfectious disease expert Leong Hoe Nam of Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital said the upward trend will likely continue in the next 2-3 weeks, and it could become an epidemic. 'The number that exceeds 1000 is very significant: it tells us that many people have not been exposed to (the virus). We have a fresh group of people getting exposed to it and in turn this 1000 will spread easily to another 1000 to 2000 people,' said Dr Leong. 'I think this is going to be an epidemic; if not we are already at the threshold of a new epidemic,' Dr Leong added, while pointing out that the current strain is not life-threatening.\n\nHFMD can be transmitted from person to person by direct contact with bodily fluids such as saliva. While both adults and children can get HFMD, children below the age of 5 are more susceptible.\n\nAs more cases have been reported, childcare centers have been working to deal with the problem. At Tai Pei childcare centre, a total of 14 HFMD cases had been reported since 2 Mar [2016] with about half of them affecting children below 3 years of age. The centre stepped up hygiene standards, and has been clear of HFMD since 15 Apr [2016]. 'To stop the chain of transmission, sterilization is very important. We even have to sterilize stationery. Usually, we only sterilized the common areas. Children's belongings like toys are sterilized once they've been played with. Everything that they touch, even charts and the walls along the corridor are all sterilized,' said the school's principal, Drolma Teh. 'We also take children's temperatures and conduct health checks up to 3 times a day,' Ms Teh added. Before the outbreak, children temperatures were taken twice daily.\n\nFour childcare centers on MOH's watch list\n------------------------------------------\nChildcare centers with more than 10 HFMD cases or with more than 13 percent of the enrolment contracting the virus and a transmission period of more than 16 days are put on a watch list on the MOH website. A total of 4 childcare centers are currently on the list: PCF Sparkletots Preschool at Sembawang, PCF Sparkletots Preschool at Paya Lebar, The Little Skool-House at Kent Vale and MY World at Woodlands Circle.\n\nIn a statement to Channel NewsAsia, the PAP Community Foundation (PCF) said: 'Several cases have been reported in the outbreak of HFMD at PCF at Sembawang and PCF at Paya Lebar centers.' The PCF added that most of the children have recovered and no new cases have been reported at PCF at Sembawang and PCF at Paya Lebar centers since 26 Apr and 20 Apr [2016], respectively.\n\n'During outbreaks of infectious diseases, our centers would immediately increase the frequency of such precautionary measures and activate additional steps such as suspending large group activities to minimize contact between children, and where necessary, engage professional cleaners to disinfect the premises.'\n\nA spokesperson from Little Skool-House International, which manages Little Skool-House at Kent Vale, said it takes all necessary precautionary measures to detect and prevent the spread of HFMD. 'This includes conducting health checks every morning before a child enters school, and subsequent checks done when needed through the day. There are regular washing and sanitization of classrooms, children's cutlery and toys.' 'Should there be a confirmed case, the class affected will be isolated and communal activities such as morning assembly will cease,' the spokesperson added.

Coxsakievirus A16 (CVA16) and coxsakievirus A6 (CVA6) were predominant in HFMD cases. Moreover, about half of the cases were co-infected with 2 or 3 pathogens.\n\nHFMD usually attacks children under the age of 5, causing mild symptoms including fever, rash, vesiculation [blistering], and inappetence, but some symptoms are extremely severe and are accompanied by several neurological complications such as encephalitis, encephalomeningitis and neurogenic pneumonedema; circulatory disturbance; and can even lead to death.\n\nHuman enteroviruses (new enterovirus, coxsakievirus and echovirus) are the most common pathogenic agents of HFMD. The major and most important causative agents are enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsakievirus A16 (CVA16), since their infections can result in severe consequences, especially EV71, which can result in the most severe consequences. Specimens initially considered to be infected with CVA16 were found to be co-infected with CVA16 and EV71 after inspection.\n\nAlthough HFMD is classically a mild disease, large outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region have been described since 1997, with a high incidence of fatal cardiopulmonary and neurological complications, particularly when the causative virus is EV-71.\n\nThe development of HFMD vaccines has rapidly expanded and pre-clinical studies are already finished and several clinical phases even completed, there are still no available vaccines and effective anti-virus therapies for HFMD.\n\n(Excerpted/edited from Z-C Zhuang, et al., Viruses. 2015 Dec; 7(12): 6400-6411. http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/7/12/2947.) - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/150.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\n'During outbreaks of infectious diseases, our centers would immediately increase the frequency of such precautionary measures and activate additional steps such as suspending large group activities to minimize contact between children, and where necessary, engage professional cleaners to disinfect the premises.' \n\nHFMD usually attacks children under the age of 5, causing mild symptoms including fever, rash, vesiculation [blistering], and inappetence, but some symptoms are extremely severe and are accompanied by several neurological complications such as encephalitis, encephalomeningitis and neurogenic pneumonedema; circulatory disturbance; and can even lead to death.

She has a 1st grader and a kindergartner at the school. She also has a younger child, still in diapers. While she does what she can to keep them safe, keeping them healthy is a bigger challenge. 'I make them jump in the shower as soon as they get home from school. I know they're carrying a lot of germs,' she says. But even those precautions weren't enough to keep her kids from getting hand, foot and mouth disease 3 weeks ago.\n\nMonday [2 May 2016], another parent at Wilson tells Fox26 KMPH News her child was diagnosed. He is a preschooler at the school -- and the 18th child to get sick at 7 different sites across the district.\n\nNumbers were requested from Fresno and Clovis Unified School Districts, but were not received as of the time of our report. 'We started with 2 isolated cases in one classroom a couple of weeks ago,' says Kimberly Salomonson, Sanger Unified's Director of Pupil Services. 'It stayed that way for 10 days.'\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the illness affects mostly children, but can affect adults, too. It's spread through saliva, fluid from blisters or contact with a contaminated surface. It starts with a fever and can develop into sores in the mouth, blisters on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet and even the child's private parts.\n\n[The 1st parent's] youngest still has a scar from the blisters on his toes. 'The middle one started with a fever, then 3 sores in his mouth and then blisters. 3 days later, his brother got it, then days later, the baby,' she says.\n\nFresno Pediatrician Veronica Ramirez says her office has been busy with cases of the disease in recent weeks. 'It seems more prevalent this year than last year, and just seems to keep spreading and spreading.' Ramirez says doctors won't prescribe antibiotics, because this is a virus. 'It needs to run its course. It lasts about 7 days,' she says. 'The treatment is general supportive for fever, sore throat, mouth pain. Controlling those symptoms is important with ibuprofen or tylenol.'\n\nSanger Unified posted a message on its Facebook page warning parents that a number of students got the virus. 'We're telling parents to keep a close eye and see if the kids aren't feeling well, or have developed the blisters,' says Salomonson. 'They can return once the blisters are healed. They have to go to the nurse to get cleared.' Monday [2 May 2016], custodians were applying a 2nd layer of disinfectant in areas commonly used by students.\n\nEveryone agrees, stopping the spread of hand, foot and mouth begins with basic hygiene.

In Europe and North America, it is not a notifiable disease but epidemiological studies of outbreaks caused by different EV-A types (CV-A16, CV-A10 and CV-A6) have been described in recent years. EV-71 also has been detected in several European countries and the USA and, although rare, infections with fatal outcomes have been reported.\n\nHFMD generally is a mild illness that causes sores in or on the mouth and on the hands, feet, and sometimes the buttocks and legs. The sores may be painful. The illness usually doesn't last more than a week or so. The disease is common in children but can also occur in adults. It can occur at any time of year but is most common in the summer and fall.\n\nThe virus spreads easily through coughing and sneezing. It can also spread through infected stool, such as when you change a diaper or when a young child gets stool on his or her hands and then touches objects that other children might then put in their mouths. Often the disease breaks out within a community.\n\nIt usually takes 3 to 6 days for a person to get symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease after being exposed to the virus.\n\n(Partly excerpted/edited from http://www.webmd.com/children/guide/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-topic-overview.) - Mod.LK\n\nA map of California may be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nIt usually takes 3 to 6 days for a person to get symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease after being exposed to the virus. \nCases of a contagious virus are on the rise across the Central Valley [California] -- and schools are taking extra measures to protect students from hand, foot and mouth disease.

The blisters, which can last up to a week and be quite painful, can make doing everyday activities difficult.\n\n'She couldn't walk for a couple days because she had so many blisters on her feet,' says a local mom about her one-year-old daughter.

It's just really hard to see our kid in pain and not really be able to do anything to help them.'\n\nAlthough people of any age can catch it, the virus is especially common among very young populations. 'Eventually, 100 percent of the children will be exposed to the coxsackievirus virus,' says Dr. Rene Bravo of Bravo Pediatrics. However, this does not mean all children will develop symptoms. About 20 percent of those exposed to the virus will catch it.\n\nDr. Bravo recommends that children who catch the virus be taken out of school or daycare to prevent the spread of the disease. 'Wait until the blisters heal and no new one shows up, and then you are welcome to come back to daycare,' says owner of Little Blossoms Daycare and Preschool.\n\nAlthough there is no immediate cure, at-home treatments can be used to make the affected person more comfortable. According to Dr. Bravo, over-the-counter medicines like Tylenol and Advil can help with pain, while calamine lotion can help calm the skin.

Preventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures have been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD.\n\nA diagnosis usually can be made by the presenting signs and symptoms alone. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture.\n\nMedications are usually not needed as hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral disease that typically gets better on its own.

The airborne virus is highly contagious and causes those affected to develop blisters on their hands, feet, and mouths. These lesions can be accompanied by a fever, sore throat, and severe discomfort. The blisters, which can last up to a week and be quite painful, can make doing everyday activities difficult.\n\n'She couldn't walk for a couple days because she had so many blisters on her feet,' says a local mom about her one-year-old daughter. 'So she was in the stroller or in our arms, which was really hard. It's just really hard to see our kid in pain and not really be able to do anything to help them.'\n\nAlthough people of any age can catch it, the virus is especially common among very young populations. 'Eventually, 100 percent of the children will be exposed to the coxsackievirus virus,' says Dr. Rene Bravo of Bravo Pediatrics. However, this does not mean all children will develop symptoms. About 20 percent of those exposed to the virus will catch it.\n\nDr. Bravo recommends that children who catch the virus be taken out of school or daycare to prevent the spread of the disease. 'Wait until the blisters heal and no new one shows up, and then you are welcome to come back to daycare,' says owner of Little Blossoms Daycare and Preschool.\n\nAlthough there is no immediate cure, at-home treatments can be used to make the affected person more comfortable. According to Dr. Bravo, over-the-counter medicines like Tylenol and Advil can help with pain, while calamine lotion can help calm the skin. If you suspect that your child has hand, foot and mouth disease, take a picture on your phone and email it to your pediatrician to save yourself a trip into the doctor's office.\n\n[Byline: Amanda Starrantino]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common human syndrome caused by highly contagious intestinal viruses. HFMD is often confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also called hoof-and-mouth disease), which affects cattle, sheep, and swine. However, the 2 diseases are caused by different viruses and are not related. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by an enterovirus, most commonly coxsackievirus A16. However, other enteroviruses like coxsackievirus A10 or A6 have also been detected in outbreaks. Internationally, enterovirus 71 is another common etiologic agent.\n\nHFMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by nasopharyngeal secretions such as saliva or nasal mucus, by direct contact, or by fecal-oral transmission. Preventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures have been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD.\n\nA diagnosis usually can be made by the presenting signs and symptoms alone. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture.\n\nMedications are usually not needed as hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral disease that typically gets better on its own.

Infection in older children, adolescents, and adults is typically mild and lasts approximately one week but may occasionally run a longer course. Fever reducers and lukewarm baths can help decrease body temperature.\n\nA minority of individuals with hand, foot and mouth disease may require hospital admission due to uncommon neurologic complications such as inflammation of the brain, inflammation of the meninges, or acute flaccid paralysis.

However, older children and adults can also get it. HFMD typically presents with a prodrome of non-specific symptoms that last 1-2 days, followed by a rash that lasts 7 to 10 days. The exanthem is usually a macular, maculopapular, or vesicular rash on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The enanthem is similar in the mouth.\n\nThe disease may be complicated by meningitis, encephalitis, flaccid paralysis, or myopericarditis. The diagnosis is made clinically, but PCR can be performed on samples from the throat, stool, urine, and vesicular fluid. Treatment is supportive.\n\nIn January 2016, China approved Sinovac's vaccine for HFMD. No vaccine existed before December 2015. But in December 2015, the China FDA approved the 1st vaccine against the virus, Enterovirus 71 (EV71), made by the Institute of Medical Biology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. But competition was not far behind: the agency approved a 2nd vaccine against the virus in January 2016, this one developed by Sinovac ($SVA).\n\nHaving 2 vaccines against HFMD made locally is a boon for China's public health and local manufacturing sectors. While other countries in Asia have reported cases and outbreaks of HFMD, China reported far more cases in 2014 than its neighbors did: 2.7 million cases and 394 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. In contrast, Japan reported 79 000 cases and no deaths, and Singapore reported 21 400 cases and no deaths.\n\n'EV71 vaccine is the 1st innovative vaccine product successfully developed and commercialized by Sinovac,' said Weidong Yin, Sinovac CEO and president, in a statement. 'We envision opportunities to collaborate with relevant government authorities to further test the safety and immunogenicity of the EV71 vaccine in order to provide scientific evidence of using this vaccine on a broader population.'\n\nSinovac will manufacture the EV71 vaccine at a facility in Beijing, which is expected to produce 20 million doses annually.\n\nThe vaccine is a 2-dose regimen for infants aged between 6 months and 3 years. The company expects to receive its Good Manufacturing Practices license in early 2016, after which it will immediately commence production of the EV71 vaccine, Sinovac said in the statement. It expects to have the jab on the market 4-5 months later.\n\nThe company plans to go through the private pay sector of the Chinese vaccine market, where it has experience selling hepatitis and flu vaccines. This strategy allows Sinovac to leverage its existing sales networks to quickly boost sales of the EV71 vaccine.

He has presented with fever, sore throat, headache, neck stiffness and rash since 7 Nov 2015. He was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on 14 Nov 2015 and was admitted on the same day for further management. The clinical diagnosis was meningitis and he has been in a stable condition all along. His stool specimen tested positive for EV71 upon testing by the Centre for Health Protection's (CHP) Public Health Laboratory Services Branch. Initial investigation revealed that the patient had no recent travel history. His home contacts remain asymptomatic.\n\nA CHP spokesman noted that there was a HFMD [hand foot mouth disease] outbreak in the secondary school in Eastern District, which the patient attended as a form-2 student. Apart from the patient, 12 form-2 students, comprising 9 boys and 3 girls aged 13 to 14, have developed fever, oral ulcers, rash and vesicles on their hands or feet since 10 Nov 2015. All affected pupils sought medical treatment and no hospitalisation is required. They are now in a stable condition. Officers of the CHP have conducted a site visit and advised the staff of the school on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The school has been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.\n\n'EV71 is among the causative agents for HFMD. The infection is transmitted from person to person by direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons. Good personal and environmental hygiene are the most important measures to prevent EV71 infection,' a spokesman for the CHP said. This is the 56th laboratory-confirmed EV71 case in Hong Kong in 2015 and the 6th case classified as severe.\n\nAs of 7 Nov 2015, a total of 736 hospital admissions of HFMD have been reported in 2015, higher than the same reporting period in 2014 (n=327).\n\nHFMD is typically a benign and self-limiting disease. Most common in young children, it presents as fever, oral lesions and rash on the hands, feet and buttocks. The oral lesions consist of rapidly ulcerating vesicles on the buccal mucosa, tongue, palate and gums. The rash consists of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, fingers and soles, which generally persist for 7-10 days, and maculopapular lesions on the buttocks.\n\nHFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the Enterovirus genus (group). This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.\n\nCoxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Enterovirus 71 has also been associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease and outbreaks of this disease. EV-71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in Southeast Asia over the several years. EV 71 is a non-polio enterovirus.\n\nComplications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage and myocarditis. Most deaths in HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.

This individual also described possible HFMD in his child, and in other children in the resort.\n\nWe wonder whether the broader ProMED community is aware of an ongoing HFMD outbreak in Caribbean resort areas. We believe that it would be important to identify such an outbreak, both because HFMD-linked viruses can cause more severe illness (such as encephalitis) and also because (as described below), the oral lesions that have been described with Zika virus infection may make this an important differential diagnosis.\n\nCase report\n-----------\nA 45-year-old man vacationed with his wife and 2-year-old daughter at a resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, from 22 Jan-1 Feb 2016. On 27 Jan 2016, he and his wife noticed that their daughter had developed a 'heat rash' described as red spots on her hands, feet, and back. Notably, they reported that there were at least 2 other children at the resort with a similar rash.\n\nOn 28 Jan 2016, the man began to feel unwell, describing fever, nausea, headache, sore throat, and myalgia as his main symptoms. On 30 Jan 2016, he developed a rash, which appeared similar to his daughter's rash, on his hands, feet, buttocks, and in his mouth. His description suggests that the rash initially was comprised of erythematous papules and vesicles. Over the following days, the rash evolved and appeared as erythematous macules and patches, which appeared petechial [pinpoint red or purple spots] and purpuric [brownish-red spots].\n\nOn 2 Feb 2016, he presented to an outpatient clinic in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On the basis of his clinical course, similar illness in children, and the appearance and progression of the rash he received a clinical diagnosis of HFMD. Serological evaluations, including antibody testing for chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses, were negative. Syphilis serology was negative. Stool PCR for enteroviruses was negative. The infectious disease consult service recommended that urine and pharyngeal specimens also be sent for viral studies, but this unfortunately was not done. In a follow up telephone discussion with a treating physician (24 Feb 2016) this individual indicated that he was recovering and his rash was resolving but stated that he was 'losing a layer or 2 of skin on [his] feet.'\n\nComment\n-------\nWhile virological confirmation is lacking in this case, the clinical features and course of this illness are most consistent with HFMD. HFMD is most commonly observed in children under the age of 5, but there are several case studies and case series on this disease in adults. It is caused by enteroviruses, most commonly coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus A71. It is transmitted through the fecal-oral route or by contact with fluid from the throat or vesicles. Its incubation period is usually 3 to 5 days. The virus is shed in the stool for 4 to 8 weeks [1].\n\nThe disease may cause outbreaks; the 1st description of a HFMD outbreak was made in 1958, by investigators in Toronto, Canada [2].\n\nHFMD typically presents with a prodrome [early symptoms and signs indicating the onset of a disease] of non-specific symptoms that last 1 to 2 days, followed by a rash that lasts 7 to 10 days. The exanthem is usually a macular, maculopapular, or vesicular rash on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The enanthem is similar in the mouth.\n\nThe disease may be complicated by meningitis, encephalitis, flaccid paralysis, or myopericarditis. The diagnosis is made clinically, but PCR can be performed on samples from the throat, stool, urine, and vesicular fluid. Treatment is supportive [1].\n\nAn epidemiological study of HFMD found no differences in either clinical presentation or enterovirus type between adults and children [3]. There have been 2 recent published HFMD case series about HFMD in adults caused by a less commonly isolated enterovirus, coxsackievirus A6 [4,5]. Some of the patients described in these case series presented similarly to the present case. Namely, their rashes appeared petechial and purpuric, with desquamation in affected areas about one month after rash onset.\n\nThese case series suggested that the incidence of coxsackievirus A6 as a cause of HFMD is increasing in the adults, and that adults infected with coxsackievirus A6 may have atypical rash. The occurrence of HFMD in this individual with subsequent desquamation may suggest infection with coxsackievirus A6.\n\nThe oral lesions observed in this instance were typical of HFMD. However, given the recent emergence of Zika virus in the Western Hemisphere, it is important to note that news reports described Zika virus presented as a febrile illness with rash and oral lesions during a recent outbreak in French Polynesia [6]. While this individual's serological evaluation was negative, the short time interval (5 days) between onset of symptoms and serological testing likely decreased the sensitivity of serological diagnosis.\n\n[We thank Dr John Brownstein of http://healthmap.org for useful discussions regarding oral lesions in Zika virus infection.]\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

It is caused by a group of viruses called enteroviruses, including certain coxsackie viruses (most commonly A16 in the United States) and enterovirus 71, which has been occasionally associated with severe disease, such as encephalitis.\n\nThe risk of infection depends on destination and time of year: in temperate climates, travellers are most at risk during the summer and autumn months. In tropical climates, the risk of infection is year-round.\n\nHand-foot-mouth disease is spread by coming into contact with secretions (fluids) from the nose and throat, saliva, fluid from blisters or stool (feces) of an infected person. It is spread through close personal contact (kissing or hugging), coughing, and sneezing or from touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus.\n\nThe symptoms can take 3 to 7 days to appear. Symptoms usually include fever, loss of appetite, sore throat, generally feeling unwell, painful blister-like sores in the mouth, and a rash with or without small blisters, usually on the palms of the hands or on fingers, soles of the feet or on toes, and may also appear on the knees, elbows, buttocks, or genital area. The disease is usually mild and most people recover in 7 to 10 days. Rare complications can include encephalitis and meningitis, which may lead to death.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for hand-foot-mouth disease; there is no vaccine or medication that is protective. Symptoms can be treated with medications that provide relief for the pain of mouth sores, fever, and aches.

Dr A Parthasarathi, specialist paediatrician and neonatologist at the Badr Al Samaa Hospital, said the virus is spreading in Oman. 'We are currently seeing around 10 to 12 cases in our outpatient department every day,' he revealed.\n\nDr Santosh Ramaswamy, paediatrician at the Atlas Medical Hospital, said the disease is characterised by a mild fever, painful sores in the mouth and rashes with blisters on hands and feet. 'It comes in specific areas where sores may be painful,' he stated. Ramaswamy also said the virus is easily spread through coughing and sneezing, and often the disease breaks out within a community. 'Initially, your child may feel tired, get a sore throat, or have a mild fever. Then, sores or blisters may appear in the mouth, feet, and sometimes the buttocks,' doctors said.\n\nSince most HFMD symptoms resemble those of chickenpox, another contagious viral infection, many parents can be easily misled, warned experts. 'Although this disease runs its course without requiring any treatment, it is important for parents to still visit a paediatrician,' doctors said.\n\nIn case of chickenpox, children develop rashes, mainly on the body near the abdomen areas and head. 'The blisters look different from those in the case of HFMD,' Ramaswamy said. Though hand-foot-and-mouth disease is common among children, it can also occur in adults during periods when the weather is changing.\n\nCases of chicken pox and scarlet fever have also been reported in various parts of the country. 'The infections and fever are common, as winter is setting in. The number of people taking to bed will keep increasing whenever there is a gap between maximum and minimum temperatures,' doctors said. 'The best thing to do this season is to practice good hygiene and wash hands regularly, as a good hand wash will kill the virus,' they added.\n\nThe Indian School Jaalan Bani Bu Ali had to recently declare a 10-day holiday for 1 class after more than 15 students in 1 particular grade had contracted chicken pox.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following has been mostly extracted from the comments of moderator Craig Pringle in prior ProMED-mail posts on this subject:\n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is caused by a group of RNA viruses called enteroviruses that includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses can also cause the illness. Only rarely is the precise agent identified because the outcome of infection is generally benign. However, enterovirus 71 has been associated with more severe disease, such as encephalitis.\n\nHFMD is characterized by fever, malaise, painful sores in the mouth and a rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, as well as a rash around the mouth, over the knees, and on the buttocks or genital area. Pictures of the oral and skin lesions can be found at http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2013;volume=79;issue=2;spage=165;epage=175;aulast=Sarma. Temporary fingernail and toenail loss, called onychomadesis, have been reported, occurring mostly in children within a few weeks after having HFMD.\n\nHFMD is commonly spread via the fecal-oral route, blister fluid, and respiratory secretions. Generally, a person with HFMD is most contagious during the 1st week of illness. People can sometimes be contagious for days or weeks after symptoms go away. Some people, especially adults, may not develop any symptoms, but they can still spread the virus to others. This is why susceptible individuals should always try to maintain good hygiene to reduce exposure to any of the enteroviruses associated with HFMD. HFMD is not transmitted to or from pets or other animals. There is no specific vector.\n\nRegarding grading of HFMD, from the Academia website:\n'Grade 1 is uncomplicated fever along with rash on the hands, feet and mouth; grade 2 shows twitching in the \ufb01ngers indicating nervous system af\ufb02iction. In Grade 3 disease manifests with more serious symptoms: persistent fever, lethargy, irritability, limb weakness, meningism, and seizure. Grade 4 is the most serious level of disease, presenting with cardiorespiratory compromise. Grading is useful for deciding treatment options: child presenting with grade 2 should be hospitalized and carefully observed for further progression. At grade 3 and 4, the child's life is seriously at risk, and intensive care becomes a necessity.'

It is not clear how many schools are affected, but a source reported that it could be up to 6, and at least one of them is a government school. The TCI Hospitals, when contacted, confirmed that they have been dealing with HFMD patients but declined to divulge the numbers, telling us instead to obtain such records from the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health said: 'A few suspected cases have recently been reported from health care facilities in Providenciales.'\n\nThe Ministry of Health, Agriculture and Human Services (MOHAHS) issued a press statement on the disease informing the public that it is in the process of collecting specimens to dispatch to the Caribbean Public Health Agency to confirm that the ailment is in fact HFMD. The ministry further noted that it has embarked on an enhanced surveillance and education campaign to ensure that suspected cases are identified as quickly as possible and schools and daycare facilities are educated on proper implementation of prevention and hygiene measures. HFMD is a contagious viral illness that primarily affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. It is transmitted by direct contact with nasal secretions, (droplets produced by coughing or sneezing), saliva, fluid from blisters and stool of infected individuals. HFMD is most prevalent in childcare settings due to frequent contact with soiled diapers and children putting their hands in their mouths.\n\nHFMD occasionally occurs in adolescents and adults. Symptoms include some or all of the following: painful sores in the mouth, rashes on the hands and feet, which may be associated with blisters, fever, headache, feeling generally unwell or irritable, runny nose, and/or sore throat. It is mostly a mild and self-limiting illness lasting for a few days. However, there are more severe, albeit uncommon, forms of the disease which are associated with neurological complications as a result of meningitis (associated with fever, headache, and neck stiffness) and encephalitis (resulting in paralysis).\n\nPeople can sometimes be contagious for days or weeks after the symptoms have ended. There is no specific treatment for hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Symptom control, such as the use of paracetamol (Panadol or Tylenol) for fever and pain relief, is often all that is necessary. In some cases, HFMD can cause a sore mouth and throat, which makes it difficult to swallow. It is, therefore, important to maintain adequate fluid intake to avoid dehydration that could result in hospitalization. Symptoms usually resolve within 10 days. Persons with suspected HFMD should abstain from school and report to a healthcare provider to obtain guidance, including when to return to work, school or daycare. The MOHAHS will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as appropriate, the Ministry of Health said.\n\nMedical practitioners advise that if your child's fever remains elevated despite appropriate fever-reducing drugs, or if he or she develops any signs or symptoms of dehydration (dry skin and mucous membranes, weight loss, persistent irritability, lethargy, or decreased urine output), you should seek immediate medical attention. When concerned or in doubt, contact your child's health care provider.\n\nThe method of control is to:\n* Limit person-to-person contact such as hugging, kissing or sharing utensils.\n* Promote good hygiene practices such as hand washing with soap and water; covering nose and mouth when sneezing.\n* Appropriate infection control practices are recommended to prevent the spread of hand, foot and mouth disease. These include immediately separating suspected cases of HFMD from the general school population and sending them home and frequent disinfection of schools in order to prevent the spread of this disease. It is recommended that schools should clean all areas and items that are more likely to have frequent hand contact (for example, taps, toys, keyboards, door handles, or desks) at least twice a day and also clean these areas immediately when visibly handled by ill persons. It is also recommended to wash items with soap and water and then to disinfect them with a 5 percent bleach solution (which is commonly sold commercially) diluted one part bleach to 10 parts water.\n\nThe Ministry of Health, Agriculture and Human Services (MOHAHS) of the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) wishes to inform the public that there have been media reports of an ongoing outbreak of HFMD in Singapore and Japan and recent reports of cases in neighboring Caribbean countries. The Turks and Caicos Islands is the latest country that has experienced an outbreak of the disease. Jamaica's schools are said to have been grappling with the ailment, forcing that country's ministry of health to close down a number of school and initiate an extensive sanitizing exercise. Parents with children attending schools in the TCI have reported getting information from schools regarding the disease and how to diminish the chances of their children contracting it.\n\nHand foot and mouth disease is a common childhood illness caused by different enteroviruses such as a Coxsackie virus. It is said that the illness most often occurs between March and June and between September and December, but it can occur at any time. It is most frequently seen in young children, infants and toddlers. Hand foot and mouth disease is characterised by fever and a blister-like rash affecting the palms of the hands and soles of the feet along with blisters inside the mouth. Research shows that children usually become infected with the virus from other children through hugging, kissing or contact with stool. It typically occurs in small epidemics in nursery schools or kindergartens.\n\nIt is not the same as other diseases that have similar names: foot-and-mouth disease (sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease) or mad cow disease. These diseases almost always occur in animals. The virus spreads easily through coughing and sneezing. It can also spread through infected stool, such as when you change a diaper or when a young child gets stool on his or her hands and then touches objects that other children put in their mouths. Often the disease breaks out within a community. It usually takes 3 to 6 days for a person to get symptoms of hand-foot-and-mouth disease after being exposed to the virus. This is called the incubation period.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This account of enterovirus infection resulting in HFMD is not precise about the species of virus that was involved.

Dr Truong Huu Khanh, head of HCM [Ho Chi Minh] City Paediatrics Hospitals No 1's Neurology and Infectious Diseases ward, said that parents should learn the signs of the disease and take their children to the hospital for treatment early. 'Parents easily understand the disease when the symptoms are a sore throat or a fever,' he said.\n\nOn 15 Sep 2015, nearly 56 children who had contracted HFMD were admitted to the ward. The doctor said common signs include fever, reduced appetite, sore throat and rash on hands, feet and diaper area. 'A serious case being treated at the ward is a 15-month-old baby from District 11, HCM City. The baby was taken to hospital 3 days ago when she was diagnosed at grade 3, with high fever, and rash on the mouth. Now she can breastfeed.' Khanh said.\n\nHand-foot-mouth disease is a common viral illness among children under the age of 3 years, especially those between 6 months and 12 months, who contract the disease easily and their condition deteriorates rapidly. The disease peaks during 2 periods, from March to May, and from September to November, he said. 'It is very important that everyone wash their hands with soap and water, and clean and disinfect toys and floors frequently as the disease is transmitted via the digestive system,' he added.\n\nHCM City Paediatrics Hospitals No 1 reported that the number of patients with HFMD increased rapidly over the last month [mid-Aug to mid-Sept 2015]. There were 126 cases in July, 242 cases in August, and 131 cases during the 1st 9 days of September.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Regarding grading of HFMD, from the Academia website:\n'Grade 1 is uncomplicated fever along with rash on the hands, feet and mouth; grade 2 shows twitching in the \ufb01ngers indicating nervous system af\ufb02iction. In Grade 3 disease manifests with more serious symptoms: persistent fever, lethargy, irritability, limb weakness, meningism, and seizure. Grade 4 is the most serious level of disease, presenting with cardiorespiratory compromise. Grading is useful for deciding treatment options: child presenting with grade 2 should be hospitalized and carefully observed for further progression. At grade 3 and 4, the child's life is seriously at risk, and intensive care becomes a necessity.'

The Police College, next to Ocean Park, has undergone a massive clean-up and tightened hygiene measures since the 14 Aug 2015 outbreak while the Centre for Health Protection investigates the source of the virus.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease has been rife in 2015, the centre warned, with 237 institutional outbreaks reported by 20 Aug. 7 cases, all of them children, were severe but none proved fatal. There were 346 cases of institutional outbreaks in 2014 compared with 779 in 2013.\n\n'Several classes of recruits whose colleagues have been infected are now receiving training separately in an effort to prevent the spread of the disease,' a police source familiar with the outbreak said. 'The college's facilities are being cleaned and disinfected 3 or 4 times a day.' He said no new cases had been reported on Wednesday or Thursday [26-27 Aug].\n\nNone of the 21 patients -- all male constables aged 18 to 30 -- required hospital care. All have been in stable condition since contracting the disease. They were given sick leave by doctors and stayed at home to recover. Half of them have now returned to the college.\n\nIt is understood the decision to close the pool and gymnasium was made by police themselves. The source said the force did not receive any advice from the Department of Health to shut down the training school or any of its facilities. There are about 600 recruits receiving training at the college.\n\nPolice alerted the department on 17 Aug 2015 after the 1st few cases emerged. Department officers visited the premises and provided health advice.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is usually caused by enteroviruses and is common among children. It usually begins with a fever, poor appetite, tiredness and a sore throat. The usual peak season is from early summer to autumn; a smaller peak may also occur in winter. In children, the infection is more likely to be associated with severe medical complications and even death. But to most adults, the disease is mostly self-limiting and is resolved in 7-10 days.\n\nIt spreads mainly by contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from vesicles or patients' stool, or contaminated objects, according to the centre. The centre advises that play facilities hit with the disease should be properly disinfected and should maintain good indoor ventilation. Notices should be posted at the entrance to advise people with infectious diseases not to enter.\n\n[Byline: Clifford Lo and Emily Tsang]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[From the UK's National Health Service 'Choices' website (http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx):\n\n'Hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral infection that can affect young children. It doesn't usually pose a serious threat to a child's health, but it can be be an unpleasant condition, particularly if it affects younger children.\n\nTypical symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease include:\n----------------------------------------------------\nCold-like symptoms, such as loss of appetite, cough and a moderately high temperature of around 38-39\u00b0C (100.4-102.2\u00b0F) a non-itchy red rash, made up of spots or small fluid-filled sacs (vesicles), which usually develops on the hands and feet, but may also occur on the knees, elbows, groin and buttocks; sometimes the rash can develop into painful blisters.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is a self-limiting condition, which means it will get better on its own without treatment. The symptoms will usually pass within seven days. However, speak to your GP or call NHS 111 if you're unsure whether your child has hand, foot and mouth disease. You should also contact your GP if your child isn't drinking any fluid or their symptoms last longer than seven days.\n\nTreating hand, foot and mouth disease.\n---------------------------------------------\nThere is currently no cure for hand, foot and mouth disease, so treatment involves making your child feel as comfortable as possible while waiting for the infection to take its course. Possible treatment options include: using paracetamol, ibuprofen and mouth gels to relieve the pain of mouth ulcer drinking plenty of fluids to help relieve a high temperature.\n\nEtiology\n---------\nHand, foot and mouth disease is caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses. The most common types of viruses that can cause the condition are:\n\nCoxsackievirus A16, A6 or A10\nEnteroviruses 71\nEnterovirus 71 carries a higher risk of causing serious complications.\n\nHow the infection spreads:\n-----------------\nA person with hand, foot and mouth disease is highly contagious until about a week after the symptoms begin. The infection can be spread if: (1) contaminated droplets are transferred from an infected person - for example, if an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets can be inhaled by another person or can contaminate surfaces, leading to the spread of infection; (2) fecal matter (stool) is transferred from an infected person - for example, if an infected person doesn't wash their hands properly after going to the toilet and then contaminates food or surfaces (the viruses can live for up to four weeks in a person's stools); or (3) you come into contact with the fluids of an infected person's blisters or saliva.\n\nBecause of the way the infection is spread, outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease can occur in places where groups of children need to have their nappies changed or use a potty, such as nurseries or childcare centres. You should keep your child away from school or nursery while they are unwell. However, there's no need to wait until the last blister has gone before your child can return to school or nursery, providing they are otherwise well. However, some schools and nurseries may reserve the right to refuse to take your child until the condition has cleared up completely.\n\nIt is rare, but possible, to get hand, foot and mouth disease more than once, although not during the same outbreak. As they get older, most children will develop immunity to the viruses that cause the condition.\n\nComplications\n----------\nIt's important to make sure that anyone with hand, foot and mouth disease keeps drinking fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. Dehydration can often occur because the mouth ulcers can make drinking fluids painful.\n\nLife-threatening complications such as brain infections (encephalitis) have been reported during epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease caused by the enterovirus 71. However, these complications are very rare and they have been limited to the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nAdults with hand, foot and mouth disease\n--------------------------\nAlthough hand, foot and mouth disease mainly affects children aged 10 or younger, adults can be affected. Adults with the condition are also contagious and should stay away from the workplace until it has completely cleared up.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease gets better on its own without treatment and complications are rare in adults. However, the symptoms can cause severe discomfort.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is not the same as foot and mouth disease, which affects cattle, sheep and pigs. The two infections are unrelated, and you cannot catch hand, foot and mouth disease from animals.'\n\n\nLife-threatening complications such as brain infections (encephalitis) have been reported during epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease caused by the enterovirus 71.

Some people, particularly young children, may have severe disease requiring hospitalization or even causing death. Travelers to these countries can protect themselves by practicing personal hygiene tips. Below is a typical alert, posted originally in ProMED-MBDS. - Mod.CP]\n\nDate: Tue 25 Aug 2015\nSource: The Visayan Daily Star [edited]\nhttp://www.visayandailystar.com/2015/August/25/med101.htm\n\n\nBacolod City [capital of Negros Occidental province] in the past few weeks has reported an increasing number of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) cases in both children and adults.\n\nEarlier this year [2015], the Department of Health reported that there was a 175.7 percent increase of HFMD cases compared to last year [2014]. The census showed that 23.7 percent of cases came from Cagayan Valley, followed by 20.1 percent from Calabarzon, then 15.5 percent from Northern Mindanao, 9.6 percent from Metro Manila, and 5.4 percent from Mimaropa.\n\nWhat is HFMD? It is an infectious viral infection that is caused by enteroviruses, usually by coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) and other picornaviruses. Children 1-4 years old are at higher risk of getting the disease, but even older children and adults can be infected.\n\nSymptoms begin with a high grade fever followed by non-specific symptoms of flu, such as malaise, sore throat, and decreased appetite. After one to 2 days, painful sores may start to appear in the mouth. This may be followed by the onset of a non-itchy flat red rash on the palms and soles which may lead to blister formation. These may also appear on the elbows, knees, and buttocks. In some cases, the symptoms are atypical, which makes diagnosis difficult. What is worse is that some people may be asymptomatic and yet may transmit the disease to others.\n\nThe culprit virus is found in throat and nose secretions, blister fluid of the skin rash, and even in the feces. Thus, it can easily be spread through the air by sneezing or coughing, by personal contact, contact with feces, and contact with objects that are contaminated by the virus, such as doorknobs, tables, and other surfaces.\n\nA person is considered highly contagious during the 1st week of illness. However, others may remain contagious for days or even weeks after the symptoms are gone.\n\nThere is no vaccine against HFMD. Prevention entails healthy, clean practices such as adequate hand washing with soap and water, especially after changing diapers or using the toilet; avoiding close contact (such as hugging, kissing, or sharing utensils) with an HFMD-infected person, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently-touched surfaces, such as doorknobs, tables, chairs, and even children's toys.\n\nAs with most viral infections, HFMD has no known cure.

The NIID is calling for vigilance, as the epidemic is likely to continue until around September [2015].\n\nReports from about 3000 pediatric institutions across the country show there were an average of 10.26 HFMD patients per medical institution from 27 Jul to 2 Aug [2015]. This is the 2nd most in history, following the record of 10.98 patients per institution from 11-17 Jul 2011, according to the institute.\n\nBy prefecture, Miyazaki saw the highest number of HFMD patients per medical institution at 19.61, followed by 19.56 in Niigata, 18.73 in Miyagi and 18.67 in Yamagata. Most of the prefectures that had more patients than the national average were in the Kanto, Hokuriku and Tohoku regions, but Osaka Prefecture also had more at 11.26.\n\nHFMD is caused by several types of viruses. The predominant virus this year [2015] is less likely to cause serious symptoms, but a virus that became more prevalent from July [2015] causes a rash in other areas as well as the hands and feet, according to the NIID.\n\nTsuguto Fujimoto, general manager of the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, urged everyone to take preventative measures against the disease until around autumn [2015]. 'Wash your hands frequently with running water and soap,' he said. 'And don't touch any feces when you're changing diapers.'\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an infectious disease caused by enteroviruses. The viruses are transmitted to humans through airborne droplets produced by coughing or sneezing and from feces through mucous membranes in the nose and mouth. There is no effective cure or vaccine. Most symptoms naturally subside in a few days, though meningitis and brain fever can result.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is caused by different types of viruses called enteroviruses, and the most common ones are coxsackie virus types A16, A5, A9, A10, B1, and B3, human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), and herpes simplex viruses (HSV). The virus is spread from person to person through direct contact with nose and throat discharges, blister fluid, and faeces. Therefore, coughing and sneezing can spread the virus from the infected person to healthy persons. When the virus enters the body, it multiplies at the contact site such as in the throat, surrounding lymphatic nodes, stomach, and intestines. Then it gets into the blood and flows to other parts of the body such as mouth and the skin.\n\nHFMD is a common worldwide disease that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old and is more widespread in summer and early spring. In tropical countries, it can be widespread in any season.\n\nSymptoms of the disease start to show after an incubation period of 3 to 7 days and include low-grade fever, loss of appetite, stomachache, and pain in the mouth. Soon, blisters develop in the mouth and on the skin, commonly at the hands and feet, and sometimes at buttocks. The typical blisters are yellow with bright red borders. They usually appear in the mouth such as on the tongue, palate, velum, tonsils, or gums. Skin rashes also develop at the back of the hands and feet or the palms. They might or might not be itchy. These rashes start of as red rashes and quickly develop into raised red spots, some with blisters. Usually, the rashes will go away within a week.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for HFMD. The treatment available is just for symptom relief. Medication is prescribed according to the symptoms, such as fever, and oral anesthetic to help relieve the pain of mouth sores. It is very important to keep infected children hydrated. You can assess the hydration status by checking the pulse, skin elasticity, mouth and eye hydration, tears when they cry, and urination frequency.\n\nAccording to the WHO (WPA): As of 2 Aug [2015], there were 216 971 cases of HFMD reported in Japan for 2015 since 12 Mar 2015 (week 11), [http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd-biweekly-20150811.pdf?ua=1].\n\nWeekly case numbers of HFMD have surpassed the numbers seen in the previous year [2014].

Most common in young children, it presents as fever, oral lesions, and rash on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The oral lesions consist of rapidly-ulcerating vesicles on the buccal mucosa, tongue, palate, and gums. The rash consists of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, fingers and soles, which generally persist for 7 to 10 days, and maculopapular lesions on the buttocks.\n\nHand-foot-mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the _Enterovirus_ genus (group). This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.\n\nCoxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of hand-foot-mouth disease in the USA, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness.\n\nEnterovirus 71 [EV-71] has also been associated with hand-foot-mouth disease and outbreaks of this disease. EV-71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in Southeast Asia over several years. EV-71 is a non-polio enterovirus.

Hand, foot and mouth disease is not on the Ontario Reportable Disease list, so there's no way to know how many cases are in Sudbury, said Lisa Schell, the manager of clinical and family services with the health unit. Schell said the health unit has been receiving calls from concerned parents.\n\n'We do know that there are some children who have been diagnosed in our community,' she said. Once we know that there are children in the community with hand, foot and mouth disease, there's certainly probably others who are ill with it as well.'\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is a virus-transmitted disease. Symptoms include a fever, poor appetite, lack of energy, discomfort, sore throat, headache, small painful mouth sores and a skin rash that looks like red spots, often with blisters on top. That rash usually appears on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, but can show up on other areas of the body, Schell said.\n\nThere is no specific treatment. There is no blood test to confirm [the diagnosis], but Schell suggested a visit to a health care provider if a child is showing symptoms. 'The diagnosis of hand, foot and mouth disease is based on the appearance of the rash,' she said. 'With hand, foot and mouth disease, we basically have to let it run its course. There's no specific treatment for the illness.'\n\nChildren do not need to be excluded [from school] if they are diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease, Schell said. 'If the child is unwell, let them lay low and treat them with bed rest and lots of fluids,' she said.

They have developed fever, oral ulcers and rash on their hands or feet since 14 June 2014. All of those affected sought medical attention, while 3 children were admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital for management, and 2 of them have been discharged. They are all currently in stable condition.\n\nThe rectal swab of an affected child tested positive for enterovirus (EV) upon laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch. Officers of the CHP have conducted a site visit and advised the staff of the residential child care centre on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The centre has been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.\n\n'HFMD is common in children and is usually caused by EVs such as Coxsackie virus and EV71. It is clinically characterised by maculopapular rash or vesicular lesions occurring on the palms, soles and other parts of the body such as the buttocks and thighs. Vesicular lesions and ulcers may also be found in the oral cavity. Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet,' a spokesman for the CHP explained.\n\nTo prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures:\n* Maintain good air circulation;\n* Wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials;\n* Keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;\n* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly;\n* Clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding 1 part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water;\n* Children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted;\n* Avoid going to overcrowded places; and\n* Parents should maintain close communication with schools to let them know the latest situation of the sick children.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The WHO Surveillance Summary includes information from countries where transmission of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) occurs and case counts are routinely reported.\n\nNorthern Hemisphere/ China: As of 31 May, there were reported 630 391 cases of HFMD, including 26 deaths in China for 2015. From 1 to 31 May 2015, 304 863 cases of HFMD had been reported, a 42 percent decrease compared with the same period in 2014 (528 777). The number of HFMD cases reported monthly in 2015 is following the seasonal pattern displayed in 2012, 2013 and 2014 (Figure 1). It is likely that the figures for Hong Kong (SARI) follow the same seasonal pattern as elsewhere in China http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd_biweekly_20150616.pdf?ua=1.\n\nHFMD usually begins with a low-grade fever and general fatigue. A rash of tiny, painful red spots will appear within a couple of days and will soon begin to blister and sometimes form ulcers. These spots may appear:\n- inside the mouth (on the tongue, gums, or cheeks)\n- on the palms of the hands or on the fingers\n- on the soles of the feet or on the toes\n- on the buttocks\n\nThe rash is not generally itchy and, in some cases, may develop on other parts of the body. Lymph nodes in the neck may also become swollen. The virus can cause the throat to feel sore and painful. Rarely, dehydration may occur as the pain due to the blisters in the mouth can make drinking difficult. Infection by EV71 has been known to cause encephalitis or viral meningitis in rare cases.\n\nChildren and adolescents are the most commonly affected people. Adults are rarely infected, although pregnant women who have not been exposed to the virus before have a higher chance of becoming infected. Daycare centres, parks, nursery schools, and other places where children play with each other are potential sites for the infection to be transmitted among children. HFMD is most common in the summer and early fall.\n\nA pregnant woman who is infected may show mild or no signs of illness. If she is infected just before her delivery, the infection can be transmitted to the newborn, resulting in only a mild illness in the baby. Rarely, multiple-organ infections occur.\n\nDuring the acute phase, a person can infect others through secretions from the nose and throat. Discharge due to coughing and sneezing can cause the virus to be transmitted easily. Young children, who tend to drool, can also transmit the infection through their saliva.\n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease affects mainly children 5 years old and under, is caused by different types of enterovirus and in most forms is normally not severe. However, 1 type of hand, foot, and mouth disease, caused by the virus EV71, can have dramatic effects, including nerve damage, paralysis or death. EV71 also appears to be very pathogenic, and in recent years has caused large and worrying outbreaks in children in Asian countries, especially in China.

Human enterovirus 71 (HEV-71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) are common etiological agents causing HFMD epidemics. Other Enteroviruses (EV) causing sporadic HFMD cases include CV-A4 to CV-A7, CV-A9, CV-A10, CV-B1 to CV-B3, and CV- B5. The characteristic distribution of the vesicle gives the disease its name. HFMD usually spreads from person-to-person through contact with nose or throat discharges, feces or vesicular fluid.\n\nThe etiological agents of HFMD belong to the _Enterovirus_ genus, family Picornaviridae. They are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. HEV-71-related HFMD epidemics in Singapore, Sarawak, and Taiwan have reported serious complications like encephalitis, myocarditis, and death. Comparatively, CV-A16 causes milder infections than HEV-71.\n\nEnterovirus infections are common in children under 4 years of age and peak incidence is seen in one-year-olds. Moreover, infants younger than 6 months of age had lower mortality compared to those 0.5 to under one year of age. Highly susceptible children congregate in childcare centers, kindergartens, and preschools.\n\nAlso see recent review:\nPons-Salort M, Parker EP, Grassly NC.

[Epub ahead of print] (http://journals.lww.com/co-infectiousdiseases/Abstract/publishahead/The_epidemiology_of_non_polio_enteroviruses__.99487.aspx).\n\nPURPOSE OF REVIEW: There are over 100 serotypes of human enteroviruses, which cause a spectrum of illnesses, including meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis, myocarditis and rash. Increasing incidence of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in the Asia-Pacific region and recent outbreaks of enterovirus-associated disease, such as severe respiratory illness in the United States in 2014, highlight the threat of these viruses to human health.\n\nRECENT FINDINGS: We describe recent outbreaks of human enteroviruses and summarize knowledge gaps regarding their burden, spectrum of diseases and epidemiology.\n\nSUMMARY: Reported outbreaks of respiratory, neurological, skin and eye diseases associated with human enteroviruses have increased in frequency and size in recent years. Improved molecular diagnostics and genetic sequence analysis are beginning to reveal the complex dynamics of individual serotypes and genotypes, and their contribution to these outbreaks. However, the biological mechanisms underlying their emergence and transmission dynamics remain elusive. They are likely to involve changes in the virus, such as fitness, antigenicity, virulence or tropism, and in the human population, such as levels of sanitation and of homotypic and heterotypic immunity. Improvements in surveillance, serological surveys and detailed genetic and antigenic characterization of viral populations would help to elucidate these mechanisms. This will be important for the design of outbreak control and vaccine development strategies. ... -more\n\nA map of the Philippines may be accessed at http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?encType=1&where1=Philippines&cp=11.1126661300659~122.509475708008&qpvt=map+of+philippines&FORM=MIRE.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/158. - Mod.LK]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nThe Cagayan Valley registered the largest number of cases, at 23.7 percent of cases, followed by Calabarzon, 20.1 percent; northern Mindanao, 15.5 percent; Metro Manila, 9.6 percent, and Mimaropa, 5.4 percent.

Dr Sunil Joseph of Tayka Medical Family Clinic in Jurong said the cases he had attended to so far were 'mild cases, where the strain of the virus is not too virulent.'\n\nWhile several parents expressed concern over the increase in HFMD cases, they told journalists they were confident their children's schools could handle the matter effectively. A parent who has a daughter in kindergarten said: 'We are trusting the school to provide us with updates on suspected HFMD cases so we as parents can take precautions accordingly.'\n\nSeveral kindergartens and childcare centres noted isolated cases of HFMD on their premises.

It is characterized by fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. It is prevalent in many Asian countries. Outbreaks of HFMD occur every few years in different parts of the world, but in recent years, these have occurred more in Asia. Countries with recent large increases in the numbers of reported cases in Asia include: China, Japan, Hong Kong (China), Republic of Korea (South Korea), Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Viet Nam. HFMD outbreaks have been frequent in Singapore and neighbouring countries and are probably indicative of common features of rearing of children.\n\nViruses from the group called enteroviruses cause HFMD. There are many different types in the group, including polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses and other enteroviruses. HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild, self-limiting disease with few complications. However, HFMD is also caused by other enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), which has been associated with serious complications and may be fatal.\n\nIt is difficult to make useful comparisons of epidemics affecting different societies. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Singapore can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/150.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. \n\nA Ministry of Health (MOH) spokesperson, noting that HFMD is a common childhood disease that is endemic to Singapore, said on Tue 16 Jun 2015 that 'increases in cases can be expected from time to time.' \n\n'The key to controlling outbreaks of infectious diseases such as HFMD is the early detection and isolation of cases (children with HFMD should stay at home till they are well), and the maintenance of high levels of personal and environmental hygiene,' the spokesperson said.

It is characterized by fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. It is prevalent in many Asian countries. Outbreaks of HFMD occur every few years in different parts of the world, but in recent years these have occurred more in Asia. Countries with recent large increases in the number of reported cases in Asia include: China, Japan, Hong Kong (China), Republic of Korea (South Korea), Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Viet Nam. HFMD outbreaks have been frequent in Singapore and neighbouring countries and are probably indicative of common features of rearing of children.\n\nViruses from the group called enteroviruses cause HFMD. There are many different types in the group including polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses and other enteroviruses.\n\nHFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild self-limiting disease with few complications. However, HFMD is also caused by other enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), which has been associated with serious complications, and may be fatal. - Mod.CP]\n\n[Lesions clearly depicted at:\nhttp://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/files/2014/11/HandFootMouth_Cheney.jpg - Mod.JW\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/150.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. \n\nLatest figures by the Ministry of Health showed that just last week, there were 609 cases, almost twice the number of cases compared to the same period last year [2014].

Over the past week, the Kadena Medical Clinic and US Naval Hospital Okinawa have reported several cases of HFMD in our beneficiary populations. Likewise, this disease has been reported in the local Japanese community.\n\nHFMD is a common viral disease caused by several different viruses. It is normally seen in children under 5 years old; however, the current strain that is circulating throughout our community is also causing illnesses in adults. Additionally, the initial signs and symptoms of HFMC can be very similar to those of measles. HFMD is spread by contact with nose and throat secretions (coughing, sneezing, etc.), blister fluid, and stool. The virus is also able to remain on objects (e.g., doorknobs, toys, surfaces, etc.) for several hours.\n\nSymptoms begin with a fever, poor appetite, and a mild feeling of being unwell. In 1-2 days, painful sores usually develop in the mouth. A rash will then show on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash may also appear in other areas. For more information about HFMD, visit: http://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/index.html.\n\nHealth complications related to HFMD are quite uncommon. However, children may refuse to eat and drink because of the painful sores in the mouth. Please monitor your child for symptoms of dehydration. If dehydration is seen, please seek medical assistance.\n\nThere is no vaccine to protect against HFMD. People can lower their risk of being infected by any of the enteroviruses associated with HFMD by\n- washing hands often with soap and water, especially after changing diapers and using the toilet. [Visit http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/ for more information].\n- cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces and soiled items, including toys\n- avoiding close contact such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups with people who [may be] infected with HFMD.\n\nIf you suspect that you or your child is ill with HFMD, you should not go to work, daycare, etc.\n\n--\nCommunicated by Jennifer Dixon\n<Dixon.jenny@gmail.com>\n\n[Although measles virus and hand-foot-and-mouth disease virus may present clinically as similar conditions, they are caused by quite unrelated viruses. Strains of measles viruses are closely related and can only be distinguished by sophisticated tests. However, hand, foot and mouth disease may be caused by several distinct species of entrovirus.

Kuching district had the highest cumulative cases at 787, followed by Miri (672) and Sibu (663), he disclosed. Until early March 2015, he said 631 cases of HFMD were recorded, while the cumulative figure for Sarawak stood at 3631 thus far.\n\n'The HFMD situation in Sarawak is stable and under control, and the department is mounting efforts to curb the spread of the disease. HFMD is said to be at the outbreak level in the state if there are 365 cases reported per week for the state,' Dr Zulkifli told The Borneo Post. He said this when asked about the total number of cases for a place to be declared an HFMD outbreak area. He attributed the larger population in Kuching, Miri and Sibu as among the causative factors for the higher numbers of cases recorded in these places.\n\nMeanwhile, he stressed it is imperative for teachers in nurseries and kindergartens to monitor entry at the gates to prevent sick pre-schoolers from entering the classroom. 'Teachers also need to check the children for symptoms of HFMD and have the classrooms cleaned daily.'\n\nAmong the symptoms of HFMD are fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers on the inside of the mouth or sides of the tongue, rash (flat or raised spots) or small blisters on palms of hands, soles of feet, and/or buttocks, lethargy and poor appetite. He reiterated that parents need to seek immediate medical attention for their child if she or he exhibits any of these symptoms.\n\nMeanwhile, the person-in-charge of a kindergarten here, Yii Yiew Yieng, said they had been advised by the department to take precautionary measures against HFMD since the start of 2015. Yii said that they carry out stringent checks on every preschooler before allowing them into the class and would notify parents if their children display HFMD symptoms. 'We then ask their parents to seek immediate medical attention for them,' she added.\n\nYii said they would intensify checks if they detect symptoms of HFMD among their pupils. 'Since 2000, our teachers have been taking stringent measures to keep the disease at bay.

HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild, self-limiting disease with a few complications. HFMD is also caused by other enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), which in large outbreaks in southeastern Asia has been associated with serious complications in certain groups and may cause deaths.\n\nHFMD mainly occurs among children under 10 years old. The usual period from infection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days. The disease usually begins with fever, poor appetite, malaise, and frequently with a sore throat. One or 2 days after fever onset, painful sores develop in the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become ulcers. They are usually located on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks. A non-itchy skin rash develops over 1-2 days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters. The rash is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia. A person with HFMD may not have symptoms or may have only the rash or only mouth ulcers. In a small number of cases, children may experience a brief febrile illness, present with mixed neurological and respiratory symptoms and succumb rapidly from the disease.\n\nHFMD virus is contagious, and infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons. Infected persons are most contagious during the 1st week of the illness, but the period of communicability can last for several weeks. HFMD is not transmitted from pets or other animals. HFMD should not be confused with the different disease in animals called foot-and-mouth disease.\n\nPresently, there is no specific treatment available for HFMD. Patients should drink plenty of water or other liquids and may require treatment of the symptoms. Health care providers are advised to treat patients according to their symptoms and to refrain from using steroids.\n\nBorrowed from Mod.ST's comment in the PRO/MBDS post Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20150120.3102437: 'In the 29 Dec 2014 WHO hand-foot-mouth disease situation update, Viet Nam reports a decrease in the number of cases since week 39 (22-28 Sep 2014), but following the seasonal patterns.

Herpangina, which is similar in nature to the hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD], mostly affects children, causing them to develop sores or blisters in the mouth. They will also show symptoms of a fever and have difficulty eating and drinking. Often, the symptoms are mild and the disease can disappear within a week.\n\nThe number of herpangina cases is on the rise in Beijing, according to the Capital Institute of Pediatrics. The hospital received 987 cases of herpangina over the past week, said Chi Yang, the hospital's public relations official, on Thu 19 Jun 2014. But the disease is not caused by a new virus strain, said Huang Hui, a doctor at the hospital's department of infectious diseases, refuting an online post that linked the rise in cases to a new strain of the herpangina virus.\n\nBoth herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease are caused by an infection of enteroviruses, Huang said. The summer and autumn seasons usually see a high incidence of both diseases among children from 1 to 7, Huang said.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of newly discovered cases of hand-foot-mouth disease in Beijing has been increasing every week since the end of April 2014, according to a weekly report of contagious diseases issued by the city's health authorities. There have been 2860 cases of hand-foot-mouth disease reported in the city over the past week, the health authorities said on Thu 19 Jun 2014.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Herpangina and HFMD can be different manifestations of the same strain of enterovirus and reported in this article published electronically several years ago in Pediatrics (Ruan F, Yang T, Ma H, et al: Risk factors for hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpangina and the preventive effect of hand-washing.

However, empirical data to support this recommendation are limited.\n\nMethods: During an outbreak of HFMD and herpangina due to infection by the human enterovirus 71, we defined a case as a vesicular papular rash on the hands, feet, buttocks, or oral mucosa and onset from 30 Apr to 26 Jun 2008. We selected 176 HFMD and herpangina case-children and a stratified random sample of 201 asymptomatic control-children; frequency matched according to residency status. We administered a questionnaire to the parents about their children's exposures and hygienic behaviors.\n\nResults: Risk factors for HFMD and herpangina included playing with neighborhood children (odds ratio [OR]: 11 [95 percent confidence interval (CI): 6.2-17]), visiting an outpatient clinic for another reason 1 week or less before onset (OR: 20 [95 percent CI: 5.0-88]), and community exposures to crowded places (OR: 7.3 [95 percent CI: 4.1-13]). By using a score summarizing responses to 4 hand-washing questions, we found that 50 percent of the case-children and 2.5 percent of control-children had a poor score of 1 to 3, whereas 12 percent of the case-children and 78 percent of control-children had a good score of 7 or higher (OR: 0.00069 [95 percent CI: 0.0022-0.022]) after we adjusted for residency, age, and community exposures by using logistic regression.\n\nConclusions: Hand-washing by preschool-aged children and their caregivers had a significant protective effect against community-acquired HFMD and herpangina from the human enterovirus 71 infection.\n\nA picture of the oral manifestations of herpangina can be seen at http://diseasespictures.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Herpangina-6.jpg.

Dr. Ly Sovann, chief of the Health Ministry's Communicable Disease Control Department, told the paper that the disease claimed the life of a boy and sickened 7 other children recently.\n\nThe disease broke out in the country from April to August in 2012. The severe form of the disease killed at least 57 Cambodian children during that period, according to a joint statement by the Health Ministry and the WHO. It had disappeared in 2013 and just reoccurred in 2014, Ly Sovann told the paper, adding that the ministry has been closely monitoring the situation.\n\nHFMD virus is contagious and infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons, according to WHO. Good hygiene practice can prevent HFMD as, currently, there is no specific treatment available for the disease.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is not clear where in the country the outbreak has occurred.\n\nThe following is an outbreak disease report from WHO (Mon 9 Jul 2012, http://www.who.int/csr/don/2012_07_09/en/index.html) regarding an earlier, impressive outbreak of an enterovirus 71 associated outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease, a usually quite benign illness in young children:\n\n'As part of the continuing investigations into the undiagnosed illness, the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Cambodia is finalizing the review of all suspected hospitalised cases. This final review added an additional 2 cases between April to 5 Jul 2012, making the total number of children affected to be 59. Of these, 52 have died. The age of the cases range from 3 months to 11 years old, with the majority being under 3 years old. The overall male:female ratio is 1.3:1. Laboratory samples were not available for the majority of the cases as they died before appropriate samples could be taken.\n\nBased on the latest laboratory results, a significant proportion of the samples tested positive for enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which causes hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). The EV-71 virus has been known to generally cause severe complications amongst some patients. Additionally, a number of other pathogens, including dengue and _Streptococcus suis_, were identified in some of the samples. The samples were found to be negative for H5N1 and other influenza viruses, SARS and Nipah viruses.\n\nFurther investigations into matching the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological information are ongoing and are likely to be concluded in a few days. WHO and partners, which include Institut Pasteur and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are assisting the Ministry of Health with this event. The government is also reinforcing awareness of good hygiene practices to the public, which include frequent washing of hands.\n\nSome facts on hand, foot and mouth disease: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. The symptoms commonly observed include fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild, self-limiting disease with a few complications. HFMD is also caused by enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), which has been associated with serious complications in certain groups and may cause deaths.\n\nHFMD mainly occurs amongst children under 10 years old. The usual period from infection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days. The disease usually begins with fever, poor appetite, malaise, and frequently with a sore throat. One or 2 days after fever onset, painful sores develop in the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become ulcers. They are usually located on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks. A non-itchy skin rash develops over 1-2 days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters. The rash is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia. A person with HFMD may not have symptoms or may have only the rash or only mouth ulcers. In a small number of cases, children may experience a brief febrile illness, present with mixed neurological and respiratory symptoms and succumb rapidly from the disease.\n\nHFMD virus is contagious, and infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons. Infected persons are most contagious during the 1st week of the illness, but the period of communicability can last for several weeks. HFMD is not transmitted from pets or other animals. HFMD should not be confused with the different disease in animals called foot-and-mouth disease.\n\nPresently, there is no specific treatment available for HFMD.

More than 4200 cases of the disease were reported in the city, overtaking the total of the previous 2 years combined [2011-2012]. The viral infection mainly affects children, but doctors have recently been seeing more cases in adults.\n\nAcademy of Medicine president Dr Donald Li Kwok-tung said the large number of outbreaks might be related to humid weather and a low overall immunity in the population. 'In the past, we hardly ever saw cases in adults, but recently we have been seeing more,' said the family medicine specialist. 'It may be due to a generally lower resistance against infections in the population, especially when people are tired and stressed.'\n\nLaboratory tests by the Department of Health found no unusual genetic characteristics in recent viruses causing the disease, but Li said there might still be slight changes in the viral strains that resulted in people having no immunity to them. Both children and adults who catch the disease usually have a fever, develop painful ulcers inside the mouth and get a rash with vesicles on the hands and feet. The disease is mostly self-limiting and sufferers recover within a week. Severe cases may develop complications like viral meningitis or encephalitis which could lead to death. There were 5 such cases this year [2013], but no fatalities so far [this year]. Li explained that the disease seldom occurred in adults because most acquired immunity at young age. Medical Association president, paediatrician Tse Hung-hing, also noticed more adult cases recently, and generally agreed with Li's explanations.\n\nThe Department of Health said the government did not keep age records of the reported cases. The disease was not a statutorily notifiable disease in Hong Kong and only institutions were encouraged to report outbreaks. As of Wednesday [2 Oct 2013], 652 outbreaks had been reported from institutions such as schools and homes for the elderly, with a total of 4246 people contracting the disease this year. There were 2216 affected people last year [2012] and 1370 in 2011. The usual peak season for hand, foot and mouth disease is in May to July. This year, the number of cases started climbing in May, fell in July, and rose to another peak in September.\n\nChinese University paediatrics professor Ellis Hon Kam-lun said the virus was mainly transmitted through touching the saliva or faeces of infected people. Parents should avoid taking their children to crowded places if possible, and sick children should stay at home.\n\n[Byline: Lo Wei]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following figures posted by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection support the statement that more than 4200 cases of the disease were reported in the city, overtaking the total of the previous 2 years combined.\n\nYear / no. of institutions affected / no. of cases\n2008 / 157 / 967\n2009 / 103 / 727\n2010 / 851 / 5025\n2011 / 253 / 1370\n2012 / 382 / 2216\n2013 / 652 / 4256 (as of 2 Oct 2013)\n\nNo information has been provided concerning the identity of the virus or viruses responsible for this or the previous outbreaks in Hong Kong.

They should wash their hands regularly with soaps or hand sanitizer after visiting toilets, coughing, or sneezing, and before preparing food. He advised parents against bringing their children to crowded public places such as shopping malls and recreational parks. 'Parents must also ensure that their children are not sent to school if he or she is down with HFMD. They should practise self-isolation at home. This includes non-sharing of eating utensils and handkerchiefs.'\n\nHe stressed that it was mandatory for nurseries and schools to report to the department if they suspected a child was down with HFMD.

These viruses includes the polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD in the United States and Europe, whereas other coxsackieviruses have been associated with HFMD elsewhere. Enterovirus 71 has also been associated with HFMD and outbreaks in Asian countries and can have more serious consequences in some situations.\n\nAccording to the WHO HFMD Situation Update of 6 Aug 2013 (http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/index.html): 'Regional HFMD in Asia is variable.

It is moderately contagious and is spread through direct contact with the mucus, saliva, or feces of an infected person. It typically occurs in small epidemics in nursery schools or kindergartens, usually during the summer and autumn months. The usual incubation period is 3-7 days. It is less common in adults. ProMED-mail does not normally report outbreaks of HFMD on account of their ubiquity. Outbreaks of HFMD are associated with a variety of enteroviruses, the most severe outbreaks being associated with coxsackievirus A6 infection or human enterovirus 71. The latter has been associated with more sever forms of HFMD and is most common in some Asian countries. Enterovirus 71-associated disease is sufficiently common and serious as to focus research on vaccine development.\n\nThe identity of the agent responsible for the 2 outbreaks in Hong Kong has not been determined, but may be the same agent in view of the intermingling of participants.

The contagious viral illness has been spreading among children below 5 years of age in the last 2 months. Of the 79 samples drawn by the scientists, 40 per cent tested positive for enterovirus.\n\n'The circulating virus in the city, causing HFMD in infants and children, is enterovirus. The infection caused by the virus is usually mild. Hence, there is no need to panic,' said senior scientist D T Mourya, director of NIV. The viral infection, benign but irritating, is characterised by painful rashes along with throat [pain] and fever. Coxsackieviruses and enteroviruses are the major causative agents of HFMD in India. This is the 1st time that the Virology Institute investigated HFMD cases in Pune after doctors reported a spurt [of cases] since October [2013]. Earlier, it had carried out HFMD investigations in Kerala, West Bengal, Odisha, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu in 2009-2010. Scientist V Gopalkrishna, Deputy Director of NIV, who spearheaded the HFMD study along with paediatricians, said, '79 clinical samples comprising throat swabs, rectal swabs, vesicular swabs and blood samples were collected from children below 7 years of age with suspected HFMD in Pune who went to paediatricians' clinics and hospitals for treatment in the last 2 months. Nearly 40 per cent of the samples tested positive for the etiological agent enterovirus. Now, cases are on the decline.' Paediatricians from Shaishav clinic, Chiranjeev clinic, Bharati Hospital and Ajinkya Hospital from the city were involved in this study with NIV scientists.\n\n'If a child is not eating and shows loss of appetite and has mouth ulcers, then it is time to consult a doctor,' said paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar. Paediatrician Jayant Navarange, who is part of the NIV study and has been treating kids with HFMD in the last 2 months, said, 'HFMD is contagious. Hence, infected children should stay away from schools till they completely recover,' he added.\n\n[Byline: Umesh Isalkar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HFMD is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in adults. Symptoms of HFMD include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (herpangina) and a skin rash. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Enterovirus 71 has been associated with more severe outbreaks of HFMD (see: http://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/index.html).\n\nHFMD is prevalent globally and infects children in all communities. Since normally the infection is mild and of short duration, there has been little incentive to identify the specific etiologic agent. Normally ProMED-mail does not record these outbreaks unless the specific etiologic agent has been identified, or there is some unusual feature. The outbreak in Pune is exceptional in that the etiologic agents have been identified. Curiously the etiologic agent was only identified in less than 40 per cent of cases.\n\nThe Western Pacific Region of WHO routinely publishes data on the incidence of HFMD throughout East Asia (but not India) [see: http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/].

The current strain is unusual in that it is infecting adults as well as children, says Dr Michael Shepherd, clinical director of Starship's emergency department. 'The strain we've got at the moment is more severe,' he said on Firstline this morning [6 Jun 2013].\n\nDr Shepherd says HFMD is a fairly common disease that most children will get at some stage but isn't usually as serious as some other infectious diseases, which is partly why it persists, says Dr Shepherd. 'We've tended to focus vaccines on illnesses that cause long-term consequences. HFMD hasn't quite reached that threshold. We worry more about measles and chickenpox, and things like that. I think that it's pretty unpleasant to get it, but I think in terms of seriousness, it doesn't cause a whole range of long-term consequences. But I think it's causing quite a lot of distress and problems for the community generally, particularly with kids being out of daycare and off school.'\n\nHFMD typically manifests as a rash on a child's hands, feet and mouth, but the current strain seems to affect other parts of the body too. 'It can be a more diffuse rash, a bit more all over your body,' says Dr Shepherd. 'The rash is typically a blistering-type rash, a little bit like chicken pox. Often the mouth lesions are the real problem in terms of getting fluid into kids; it's very painful.'\n\nThe worst thing that can happen is that a victim's nails can fall off. Dr Shepherd says it's 'pretty dramatic' and unusual, but they do grow back again. 'If you think your child had HFMD, it would be nice if you didn't take them to daycare,' he says. 'We ask people to keep them away until their fever has gone away and until they're not getting any new lesions and the old ones have scabbed over or started to heal up.'\n\n[Byline: Dan Satherley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HFMD occurs worldwide, and several different enteroviruses have been associated with outbreaks of HFMD.

In these outbreaks, most children have typical symptoms of HFMD and recover without complications. However, a small number of children with this disease have developed severe complications requiring prolonged hospitalization or, rarely, death. These cases have been associated with prevalence of a particular strain of human enterovirus 71, a genogroup C4a strain. This strain was 1st identified in Cambodia and more recently detected in Australia.\n\nIt would be relevant to establish whether this strain is responsible for the current outbreak of HFMD in Auckland.

Media are also reporting Auckland Starship Hospital's emergency department has been treating up to 15 children each week for the last month.\n\nThe disease, a contagious virus based in the intestine, is not the same as the veterinary disease, foot-and-mouth disease, and is characterised by fluid-like blisters appearing on the hands, feet, and inside of the mouth. It is not considered serious but many children can become dehydrated as blisters make it painful to drink water. Bay of Plenty District Health Board paediatrician Doctor Hugh Lees says while it is contagious it is considered relatively mild. 'We only see the children who are having difficulty with getting fluids. Most children will probably be being seen by a GP. 'The most important measure to prevent the spread is 'to wash your hands.'\n\nHealth officials are advising children should only be sent home if they are feeling unwell, not because red spots are visible. HFMD most commonly affects children under the age of 10, particularly pre-schoolers with outbreaks often occurring in child-care centres and schools. The disease is transmitted from person to person by direct contact with the blisters fluid or direct contact from secretions from the child's nose or throat.

Yesterday [27 Oct 2012], the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission announced that a hand, foot and mouth disease vaccine is expected to be approved and marketed next year [2013]. This vaccine will be administered to children under 6 months of age.\n\nAccording to the Beijing CDC [Centre for Disease Control], this year [2012], Beijing [with a population of about 19.6 million] has reported a total of about 36 000 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease, a 40 percent increase over the same period last year. [At present] there is no vaccine or specific drug available for treatment of hand, foot and mouth disease virus infection.\n\nThe Beijing CDC said previous monitoring data showed that the incidence of HFMD in Beijing increases during the summer months. In 2011, there were 2 peaks, May to August 2011 and then again in November 2011, the 2nd incidence peak being significantly lower than the 1st peak. Although Beijing has now entered the low peak period for the current year [2012], cases are still being diagnosed, and the outbreak may persist into the winter.\n\nAccording to the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, a vaccine is currently under development against this disease, which affects mainly children under 5 years of age. It is understood that human enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the major pathogen causing human hand, foot and mouth disease, and 2 companies are engaged in development of an inactivated vaccine to control this disease. In one project, Phase III clinical trials are expected to be completed this year [2012]. The vaccine is expected to be approved next year. The EV71 inactivated vaccine will be suitable for administration to children over 6 months of age. However, the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, said EV71 inactivated vaccine is still in the research and development stage.\n\nHFMD is caused by a variety of enteroviruses, mainly affecting children under 5 years of age with an incidence highest in children under 3 years of age. The majority of children have mild symptoms, mainly fever and rashes affecting the hands, feet and mouth. Under normal circumstances, most patients recover within about a week, but a few cases may lead to meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, and pneumonia, with some children experiencing severe illness sometimes leading to death.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It remains to be seen to what extent a vaccine against human enterovirus 71 would affect the incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Although human enterovirus 71 virus infection has been associated with the more serious outcomes of hand, foot and mouth disease, it is likely that many other human enteroviruses are implicated in this disease, which is to some extent associated with inadequate hygiene.\n\nIt is clear from research in Viet Nam and elsewhere that the epidemiology of HFMD is complex and that human enterovirus 71 is one of several enteroviruses causing this disease. Furthermore, a great diversity of human enterovirus 71 strains circulate globally, and no particular genotype has been specifically associated with severe disease. Different human enteroviruses co-circulate in the community annually. According to a recent review (Lee, T.C. et al., Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2009 Oct;28(10):904-10), the emergence in recent years of the human enterovirus 71 epidemic in the Asia Pacific region has been associated with the circulation of 5 genetic lineages (genotypes B3, B4, C1, C2, C4) that appear to be undergoing rapid evolutionary changes. More recent reports indicate that sub-genotype C4 predominates in China at the present time (Mao LX, et al., J Clin Virol. 2010 Oct;49(2):100-4).

That kids are more vulnerable to hand, foot and mouth disease [HFMD] has left parents and doctors across the city worried.\n\nPaediatrician Shantanu Ray say he has never come across so many hand, foot and mouth cases in Kolkata before. 'Most have been extremely severe. The rashes are taking at least a week to go. It's leading to a complete loss of appetite, weakness and fever. Lack of awareness has made things worse. Parents of affected children are often sending their children to school mistaking it to be ordinary body rashes. It has hastened the spread of the disease,' he added.\n\nThe initial symptoms of the disease -- fever, headache, loss of appetite and rashes -- have left both doctors and patients confused and scared. Even though hand, foot and mouth disease usually strikes only children and is rarely fatal, it has been severe, prompting doctors to treat it as seriously as dengue fever.\n\nCaused by a highly contagious virus, it has been affecting children aged between 2-8 years. Hand, foot and mouth disease rarely affects those above 10 years of age, but it spreads from person to person through nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stools of an infected person. A child is most contagious in the 1st week when he/she contracts the disease.\n\nSoon after the dengue epidemic started in late July 2012, hand, foot and mouth disease had set in also. By late August 2012, thousands had been affected in Kolkata. The numbers have started going down, but the virus is still active, say doctors. 'Since it coincided with dengue, it led to a panic. The symptoms are scarily similar to those of dengue. Apart from the rashes, which are restricted to the mouth, hands and feet, other indicators are no different from those of dengue. High fever, headache, loss of appetite are the common indicators,' said Arindam Kar, director, Medical Institute of Critical Care. But it could be even more painful than dengue, pointed out some experts. The blisters triggered by the virus could appear on the tongue, lips and other parts of the mouth, making it painful to chew and swallow food.\n\nSeveral playschools had to shut down following the outbreak. Many asked parents to stop sending their children to school if they had rashes. 'Almost 20 percent of our students had the disease. It was spreading fast, so we had shut down for a week,' said the teacher in charge of a playschool in Alipore. 'Fortunately, our students have not yet been affected. But there is reason to be careful,' said Malini Bhagat, principal, Mahadevi Birla Girls' Higher Secondary School.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is a relatively common viral infection that usually begins in the throat. Caused by intestinal viruses of the family _Picornaviridae_, it takes 3 to 7 days for the symptoms to develop. It is less common in adults, but those with immune deficiencies are very susceptible. There is no specific treatment for the infection other than relief of symptoms. Treatment with antibiotics does not work and is usually not recommended. 'But it might be necessary in some cases. Also, the blisters need to be treated with ointments to make them disappear fast,' said Ray.\n\n[Byline: Prithvijit Mitra]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common, mild disease usually caused by any of several enteroviruses such as human coxsackievirus A, human coxsackievirus B or human enterovirus 71.

It can also cause ulcers in the mouth, although many individuals have no symptoms. Many countries in east and Southeast Asia experience very large annual outbreaks affecting many thousands of children. A few children, and rarely adults, may have severe illnesses.

This notification prompted a flurry of confused questions, including 'What is hand, foot and mouth disease?' 'How do I get it?' 'What are the symptoms?' and 'Will I be okay?'\n\nHFMD is actually a fairly common illness, spread by [a virus] much in the same way as the common cold. Several of its symptoms, too, match those of a cold or flu, including fever, a general feeling of discomfort, and a sore throat. After one or 2 days, rashes and sores appear, often on hands and feet and in the back of the mouth. These sores increase the contagiousness of the disease, as they can rupture and leak fluid, causing the infection to spread. HFMD clears up on its own; in fact, there is no known cure. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is very little doctors can do except to prescribe analgesics to help ease the pain the sores create.\n\nThis year's [2012] university outbreak has been out of the ordinary, Dr. Meredith Hayden of Student Health said. It is the 1st outbreak she has seen in her 7 years at the university. 'It's not uncommon that these viruses are in circulation pretty much all the time,' she said. 'It's not anything that's [particularly] out of the ordinary; it's just unusual to see it in the student population.'\n\nEstimating the total number of cases within the university is difficult, as the disease is often simply classified as a general rash, Hayden said. But there have been 16 confirmed HFMD cases in September 2012, and October 2012 has seen 8 more so far, she added. Whether the outbreak is ending, Hayden said, is hard to tell, but it may be slowing down. 'I personally haven't seen a case in the last couple of weeks,' she said.\n\nThis may be because of the school's attempts to contain the virus. The email said the university is making an extra effort to stop the disease before it spreads further. 'Our diligent housekeeping staff has been notified, and they have heightened their efforts to disinfect common areas, including our bathrooms,' the email said.\n\nAlthough the disease has in rare instances been known to cause serious complications, Hayden said the average college population is not generally at serious risk. Inflammation of the brain and meningitis can occur but are exceedingly rare. After the disease clears, some patients also note nail loss, although the CDC says that 'in the reports reviewed, the nail loss was temporary, and the nail grew back without medical treatment.'\n\nThe key to stopping the spread of the disease is simply good hygiene. The CDC promotes 'washing hands often with soap and water, disinfecting dirty surfaces and soiled items, and avoiding close contact such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups with people with HFMD.'\n\nEspecially now that cold and flu season will soon be in full swing, it should be everyone's responsibility to prevent the spread of the disease within the university.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedorg.com>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years of age. Rarely, it can occur in older children and adults. Symptoms of HFMD include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (herpangina), and a skin rash. Nail loss may a delayed consequence of infection. In the United States, HFMD in adults is rare and mainly observed in educational institutions, such as the University of Virginia, where young people from diverse backgrounds are accommodated in close proximity.\n\nHFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_ of the family _Picornaviridae_. Recently coxsackievirus A6 has been a cause of HFMD in the United States, whereas other enteroviruses -- enterovirus 71 in particular -- have also been associated with the more serious forms of HFMD observed in China and Southeast Asian countries. According to the WHO, as of 5 Oct 2012, regional HFMD activity is variable. While China, Hong Kong (China) and Macao (China), and Singapore have reported more cases in 2012 than in 2011 for the same period, the recent trend is declining in China, Hong Kong (China) and Macao (China). Japan and Singapore are seeing an increase in activity, and Viet Nam continues to see high activity (see: http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/index.html). - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1Fgq.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE - USA (06): (VIRGINIA), UNIVERSITY STUDENTS\n************************************************************************\n \n\nEstimating the total number of cases within the university is difficult, as the disease is often simply classified as a general rash, Hayden said. \n\nAlthough the disease has in rare instances been known to cause serious complications, Hayden said the average college population is not generally at serious risk. \n\nEspecially now that cold and flu season will soon be in full swing, it should be everyone's responsibility to prevent the spread of the disease within the university.

More than 400 self-reported cases of Coxsackie A6 virus infection, which arrived in the United States in December [2011], have been received by the health district in 2012.\n\nHFMD is a common viral illness that predominantly affects children 5 and younger. The health district sent its first alert on 30 Mar 2012, when there were about 30 cases of the unusual Coxsackievirus A6 virus, which included 6 adults. Some of the symptoms include a rash that may appear as small pimply sores at first, progressing to larger sores (some fluid filled) that scab over after a day or 2, according to the health district's website. The sores do not usually itch but can be painful as they emerge and may appear on parts of the body other than the hands, feet or mouth, including groin, buttocks, torso, arms and face. Sores in the mouth and/or throat may cause loss of appetite and/or dehydration.\n\n'This strain is not [affecting] just the hands, feet and mouth,' said Phil Ulibarri, public information officer for the health district. 'It's also seen on the elbows, the knees, the arms, buttocks, legs and in the genital area.' Ulibarri said the Coxsackie A6 virus strain also can cause finger and toenail shedding after other symptoms subside.\n\nThe school district sent a message to parents via its ConnectEd automated phone system at the request of the health district. It asked parents to familiarize themselves with the information so that if their child developed symptoms consistent with this [virus infection], they will be prepared with the information needed to stop its spread. 'We want kids to stay home until the sores dry up or scab over,' Ulibarri said. 'We don't want to see people having person to person contact if they're still contagious.' He said children, especially younger children, can spread the disease as they share objects, such as toys, eating utensils and cups.\n\nDana Balchunas, director of the school district's student health services, said it began sending literature to the school nurses and other staff at the end of last school year. It was sending another round of alerts in advance of the traditional school year beginning 27 Aug 2012, he said. 'We communicate with nurses about what they should look for, and they in turn tell the principals and teachers,' Balchunas said. 'It's an ongoing process.' Some of the year-round schools have reported cases of students with the virus, she said. 'It's not a high number of reports from schools,' Balchunas said.\n\nThe health district says that a student must be kept home until there are no new sores for 2 days, all sores are dry or scabbed over, and no fever for 24 hours without the use of fever reducing medications. A person infected should rest, take food and fluids as they are able, use fever reducing medications appropriately and consult a physician if needed. With no treatment or vaccine for the disease, the best defense is prevention.\n\nThe Washoe County Health Department issued these hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) prevention tips:\n\n- wash hands with soap and water carefully and frequently, especially after going to the bathroom, after changing diapers, and before preparing foods or beverages;\n- disinfect surfaces and items, including toys. First wash the items with soap and water, then disinfect them with a solution of 2 tablespoons of bleach and 4 cups of water;\n- avoid close contact such as kissing, hugging or sharing eating utensils or cups with infected people;\n- report suspected cases of HFMD; contact the Washoe County Health District at 775-328-3764.\n\n[byline: Michael Martinez]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HFMD occurs globally. In developed countries, HFMD is generally mild and often associated with outbreaks of Coxsackie A16 virus infection. Contrary to the above report, Coxsackie A6 virus infection is a frequent cause of HFMD in North America and has not 'arrived'.\n\nIt is not clear whether the Nevada outbreak is more severe than usual or merely that the surveillance in Washoe county is more sensitive than elsewhere.

'The patient presented with fever and rashes in the hands, feet, and mouth and is presently recovering at home as no hospitalization was required. Just like the first confirmed case he had no history of travel to Cambodia. A DOH team is now conducting contact tracing to determine the spread [source] of infection,' Ona revealed.\n\nThe Department of Health's National Epidemiology Center reported 43 suspected HFMD cases as of 21 Jul 2012. Laboratory results were available for 42 of these cases. Twenty-one cases (21), which screened positive for a human enterovirus [infection] were classified as confirmed HFMD cases; 2 of these cases further tested positive for EV-71 while 19 were negative [for EV-71].\n\nOf the confirmed HFMD cases, 14 were males and age ranged from 6 months to 23 years; 12 were less than 5 years old. Most of the cases were reported from Southern Luzon (13) and Davao (4). No deaths were reported.\n\nAn interim guideline for surveillance of HFMD and severe enteroviruses is now available. All suspected cases of HFMD are now required to be immediately reported to the DOH within 24 hours of detection. Laboratory screening and confirmation of human enteroviruses are done at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).\n\n'The public is reminded to observe strict personal hygiene and hand washing,' Ona reminded. He adding that shared toys or teaching tools in daycare should be cleaned, washed and disinfected as they easily become contaminated.\n\nAs of today, there are no travel restrictions to and from HFMD-affected countries.

Rayong Public Health chief Kris Pansuk yesterday identified the victim only as a two and a hilt year-old child. 'We suspect that he caught HFMD, mainly because of his symptoms - blisters, high fever and vomiting,' Kris said.\n\nThe boy developed symptoms on 21 Jul 2012. His parents took him to a clinic twice, the first occasion a few days after he became ill. 'Because his condition did not improve, he was sent to the Klaeng Hospital on Wednesday. Just two hours after he was admitted, he succumbed,' Kris said. He said he had informed Rayong Governor Seni Jitkasen of the death. Major public hygiene operations will take place in Rayong today.\n\nIn a related development, Disease Control Department director-general Dr Pornthep Siriwanarangsun yesterday visited the mother of a young girl whose death from HFMD last week was the first in Thailand this year. Earlier this week, experts confirmed the girl died of HFMD, which can spread quickly among young children. HFMD has already infected at least 16,860 people this year. 'The girl's parents understand the news coverage of their child's death and related information. They are hurt, though, by the fact that some news reports suggest that they brought their daughter to doctors rather too late,' Pornthep said.\n\nAccording to the parents, their daughter developed symptoms on July 15 or 16, and she was immediately rushed to a hospital. The girl's mother, also denied reports that her family sought financial assistance from Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. She explained that Public Health Minister Witthaya Buranasiri gave her family some cash for merit making [?].\n\nIn the wake of the spread of HFMD, Witthaya called for hygiene campaigns to be implemented beyond schools and nurseries. 'I have ordered that public buses, subway cars, Skytrain carriages, taxis and train stations be cleaned too,' he said. He added that all village public-health volunteers had been instructed to guide people in how to guard against HFMD and how to rapidly detect infections.\n\nDeputy Public Health Minister Surawit Khonsomboon said most HFMD patients could be treated as outpatients and would recover within 10 days. He warned parents against taking their children on long-haul trips, for example, for the purpose of letting them recuperate in their home provinces. 'Travelling can suppress a patient's immune system. It may also spread the disease,' Surawit said.\n\nQueen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health director Dr Siraporn Sawasdivorn expected the HMFD outbreak to die down next month.\n\nAccording to the head of the institute's infectious-disease department, more cases of dengue fever have been detected recently than of HFMD.'The symptoms [of the two diseases], such as high fever and vomiting, may be quite similar. But HFMD patients will likely refuse to eat too,' Dr Siripen Kalayanarooj said. The Disease Control Department said dengue fever had already hit 25 351 people and killed 27 of them this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Food and Drug Administration deputy secretary-general Srinuan Kornkotchakorn told people not to believe in widespread rumours that caffeine-mixed drinks would help protect them against the HFMD.'They are beverages.

It causes fevers, rashes on hands and feet, and blisterlike sores in the mouth, which can make drinking and eating extremely uncomfortable. It usually clears up on its own in about a week.\n\nNow, though, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting that an unusual version has hit the country, with more severe fevers and rashes, some leading to hospitalization for dehydration and pain.\n\nThe severe strain was 1st noticed in Alabama, Connecticut, California, and Nevada last winter [2011-2012], which was odd because HFMD typically appears in summer and early fall.\n\nAlthough several pediatricians in the Washington area say they haven't seen the atypical virus, 'it's pretty much all over the country at this point,' says Steven Oberste, laboratory chief in CDC's viral disease division.\n\nHFMD is usually caused by coxsackievirus A16; the more severe illness is caused by coxsackievirus A6, which has popped up in this country only a few times in the past 40 years, according to the CDC. Both are spread through saliva, mucus, fluid from the blisters, and stool.\n\nThe CDC has received about 100-150 reports of severe cases. 'Since there's no required reporting of hand-foot-mouth disease, it's difficult to estimate how many cases are out there,' Oberste says. 'We have 100-150 reports, but clearly it's a lot more than that.'\n\nMelissa Arca, a pediatrician in Sacramento, where the disease seems to have hit hard, says there were times during the summer when she saw 3 or 4 children every day with severe HFMD, and she only works half days at her clinic. Researchers don't know if the A6 wave has peaked with the end of summer, so they're unsure whether the new school year will cause a spike in cases. Outbreaks of HFMD occur around the globe, but in recent years they have mostly been in Asia, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nDaniel Levy, a pediatrician in Owings Mills, Maryland, says that he has seen a normal amount of HFMD and the cases don't seem any more severe than usual. Pediatricians at Children's National Medical Center and one in Columbia Heights both echoed Levy's experience. 'I have yet to see any child hospitalized or sent to the ER [for HFMD] in my career; it is just not that serious,' Levy says. 'It sounds a lot worse than it is.'\n\nThe A6 version is odd, for a number of reasons. It causes more severe rashes up the legs, around the mouth and, especially for toddlers, on the buttocks. Arca reports that in some cases, after the rash has gone away, the skin can peel and the fingernails and toenails can fall off. 'It's scary, but they'll grow back,' she says.\n\nAlso, more adults than usual seem to be catching the new strain, according to the CDC. That's probably because A6 has circulated only sporadically in the United States since 1970, so fewer adults were exposed to it when they were younger, according to Oberste. A6 was big in Japan in the spring and summer of 2011.\n\n[Byline: Rachel Saslow]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The coxsackie A6 virus has circulated sporadically in the USA, and may produce somewhat more severe disease.

Furthermore, the complication rate was higher and duration of hospitalization longer among children with HFMD and vitamin A levels of 0.7 micromoles/L or less -- the level generally considered to indicate deficiency -- compared with those whose levels were higher, remarks the team in Clinical Nutrition.\n\nVitamin A is 'an essential micronutrient with established roles in embryogenesis, growth, reproduction, maintenance of epithelial integrity, and optimal function of the immune system,' explain Weiping Wang, from the Children's Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai, the People's Republic of China, and co-investigators. The last 2 functions are particularly concerning when considering the potential impact of vitamin A deficiency on HFMD infection, which is characterized by pathologic damage to the skin and mucous membranes, they add.\n\nThe team assessed dietary intake and serum concentrations of vitamin A in a group of 450 hospitalized HFMD patients aged a median 25 months at disease onset. Participants all weighed in the normal range for their age and none were malnourished.

According to the World Health Organization, 190 million preschool-aged children and 19.1 million pregnant women around the world have a serum retinol concentration below 0.70 micromoles/L. In these countries, low vitamin A intake is most strongly associated with health consequences during periods of high nutritional demand, such as during infancy, childhood, pregnancy, and lactation.\n\nIn developing countries, vitamin A deficiency typically begins during infancy, when infants do not receive adequate supplies of colostrum or breast milk. Chronic diarrhea also leads to excessive loss of vitamin A in young children, and vitamin A deficiency increases the risk of diarrhea. The most common symptom of vitamin A deficiency in young children and pregnant women is xerophthalmia. One of the early signs of xerophthalmia is night blindness, or the inability to see in low light or darkness. Vitamin A deficiency is one of the top causes of preventable blindness in children. People with vitamin A deficiency (and, often, xerophthalmia with its characteristic Bitot's spots) tend to have low iron status, which can lead to anemia. Vitamin A deficiency also increases the severity and mortality risk of infections (particularly diarrhea and measles) even before the onset of xerophthalmia.\n\nIn developed countries, the amounts of vitamin A in breast milk are sufficient to meet infants' needs for the 1st 6 months of life. But in women with vitamin A deficiency, breast milk volume and vitamin A content are suboptimal and not sufficient to maintain adequate vitamin A stores in infants who are exclusively breastfed. The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in developing countries begins to increase in young children just after they stop breastfeeding. The most common and readily recognized symptom of vitamin A deficiency in infants and children is xerophthalmia.\n\nThe body needs vitamin A to maintain the corneas and other epithelial surfaces, so the lower serum concentrations of vitamin A associated with measles virus infections, especially in people with protein-calorie malnutrition, can lead to blindness. Consequently it is feasible that vitamin A deficiency may play a role in susceptibility to HFMD.\n\nMeasles virus infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children in developing countries. About half of all measles deaths happen in Africa, but the disease is not limited to low-income countries. Vitamin A deficiency is a known risk factor for severe measles. The World Health Organization recommends high oral doses (200 000 IU) of vitamin A for 2 days for children over age one with measles who live in areas with a high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency [36]. A similar regime should be explored in the cases of HFMD.\n\nFurther information can be found in the Nation Institutes of Health, Vitamin A Dietary Fact Sheet http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Vitamin A deficiency is common in many developing countries, often because residents have limited access to foods containing preformed vitamin A from animal-based food sources and they do not commonly consume available foods containing beta-carotene due to poverty.

The statistics also showed EV71 has caused around 80 percent of the infections this year.\n\nLast year [2011], many but not all of 169 deaths were caused by the virus strain and only 20 percent of the 110 000 infections [were caused] by it. Most of the cases were instead caused by [a coxsackievirus] strain, Hai told the media on the sidelines of a Nha Trang conference. He said EV71 is the most toxic among intestinal viruses, 'capable of causing brain, neurological, and respiration complications that lead to death.'\n\nHai said health agencies are working to find answers for the remarkable changes in the disease, which [usually] begins with mouth sores and blisters on hands and feet. They will also try to explain the sudden increase of infections in the north, which last year [2011] reported fewer cases than the south, but at present is accounting for half of the infections nationwide with around 22 000 patients.\n\nHai said there's a theory that the molecular structure [genotype] of EV71 in the north is different of that in the south of Viet Nam.

Passakorn Chaivanichsiri, Director of Nopparat Rajathanee Hospital on Ram Intra Road [Bangkok], said EV-71 was thought to have been found in the body of a 2-and-a-half-year girl who died on 19 Jul 2012. He said the infant showed no related symptoms of the disease such as ulcers in the throat, mouth and tongue or any rash. She suffered damage to her heart, lungs and brain.\n\nAccording to Dr Passakorn the hospital conducted a proper screening and diagnosis and the result came back negative for HFMD. However, 'the results of a throat culture show [signs of] EV-71, a strain that can cause serious complications,' he said.\n\nA source close to the hospital said the infant was in critical condition when she was admitted to the hospital. The Disease Control Department earlier denied her death was caused by the HFMD virus after a lumbar puncture test and stool examination did not reveal the presence of the disease. The girl's father said his daughter had visited a school before she fell ill.\n\nPornthep Siriwanarangsan, director general of the Public Health Ministry's Disease Control department, urged parents not to be afraid of an outbreak of HFMD. He said the public health system's preventative measures are highly effective. A temporary shutdown of some schools is in place as a precaution to contain a likely outbreak.\n\nAccording to Dr Pornthep, HFMD killed 6 people out of 18 196 patients last year [2011]. The mortality rate was 0.01 per 100 000 people. Dr Prasert Thongcharoen, an adviser to the Disease Control Department, said the laboratory tests on the girl will be submitted to virologists on Tuesday [24 Jul 2012] to confirm the cause of death. 'Parents should not panic about this as the situation is not unusual. Over the past 5 years, Thailand has averaged 8000 - 18 000 HFMD patients a year with between 2 and 6 deaths,' he said.\n\nPublic Health Minister Witthaya Buranasiri yesterday [21 Jul 2012] gave assurances that state and private hospitals are highly capable of handling HFMD. He said parents seem to be well informed about how to take action to stop the disease. He urged schools and child-care centres to maintain high hygiene standards even without any sign of an outbreak. 'There is no need to wait for an outbreak to step up sanitation. Parents should wash their hands before holding their children.

The peak will last until October but the infection commonly seen among toddlers can be easily prevented and treated with early detection and intervention, said Xiao Donglou, a division director of the Ministry's disease prevention and control bureau.\n\nAccording to official statistics the infection claimed more than 240 lives on the mainland in the first 5 months of the year. The epidemic appeared to hit harder this year in terms of scale and severity, Xiao said. From Jan to Jun last year, 132 deaths were reported. An official tally showed China reported nearly 1.62 million HFMD cases in 2011, including 509 deaths.\n\n'The infection is expected to maintain a relatively high prevalence this year and children attending nurseries, kindergartens and elementary schools are most vulnerable to the disease,' he said. In response, the Ministry has devised clinical guidelines to help with a timely diagnosis and proper treatment of HFMD particularly at grassroots-level health institutions. The ministry has distributed information and training materials, mainly at kindergartens, to help better track the infection and get timely medical intervention. Kindergartens and elementary schools are required to increase monitoring and preventive measures by carrying out morning checks and routine disinfection.Kindergartens must report any HFMD cases upon detection to local health authorities to help avert the risk of secondary infections. Kindergartens with outbreaks could be closed temporarily.\n\nPang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention, told China Daily several kindergartens in the capital had been temporarily closed after outbreaks were detected. The capital has reported three deaths, all children under 5, from the infection, she said. 'All of them were diagnosed at the late stage and sent to private small clinics and their deaths could have been avoided,' she told China Daily.\n\nAccording to medical experts, children younger than 3 are at the greatest risk of HFMD and the infection usually starts with a light fever followed by blisters and ulcers in the mouth and rashes on the hands and feet. The virus spreads via the digestive and respiratory systems and through close contact. Zhao Min, a sales manager in Beijing, said she has received manuals on HFMD prevention and intervention from the kindergarten her 3 year old son attends. 'Starting in May, I began to regularly disinfect his toys and keep him away from crowded public places like the shopping mall,' she said.\n\nThere is no vaccine to specifically target the infection so good hygiene practices should be applied to prevent the disease, Pang said. Adults could get infected but usually show no symptoms.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is generally a mild disease usually caused by an enterovirus such as human coxsackievirus A, human coxsackievirus B, or human enterovirus 71. Infection by human enterovirus 71 may have more serious outcomes, but otherwise HFMD is a mild illness. HFMD gets its name from the non-itchy rash that develops on the palms of your hands and soles of feet. It can also cause ulcers in the mouth although many individuals have no symptoms.\n\nMany countries in East and South East Asia experience very large annual outbreaks affecting many thousands of children, but HFMD is by no means confined to the developing world and remains a problem elsewhere. A few children, and rarely adults, may have severe illnesses. During the year ProMED-mail through HealthMap alerts receives many reports of HFMD from numerous Chinese provinces. These reports are almost invariably Chinese language report which we are unable to edit. The above report provides an overall estimate of the incidence of HFMD in China -- 1.62 million HFMD cases in 2011, including 509 deaths. The extent of the outbreak in the current year is likely to be similar since there have been 240 deaths already in the first 5 months of this year.\n\nHFMD is spread from person to person through nose and throat secretions (such as saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus), blister fluid, or faeces of infected people. As noted above there is no preventative vaccine, in part because HFMD is caused by enterovirus infection and the identity of the specify infectious agent is rarely determined and may vary from locality to locality.

Cases have occurred in 63 provinces, and 20 deaths (all in children under 5) have occurred in 10 provinces. Hai Phong in the North has the highest number of cases, followed by Bac Can, Yen Bai, Lao Cai, Hoa Binh, Da Nang, Vinh Phuc, Quang Tri, Dong Thap, and Binh Dinh Provinces in the Center and Southern Regions. The Viet Nam Ministry of Health is taking steps to control the outbreak.\n\nLarge outbreaks of severe HFMD occur frequently in some countries in Asia. Thousands of people may get infected during these outbreaks. Some people, particularly young children, may have severe disease requiring hospitalization or even causing death. To learn more outbreaks occurring around the world, visit the World Health Organization's website.\n\nHFMD is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children under 5 years of age. Adults can also get the disease. Symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (often painful), and a rash. HFMD is spread from person to person by direct contact with the saliva, nasal secretions, blister fluid, and stool of an infected person. The virus can also be spread when an infected person touches objects and surfaces that are then touched by others. An infected person is most contagious during the 1st week of the illness. However, the virus can stay in the stool for weeks after symptoms go away. In addition, people with HFMD do not always show signs of infection, but still could have the potential to spread the disease.\n\nThere is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent HFMD. However, you can protect yourself from HFMD by practicing healthy personal hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially before eating and after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner with at least 60 percent alcohol. Consider packing alcohol-based hand cleaner in your carry-on luggage to ensure you have it when needed. Disinfect dirty surfaces and soiled items. If you are able, 1st wash the items with soap and water; then disinfect them with a solution of chlorine bleach (made by mixing 1 tablespoon of bleach with 4 cups of water) or a cleaning product that contains bleach. Avoid close contact such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups with people who have HFMD.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for HFMD. If you do develop mouth sores: Take over-the-counter medications to relieve pain and fever. (Caution: Aspirin should not be given to children.) Use mouthwashes or sprays that numb mouth pain. Drink plenty of liquids to stay hydrated.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although this travel alert is directed towards travellers to Viet Nam, the advice is equally appropriate for travellers to many other destinations in south and south-east Asia.

There were 1394 cases last week [week of 16 Apr 2012], a 19 percent spike from the previous high reported the preceding week. The latest figures bring the total number of HFMD cases this year [2012] to 13 289 [as of 27 Apr 2012].\n\nAccording to a Ministry of Health (MOH) spokesperson, the HFMD cases so far are not related to the EV71 virus [human enterovirus 71], which [has been associated with] potentially serious complications. 'There has not been any HFMD case with severe complications among the cases notified this year,' a Ministry of Health [MOH] spokesperson said in response to queries. Adding that the MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely, she said that the ministry's surveillance of hospitals and general practitioners 'does not indicate that the current uptrend is EV71-related.'\n\nWith the number of cases remaining above the epidemic threshold, the MOH is also working closely with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to 'ensure that high levels of environmental hygiene are maintained in the institutions.' The MOH spokesperson said: 'Institutions have also been reminded to check the overall health of children daily upon arrival and to refer sick children for further assessment by medical practitioners. This, together with maintaining a high-standard of environmental hygiene, is an important measure in preventing the spread of HFMD to other children in the institutions.'\n\nPre-schools contacted by TODAY said they have increased their temperature and health checks. EtonHouse Pre-School, for instance, has stepped up its checks from twice to 4 times a day since February 2012. Director Josephyne Ho said the school premises and equipment have been fumigated daily with sanitisers since last month [March 2012]. Similarly, Odyssey The Global Preschool has increased its number of health checks to 3 times a day since January 2012, while toys are sanitised daily.\n\nThe MOH spokesperson said the ministry 'strongly urges parents with preschool age children not to bring their child to school, or any other crowded public places, if their child is exhibiting HFMD symptoms and to seek medical attention early if their child is unwell.' She added: 'Parents should also ensure that a high standard of personal and environmental hygiene is maintained at home. Children infected with HFMD should avoid contact with other children. Articles contaminated by oral or nasal fluids from infected children should be disinfected.'\n\nThe MOH spokesperson reiterated that HFMD is 'a common childhood disease which is endemic in Singapore, thus yearly seasonal outbreaks can be expected. The disease is generally mild and self-limiting,' she said.\n\n[Byline: Amanda Lee]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRonan Kelly\n<ronankelly@comcast.net>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Ronan Kelly for drawing attention to the report above, which indicates that human enterovirus 71 is unlikely to be the etiologic agent responsible for the current outbreak of HFMD in Singapore.

The increase in cases had been observed since January this year, and 17 221 cases have been reported since then. Dr Hasan added that the Ministry's measures to curb the spread were to temporarily shut down premises or institutions where HMFD was spreading, and urged medical practitioners to report HFMD cases to the ministry.

However, it can sometimes occur in adults. Symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease include fever, mouth sores, and a skin rash. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. Unfortunately this report does not identify the causative agent (or agents) responsible for this outbreak of HFMD. The uniformly mild symptoms observed suggests that this outbreak is not caused by human enterovirus 71, which in the past has been accompanied by cases of severe disease in Malaysia.\n\nHFMD usually starts with a fever, poor appetite, a vague feeling of being unwell (malaise), and sore throat. One or 2 days after fever starts, painful sores usually develop in the mouth (herpangina). They begin as small red spots that blister and that often become ulcers. The sores are often in the back of the mouth. A skin rash develops over 1 to 2 days. The rash has flat or raised red spots, sometimes with blisters. The rash is usually on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; it may also appear on the knees, elbows, buttocks or genital area. Some people, especially young children, may get dehydrated if they are not able to swallow enough liquids because of painful mouth sores.\n\nHand, foot, and mouth disease is spread from person to person by direct contact with the infectious viruses that cause this disease. These viruses are found in the nose and throat secretions (such as saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus), fluid in blisters, and stool of infected persons. The viruses may be spread when infected persons touch objects and surfaces that are then touched by others.\n\nThere is no specific treatment. There is no vaccine to protect against the viruses that cause HFMD.

It's called hand, foot, and mouth Disease (HFMD). No one knows the extent of the [disease] because doctors don't have to report it to the Health Department or even the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]. But health experts say in rare cases, people may have to be hospitalized and the virus could be deadly.\n\nWithin hours of asking News 2 Facebookers if they've seen any sign of the disease, more than 40 people responded, some with pictures of family members recovering. One Kernersville mom also told us her child's daycare had an outbreak last week. 'From what I understand there were not many children there on Friday and today,' she said. Her daughter hasn't been feeling well since she picked her up from the center last Thursday [3 May 2012]. 'You could just tell she wasn't feeling good. We got home, 102-degree fever that night. She developed blisters all over her legs, her behind, and her back and her arms.' And as her daughter's pediatrician found out, the blisters also made it to her oesophagus. 'From a parent who's never seen it before, it's very scary,' said her mother.\n\nAt the daycares it spreads from child to child; and at home from child to parent. 'My rash got a lot worse than my daughter's did,' said another mother whose daughter had just recovered from the virus [infection]. 'I've kind of felt dizzy all day.' Her forehead, her brow line, into her hairline, and ears were all affected.\n\nThe virus spreads through saliva and other bodily fluids and quickly. Once contracted, doctors can't do much for a patient until it runs its course. 'It's devastating as a parent because what do you do?' a mother asked rhetorically, saying daughter's doctor gave her a medicinal mouthwash to numb the pain in her throat.\n\nParents tell us their daycares have notified them about the virus soon after outbreaks. The CDC recommends no shaking hands, hugging and kissing for at least a week after the infection. They also say you should wash your hands often and disinfect surfaces you've touched.\n\nHFMD is often confused with foot-and-mouth disease (or hoof-and-mouth disease), a disease that affects only cattle, sheep, and swine; not humans. Also, HFMD is caused by a completely different and unrelated virus.\n\n[Byline: Faith Abubey]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HFMD occurs globally. In developed countries it is generally a mild disease and often associated with outbreaks of Coxsackie A16 virus infection. In East Asian countries in recent years, the disease often has been associated with outbreaks of Human enterovirus 71 infection and can be more severe, with a small proportion of children experiencing neurological complications, occasionally with fatal outcome. Recently Coxsackie A6 virus has been responsible for an outbreak of HFMD in Alabama. It will be interesting in due course to learn whether there is any linkage between these 2 outbreaks.\n\nThe Piedmont Triad is a north-central region of the state of North Carolina that consists of the area within and surrounding the 3 major cities of Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and High Point. The Triad is not to be confused with the 'Triangle' region (Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill), directly to the east. The location of the Piedmont Triad can be found in the interactive HealthMap at http://healthmap.org/r/2kc_. - Mod.CP]\n\n[One interesting bit of information in the above newswire is that the news station (News 2) used Facebook as a disease surveillance tool, asking News2 Facebook subscribers to report if they had seen signs of the disease. As was demonstrated in the above newswire, in a matter of hours, more information on the numbers of cases as well as institutions involved in the HFMD outbreak was received by the newsgroup soliciting the information.\n\nFor those who are not familiar with Facebook, it is one of the social media networks on the internet where individuals 'friend' other individuals ('friending' is connecting with others as part of a network of one's friends and acquaintances) as well as join like-minded interest groups such as a newswire or in our case ProMED-mail (yes, there is a ProMED-mail Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/ProMEDmail).\n\nIn 2011, there was an outbreak of Pontiac fever (legionellosis) identified through the use of a social media network (also Facebook, and also associated with a news reporter using Facebook to learn about the outbreak and identify cases).

HFMD is typically a benign and self-limiting disease. Most common in young children, it presents as fever, oral lesions and rash on the hands, feet and buttocks. The oral lesions consist of rapidly-ulcerating vesicles on the buccal mucosa, tongue, palate and gums. The rash consists of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, fingers and soles, which generally persist for 7 to 10 days, and maculopapular lesions on the buttocks.\n\nThe [virus causing this outbreak] of HFMD in the Viet Nam epidemic, EV71, can be fatal [in rare cases] and is spreading among children under 5 according to the World Health Organization. EV-71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in Southeast Asia over several years. EV-71 is a non-polio enterovirus. Complications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or haemorrhage and myocarditis. Most deaths in HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or haemorrhage.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alert\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The epidemic of HFMD in Viet Nam shows no sign of slowing.

In the United States, outbreaks of HFMD typically occur during summer and autumn months. The most common cause of HFMD in the United States has been enterovirus serotype coxsackievirus A16. Most infections are asymptomatic; persons with signs and symptoms typically have a mild febrile illness with rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and sores in the mouth. HFMD also has been associated, often weeks after initial symptom onset, with nail dystrophies (e.g., Beau's lines or nail shedding).\n\nFrom 7 Nov 2011, to 29 Feb 2012, CDC received reports of 63 persons with signs and symptoms of HFMD or with fever and atypical rash in Alabama (38 cases), California (7), Connecticut (1), and Nevada (17). HFMD is not a reportable disease in the United States; the cases were identified as unusual by health-care providers or by a department of health that contacted CDC for diagnostic assistance. Clinical specimens were collected from patients in 34 of the 63 cases. Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) was detected in 25 (74 percent) of those 34 patients by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and partial sequencing of the VP1 gene at CDC or at the California Department of Public Health. No enteroviruses were detected in the other 9 patients.\n\nOf the 63 patients, 40 (63 percent) were aged under 2 years, and 15 (24 percent) were adults aged 18 years or older; 44 (70 percent) of the patients had exposure to a child care facility or school, and 8 (53 percent) of the 15 adults had contact with children in childcare where cases of HFMD [hand, foot and mouth disease] were reported, or provided medical care, or were related to a child with HFMD.\n\nRash and fever were more severe, and hospitalization was more common than with typical HFMD. Signs of HFMD included fever (48 patients [76 percent]); rash on the hands or feet, or in the mouth (42 [67 percent]); and rash on the arms or legs (29 [46 percent]), face (26 [41 percent]), buttocks (22 [35 percent]), and trunk (12 [19 percent]). Of 46 patients with rash variables reported, the rash typically was maculopapular; vesicles were reported in 32 (70 percent) patients and scabs in 30 (65 percent) patients. Shedding of nails [onychomadesis] occurred after initial infection in 2 (4 percent) patients. Of the 63 patients, 51 (81 percent) sought care from a clinician, and 12 (19 percent) were hospitalized. Reasons for hospitalization varied and included dehydration and/or severe pain. No deaths were reported.\n\nThe age ranges of patients, severity of illness, seasonality of disease, and identification of CVA6 [Coxsackievirus A6] in these cases were unusual for HFMD in the United States. CVA6 has been associated with more severe and extensive rash than HFMD caused by other enteroviruses (1). Since 2008, international outbreaks of CVA6 HFMD in children and adults have been described (1-4), but no outbreaks had been reported in the United States previously. Although all 25 of the CVA6 strains identified in the U.S. cases were genetically closely related (based on partial VP1 gene sequences) to CVA6 strains identified in recent international outbreaks, no epidemiologic evidence (e.g., travel history) has directly linked any of the U.S. cases to importation.\n\nHFMD is spread from person to person by contact with saliva, respiratory secretions, fluid in vesicles, and feces. Transmission of HFMD can be reduced by maintaining good hygiene, including handwashing and disinfection of surfaces in child care settings (5). CDC continues to receive reports of CVA6-associated HFMD. Persons who suspect a severe case of HFMD should contact their health-care provider. Local or state health departments may contact CDC for assistance with enterovirus laboratory diagnosis.\n\nReferences:\n1. Wei SH, Huang YP, Liu MC, et al.

In developed countries, hand, foot and mouth disease is generally mild and often associated with outbreaks of Coxsackie A16 virus infection. The largest outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease in Singapore in 2008: the role of enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A strains. An outbreak of coxsackievirus A6 hand, foot, and mouth disease associated with onychomadesis in Taiwan, 2010. Of the 63 patients, 51 (81 percent) sought care from a clinician, and 12 (19 percent) were hospitalized. A6 infection as a cause of the hand, foot and mouth disease currently observed in Alabama and other states appears to be intermediate in severity. In east Asian countries in recent years, the disease has been associated with outbreaks of Enterovirus 71 infection and can be more severe, with a small proportion of children experiencing neurological complications, occasionally with fatal outcomes. \n\nThe age ranges of patients, severity of illness, seasonality of disease, and identification of CVA6 [Coxsackievirus A6] in these cases were unusual for HFMD in the United States.

The disease is a common viral illness that most often affects children but can occur among adults.\n\nMost infections cause little or no symptoms in children. The period from initial infection to the onset of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is from 3 to 7 days. Symptoms may include: fever; sore throat; a feeling of being unwell (malaise); painful, red, blister-like lesions on the tongue, gums and insides of the cheeks; a red rash without itching but sometimes with blistering on the palms, soles and sometimes the buttocks; irritability in infants and toddlers; loss of appetite.\n\n'We have seen some cases of HFMD within the school systems we monitor weekly,' stated Jamey Keen, Public Health Nurse at Southwest Nebraska Public Health Department. 'If you notice any of the symptoms, notify your physician.'\n\nThe virus is spread from person to person by contact with saliva, respiratory secretions, fluid in vesicles and feces. HFMD is not related to foot-and-mouth disease, which is an infectious viral disease found in farm animals. You can't contract HFMD from pets or other animals, and you can't transmit it to them.\n\nHFMD is usually a minor illness that goes away after a few days of the fever and symptoms. The most common complication of the disease is dehydration. The illness can cause sores in the mouth and throat, making swallowing painful and difficult. Watch closely to make sure your child frequently sips fluid during the course of the illness. If your child is taking in very little fluids, contact your family physician for further evaluation. Although rare, this disease can involve the brain, leading to more serious complications such as meningitis or encephalitis.\n\nHandwashing is the single most effective way to prevent infection, and good hand hygiene is important. Disinfecting common areas and surfaces in child care settings, whether public or private, as well as surfaces at home will help kill the virus that causes hand-foot-mouth disease. To disinfect surfaces, wash with soap and water first and then with a diluted solution of chlorine bleach, approximately 1/4th cup of bleach to one gallon of water. All common areas, including shared items such as toys, need to be disinfected, as the virus can live on these objects for days. Clean your baby's pacifiers often as well.\n\nBecause HFMD is highly contagious, people with the illness should limit their exposure to others while they have active signs and symptoms. Keep children out of child care or school until the fever is gone and mouth sores have healed. If you have the illness, stay home. A person who suspects a severe outbreak of HFMD should contact the Southwest Nebraska Public Health Department at (308) 345-4223 or their family physician for assistance.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness caused by enteroviruses that predominantly affect children aged under 5 years. In the United States, outbreaks of HFMD typically occur during the summer and autumn months. The most common cause of HFMD in the United States has been the enterovirus Coxsackievirus A16, whereas strains of Enterovirus 71 have been the predominant virus in South and East Asia in recent years. Most infections are asymptomatic; persons with signs and symptoms typically have a mild febrile illness with rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and sores in the mouth. HFMD also has been associated, often weeks after initial symptom onset, with nail dystrophies (e.g., Beau's lines or nail shedding).\n\nUnfortunately, the above report does not identify the particular enterovirus responsible for the Nebraska outbreak. It would be relevant to establish whether the etiologic agent in Nebraska is similar to the Coxsackievirus A6, which has been responsible for outbreaks in the recent past in Alabama, Connecticut, California, and Nevada.

The local health authorities have cleaned the environment and sprayed antiseptic at affected areas and their surroundings. Can Tho authorities have also launched a campaign for environmental hygiene across the city, especially in schools, kindergartens and families with children under 5 years old.\n\nMeanwhile, patient overload has occurred in the Obstetrics-Pediatrics Center of the Da Nang General Hospital in the central city of Da Nang, where 140 children have been hospitalized despite the center having only 40 official sickbeds.

These viruses are found in the nose and throat secretions (such as saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus), fluid in blisters, and stool of infected persons. The viruses may be spread when infected persons touch objects and surfaces that are then touched by others. Infected persons are most contagious during the 1st week of the illness. The viruses that cause HFMD can remain in the body for weeks after a person's symptoms have gone away. This means that infected people can still pass the infection to others even though they may appear well. Also, some people who are infected and shedding the virus, including most adults, may have no symptoms. HFMD not transmitted to or from pets or other animals, and is most prevalent where sanitation is poor.\n\nIt has been observed that infection with EV71 is occasionally associated with severe neurological disease such as acute encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and cardiopulmonary failure.

The following background information on HFMD in Singapore is reproduced from a recent publication in BMC Infect Dis. 2011; 11: 270. By: Li W Ang, Meng C Phoon, Yan Wu, Jeffery Cutter, Lyn James,and Vincent T Chow, http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/270.\n\n'Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) have caused large epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide. Since EV71 was 1st identified in 1969 from an infant suffering from encephalitis in California, outbreaks associated with this virus have been documented, including in Australia in 1972, Japan in 1973 and 1978, Bulgaria in 1975 and Hungary in 1978. EV71 infection is occasionally associated with severe complications (such as encephalitis) and deaths in children. Since 1997, EV71-related HFMD epidemics in the Asia-Pacific region have been increasingly reported, including in Sarawak, Malaysia in 1997, 2000, 2003 and 2006; Brunei in 2006; Perth, Australia in 1999 [11]; Taiwan in 1998 and 2000; Japan in 2000 and 2003; and China in 2008.\n\n'In Singapore, HFMD was 1st recognized in an outbreak in June-July 1970, but the etiologic agent was hitherto unknown. CA16 was associated with 2 other outbreaks without serious complications or fatalities, involving 104 individuals between September 1972 and January 1973, and 742 individuals between September and December 1981. EV71 was 1st isolated from an infant with symptoms of HFMD in Singapore in 1984. Between September and October 2000, a large EV71-associated HFMD outbreak occurred in Singapore, resulting in 4 deaths. HFMD became notifiable under the Infectious Diseases Act from 1 Oct 2000. All preschool centers were closed from 1 Oct to 15 Oct 2000. By 28 Oct 2000, a total of 2827 cases were notified. The main pathologic findings in the fatal cases were encephalitis, interstitial pneumonitis, and myocarditis. Thereafter, EV71-associated HFMD epidemics occurred in 2006 and 2008, with the latter being the largest known HFMD outbreak in Singapore.\n\n'HFMD is endemic in Singapore, and more than 50 percent of cases occur in children below 5 years of age. Although the predominant circulating enteroviruses change periodically, the 2 major enteroviruses causing nationwide HFMD epidemics in Singapore have been CA16 and EV71.\n\n'An EV71 serologic survey in Singapore had been conducted on serum samples collected from 856 children aged 12 years or younger at a pediatric clinic at the National University Hospital (NUH) between July 1996 and December 1997. All children who were born at the hospital or brought for routine visits and vaccinations during this 18-month period were included, and they did not exhibit HFMD-related symptoms at the time of sample collection. Since then, there had not been any comprehensive survey to measure the EV71 seroprevalence between or after EV71-associated HFMD epidemics in Singapore.\n\n'Between August 2008 and July 2010, we conducted a seroprevalence survey to estimate the levels of EV71-specific neutralizing antibodies among children and adolescents aged between 1-17 years. This was the largest and 2nd nationally representative survey conducted to ascertain the latest age-specific seroprevalence of EV71 infection in Singapore. We compared our findings with the results of the 1996-1997 study to discern any significant changes over the past decade.\n\n'Our study revealed that EV71 infection is very common among Singapore children and adolescents, with 39 percent infected by the time they are in secondary school (i.e. 13-17 years of age). The previous 1996-1997 study was conducted before the 1st EV71-associated HFMD epidemic occurred in 2000. Our survey commenced in August 2008, several months after an HFMD epidemic started in Singapore around March 2008.

Can Tho Children's Hospital, the only children's hospital in the Mekong Delta, has been overloaded with hundreds of HFM-infected patients over the last few days. 2 to 3 children have had to share a bed. During the first 3 months of the year, the hospital received nearly 4500 children with the disease, 3 times higher than that of the same period last year.\n\nHalf of the patients were from other provinces in the Mekong Delta. More than 1000 people were hospitalised for treatment. 2 of them died. Le Hoang Son, director of the hospital, said 20 standby beds had been set up in anticipation of a likely increase until the end of June [2012]. Children contracting HFM in the earliest stages had been treated at home to ease the overload at the hospital. In many cases, HFM-infected children have been wrongly diagnosed as having pneumonia, dengue fever or meningitis by primary-care physicians. When they were later transferred to the hospital, the patients had already reached an advanced stage of the illness.\n\nMost hospitals in the provinces of Mekong Delta do not have proper equipment, including respirators, drop counters, syringe pumps and blood purification machines. Vo Huy Danh, director of An Giang Province's Preventive Medicine Centre, said that it had asked the provincial People's Committee to provide VND10 billion (USD 475 000) to purchase necessary equipment as well as chemicals for the prevention and treatment of the disease. This would reduce the number of fatalities as well as the number of patients transferred to hospitals in Can Tho and HCM City, Danh said.\n\nThe province has reported 5 deaths caused by HFM disease, the country's highest fatality rate. More than 700 children have contracted the disease, according to the province's Preventive Medicine Centre. More than 1000 cases, including 2 fatalities, have been recorded in Dong Thap Province this year [2012].

The Mekong Delta (the 'Nine Dragon river delta') is the region in southwestern Viet Nam where the Mekong River approaches and empties into the sea through a network of tributaries. The Mekong delta region encompasses a large portion of southwestern Viet Nam of 39 000 square kilometres (15 000 square miles). The size of the area covered by water depends on the season. The Mekong Delta is Viet Nam's southernmost region, and contains 12 mostly small but populous provinces in the delta of the Mekong, plus the independent municipality of C\u00e1\u00ba\u00a7n.\n\nHFMD is a common, mild and self-limiting rash-associated illness in most children, with Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) or Enterovirus 71 (EV71) the predominant causative agents. Since first described in California in 1969, EV71 has been reported to be responsible for many large outbreaks all over the world, including outbreaks that occurred in South and East Asia from 1997 onwards.

Lin Kuo-ning, deputy chief of the city Department of Health's disease control division, said there have been 5 cases of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection reported so far this year [2012], involving one high school student and 2 junior high school students.\n\nEV71 is a picornavirus associated with HFMD and fatal neurological illness in infants and young children. These cases suggest a rising trend in the age of patients susceptible to EV, Lin said.\n\nAccording to city health department statistics, as of 10 Mar 2012, district hospitals in the city had reported a total of 1182 cases of EV infection, 2.8 times the 417 cases the hospitals reported in the same period last year [2011]. Meanwhile, schools around Taipei reported a total of 1384 EV[71?] cases from 1 Jan 2012 to 10 Mar 2012, some 3.93 times the 352 cases recorded in the same period of last year. The accumulated number of school classes forced to be suspended due to cluster infections reached 113 classes during this period, that is 3.22 times the 35 classes reported in the same period of 2011, the statistics show.\n\nThe city health department reminded the public that infants and toddlers aged under 5 are at the highest risk of severe EV infection. Children who develop symptoms of extreme sleepiness, unconsciousness, vomiting, persistent fever or seizures should be taken to local clinics or hospitals for medical treatment as soon as possible, the department said.\n\n[Byline: Huang Li-yun and Elizabeth Hsu]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It seems likely that EV71 is the virus mainly responsible for the current outbreaks in Southeast and South Asia, although the causative agent is rarely specified.\n\nEV71 was 1st identified in 1969 from an infant suffering from encephalitis in California, and subsequent outbreaks associated with this virus have been described, including in Australia in 1972, Japan in 1973 and 1978, Bulgaria in 1975, and Hungary in 1978. EV71 infection is occasionally associated with severe complications (such as encephalitis) and deaths in children. Since 1997, EV71-related HFMD epidemics in the Asia-Pacific region have been increasingly reported, including in Sarawak, Malaysia in 1997, 2000, 2003 and 2006; Brunei in 2006; Perth, Australia in 1999 [11]; Taiwan in 1998 and 2000; Japan in 2000 and 2003; China in 2008, and currently in Viet Nam.\n\nEV71 phylogenetic analyses have revealed considerable genetic diversity. VP1 sequences [indicative of potential antigenic diversity] clustered into 3 genogroups, A, B and C, with genogroups B and C further divided into 5 subgenogroups, B1-B5 and C1-C5, respectively. All EV71 strains were clustered similarly in the 5'UTR and VP1 trees, except for one Taiwanese strain, which demonstrated different clustering in the 2 trees, suggesting a recombination event in the phylogeny.\n\nAnother recent overview describes the molecular epidemiology of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) in the Asia-Pacific region from 1997 through 2002. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP4 and VP1 genes of recent HEV71 strains indicates that several genogroups of the virus have been circulating in the Asia-Pacific region since 1997. The 1st of these recent outbreaks, described in Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) in 1997, was caused by genogroup B3. This outbreak was followed by large outbreaks in Taiwan in 1998, caused by genogroup C2, and in Perth (Western Australia) in 1999, where viruses belonging to genogroups B3 and C2 co-circulated. Singapore, Taiwan, and Sarawak had HEV71 epidemics in 2000, caused predominantly by viruses belonging to genogroup B4; however, large numbers of fatalities were observed only in Taiwan. HEV71 was identified during an epidemic of hand, foot and mouth disease in Korea; that epidemic was found to be due to viruses constituting a new genogroup, C3.\n\nSee:\n[1] J Gen Virol. 2010 Aug;91(Pt 8):1949-58.

Dr. Bhagwan Bang of South Alabama Pediatrics in Opp said other Alabama counties are reporting similar cases, as well. Hand foot mouth disease is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 and can be contracted by not washing one's hands properly. Bang said the disease strain currently circulating locally has caused extensive and larger-than-normal lesions on the hands, feet and mouth. He said cases in adults have also been noted.\n\nHe said the same strain [virus species] -- Coxsackie A6 virus -- reportedly caused a 2008 epidemic in Finland, a 2004 and 2008 epidemic in Taiwan, and this year for the first time in the U.S.\n\n'Hand, foot and month disease usually starts with a fever, poor appetite, malaise and sore throat, painful sores in the mouth, on the palms of hands and soles of feet,' Bang said. 'It also appears on the knees, elbows and buttocks, and can also cause dehydration due to the inability to swallow fluid.' Bang said his office has seen several cases -- 2 of which were confirmed as the disease by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n'This isn't something that should scare parents,' Bang said. 'They should just be aware of it and take precautions against it. The easiest way to stop the spread of this disease is by simply washing your hands after changing a dirty diaper, disinfecting a dirty surface and avoiding close contact with someone who is infected.'\n\nThose at Covington Pediatrics in Andalusia have seen similar cases, which they attribute to the unseasonably warm weather. The virus should not be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease), a disease of cattle, sheep and swine. The two diseases are caused by different viruses and are not related. Those concerned about symptoms should contact their health care provider.\n\n(By Stephanie Nelson)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from Health Map alefts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot and mouth disease occurs globally.

The outbreak is concentrated in the southern part of the\ncountry, but cases have been reported from all regions.\n\nCities and provinces with the highest numbers of HFMD deaths are Ho\nChi Minh City, Dong Nai, Binh Duong, Long An, Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Bac\nLieu, Dong Tap, Tien Giang, and Quang Ngai.\n\nAs of mid-October 2011, Viet Nam had reported 80 000 cases of HFMD and\n137 deaths. As in other outbreaks of EV71-associated HFMD reported in\nSoutheast Asia since 1997, a small proportion of children with the\ndisease have developed severe, often fatal complications, including\nencephalitis.\n\nHFMD is a common illness that usually affects infants and young\nchildren. However, older children and adults can also become infected.\nHFMD can be caused by several different viruses. Symptoms of HFMD\ninclude fever, painful blister-like sores in the mouth, and a skin\nrash. HFMD is spread from person to person by direct contact with the\nviruses that cause this disease. These viruses can be found in saliva,\nnasal secretions, blister fluid, and feces of the infected persons.\nThe viruses also may be spread when an infected person touches objects\nand surfaces that are then touched by others.\n\nYou can protect yourself from HFMD by practicing healthy personal\nhygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially before\nyou eat, after you cough or sneeze, and after you go to the bathroom\nor change a baby's diaper. If soap and water are not available, use an\nalcohol-based hand gel (with at least 60 percent alcohol). Consider\npacking alcohol-based hand gel in your carry-on luggage to ensure you\nhave it when needed [However, you won't get through airport security\nwith it in the UK and many other countries. - Mod.CP]. Disinfect dirty\nsurfaces and soiled items. Avoid close contact such as kissing,\nhugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups with people with HFMD.\n\nThere is currently no vaccine to protect against the viruses that\ncause HFMD. The personal hygiene measures described above are the best\nprotection. There is no specific treatment for HFMD. However, some\nthings can be done to relieve symptoms, such as taking\nover-the-counter medications to relieve pain and fever (Caution:\nAspirin should not be given to children), and using mouthwashes or\nsprays that numb mouth pain. If a person develops mouth sores, staying\nhydrated is important. An ill person who cannot swallow enough liquids\nto stay hydrated should see a doctor. Fluids may need to be given\nintravenously.\n\nThe current outbreak in Viet Nam has been attributed to EV71. HFMD is\none of many infections that cause mouth sores.

'Yes, the situation is much better now\ncompared to the same period last year when 4692 cases were reported,'\nshe said.

'It is important that they\ncontinue to practice a high standard of hygiene and cleanliness,\nincluding proper hand washing, and non-sharing of eating utensils,'\nshe advised.\n\nParents, she said, should isolate their children if they did not feel\nwell and get them immediate medical attention. She also revealed that\npreschools, schools and organisations had been given guidelines on the\ndos and don'ts pertaining to HFMD, and that preschools and schools\nshould inform the Health Department if they suspected a child was down\nwith HFMD. 'The department personnel will carry out checks and\ninvestigation at the nursery or school concerned.

Since 1\nJan 2011 to 4 Sep 2011, 98 deaths and 42 673 cases of HFMD have been\nconfirmed across the country. Three quarters of the deaths have been\nin children aged 3 years or less.\n\nViet Nam has implemented precautionary measures in an effort to reduce\nthe spread of HFMD. The Prime Minister of Viet Nam has instructed all\nprovincial authorities and relevant ministries to strengthen\nprevention and control measures against HFMD. In addition, formal\nguidelines for surveillance, prevention and treatment of the disease\nhave been sent to all health care facilities. 'The number of HFMD\ncases might increase in the coming months when preschools and\nkindergartens resume,' said Minister of Health, Ms. Nguyen Thi Kim\nTien.\n\nHFMD is a common viral illness among infants and children under the\nage of 10 years but can also occur in adults. The virus causes fever\nand sores in the throat and blisters on the hands and feet. The\ndisease is usually mild and patients generally recover in 7-10 days.\nThe disease is caused by a group of viruses known as Enterovirus\n[Family _Picornaviridae_, Genus _Enterovurus_]. One of these is EV71\n[Species _Human enterovirus A 71_] which on occasion can cause severe\ncomplications, including neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory\nproblems. In Viet Nam, the epidemiology of HFMD is complex but EV71 is\nresponsible for nearly half of the infections in those who have tested\npositive for HFMD.\n\nTypically, HFMD sporadically occurs across Viet Nam but remains most\nconcentrated in the Southern and Central provinces. Higher rates of\ninfection occur from March to May and September to December.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has begun conducting 84 training courses on\nsurveillance, prevention and control of HFMD that include preventive\nmedicine staff at provincial, district and communal level as well as\npre-school teachers. There is also an ongoing nation-wide public\nawareness campaign on television and other media to highlight these\npreventative measures.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) along with the United States\nCenter for Disease Control (CDC) is supporting the Ministry of\nHealth's General Department of Preventive Medicine (GDPM) efforts to\ncontrol the disease. 'WHO and CDC are working closely with MOH to\ndetermine the cause of the unusual increase in cases and deaths, and\ninvestigate the epidemiological characteristics of HFMD in Viet Nam,'\nActing WHO Representative, Dr. Graham Harrison said.\n\nThe virus causing HFMD is spread from person to person through direct\ncontact with virus contained in nose and throat secretions, saliva,\nblister fluids, stools of infected persons and asymptomatic carriers.\nThe virus is most often spread by virus-contaminated hands and through\ncontact with contaminated surfaces. Infected persons are most\ncontagious during the 1st week of the illness. The viruses that cause\nHFMD can remain in the body for several weeks after a patient's\nsymptoms have gone away. This means that the infected person can still\npass the infection to other people even though they may appear to be\nwell.\n\nCurrently, there is no vaccine or specific medication against HFMD.\nHowever, the risk of infection is lowered significantly with high\nstandards of personal and environmental hygiene. The Ministry of\nHealth recommends the following precautionary measures:\n- Frequent hand washing with soap and water, especially after changing\ndiapers, before preparing food, before eating, and before feeding\nchildren, and after using the toilet;\n- Cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing;\n- Thoroughly clean contaminated surfaces and soiled items 1st with\nsoap and water and then with common disinfectant in homes, in child\ncare centers, kindergartens and schools, and maintain clean\nsurroundings;\n- Avoid sending children to child care centers, kindergartens or\nschools if they are suffering from HFMD;\n- Follow safe food and water practices.

HFMD usually attacks infants and children under the\nage of 10, causing them to run a fever, develop ulcers in the mouth,\nespecially on the tongue and gums, as well as blisters or rashes on\nthe hands and feet, he said. Dr Hasan also urged parents and\ncaregivers to send children to hospital or clinic immediately if they\ndetected such symptoms. He also asked them to practise good hygiene\nand observe cleanliness at all times to prevent the spread of the\ndisease.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a febrile sickness complex\ncharacterized by cutaneous eruption (exanthem) on the palms and soles\nwith simultaneous occurrence of muco-cutanous vesiculo-ulcerative\nlesions (enanthem) affecting the mouth. Infection is spread from\nperson to person by direct contact with infectious virus. Infectious\nvirus is found in the nose and throat secretions, saliva, blister\nfluid, and stool of infected persons. The virus is most often spread\nby persons with unwashed, virus-contaminated hands and by contact with\nvirus-contaminated surfaces.

The disease has killed 137 people, mostly children, out of\n77 895 infections in the 63 cities and provinces across the country\n[i.e., the whole of Viet Nam - Mod.CP] this year.\n\nA report by the Viet Nam Administration of Preventive Medicine showed\n2900 new HFMD cases were recorded last week [16-22 Oct 2011], up 400\ncases from the previous week. Nguyen Van Binh, chief of the\nadministration, said the number of HFMD fatalities and infections\nwould continue to rise.\n\nLocal media have repeatedly asked why the Health Ministry has not\ndeclared the HFMD an epidemic so that more money and effort can be\npoured into prevention of the disease. Minister Tien reiterated a\nregulation on Tuesday [25 Oct 2011] that the ministry can announce a\nnational epidemic only after at least 2 provinces do so locally. 'In\nfact, HFMD is occurring in South Korea, Japan and China but none of\nthose countries have declared a national epidemic either,' she said.\n'No announcement made does not mean we are neglecting of the lives of\nthe children. We are trying our best to prevent the disease from\nspreading with the help of World Health Organization [WHO] experts in\nViet Nam.'\n\nInfection is typically mild and causes mouth sores and blisters on\nhands and feet. No vaccine or specific treatment exists, but most\nchildren typically recover quickly without problems.\n\nAccording to WHO updates on 11 Oct 2011, Viet Nam ranked 3rd in the\nnumber of HFMD infections among 7 countries and territories in the\nWestern Pacific region, after China and Japan. WHO said China, Japan,\nMacao (China) and South Korea were seeing a declining trend in the\nnumber of reported HFMD cases while Singapore continued to see\nlow-level activity. In comparison, China reported 1 217 768 HFMD\ncases, including 399 deaths, between January and September this year.\nIn Japan, 306 944 cases have been reported as of 2 Oct 2011, and In\nSingapore, 14 146 cases have been reported as of 1 Oct 2011.\n\nBig cities are facing the danger of HFMD outbreaks as more and more\nHFMD cases from other provinces rush to hospitals in big cities. In Ho\nChi Minh City [HCM], although the number of HFMD infections has not\nincreased since peak months (May-August), the number of child patients\nat Children's Hospital 1 has seen no decrease. The hospital's\nInfectious Diseases Department is always overloaded, with an average\n150 child patients a day, mostly from other provinces. Dr. Truong Huu\nKhanh, chief of the Infectious Diseases Department, said there were\ndays when more than 80 percent of child patients admitted to the\nhospital were from other provinces. 'The provinces with the most\npatients include Ben Tre, Tien Giang, Long An, Tay Ninh, Binh Phuoc,\nBinh Duong and Ba Ria-Vung Tau,' he said.\n\nAt HCMC Children's Hospital 2, an estimated 110-130 HFMD cases are\nbeing reported a day, with 50-60 percent of patients coming from other\nprovinces.\n\n'The workload for doctors in big cities is so big that they can make\nmistakes, which are sometimes paid for with the patients' lives,' said\na doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity. According to doctors,\nHFMD patients rush to big cities because provincial hospitals do not\nhave enough medical staff and equipment to treat serious cases.\nProvincial hospitals also don't cover drug fees for HFMD patients\nunder age 6, while HCMC does. According to Khanh, 10 percent of HFMD\nchild patients at the Children's Hospital 1 must be treated with\ngammaglobulin.\n\nDr. Nguyen Dac Tho, deputy director of the HCMC Center for Preventive\nMedicine, warned that the rising number of HFMD patients from other\nprovinces rushing to city-based hospitals could help spread the\ndisease. Dr. Tran Phu Manh Sieu, the center's director, said the risk\nof the disease spreading to new communities was very high. 'HFMD child\npatients may spread the virus to other patients, and adults and\nchildren who share the hospitals' canteens and toilets may contract\nthe virus.

The disease causes fever and blister-like\neruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. The disease usually begins\nwith a fever, poor appetite, malaise, and often with a sore throat.\nOne or 2 days after fever onset, painful sores usually develop in the\nmouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often\nbecome ulcers. The sores are usually located on the tongue, gums, and\ninside of the cheeks. A non-itchy skin rash develops over 1 to 2 days.\nThe rash has flat or raised red spots, sometimes with blisters. The\nrash is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the\nfeet; it may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia. A person\nwith HFMD may have only the rash or only the mouth sores.\n\nHFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_ which\nincludes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and\nenteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 has been the most common cause of\nHFMD in the North America, and other coxsackieviruses have been\nassociated with the illness elsewhere. In recent years Human\nenterovirus 71 have been associated with outbreaks of HFMD in\nSouth-East Asia responsible for more serious disease accompanied by\nencephalitis in some children. The above report reveals that this more\nserous form of HFMD, and associated encephalitis, is increasing in\nprevalence in Viet Nam.\n\nVery recently Tran CB, Nguyen HT, Phan HT, Tran NV, Wills B, Farrar J,\nSantangelo JD, Simmons CP. have published a study of 'The\nseroprevalence and seroincidence of enterovirus 71 infection in\ninfants and children in Ho Chi Minh city, Viet Nam' (PLoS One.\n2011;6(7):e21116.

Coxsackievirus A16 has been the most\ncommon cause of HFMD in the United States in recent years, but other\ncoxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Other\nenteroviruses, such as enterovirus 71, have also been associated with\noutbreaks of HFMD, principally in Asia.\n\nIndividual cases and outbreaks of HFMD occur worldwide. In temperate\nclimates cases occur more often in summer and early autumn. HFMD\ncaused by coxsackievirus A16 infection is generally a mild disease,\nwith nearly all patients recovering in 7 to 10 days without medical\ntreatment. Since 1997, however, outbreaks of HFMD caused by\nenterovirus 71 have been reported in Asia and Australia. HFMD caused\nby enterovirus 71 has shown a higher incidence of neurologic\ninvolvement and fatal cases of encephalitis have occurred during\noutbreaks. However, such serious outcomes are still very rare.\n\nHFMD infection is spread from person to person by direct contact.\nInfectious virus is found in the nose and throat secretions, saliva,\nblister fluid and stool of infected persons. The virus is most often\nspread by persons with unwashed, virus-contaminated hands and by\ncontact with virus-contaminated surfaces. Infected persons are most\ncontagious during the 1st week of the illness, but may remain a source\nof infection for others after symptoms have resolved.\n\nComplications from virus infections that cause HFMD are uncommon;\n'aseptic' meningitis can occur rarely with HFMD causing fever,\nheadache, stiff neck, or back pain. Some patients may require\nhospitalization for a short time. Other more serious conditions, such\nas encephalitis, are very rare although encephalitis can be fatal.\nThere have been reports of fingernail and toenail loss occurring\nmostly in children within 4 weeks of having HFMD (see: ProMED-mail\npostings Onychomadesis, coxsackievirus - USA: (MI), RFI 20080729.2317;\nOnychomadesis - Spain: (Valencia), coxsackievirus 20080709.2099; and\nOnychomadesis - Spain: (Valencia), coxsackievirus (02) 20080711.2120).\nAt this time, it is not known whether the reported nail loss is or is\nnot a result of the infection.

A\ntotal of 11 cases of HFMD occurred in the childcare centre and another\n9 were reported from nearby areas in the district. Coxsackie A16 virus\n[CA16] was diagnosed in 13 clinical specimens obtained from 11\nsymptomatic and asymptomatic children. All cases resolved without\ncomplications.\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\nOn 2 Mar 2011, the Department of Epidemiology of Zagreb County\nInstitute of Public Health was contacted by a health professional from\na childcare centre in Bregana, Samobor district, reporting 4 children\nwith vesicular stomatitis and rash (hand-foot-mouth disease, HFMD) in\nthe weeks before. The centre cares for 160 children at 2 locations and\ncomprises 8 classes (7 classes in the main building complex and one\nclass in a house nearby). 3 cases were from one class at the 1st\nlocation and a 4th case was from the nearby house.\n\nOn the same day that the cases were reported, the epidemiologist\nfound another 2 children with the same symptoms in the same class of\nthe main building complex. The epidemiologist immediately reported the\ncases to the Reference Epidemiology Centre at the Croatian National\nInstitute of Public Health. The day after, mouth swabs and stools were\ncollected for viral culture from all children in the 2 affected\nclasses. After active case finding (parent questionnaire,\npaediatrician reports), another 5 cases were found in other classes of\nthe same childcare centre (11 cases in total). In this investigation,\nonly symptomatic individuals were considered as cases, irrespective of\nlaboratory-confirmation. All cases presented with a mild clinical\npicture of disease, with no complications, and only 4 of the 11\nchildren attending the childcare centre stayed at home until they\nrecovered. The affected classes were neither closed, nor were infected\nchildren separated. The management of the childcare centre was rather\ninstructed to carry out an extensive cleaning and disinfection of all\nsurfaces, toys, furnishings, toilets, and other objects, while parents\nwere given written materials on disease transmission and how to avoid\nit. No further cases occurred in the childcare centre after 14 Mar\n2011.\n\nThe epidemiologist also identified 9 cases, outside the childcare\ncentre, retrospectively by active case finding. These cases were also\npreschool children, aged 1 to 4 years, living in the Samobor district,\nwhich comprises about 43 000 inhabitants. The 9 cases were all\ndiagnosed by 4 primary care paediatricians taking care of most of the\nchildren in the area. After the outbreak in the childcare centre was\nrecognised, the epidemiologist in charge of the investigation checked\nwith them all the records and asked to report further cases. None of\nthe cases outside the childcare centre were laboratory-investigated.\n\nHFMD is a syndrome characterised by vesicular stomatitis and\ncutaneous lesions of the distal extremities and it is usually caused\nby CA16 or enterovirus 71 (E71). These viruses are genetically closely\nrelated and are both serotypes of the human enterovirus A (HEV-A)\nspecies, _Picornaviridae_ family. HFMD has a worldwide occurrence.\nOutbreaks occur frequently among groups of children in childcare\ncentres and schools. Transmission is by faecal-oral route and by\nexposure to throat discharges or fluid from blisters. In the absence\nof cutaneous lesions, oral lesions of HFMD may be mistaken for\naphthous ulcers or herpes simplex gingivostomatitis. Although\ndescribed, neurologic complications of HFMD caused by CA16 are rare\nwhen compared to the disease caused by E71. Diagnosis of HFMD is\nusually based on the clinical picture alone. Laboratory diagnosis is\nusually performed by virus isolation of cell culture from throat swabs\nand stool specimens.\n\nEnterovirus infections are notifiable diseases in Croatia. Usually,\nthere are few reports of sporadic cases of HFMD each year, diagnosed\nbased on the clinical picture alone. There are also several different\nserotypes of enteroviruses isolated in Croatia each year but\nlaboratory confirmed cases caused by CA16 virus have not been\nregistered until now.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nCA16 and E71 are prevalent in many parts of the world, especially in\nsouth-east Asia, but also in European countries. In Croatia CA16\ninfections have not been documented until now, although these occur in\nneighbouring countries. The traditional technique for detecting and\ncharacterising enteroviruses, also used in this laboratory, relies on\nviral isolation in cell culture followed by neutralisation using\nreference antisera. However, no single cell line exists that is\ncapable of growing all human enteroviruses. In 2004, RD(A) cells were\nintroduced into the routine laboratory diagnostic algorithm for\nenterovirus culture together with previously used GMK and L20B cells.\nThis has resulted in the detection of HEV-A viruses including CA16 and\nE71, which grow poorly, if at all, in the other 2 cell lines used in\nour laboratory. Immediate collection of clinical specimens by the\nepidemiologist during the investigation of this outbreak also\ncontributed to the successful isolation of CA16.\n\nCA16 and E71 are associated with sporadic cases and outbreaks of\nHFMD, and rare cases of acute neurological diseases. The HFMD outbreak\nreported here confirmed the previously observed characteristics of\nCA16 infection. An outbreak occurred in a childcare centre in children\naged 1.5 to 5.5 years, who seem to be the most susceptible age group\nfor CA16 infection. A seroprevalence study in Germany showed that 2/3\nof children aged 1 to 4 years do not posses neutralising antibodies to\nCA16. HFMD is a highly contagious disease, but the manifestation rate\nof infection is low. A large number of exposed children in this\noutbreak were infected as by laboratory confirmation (11/35). Most of\nthe infected children were asymptomatic (8/11). The illness is usually\nmild without complications, as confirmed during this outbreak. The\nnumber of positive stool specimens versus throat swabs in symptomatic\nas well as asymptomatic children in this report confirmed that stool\nis the most appropriate clinical specimen for enteroviruses in which\nthey survive for a long period.\n\nIn conclusion, a prompt reaction of the Epidemiology Service and the\nthorough investigation that followed, allowed the successful\nimplementation of control measures, which prevented further spreading\nof the HFMD outbreak in the childcare centre. CA16 appeared to have\nbeen circulating in the Samobor area from February [2011], but as\nsymptoms are mild or absent in most cases, many parents may not have\nsought medical help for their children.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Readers are recommended to read the full text via the source URL\nabove to view the data and literature references.\n\nCoxsackie viruses are separable into 2 groups, A and B, based on\ntheir effects on newborn mice (coxsackie A results in muscle injury,\nparalysis, and death; coxsackie B results in organ damage but less\nsevere outcomes). Type A viruses cause herpangina (painful blisters in\nthe mouth, throat, hands, feet, or in all these areas).\nHand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is the common name of this viral\ninfection. Coxsackie A 16 causes the majority of HFMD infections in\nEurope and the Americas. It usually occurs in children (age 10 and\nunder), but adults can also develop the condition. Type A also causes\nconjunctivitis (inflammation of the eyelids and white area of the\neye). Type B viruses cause epidemic pleurodynia (fever, lung, and\nabdominal pain with headache that lasts about 2 to 12 days and\nresolves). Pleurodynia is also termed Bornholm disease.\n\nBoth types of viruses (A and B) can cause meningitis, myocarditis,\nand pericarditis, but these occur infrequently from coxsackie\ninfections. Infection usually is spread by fecal-oral contamination,\nalthough occasionally the virus is spread by droplets expelled by\ninfected individuals. Items like utensils, diaper-changing tables, and\ntoys that come in contact with body fluids that contain the virus may\nalso transmit them to other individuals. Although people of any age\ncan get infected, the majority of patients identified with coxsackie\ninfection are children (see MedicineNet.com\nhttp://www.medicinenet.com/coxsackie_virus/article.htm).\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Croatia can be accessed\nat http://healthmap.org/r/0TZG. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE - CROATIA: (ZAGREB) CHILDCARE CENTRE\n******************************************************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n On 2 Mar 2011, the Department of Epidemiology of Zagreb County\nInstitute of Public Health was contacted by a health professional from\na childcare centre in Bregana, Samobor district, reporting 4 children\nwith vesicular stomatitis and rash (hand-foot-mouth disease, HFMD) in\nthe weeks before. The\nnumber of positive stool specimens versus throat swabs in symptomatic\nas well as asymptomatic children in this report confirmed that stool\nis the most appropriate clinical specimen for enteroviruses in which\nthey survive for a long period. The management of the childcare centre was rather\ninstructed to carry out an extensive cleaning and disinfection of all\nsurfaces, toys, furnishings, toilets, and other objects, while parents\nwere given written materials on disease transmission and how to avoid\nit. All cases presented with a mild clinical\npicture of disease, with no complications, and only 4 of the 11\nchildren attending the childcare centre stayed at home until they\nrecovered. \n\nCoxsackie viruses are separable into 2 groups, A and B, based on\ntheir effects on newborn mice (coxsackie A results in muscle injury,\nparalysis, and death; coxsackie B results in organ damage but less\nsevere outcomes). CA16 appeared to have\nbeen circulating in the Samobor area from February [2011], but as\nsymptoms are mild or absent in most cases, many parents may not have\nsought medical help for their children. In conclusion, a prompt reaction of the Epidemiology Service and the\nthorough investigation that followed, allowed the successful\nimplementation of control measures, which prevented further spreading\nof the HFMD outbreak in the childcare centre. There are also several different\nserotypes of enteroviruses isolated in Croatia each year but\nlaboratory confirmed cases caused by CA16 virus have not been\nregistered until now. Although people of any age\ncan get infected, the majority of patients identified with coxsackie\ninfection are children (see MedicineNet.com\nhttp://www.medicinenet.com/coxsackie_virus/article.htm). The traditional technique for detecting and\ncharacterising enteroviruses, also used in this laboratory, relies on\nviral isolation in cell culture followed by neutralisation using\nreference antisera. After active case finding (parent questionnaire,\npaediatrician reports), another 5 cases were found in other classes of\nthe same childcare centre (11 cases in total). \n\n\nOutbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease caused by coxsackie A16 virus in\na childcare centre in Croatia, February to March 2011\n An outbreak occurred in a childcare centre in children\naged 1.5 to 5.5 years, who seem to be the most susceptible age group\nfor CA16 infection. A\ntotal of 11 cases of HFMD occurred in the childcare centre and another\n9 were reported from nearby areas in the district. After the outbreak in the childcare centre was\nrecognised, the epidemiologist in charge of the investigation checked\nwith them all the records and asked to report further cases. The centre cares for 160 children at 2 locations and\ncomprises 8 classes (7 classes in the main building complex and one\nclass in a house nearby). On the same day that the cases were reported, the epidemiologist\nfound another 2 children with the same symptoms in the same class of\nthe main building complex. These cases were also\npreschool children, aged 1 to 4 years, living in the Samobor district,\nwhich comprises about 43 000 inhabitants. The 9 cases were all\ndiagnosed by 4 primary care paediatricians taking care of most of the\nchildren in the area. The day after, mouth swabs and stools were\ncollected for viral culture from all children in the 2 affected\nclasses. Usually,\nthere are few reports of sporadic cases of HFMD each year, diagnosed\nbased on the clinical picture alone. The epidemiologist immediately reported the\ncases to the Reference Epidemiology Centre at the Croatian National\nInstitute of Public Health. Laboratory diagnosis is\nusually performed by virus isolation of cell culture from throat swabs\nand stool specimens. \n\nHFMD is a syndrome characterised by vesicular stomatitis and\ncutaneous lesions of the distal extremities and it is usually caused\nby CA16 or enterovirus 71 (E71). \n\nBoth types of viruses (A and B) can cause meningitis, myocarditis,\nand pericarditis, but these occur infrequently from coxsackie\ninfections. In this investigation,\nonly symptomatic individuals were considered as cases, irrespective of\nlaboratory-confirmation.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hand, foot and mouth disease"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2004-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-02-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Croatia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Zagreb", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bregana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pleurodynia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Zagreb County", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "540636", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hand, foot & mouth disease (08): Thailand", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=540636", "date": "2010-09-28 23:50:00", "main_text": "HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE (08): THAILAND\n*******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Mon 27 Sep 2010\nSource: National News Bureau of Thailand (NNT), Public Relations\nDepartment [edited]\n<http://thainews.prd.go.th/en/news.php?id=255309270009>\n\n\nThe Ministry of Public Health has ordered the provincial public health\noffices to monitor the spread of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) after\nover 10 000 patients have been infected so far this year [2010].\nAccording to Deputy Public Health Minister Dr Phansiri Kullanartsiri,\na change from the rainy season to the winter has provided a climate\nsuitable for HFMD spread. 90 percent of the patients are infants aged\nless than 5 due to their low immunity.

In Shanghai there has been a\n40 percent increase in cases compared to 2009 with 13 371 cases, 67\nsevere cases and 2 deaths reported cumulatively in 2010. The majority\nof cases in China are being reported from rural communities.\n\nConsequently, currently available data indicate that there is an\nincreased activity of HFMD in the region, with a higher incidence and\nan earlier start of the epidemic season. Also, surveillance data from\nJapan suggests that there is an increased proportion of HFMD cases\ncaused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection compared to previous years.\n\nThe reasons for the current unusual epidemiological picture of HFMD\n(and specifically EV71 in Japan) are not well understood. The methods\nused in Asian countries for surveillance of HFMD, as well as the\nprotocols for laboratory confirmation and testing do vary between\ncountries. Furthermore it is not known to what extent different\ncountries have recently adapted and/or strengthened their surveillance\nfor HFMD which could mean that the current observed increase is simply\ndue to a surveillance artefact. In order to fully understand the\ncurrent epidemiological picture of HFMD in the Asian region it would\nbe important to know the proportion of HFMD cases that are positive\nfor EV71 as well as the type of EV71 virus that is the dominant\ncirculating strain.\n\nEV71 infections in Europe have been successively caused by viruses of\nsub-genogroups B0, B1 and B2. A genogroup shift occurred in 1987,\nafter which viruses of subgenogroups C1 and C2 were detected\nexclusively. This is distinct from the situation in the Asian Pacific\nregion, where EV71 subgenogroups B3-B5 and C4-C5 have caused large\noutbreaks since 1997 (see van der Sanden et al, J Gen Virol 2010 Aug;\n91(Pt 8): 1949-58\n<http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/8/1949>).\n\nThere are existing gaps in the knowledge about HFMD that [if they\ncould be filled] would contribute to a better understanding of the\nsituation, including:\n\n1. Seasonality: even though most Asian countries have annual epidemics\nof HFMD, it is not well understood what factors are triggering the\nepidemics to start earlier (as confirmed by Japan in the present year).\n\n2. Cyclical nature of the disease: some countries have suggested a\ncyclical nature of the outbreaks every 2-3 years. The last large\noutbreaks of HFMD in SE Asia occurred in 2008, and therefore the\noutbreaks this year (2010) could confirm such a cyclical pattern.\n\nFor a map of the provinces of Viet Nam see\n<http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/VietnameseProvincesMap.png>.

The ministry vowed to further enhance medical\nresponses, particularly in vast countryside areas, to curb the raging epidemic.\n\nAs of Tue 22 Jun 2010 the common viral epidemic among children has\nsickened nearly 987 779 on the Chinese mainland. Of that total, 537\ndied. The majority of those who have gotten ill are younger than 3\nyears of age, said Wang Zijun, deputy director of the emergency\nresponse office under the Chinese Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC), at a press conference.\n\nThe epidemic control situation is grave in the country as the number\nof deaths caused by the disease stood at only 186 in the same period\nlast year, Wang said. 'Rural doctors, who are less experienced than\ntheir urban counterparts in treating the infection, are finding it\ndifficult to make timely diagnoses of the infection, with no lab\nscreening capacity at grassroots-level facilities,' said Lu Lianhe,\nveteran infectious disease doctor of the Beijing Ditan Hospital. A\nlate diagnosis might delay effective treatment for the disease,\nwhich, in rare cases, can cause deadly complications like\nencephalitis, he said.\n\nUsually, the infected person recovers without medication in 7 to 10\ndays, experts said. Relatively poor awareness of public hygiene and\nmedical care among the rural population is also to blame for the\nhigher fatality rate there, Wang said, urging parents there to\npractice better hygiene.\n\nAmong the fatal cases, about 92 percent were caused by enterovirus 71\n(EV71), which, like other strains [species of enteroviruses] such as\nthe polioviruses, coxsackieviruses and echoviruses, can cause the\n[same symptoms], Wang said. To address that issue, the CDC planned to\nintroduce a quick test kit for EV71 among rural doctors to help\nfacilitate early detection, according to Wang. 'Early detection and\ntreatment are the key to averting death,' he said. Also, the Ministry\nhas been busy training all rural doctors in the nation for better\nHFMD response, said Yang Jinrui, deputy director of the Ministry's\ninformation office.\n\nThe task will be completed by the end of June [2010], according to\nYang. Previously, treatment guidelines for HFMD had been distributed\nto all medical facilities across the country. In truth, apart from an\nunbalanced outbreak response between rural and urban areas in China,\nthe long-existing gap in health conditions of minors is also\nwidening, experts warned. The prevalence of stunted growth among\nrural children younger than 5 is 17.3 percent, nearly 4 times that of\nurban children, official statistics show. 'And the gap shows no signs\nof shrinking,' said Song Wenxiu, divisional director of the National\nWorking Committee on Children and Women under the State Council.\nAlso, they are more susceptible to incidents such as the fake milk\npowder, she said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HFMD) is a common viral illness of infants and children. The disease\ncauses fever and blister-like eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin\nrash. In recent years, coxsackievirus A16, enterovirus 71, and the\ncoxsackievirus B viruses have been implicated most often. Less-common\ncauses include echovirus, parechovirus 1, adenovirus, and herpes\nsimplex virus (HSV).\n\nInfection is spread from person to person by direct contact with\ninfectious virus. Infectious virus is found in the nose and throat\nsecretions, saliva, blister fluid, and stool of infected persons. The\nvirus is most often spread by persons with unwashed, virus-\ncontaminated hands and by contact with virus-contaminated surfaces.\nInfected persons are most contagious during the 1st week of the\nillness. Everyone who has not already been infected with an\nenterovirus that causes HFMD is at risk of infection.\n\nEnterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged also as a major cause of\nneurological threat following the eradication of poliovirus. Most\nEV71 infections commonly result in hand, foot and mouth disease but\nsome cases are associated with brainstem encephalitis and acute\nflaccid paralysis. Mortality has been high high in EV71 brainstem\nencephalitis complicated with pulmonary edema, particularly in\nchildren below 5 years of age. Destruction of vasomotor in the\nbrainstem by EV71 produces autonomic nervous system dysregulation\nprior to the pulmonary edema. The pulmonary edema is the result of\nincreased pulmonary vascular permeability caused by the direct\nbrainstem lesions and/or a systemic inflammatory response syndrome\nproduced by the release of cytokines and chemokines.\n\nThere is currently no specific antiviral agent to treat or vaccine to\nprevent EV71 diseases. Treating severe EV71 brainstem encephalitis\npatients with intravenous IgG and milrinone is associated with\nsignificantly decreased mortality by attenuated sympathetic activity\nand cytokine production (recently reviewed by Wang SM, Liu CC.

Dr\nTruong Huu Khanh, head of the Infection and Neurology Department at\nChildren's Hospital No 1, said that nearly 20 children were\nhospitalized due to HFMD in the past 3 days [in March 2010], which\nbrings the total number of infected children to 39. According to\nKhanh, 28 of the cases involve serious nerve complications that\nrequire special treatment. More than 60 percent of the patients live\nin the city, while the rest come from neighbouring areas.\n\nDr Tran Van Thao, deputy head of Children Hospital No 2, said the\nhospital received 32 children with HFMD, an increase of 50 percent\nduring the last week [in March 2010]. An 18-month-old baby was\nreported to have been in critical condition and died 20 hours after\nbeing hospitalized. The peak season of the illness is between April\nand May. However, early hot weather has led to a sudden onset of\nillness among children. EV71 [enterovirus 71] is known to cause high\nfever with blisters appearing on the mouth, palms, or on the soles of\nthe feet. Doctors have warned that it's easy to misdiagnose the\ndisease as scabies. Parents should take their children to hospital\nimmediately if they are showing symptoms to avoid complications, such\nas heart failure, lung swelling, or brain damage. Currently, there are\nno vaccines or specific remedies to cure the disease, according to the\ndoctor.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPRO/MBDS <promed-mbds@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of\ninfants and children. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the\ngenus _Enterovirus_. This genus of viruses includes polioviruses,\ncoxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16\nhas been the most common cause of HFMD, but other coxsackieviruses\nhave been associated with the illness. In recent outbreaks in Asia and\nAustralasia, enterovirus 71 has more often been associated with HFMD\nand linked with rare neurological complications of infection. The\nvirus responsible for the current outbreaks in South East Asia has not\nyet been identified, but the occurrence of neurological cases in Viet\nNam suggests that enterovirus 71 may be present.\n\nHFMD occurs mainly in children under 10 years old but can also occur\nin adults. Children are more likely to be at risk for infection and\nillness because they are less likely than adults to have antibodies to\nprotect them.

On 10 Mar 2010, a toddler boy from Daxijiang Township\ndied in the Quanzhou County People's Hospital with blood and some foam\ncoming out of his mouth. The outbreak of his symptoms had only begun 3 days\nbefore.

By: E Haneke. At: Dermatology Practice 'Dermaticum,'\nFreiburg, Germany; Department of Dermatology, Inselspital, University\nof Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Dermatology Centre 'Epidermis;' Instituto\nCUF, Porto, Portugal; Department of Dermatology, Academic Hospital,\nUniversity of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium\n\nOnychomadesis is the spontaneous separation of the nail plate from\nthe matrix, a kind of proximal onycholysis, and is a common\nphenomenon due to arrest of nail formation for a certain period.\nShort-term slowing down of nail formation leads to Beau's lines,\nwhile long-term stop of nail growth will cause onychomadesis and even\nnail shedding.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a relatively common viral\ninfection often seen as small epidemics in autumn or spring [In fact,\nin south-east Asian countries, epidemics of HFMDV characteristically\ninvolve large numbers of infants, are socially disruptive, and\nresponsible for a number of fatalities. - Mod.CP]. It is\ncharacterised by oval blisters around the nails, on palms and soles\nwith the long axis of the vesicles running along the dermatoglyphs,\nand by aphthoid small ulcerations of the oral mucosa. Small children\nare mostly infected, but probably many parents are non-symptomatic\ncarriers as the condition usually runs a very mild course.\n\nA relationship between HFMD and onychomadesis has been proposed\nalready 10 years ago [1,2], but only recently Finnish and Spanish\nauthors observed a sufficient number of children developing\nonychomadesis approximately 6 weeks after they had suffered from HFMD\n[3-6] that makes this appear more than a chance association. An\narticle by Guimbao and coworkers published in today's [16 Sep 2010]\nissue of Eurosurveillance [see (2) below] describes an outbreak of\nonychomadesis in Saragossa (Spain) in July 2008 [7]. The authors\nnoticed that a large proportion of the patients had had HFMD a few\nweeks before and initiated a retrospective cohort study that\nindicated a link between the 2 diseases. They conclude that\nonychomadesis may be a late complication of HFMD.\n\nFrom these authors' and the previous ones' observations, there is no\ndoubt that there is a temporal link between HFMD and onychomadesis.\n\nThe question is now: Is the virus, more specifically the enterovirus\ncausing HFMD, really the cause of onychomadesis? While the number of\nonchomadesis cases in these young patients suggests it, could it have\nbeen caused rather by the inflammation so close to the nail matrix?\nOr could it have been due -- of course much less likely -- to\nintensive hygienic measures taken after HFMD broke out in the\nnurseries? It is well known that maceration favours Candida\ninfections and allergic contact dermatitis, which can also cause\nonychomadesis [8]. The timing of viral determination from stools and\npharynx samples taken one to 3 weeks after the diagnosis of\nonychomadesis and thus between 7-9 weeks after the disease, appears\nto be very late considering that HFMD is a self-limited condition\nhealing spontaneously within a week. In order to solve the problem,\nmore viruses that could potentially be associated with the 2\nconditions will need to be analysed, with viral analyses of nail\nspecimens!\n(e.g. swabs from under the proximal nail fold) performed in the\nearly course of the disease.\n\nHowever, onychomadesis per se is certainly not infectious; instead,\nit may be the consequence of an infectious disease often localised\nvery close to the nail. Another explanation would be that HFMD has a\nmore severe impact on the general condition of the small children so\nthat it causes a nail growth arrest for a period sufficiently long to\nresult in onychomadesis.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Clementz GC, Mancini AJ.

Some of the cases had previously\nsuffered from hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). In order to study\nthe outbreak and to determine the relation between the 2 diseases, 2\nepidemiological studies were conducted: a descriptive study focused\non cases and a retrospective cohort study. Samples from stool,\npharynx and nails were obtained from cases for microbiological\nanalysis. During the study period, 27 children fulfilled the case\ndefinition. The average age was 1.8 years. A case shed on average 4\nnails (minimum one, maximum 12). 24 of the 27 cases had previously\npresented with HFMD which started an average of 40 days before the\nonset of onychomadesis (relative risk: 14). Unidentified non-polio\nenterovirus (n=10), coxsackie B1 (n=4) and coxsackie B2 virus (n=3)\nwere isolated in 28 specimens obtained from 14 cases. The analysis\nshowed a strong association between HMFD and onycho!\nmadesis.

An\narticle by Guimbao and coworkers published in today's [16 Sep 2010]\nissue of Eurosurveillance [see (2) below] describes an outbreak of\nonychomadesis in Saragossa (Spain) in July 2008 Those\ncaused by enterovirus 71 have occurred more frequently in Southeast\nAsia in recent years, but onychomadesis has not been reported as a\ncomplication of HFMD in these epidemic. The authors\nnoticed that a large proportion of the patients had had HFMD a few\nweeks before and initiated a retrospective cohort study that\nindicated a link between the 2 diseases. It is\ncharacterised by oval blisters around the nails, on palms and soles\nwith the long axis of the vesicles running along the dermatoglyphs,\nand by aphthoid small ulcerations of the oral mucosa.

Short-term slowing down of nail formation leads to Beau's lines,\nwhile long-term stop of nail growth will cause onychomadesis and even\nnail shedding. However, onychomadesis per se is certainly not infectious; instead,\nit may be the consequence of an infectious disease often localised\nvery close to the nail. The diversity of enteroviruses associated with HFMD and the time\nlapse between the acute disease and the appearance of onychomadesis\nmake it difficult to confirm an association. 24 of the 27 cases had previously\npresented with HFMD which started an average of 40 days before the\nonset of onychomadesis (relative risk: 14). While the number of\nonchomadesis cases in these young patients suggests it, could it have\nbeen caused rather by the inflammation so close to the nail matrix? \nSummary: In July 2008, an onychomadesis outbreak in a nursery setting\nwas reported in Saragossa (Spain).

It is well known that maceration favours Candida\ninfections and allergic contact dermatitis, which can also cause\nonychomadesis [8]. Small children\nare mostly infected, but probably many parents are non-symptomatic\ncarriers as the condition usually runs a very mild course. Or could it have been due -- of course much less likely -- to\nintensive hygienic measures taken after HFMD broke out in the\nnurseries?

A 12\nmonth old girl died of a brain inflammation on Tuesday last week [5 May\n2009] after being infected with enterovirus 71 (EV-71), a strong\n[virulent?] intestinal virus, said Jun Byung-yul, a senior official of the\nKorea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCaused by intestinal viruses coxsackie A virus and enterovirus 71, the\nhuman syndrome [hand, foot, and mouth disease] is a common childhood\ndisease that mainly affects children under the age of 5 during the summer\nand early autumn months. Early symptoms of the disease are similar to those\nof ordinary flu such as a fever and a sore throat. Even though there is no\nspecific vaccine for the disease, most patients recover in a week without\nmedical treatment. However, in severe cases, patients can suffer from\nneurological complications such as brain inflammation and meningitis,\nsometimes leading to death.\n\nThere have been some cases where children infected with the coxsackie A\nvirus have had complications in Korea. But it is the 1st time for the\nenterovirus 71, which has killed more than 80 children in China since last\nmonth [April 2009], to be found in the country.\n\n'Because the girl had never been to China and other South East Asian\ncountries where the virus has thrived in recent years, we think the virus\nhas already been localized in this country after being transferred from\nChina,' Jun said. It is possible the virus is [responsible for] some deaths\nof children who died of brain inflammation or meningitis [in South Korea]\nin recent years, Jun said.\n\nDespite the worsening situation in and out of the country, health\nauthorities said they do not know the exact number of children infected\nwith the EV-17 because the disease is not a legally designated infectious\ndisease monitored by the government. According to recent government\nfigures, which were offered by 186 sample pediatrics in the latest 19\nweeks, the number of patients seems to be increasing. However, the outbreak\nis not large enough to be considered an epidemic, health officials said.\n\n'Some fatal cases in China are considered because children in some regions\nwere malnourished and couldn't be supported by the better medical system,'\nJun said. 'We will launch a monitoring system on the outbreak situation of\nthe disease in cooperation with related medical organization, especially in\nSuwon, Gyeonggi Province, where the nation's 1st fatal case was found,' he\nadded.\n\nExperts say intestinal viruses usually thrive in warm weather, causing\nhand, foot and mouth disease in April and other complications in May until\nthe rainy season starts in June. 'The disease passes easily among children\nthrough blisters on their hands, feet, and buttocks. So child care centers\nand kindergartens need to take greater care in cleaning surfaces of\nchildren's stuff,' said Kim Dong-soo, a podiatrist at Severance Children's\nHospital. 'There's no special way to prevent the infection. Children and\ntheir parents themselves should follow hygiene rules such as drinking\nboiled water only, brushing teeth whenever necessary and avoiding\ncontacting with too many people,' Kim advised.\n\nMeanwhile, the government's [delayed] announcement of the fatal case, which\noccurred 10 days earlier, was criticized by the media and the public.\n'There was some miscommunication among health officials in reporting the\ncase to upper authorities. I apologize for confusing people about the\ncase,' said Jun, who is in charge of disease prevention and control\nincluding the latest H1N1 influenza.\n\n[byline: Lee Ji-yoon]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This appears to be the 1st fatal case of hand, foot and mouth disease\namong children in South Korea so far this year (2009). It is likely that\nthe disease is widespread in South Korea and has escaped attention because\nfatalities are rare in such outbreaks. It is likely that there will be more\ncases since transmission of hand-foot-mouth disease increases in\nprevalence, as do all enterovirus infections, with the onset of summer weather.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of South Korea can be accessed at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/00cd>. - Mod.CP]\n\n[see also\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (09): (SD) 20090505.1678\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (08): (ZJ) fatal 20090410.1385\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (07): (HE, SD) 20090408.1357\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (06): (SD) 20090404.1304\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (05) 20090401.1257\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (04): (HE, SD) 20090327.1194\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (SD) 20090324.1154\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (02): (HE), RFI 20090318.1099\nHand, foot & mouth disease - China (Hong Kong S.A.R.) 20090312.1023]\n\n.................cp/mj/sh\n\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

HFMD is common among infants and\nchildren, and most of the recently reported cases have occurred in\nchildren.\n\nThe disease is very contagious and is spread through contact with the\nbody fluids of an infected person, such as droplets from coughs and\nsneezes, saliva, blister fluid, or stool.\n\nChina\n-----\nOn 10 Apr 2009, China's Ministry of Health Information Office reported\nthat 54 713 cases of HFMD had been detected through the end of March\n2009. Most of these cases were in rural areas. The provinces and\nregions most affected by this outbreak are the central provinces of\nHenan, Jiangsu, Guangxi, Anhui, Guangdong, Hebei, Hunan, Zhejiang,\nHubei, and the eastern province of Shandong. As of 30 Mar 2009, the\nChinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC)\nconfirmed that at least 19 children have died from HFMD this year\n[2009].\n\nThe Chinese government has enhanced its surveillance, prevention, and\ncontrol activities, along with training of local medical staff to\nidentify and report cases promptly.\n\nHong Kong S.A.R.\n----------------\nAs of 27 Mar 2009, the Center for Health Protection of Hong Kong has\nconfirmed one case of HFMD. Nine other children who were exposed at\nthe nursery where the ill child attended also developed HFMD symptoms.\nThis is the 7th case reported to the Center for Health Protection of\nHong Kong this year [2009].\n\nSingapore\n---------\nAs of 11 Apr 2009, Singapore's Ministry of Health has reported 5471\ncases of HFMD infections this year [2009]. Typically, Singapore\nexperiences annual peaks of HFMD from March to May.\n\nTaiwan\n------\nAs of 31 Mar 2009, the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention (Taiwan CDC) has reported 9 cases of HFMD with severe\ncomplications, all in children under 5 years of age. Two cases each\nwere located in the northern and central area of Taiwan, and 5\nadditional cases were located in the southern area of Taiwan.\n\nIn response to the growing number of reports of HFMD, other countries\nin the Western Pacific have increased surveillance for HFMD. When\navailable, further information on this evolving situation will be\nposted as an update to this notice.\n\nAdvice for Travelers\n--------------------\nNo vaccine is available to prevent HFMD. There is no specific\ntreatment for people who are sick with this disease other than\ntreating symptoms, such as fever. If you are sick and have fever while\nyou are traveling, be aware that some countries treat fever with a\nclass of medicine called pyrazolone that is banned in the United\nStates due to harmful side effects. This medicine may even be\navailable over-the-counter. CDC does not recommend using this class of\nmedicine to treat fever.\n\nIn general, because in some countries there is a risk that medications\nyou buy will be counterfeit, CDC recommends that you bring with you\nall the medications that you think you will need during your trip. You\nshould consider taking fever medicine with you to treat any symptoms\nif you plan to travel to any of these countries. Travelers can take\nsteps to prevent getting HFMD by practicing good personal hygiene. If\nyou are traveling, especially to areas where HFMD has been reported,\nfollow these tips for good health:\n\n- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially before you\neat, after you cough or sneeze, and after you go to the bathroom. If\nsoap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand gel (with\nat least 60 percent alcohol). Consider packing alcohol-based hand gel\nin your luggage to ensure you have it when needed.\n- Do not share eating utensils, such as forks, spoons, and cups.\n\nAdults should help child travelers to follow these recommendations.\nInfants, children, and adolescents are more susceptible to HFMD.\n\nHFMD is an illness caused by certain enterovirus strains, including\nEV71 [enterovirus 71], which are common worldwide. Outbreaks of HFMD\ncaused by EV71 are common and have been reported by countries\nthroughout the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. EV71 can be spread\nfrom person to person by direct contact with nose and throat\nsecretions (e.g., by coughing or sneezing), saliva, fluid from\nblisters, or the stool of infected persons. People who are sick with\nHFMD often experience symptoms such as fever, sores in the mouth, and\na rash, occasionally with blisters. HFMD caused by EV71 may sometimes\nlead to serious complications, including swelling of the brain\n(encephalitis). Most cases of HFMD occur in children under 10 years of\nage, but adults can also become infected.\n\nFor more information, see the CDC Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Fact sheet:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/enterovirus/hfhf.htm>.\n\n--\nCommunicated by\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Wed 3 Jun 2009\n If\nyou are traveling, especially to areas where HFMD has been reported,\nfollow these tips for good health:\n\n- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially before you\neat, after you cough or sneeze, and after you go to the bathroom.

'The situation of\npreventing and containing hand, foot and mouth\ndisease is very serious at the moment,' Deng\nHaihua, spokesman for China's health ministry,\nsaid last week. More cases are expected, as the\ndisease normally peaks between May and July. In\nthe absence of a drug treatment, the ministry is\nfocusing on prevention and containment.\n\nThe outbreak is the latest in a series to have\nhit China in recent years, caused by a\nfast-spreading virus called enterovirus 71. 'The\npersistence of enterovirus 71 outbreaks in China\nis a wake-up call,' says Jane Cardosa, a\nvirologist at the University Malaysia Sarawak in\nKota Samarahan. In 1997, Sarawak saw the 1st\noutbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease in the\nAsia-Pacific region. The disease causes flu-like\nsymptoms, along with rashes on the hands and\nfeet, and mouth ulcers. It can be caused by many\ntypes of human enterovirus belonging to the\nfamily _Picornaviridae_, which are mainly\ntransmitted through fecal or oral routes.\nAlthough normally mild, the disease can be\nlife-threatening: some viruses, particularly\nenterovirus 71, can cause inflammation of the\nbrain stem, resulting in heart failure and fluid accumulation in the lungs.\n\nIn 1997 in Sarawak, more than 2600 cases of the\ndisease were reported and 29 people died. The\nnext year in Taiwan, there were 129 000 reported\ncases and 78 deaths. In mainland China, the 1st\nreported case was in Shenzhen, Guangdong\nprovince, in 1999. At 1st, outbreaks were local\nand there were no reported fatalities. But since\n2004, the outbreaks have become more severe and\nwidespread, says Xu Wenbo, an infectious-disease\nexpert at the Beijing-based China Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn May 2008, the country's health ministry added\nhand, foot and mouth to its category 'C' of\nnotifiable diseases, meaning that all diagnosed\ncases must be reported through a national\nWeb-based system for disease surveillance, and\ntook measures to streamline reporting\nrequirements. The Ministry also vowed to take a\ntough stance against cover-ups and last month\n[fired] 4 health officials in Henan province for\nconcealing the number of infections and deaths.\n\nThis year, enterovirus 71 has caused nearly all\nof the laboratory-confirmed cases in 2 hot-spots,\nthe provinces of Henan and Shandong.\n\nXu suspects that the disease's increasing\nvirulence may be due to a genetic change in the\ncirculating virus strain. Before 2004 the\npredominant strain was called C4b; since then, a\ndifferent strain, C4a, has been most common (see:\nY. Zhang et al. J. Clin. Virol. 44, 262\u00ad267;\n2009). What caused this switch isn't clear, says\nXu, as little is known about the genetics and\ntransmission trends of the fast-mutating virus.\nMost studies have been clinical, aimed at, for\nexample, identifying the strains behind a given\noutbreak and the disease's clinical features,\nespecially when there are neurological\ncomplications. Many researchers say it is time to\nstep up efforts to understand the basic biology\nof enterovirus 71 to speed vaccine development.\n\nIn a major push financed by the Chinese Health\nMinistry and the Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Xu and his colleagues measured the\ninfection rate in adults and children during last\nyear's outbreak and analysed stool samples and\nthroat swabs taken from more than 18 000\npatients. Preliminary results suggest that the\ninfection rate is alarmingly high, meaning that\nthere are large populations of virus carriers who\ndo not show any symptoms of the disease.\n\nExperts are divided as to how worried the world\nshould be about the virus. Tom Solomon, a\nneurologist at the University of Liverpool, UK,\nargues that enterovirus 71 infection is\nunderappreciated on a global scale and may pose a\nbigger risk to public health than is currently\nthought. But Hans Troedsson, the World Health\nOrganization's representative in China, says\n'there is no cause for alarm.' The public-health\nimpact of hand, foot and mouth disease, including\ncases caused by enterovirus 71, is no more\nserious than other common childhood diseases, he\nsays. Troedsson thinks that the recent apparent\nincrease in enterovirus 71 infection might be due\nto higher reporting rates rather than an increase\nin disease prevalence. 'We will closely monitor\nthe situation and decide policies accordingly,' he says.\n\n[Byline: Jane Qiu]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This article provides a useful statement of the current situation and\nan indication of the extent of the epidemic.

This, he said, was based on the\ncycle of HFMD outbreaks, which have occurred every 3 years in the\nstate [Sarawak].

A programme by the\nSarawak Health Department and the Institute of Health and Community\nMedicine at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak discovered outbreaks of HFMD\nevery 3 years in 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006.\n\nThe outbreak in 1997 was due to EV71 [enterovirus 71], which killed\n30 children aged below 5 years. It was the 1st time that EV71 was\nrecognised in Malaysia. Wong said that, from [30 Dec 2007] to [18 Oct\n2008], 6666 cases were reported compared to 6332 for the\ncorresponding period last year [2007-08]. 'Kuching recorded the\nhighest number with 2417 cases followed by Miri (1027), Bintulu\n(828), and Sibu (761),' he said, adding that one death had been\nreported in Sibu.\n\nAs of 24 Oct [2008], a total of 52 kindergartens, child-care centres,\nand pre-schools had been served with closure orders or closed\nvoluntarily.

The disease\ncauses fever and blister-like eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin\nrash. Individual cases and outbreaks of HFMD occur worldwide. In\ntemperate climates, cases occur more often in summer and early\nautumn. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus\n_Enterovirus_, which includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses,\nechoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 has been the most\ncommon cause of HFMD, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated\nwith the illness. Since 1997, outbreaks of HFMD caused by enterovirus\n71 have been reported throughout Asia and in Australia.\n\nWhereas HFMD caused by coxsackievirus A16 infection is a mild\ndisease, with nearly all patients recovering in 7 to 10 days without\nmedical treatment, HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 has shown a higher\nincidence of neurologic involvement. Fatal cases of encephalitis\ncaused by enterovirus 71 have occurred during outbreaks.\n\nHFMD occurs mainly in children under 10 years of age but can also\noccur in adults. Children are more likely to be at risk of infection\nand illness because they lack protective antibodies. Infection\nprovides in immunity to the specific virus causing the disease, but a\n2nd infection may occur following exposure to a different enterovirus.\n\nPrevention depends on strict attention to hygiene. Vaccines are under\ndevelopment, particularly to control enterovirus 71 infection, but\nnone is currently available.\n\nSarawak is one of 2 Malaysian states on the island of Borneo.

This peak, though,\nusually affects fewer people than the 1st one from March to May, said\nDr. Lyn James, director of the Health Ministry's communicable\ndiseases division. The reasons for the peaks are not known.\n\nStill, the latest surge has already proven deadly. On 6 Aug 2008,\nSingapore registered its 1st death from HFMD [see: Hand, foot & mouth\ndisease - Asia (23): Singapore 20080808.2447] since a severe\noutbreak from 2000 to 2001 killed 7 children. Like most of those\nvictims, the 3-year-old child died from a severe form of HFMD caused by\na virus called EV71 [human enterovirus 71]. This virus has been of\nparticular concern to countries in Asia, which have been battling\noutbreaks of HFMD in recent years. This year, it has killed 44 in\nChina, 10 in Taiwan and 11 in Viet Nam.\n\nThe Health Ministry and the Regional Emerging Disease Intervention\n(Redi) Centre organised a 2-day regional forum on HFMD, which was\nattended by more than 80 scientists and public health officers from\n12 countries. At the forum's last day yesterday [25 Aug 2008], local\nvaccine company SingVax, Chinese vaccine company Sinovac Biotech and\nTaiwan's Centres for Disease Control gave updates on their progress\nin developing the world's first HFMD vaccine. Both SingVax and\nTaiwan's CDC said they have seen good results in the laboratories and\nhope to start clinical trials next year [2009].\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine, parents should ensure their children\nwash their hands, because the disease is often spread through saliva\nand faecal matter. They should also take their children to the doctor\nat the 1st sign of symptoms, and keep them away from schools and\ncrowded places, Dr. James said.\n\nMeanwhile, the school that the deceased child attended, Elias\nKindergarten in Woodlands, reopened earlier this week after a 10-day\nclosure to clean up. When The Straits Times visited yesterday, about\n20 to 30 children were in a queue waiting to have their teachers\ncheck their temperatures as well as hands and mouths to look for signs\nof HFMD.\n\n[Byline: Lee Hui Chieh and Ang Yiying]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As elsewhere in Asia the current outbreak of HFMD is predominantly a\nconsequence of enterovirus 71 infection.

A visit by The Straits\nTimes yesterday evening found the place quiet, with no parents or\nchildren to be seen.\n\nThe boy who died had fever, ulcers and a rash on Sunday [3 Aug 2008].\nHis family took him to a doctor, who diagnosed HFMD. On Monday, he\nstarted vomiting. By Wednesday, he was so ill that his family had to\nrush him to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), where he was\nsent straight to the intensive care unit. He became more alert after\nsome initial treatment, but continued throwing up. He later had\nseizures, a sign of encephalitis or inflammation of the brain lining\n-- a rare but severe complication associated with HFMD. Dr. Chong\nChia Yin, a senior consultant in infectious diseases at KKH, said the\nboy could not be resuscitated despite their best efforts.\n'Encephalitis patients can go downhill rapidly,' she said.\n\nIt happened to many of the 7 children who died of HFMD in the\n2000-2001 outbreak, the last time anyone here died here from the\ndisease. Like most of them, this boy was also infected with EV71\n[Human enterovirus 71], the deadliest of about 70 HFMD strains. The\nstrain is responsible for almost a 3rd of the more than 17 000\ninfections that hit children who develop this normally mild childhood disease.\n\nThe outbreak this year has raised some concerns because, compared\nwith the same period last year, there has been a 40 percent jump in\nthe number of children coming down with HFMD. As a precaution, the\nHealth Ministry has ordered child-care centres and kindergartens to\nclose when there is a large active cluster, or in this case, a death\nfrom the disease.\n\nHowever, the outbreak seems to be tailing off. Last week, only 392\nchildren caught the bug -- down from a high of more than 200 cases a\nday in April [2008]. There were 2 other severe cases this year.

It is known that pulmonary edema or\nhaemorrhage, which is a common complication, can kill a child within one\nday, therefore health workers all over the country have been working\naround-the-clock providing intensive care to patients in critical\ncondition. Largely owing credit to these efforts, no casualties have been\nreported to date.

Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS): this is a\nsyndromic surveillance system collecting ICD-9 data from over 150\nmajor emergency departments automatically. We use specific ICD-9 code\nsets to represent enterovirus infections. This system can help us to\ntrack the trend of the epidemic in real time.\nd.

Emergency treatment failed and he died a few hours\nlater, according to the bureau.\n\nThe child, a native of north China's Henan Province, lived with his\nfamily in the Songjiang District of Shanghai, said a bureau\nstatement. Medical experts were still studying the case.\n\nShanghai reported 10 340 HFMD cases in the first 5 months [of 2008].\nThe city is not on the Health Ministry's list of the regions worst\nhit by the epidemic. The ministry reported earlier last week that\nthere were more than 176 000 HFMD cases reported nationwide last\nmonth [May 2008].

HFMD is common among infants and children. It is very\ncontagious and is spread through direct contact with the nose and\nthroat secretions, saliva, blister fluid, or stool of an infected\nperson. A large number of cases in the current outbreaks of HFMD in\nAsia are reportedly caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71). However, other\nstrains of enterovirus can also cause HFMD.\n\nIn addition to the countries listed below, other countries in the\nWestern Pacific have also increased surveillance for HFMD. [The\navailable statistics as of Thu 3 Jul 2008 are listed below]\n\nChina\n-----\nOn 16 Jun 2008, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\n(China CDC) posted a notice confirming that the HFMD outbreak peaked\non 14 May 2008, and is now in decline. According to Ministry of\nHealth spokesman Mao Qun'an, although over 176 000 cases were\nreported last month [June 2008], the number of daily reported cases\ndecreased from 11 501 during the outbreak's peak to 3922 by 5 Jun\n2008.\n\nThe provinces which have been most affected by this outbreak are\nGuangdong, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, and Hunan. A joint report from\nChina CDC and the Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) in\nChina, released 19 May 2008, states that cases have also occurred in\nother provinces, including Anhui, Hebei, Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu,\nJiangxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan, and in the municipalities of\nBeijing and Chongqing. As of 16 Jun 2008, over 370 cases have also\nbeen reported in Macau SAR, according to China CDC.\n\nOf the HFMD cases reported in China, most were in children 5 years of\nage and younger, and of those tested in laboratories, the majority\nwere caused by EV71.\n\nThe Chinese government has enhanced its surveillance, prevention, and\ncontrol activities, including implementing a public awareness\ncampaign and monitoring water quality.\n\nChina (Hong Kong SAR)\n---------------------\nAs of 2 Jul 2008, a total of 100 cases of HFMD have been reported in\nHong Kong, with 66 (66 percent) of the cases caused by EV71.\n\nSingapore\n---------\nAs of 2 Jul 2008, the Ministry of Health in Singapore has reported a\ntotal of 15 776 cases. Since the end of May [2008] the number of\ncases reported each week has been decreasing. Of these, none had\nserious complications and none were fatal. As of 3 Jun 2008, 32\npercent of cases tested this year in the Ministry's sentinel\nsurveillance system were positive for EV71. The Ministry is working\nclosely with preschools and child-care centers to help limit the\nspread of HFMD and stresses the importance of good personal and\nenvironmental hygiene, especially for children.\n\nTaiwan\n------\nOn 30 Jun 2008, the Central News Agency reported that the Taiwan\nCenters for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) had confirmed a total of 272\ncases this year [2008], including 9 deaths. Due to the decreasing\nnumbers of cases reported each week, Taiwan CDC is reporting that the\noutbreak is waning. The importance of good hygiene and prompt medical\nattention for children showing severe symptoms has been encouraged.\n\nPrevention measures for travelers\n---------------------------------\nNo vaccine is available to prevent HFMD. There is no specific\ntreatment for people who are sick with this disease other than\ntreating symptoms, such as fever.\n\nTravelers can take steps to prevent getting HFMD by practicing good\npersonal hygiene and following safe food and water practices. If you\nare traveling in general, and especially to areas where HFMD has been\nreported, follow these tips to help make healthy choices:\n\n- Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds,\nespecially before you eat, after you cough or sneeze, and after you\ngo to the toilet. If soap and water are not available, use an\nalcohol-based hand gel (with at least 60 percent alcohol). Consider\npacking alcohol-based hand gel in your luggage to ensure you have it\nwhen needed.\n- Eat foods that are fully cooked and served hot.\n- Drink beverages that have been properly bottled and sealed (water,\ncarbonated drinks, or sports drinks).\n- Do not put ice in drinks.\n- Eat only fruits and vegetables that you can wash (with boiled or\nbottled water) and peel yourself.\n- Do not share eating utensils, such as forks, spoons, and cups.\n\nAdults should help child travelers to follow these recommendations.\nInfants, children, and adolescents are more susceptible to infection\nand illness because they are less likely than adults to have cells\nthat fight infection from previous exposures to the enteroviruses\nthat cause HFMD.\n\nInfection results in immunity to the specific virus that caused HFMD.\nA 2nd episode of HFMD may occur following infection with a different\nmember of the enterovirus group.\n\nAdditional information\n----------------------\nHFMD is an illness caused by certain strains of enterovirus,\nincluding EV71, which are common worldwide. Outbreaks of HFMD caused\nby EV71 are not uncommon and have been reported by countries\nthroughout the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. EV71 can be\nspread from person to person by direct contact with nose and throat\nsecretions (such as, by coughing or sneezing), saliva, fluid from\nblisters, or the stool of infected persons. People sick with HFMD\noften experience symptoms such as fever, sores in the mouth, and a\nrash, occasionally with blisters. HFMD caused by EV71 may sometimes\nlead to serious complications, including swelling of the brain\n(encephalitis). Most cases of HFMD occur in children under 10 years\nof age, but adults can also become infected.\n\nFor more information, see\n- Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (CDC Fact Sheet, available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/enterovirus/hfhf.htm>.)\n- Traveling with Children: Resources (CDC Travelers' Health website at\n<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentChildTravel.aspx>.)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[There are some remarkable differences in mortality that require\nexplanation; for example, 15 776 cases and no fatalities in Singapore\nand by contrast 272 cases and 9 deaths in Taiwan. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Thu 3 Jul 2008\n According to Ministry of\nHealth spokesman Mao Qun'an, although over 176 000 cases were\nreported last month [June 2008], the number of daily reported cases\ndecreased from 11 501 during the outbreak's peak to 3922 by 5 Jun\n2008.

Deng Xiaohong, spokeswoman of the Beijing Health Bureau, said the\nchild, a 13 month old boy from northern Changping District, had died on the\nway to a hospital last Sunday [11 May 2008]. She said the child had tested\npositive for enterovirus 71 (EV71), a virus that causes the majority of\nHFMD deaths in China.\n\nThe spokeswoman also confirmed that another child from north China's Hebei\nProvince had died of HFMD in a Beijing hospital, but she did not reveal\nwhen the child died. 'Under the disease counting regulations of the\nMinistry of Health, the child from Hebei was not counted in Beijing's\ndisease toll,' said Deng Hebei Province, which neighbors Beijing, had not\npreviously reported any child death from HFMD.\n\nBeijing counting of HFMD infection ran up to 3606 as of 12 May 2008, up\nfrom 1492 cases reported on May 4. The health bureau did not update the\nfigure by Wednesday morning. Deng said that Beijing's Chaoyang District has\nso far the city's largest number of infections, followed by southern\nFengtai and northern Changping districts. The bureau's figures showed that\nas of Wednesday, a total of 70 children remained in Beijing's hospitals for\nthe epidemic treatment. Among them, 55 were locals and 15 were from elsewhere.\n\nThe spokeswoman said the child deaths should not be seen as a signal for\nthe worsening disease control situation in the national capital. 'Both\ndeaths should be attributed to the delay in getting hospital treatment by\nthe children's families. We again urged parents to send their children to\nstandard hospitals immediately after they find children to have likely\nsymptoms related to the disease,' said Deng.\n\nMany of Beijing residents are reluctant to send their children to\nhospitals, which have also enrolled HFMD patients from other parts of the\ncountry, said a doctor in Ditan Hospital, the largest hospital specialized\nin contagious diseases in China. 'Some parents refused to heed doctors'\nadvice to leave their children in hospital. They complained that we have\nalso taken in patients from outside Beijing, for example from Fuyang City,\nwhere the disease first broke out,' said Cai Gaochang, a doctor with the\ninformation department of the hospital. The national capital has the best\nhospitals and doctors in the country. Patients from around the country opt\nfor Beijing for treating complicated diseases.\n\nBeijing's health authority has reinforced the viral epidemic control effort\nin kindergartens. The Caoqiao Kindergarten in Fengtai District was ordered\nto suspend classes this week for a thorough disinfection, after 2 children\nwere found to be infected with the virus. A teacher said that more than 200\nchildren in the kindergarten have gone through disease prevention checks to\nexclude the possibility of HFMD infection. At least 2 Beijing kindergartens\nwere suspended last week after children showed symptoms of the disease.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail (promed@promedmail.org)\n\n[These 2 cases can be presumed to increase the total number of deaths in\nthe outbreak in China to 36.

Hospitals in\nseveral other aimags have reported having patients with symptoms of HFMD,\nalthough the disease has not yet been verified.\n\nThe 1st case was reported on Thursday [8 May 2008] in Ulaanbaatar. Since\nthen the General Authority for Emergency Management (GAEM) has seen a rapid\nescalation. Deputy prime minister M Enkhbold is heading an emergency\ncommittee to take measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic, which\nyesterday agreed to a proposal for Tugrug 305 million in response aid\n[about USD 262 000].\n\n'74 per cent of the affected children are aged 4 years old,' Enkhbold said.\n'The National Emergency Management Agency held meetings last weekend and\nmade some decisions and have established some procedures. 'In order to\nfollow these, the Government of Mongolia budgeted Tugrug 57.7 [USD 0.05. Is\nthis per person or in millions? - Mod.SH] to the training, advertising,\nmedicine and appropriate cleaning equipment which is useful for prevention\nfrom this disease.' The advertising budget the government has allocated\nwill be on television and radio soon and will educate the public on the\ndangers of the disease.\n\nNo one has been killed by the disease to date, and at least 29 children\nhave fully recovered. While hundreds of the suspected patients have been\nhospitalized, many others with lighter symptoms have been quarantined at home.\n\nOfficials said the 250 beds it had dedicated to HFMD in the National Center\nfor Studies of Infectious Diseases are full. An overwhelming number of\ninfected patients will recover from the disease within a few weeks. Some of\nthe businesses the government deemed as having a high-exposure risk\nincluded small kiosks, some grocery stores, fitness centers and computer\ngaming centers.

Those sickened\nby EV71 often show serious symptoms. It can also lead to meningitis,\nencephalitis, pulmonary edema and paralysis in some children. There\nis no vaccine.\n\nAs of Thursday [8 May 2008], HFMD had sickened 24 934 children on the\nChinese mainland, of whom 34 had died.

A report by the state-run Xinhua news agency late\nSunday [27 Apr 2008] evening said the outbreak began in early March\nand cited the city's health department as confirming that the disease\nwas caused by enterovirus-71, one of several viruses that can cause HFMD.\n\nThe disease is common among children and infants, who can develop a\nfever, rash and sores in the mouth once infected. But the disease --\ncompletely unrelated to foot-and-mouth disease, which affects cattle,\npigs, and sheep -- rarely kills people. Most HFMD patients recover\nwithin a week or so. Clusters of fatal cases occasionally emerge and\nwere reported in Malaysia in 1997 and Taiwan in 1998, according to\nthe Web site of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nEven though the family of viruses that caused the Chinese outbreak is\nfound around the world, and the particular strain involved has been\nreported in China in recent years, 'we believe the situation is still\nof concern, especially because of the current high reported case\nfatality rate compared to previous years,' Cris Tunon, an official\nwith the World Health Organization in Beijing, said in a statement.\n\nChina's Health Minister Chen Zhu visited Fuyang on Saturday [26 Apr\n2008], according to the Xinhua report. Chinese health officials at\nthe local level in the past have sometimes played down disease\noutbreaks early on, only to be caught off guard later. After families\n[arrived at] hospitals with their sick children, rumors began\ncirculating in Fuyang.\n\n'Because there is no information about the strange disease from the\nofficials, rumors from the street are becoming unrestrained,'\naccording to a story in the Democracy and Law Times, a Beijing-based\nnewspaper. 'Some people are calling this disease 'Baby SARS.''\n\nFeng Lizhong, deputy director of Anhui Provincial Health Department,\nsaid that when the outbreak started in March [2008], it was unclear\nwhat the disease was, so they reported the cases to higher-level\nhealth officials. Eventually, health officials arrived in Fuyang and\ninvestigated for about 10 days, Mr. Feng says, and sent virus samples\nto Beijing for analysis.\n\nEver since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or\nSARS, swept across China and eventually claimed nearly 800 lives\nworld-wide in 2002 and 2003, international health officials have long\nfeared that slow reporting about a disease outbreak on the Chinese\nmainland could thwart any effort to respond and contain the outbreak.\n\nHong Kong's Center for Health Protection issued a news release on 24\nApr 2008 detailing a single case of a 7-year-old boy from the\nmainland who was diagnosed with HFMD 3 days after he was admitted to\na Hong Kong hospital.\n\n[Byline: Nicholas Zamiska]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Since a previous report dated 27 Apr 2008 (see: Hand, foot & mouth\ndisease - China (Anhui), Singapore 20080429.1472), the number of\nfatalities has increased from 19 to 20 and the number of cases from\n'over 700' to 'some 1200.'\n\nA map of the provinces of China showing the location of Anhui\nprovince is available at\n<http://www.mapsofworld.com/china/china-political-map.html>, and a\nmap of Anhui province showing the location of the city of Fuyang in\nthe northwest of the province is available at\n<http://www.mapsofworld.com/china/provinces/anhui/map-of-anhui.html>. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "Even though the family of viruses that caused the Chinese outbreak is\nfound around the world, and the particular strain involved has been\nreported in China in recent years, 'we believe the situation is still\nof concern, especially because of the current high reported case\nfatality rate compared to previous years,' Cris Tunon, an official\nwith the World Health Organization in Beijing, said in a statement. \n\nA map of the provinces of China showing the location of Anhui\nprovince is available at\n<http://www.mapsofworld.com/china/china-political-map.html>, and a\nmap of Anhui province showing the location of the city of Fuyang in\nthe northwest of the province is available at\n<http://www.mapsofworld.com/china/provinces/anhui/map-of-anhui.html>.

All were below the age of 6, with the majority being under\n2. Altogether [at least] 25 children have died of the disease. Tests\nhave confirmed 24 of the deaths were triggered by the virus known as\nenterovirus 71 (EV71).\n\nAccording to the Guidelines Regarding Prevention and Control of HFMD\npublished on the Ministry of Health website, HFMD can be caused by a\nhost of intestinal viruses, but EV71 and the coxsackievirus A16 (Cox\nA16) were the most common.\n\nAnhui Province, in east China, and Guangdong Province, south China\nwere the worst hit areas. 22 of the deaths occurred in Fuyang, a city\nin northwestern Anhui, and the rest happened in Guangdong. These 2\nregions were followed by Beijing, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Hubei,\naccording to statistics released by local health departments.\n\nIn Anhui alone, 622 new cases were reported on Saturday [3 May 2008],\nincluding 362 in Fuyang, driving up the number of children with HFMD\nto 5151 in Anhui. Beijing has recorded at least 1010 cases of the\ndisease, while Guangdong registered 925 cases as of Sunday [4 May 2008] .\n\nBoth EV71 and Cox A16 can cause HFMD, which usually starts with a\nslight fever followed by blisters and ulcers in the mouth and rashes\non the hands and feet. Those sickened by EV71 often show serious\nsymptoms. It can also lead to meningitis, encephalitis, pulmonary\nedema, and paralysis in some children. There is no vaccine.\n\nSaying reports of HFMD could increase in the next few months, the\nHealth Ministry issued a circular late last month [April 2008]\nrequiring better management and surveillance of the disease.

All were below the age\nof 6 and most were under the age of 2, it said. The total number of\ninfections reported nationwide by Monday [5 May 2008] was 11 905,\nXinhua said, with smaller outbreaks in Hebei, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei,\nShaanxi, Jiangxi, and Henan provinces and in the city of Chongqing.\n\nAlthough nearly all the deaths have been blamed on enterovirus 71\n(EV71), it was not immediately clear how many of the overall\ninfections were traced to that virus. Zhejiang's provincial health\nbureau said on its website that only 9 of its 1198 cases had tested\npositive for EV71. Chongqing said none of its 42 infections have been\nconfirmed to be cause by EV71.\n\nXinhua said the jump in cases was due in part to a new regulation\nfrom the Ministry of Health classifying hand-foot-mouth disease among\nthose that have to be reported to the central government. The agency\nsaid a majority of the cases were reported in Anhui province, where\n5840 cases were reported, nearly all of them in the fast-growing city\nof Fuyang.\n\nEnterovirus [71] causes a severe form of hand-foot-mouth disease with\nsymptoms including fever, mouth sores, and rashes with blisters. It\nis easily spread by sneezing or coughing. The viruses mainly strike\nchildren ages 10 and younger. Some cases can lead to fatal swelling\nof the brain.\n\nThe illness is not related to foot-and-mouth disease, which afflicts\nlivestock. There is no vaccine or specific treatment, but most\nchildren affected by mild forms of the disease typically recover\nquickly without problems.

They urged all parents and schoolteachers to be more\nvigilant against enterovirus [infection], as temperatures in Taiwan\ncontinue to rise into the summer months. Chou Jih-haw, deputy\ndirector of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department\nof Health (DOH), said that the latest victim was a boy aged 3 years\nand 4 months who had probably been infected by his 5-year-old sister.\n\nOn 11 Apr 2008, the boy developed a fever, with rashes and sores in\nhis mouth, and he was checked into the hospital with spasms the\nfollowing day [12 Apr 2008], Chou said. The boy lapsed into a coma\nshortly after he was admitted, and died 5 days later despite efforts\nto save him, Chou said. An investigation found that the boy's sister\nalso had an enterovirus infection, and had been admitted to the\nhospital on 13 Apr 2008. But she fully recovered because her case was\nnot that serious.\n\n'Children under 3 years old are most vulnerable to the disease\nbecause they have no antibodies, making them a high risk group in\nserious cases of enterovirus, especially in cross infection\nsituations,' Chou said. The 1st enterovirus death occurred in March\n[2008] in Yunlin County, southwestern Taiwan, the CDC reported.\n\nHealth officials at the CDC said that the number of confirmed serious\ncases of enterovirus has reached 60 this year [2008], and among them\nthere have been 2 deaths; 7 other patients remain in intensive care,\nwhile one has been hospitalized for about 4 months due to\nencephalitis complications.\n\nEnterovirus infections can be deadly for young children. The virus\nenters the body through the gastrointestinal tract and often moves on\nto attack the nervous system, leading to symptoms of fever, muscle\naches, and aseptic or viral meningitis. In a massive outbreak in\nTaiwan in 1998, 405 children were infected and 78 of them eventually\ndied. The most recent outbreak came in 2005, with 145 children\ninfected and 15 dying from the virus.\n\nDOH officials said people should maintain good personal hygiene by\nfrequently washing their hands. Parents and teachers at elementary\nschools and kindergartens should especially supervise young children\nto clean their hands in southern Taiwan during warmer weather, they\nsaid. Young children should also be kept away from places with big\ncrowds, they advised.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The HFMD outbreaks continue to spread through China with up to 12\n000 children affected and 26 fatalities reported.

HFMD is a consequence of\ninfection by an enterovirus and is particularly associated with\ninfection by human coxsackievirus A16 (and less commonly A4, A5, A9,\nA10, B2, or B5). Human echovirus 19 was responsible for an outbreak\nof HFMD in Shandong province of China in 2003. Beginning in the 1970s\nhuman enterovirus 71 has been associated with outbreaks exhibiting\nsome neural involvement (meningitis and encephalitis). Cases of fatal\nencephalitis occurred during outbreaks of HFMD due to human\nenterovirus 71 infection in Malaysia in 1997 and in Taiwan in 1998.\n\nDespite their distinctive names, human coxsackievirus A16 and human\nenterovirus 71 are similar viruses now classified together as members\nof the same virus species _Human enterovirus A_. Human enterovirus 71\nhas been the predominant cause of HFMD in south China.

Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the Centers\nfor Disease Control under the DOH, said that the girl's parents took\nher to a Kaohsiung medical center on 4 Feb 2008 after discovering\nblisters all over her body. The child was released from hospital the\nnext day after her condition improved. However, on 6 Feb 2008, the\nchild developed a fever, symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease\n(HFMD), as well as arm and leg spasms, Lin said. The parents brought\nthe child back to the same medical center, and the child was\nimmediately admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. On 19 Feb\n2008, after conducting tests, the hospital reported the suspected\nenterovirus-71 case to the CDC. The child was released from the\nmedical center several days later after her condition had improved.\n\nLin said that although the latest data shows that enterovirus may be\non the wane, the data was compiled ahead of the start of school\nfollowing the extended holiday break, which he noted may be the\nreason for the decline in new enterovirus cases. Pointing out that\nenterovirus may make a resurgence when school starts again, Lin\nreminded parents and teachers to not let their guard down and to pay\nattention to students' sanitary habits as well as to make sure that\nthey wash their hands often to avoid being infected. He also urged\nparents to take their kids to a hospital immediately if they develop\na fever, HFMD symptoms, or arm and leg spasms.\n\nIn 2007, there were a total of 49 cases of confirmed enterovirus\ninfections in Taiwan, with 2 fatalities. So far this year [2008],\nthere have been 14 cases, with no fatalities, which Lin said shows\nthat citizens have become more aware of the threat of enterovirus.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) syndrome commonly observed in\ninfants and young children can be caused by several enteric viruses.\nHuman enterovirus-71 and human coxsackievirus A16 are the most\nfrequent pathogens.

In an outbreak year, we start seeing\ncases in early February. The outbreaks have peaked between March and\nMay. In 2000 and in 2003, we did not have many fatal cases, but in\nthis year's [2006] outbreak, we have seen more than in the previous 2\noutbreaks. All outbreaks we have documented (1997, 2000, 2003 and\n2006) have been predominantly caused by EV71 of genogroup B.

As our reporting system is rather\ncomprehensive, we get to hear of and investigate cases throughout the\nstate. As ProMED-mail has reported, we have seen a resurgence of HFMD\ncases in the period after epidemiological week 20, and our\nvirological investigations confirm that these cases are predominantly\ndue to EV71 still, and the virus continues to circulate in the\nnorthern part of the state, particularly in the more remote areas of\nthe interior, and these numbers contribute towards the '2nd wave'\ndescribed in the popular press.

Deputy Chief Minister George Chan said the\nboy died on Fri 7 Jul 2006 but described the death as an isolated case. The\nState has been battling the outbreak since February and the number of cases\nhad declined in recent months. The critically ill boy was first admitted to\na local hospital on Thu [6 Jul 2006] but died the following day despite\nbeing flown to Miri hospital.\nChan said the number of new cases had dropped to around 200 to 250 per week\nsince mid-April from between 1000 and 1300 cases per week previously. The\nillness affects mainly infants and young children, causing painful mouth\nand throat ulcers, fever and blisters on hands and feet.\nThe Health Ministry on 3 Mar 2006 ordered the closure for a few weeks of\nall 488 kindergartens and child-care centres in Sarawak, which is on the\nisland of Borneo. Sarawak has been hit periodically by the disease. In the\nworst outbreak in 1997, 31 people died.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[HFMD is a common illness of infants and children, characterized by fever,\nsores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters. It begins with a mild fever,\npoor appetite, malaise, and frequently a sore throat. One or 2 days after\nthe fever begins, painful sores develop in the mouth, usually on the\ntongue, gums, and inside of the cheeks. The skin rash develops over 1-2\ndays with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters, usually on the\npalms of the hands and soles of the feet -- hence the name.\nHFMD is usually associated with infection by human coxsackievirus A16 or\nhuman enterovirus 71 (EV-71). Occasionally cases due to infection by other\ngroup A or B B coxsackieviruses have been recorded. Coxsackievirus A16\ninfection is normally a mild disease and nearly all patients recover\nwithout medical treatment in 7 to 10 days. Complications are\nuncommon. EV-71 may also cause viral meningitis and, rarely, more serious\ndiseases, such as encephalitis, or a poliomyelitis-like paralysis. EV71\nencephalitis may be fatal.

The case in Hong Kong has been diagnosed as\ndue to EV-71 infection and it is likely that the same virus is responsible\nfor the outbreak in Sarawak, although that is not stated specifically in\nthe above report. The skin rash develops over 1-2\ndays with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters, usually on the\npalms of the hands and soles of the feet -- hence the name. The\nillness affects mainly infants and young children, causing painful mouth\nand throat ulcers, fever and blisters on hands and feet. One or 2 days after\nthe fever begins, painful sores develop in the mouth, usually on the\ntongue, gums, and inside of the cheeks. The critically ill boy was first admitted to\na local hospital on Thu [6 Jul 2006] but died the following day despite\nbeing flown to Miri hospital. Coxsackievirus A16\ninfection is normally a mild disease and nearly all patients recover\nwithout medical treatment in 7 to 10 days. The Health Ministry on 3 Mar 2006 ordered the closure for a few weeks of\nall 488 kindergartens and child-care centres in Sarawak, which is on the\nisland of Borneo. Cases of fatal EV-71-associated encephalitis\nhave occurred during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia and Taiwan [see\nProMED-mail references below].

It is a common infection but\ncomplications can cause death.\nSigns include red spots on the palm, leg surface and blisters in the\nmouth and tongue [URL for picture of hand lesions included below. -\nMod.RY]. It really hurts the tongue and those afflicted will\nexperience discomfort when swallowing food or drinking fluids.\nParent have been advised to consult a doctor if their child has any\nof the following conditions: persistent high fever, repeated vomiting\nand poor appetite, extreme tiredness and sleepiness, irritability,\nabdominal distension, urine retention, shortness of breath, fast\nheart beat or pulse (of more than 160 per minute), unsteady gait or\nlimb weakness, muscle jerks, abnormal eye movement and cold sweating.\nThe disease spreads through direct contact via patient's mucus, fluid\nfrom running nose, saliva, and liquid from blisters and stools.\nThere's no specific treatment for the disease. The treatment given is\nto decrease the intensity of the symptoms.\nThe public, especially parents and those at childcare centres, are\nadvised to take precautionary steps. Personal hygiene is most\nimportant in avoiding to contract and transmit enterovirus infection.\nThese include washing hands thoroughly before eating, after going to\nthe toilet or handling nappy/excreta, covering mouth and nose when\ncoughing or sneezing, cleaning thoroughly surfaces of toys and other\nappliances and maintaining cleanliness among children, especially\nthose under 5 years old. Infected children should stay away from\npublic places like schools and childcare centres. Parents should not\nbring their children to the affected areas.\nShould parents come across these symptoms in their children, they\nshould bring them to the nearest hospital or go to emergency wards in\nthe 4 districts after office hours.\nFor further information on the disease, the public can contact\n2242424 extension 393.\nHFMD FACTBOX\nWhat is HFMD?\nHFMD is often confused with foot-and-mouth disease among cattle,\nsheep and swine. Although the names are similar, the diseases are not\nrelated and are caused by different viruses. Viruses from the group\ncalled enteroviruses cause HFMD.\nHFMD, caused by coxsackievirus A16 infection, is a mild disease and\nnearly all patients recover without medical treatment in 7-10 days.\nComplications are uncommon.\nIs HFMD contagious?\nIt is moderately contagious. Infection spreads from person to person\nby direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from\nblisters, or the stool of infected persons. A person is most\ncontagious during the first week of the illness.\nThe usual period from infection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days.\nFever is the first symptom of HFMD.\nWho is at risk of HFMD?\nChildren under 10 years old are at risk but it may occur in adults\ntoo. Infants, children and adolescents are more likely to be\nsusceptible to infection as they are less likely than adults to have\nantibodies and be immune from previous exposures to them.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nPersistent high fever, repeated vomiting and poor appetite, extreme\ntiredness and sleepiness, irritability, abdominal distension, urine\nretention, shortness of breath, fast heart beat or pulse (of more\nthan 160 per minute), unsteady gait or limb weakness, muscle jerks,\nabnormal eye movement and cold sweating.\nHow it can be prevented?\nWashing hands thoroughly before eating, after going to the toilet or\nhandling nappy/excreta; covering mouth and nose when coughing or\nsneezing; cleaning thoroughly surfaces of toys and other appliances\nand maintaining cleanliness among children especially those aged\nunder 5 years. Infected children should stay away from public places\nlike schools and childcare centres. Parents should not bring their\nchildren to the affected areas.\n[Byline: Azlan Othman & Lyna Mohammed]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Brunei has experienced the first death out of a total of 17 cases of\nHFMD -- a rough case fatality rate of 5.9 percent. HFMD is caused by\nenteroviruses, among which coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) is the most\ncommon etiologic agent. Usually no complications of HFMD are caused\nby CA16 infection, although aseptic or viral meningitis may occur\noccasionally. A second common cause of HFMD is enterovirus 71(EV71).\nIn addition to HFMD, EV71 may also cause aseptic or viral meningitis,\nencephalitis, or a polio-like paralysis. EV71 meningitis or\nencephalitis may on rare occasions be fatal.\nCases of fatal encephalitis occurred during widespread outbreaks of\nHFMD in Bulgaria in 1975 (29 deaths), Malaysia in 1997 (29 deaths)\nand Taiwan in 1998 (78 deaths). In the 1998 epidemic several\nenteroviruses were involved. However, enterovirus 71 infection was\nassociated with most, if not all, of the serious clinical\nmanifestations and with nearly all deaths. Most of those who died\nwere younger than 5 years, and the majority died of pulmonary edema\nand pulmonary hemorrhage.\nNo effective treatments are available. General treatment is\npalliative. Preventive measures are focused on enforcement of\npersonal hygiene and public awareness campaigns.\nSince the advent of the 1998 outbreak, Department of Health (DOH) of\nTaiwan has determined the pattern of the annual seasonal HFMD\nepidemic, the peak of which tends to fall in the beginning of July.\nThe DOH schedules the reminder campaign according to this pattern.\nThe disease has been brought under control.

Infection spreads from person to person\nby direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from\nblisters, or the stool of infected persons. Cases of fatal encephalitis occurred during widespread outbreaks of\nHFMD in Bulgaria in 1975 (29 deaths), Malaysia in 1997 (29 deaths)\nand Taiwan in 1998 (78 deaths). Infants, children and adolescents are more likely to be\nsusceptible to infection as they are less likely than adults to have\nantibodies and be immune from previous exposures to them. Usually no complications of HFMD are caused\nby CA16 infection, although aseptic or viral meningitis may occur\noccasionally. Most of those who died\nwere younger than 5 years, and the majority died of pulmonary edema\nand pulmonary hemorrhage. However, enterovirus 71 infection was\nassociated with most, if not all, of the serious clinical\nmanifestations and with nearly all deaths. Parents should not bring their\nchildren to the affected areas.\n HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE - BRUNEI\n*************************************\n Since the advent of the 1998 outbreak, Department of Health (DOH) of\nTaiwan has determined the pattern of the annual seasonal HFMD\nepidemic, the peak of which tends to fall in the beginning of July. HFMD is caused by\nenteroviruses, among which coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) is the most\ncommon etiologic agent. Viruses from the group\ncalled enteroviruses cause HFMD.\n Situated in Southeastern Asia, bordering the South China Sea and\nMalaysia, Brunei is a tiny independent country with an area of 5770\nsq km.

HFMD, caused by coxsackievirus A16 infection, is a mild disease and\nnearly all patients recover without medical treatment in 7-10 days. Infected children should stay away from\npublic places like schools and childcare centres. Infected children should stay away from public places\nlike schools and childcare centres. The disease spreads through direct contact via patient's mucus, fluid\nfrom running nose, saliva, and liquid from blisters and stools. Asked about the last case that was detected in Brunei, Dr. Meng Keang\nsaid it occurred in February 2006, but in small numbers: 2-3 cases. Children under 10 years old are at risk but it may occur in adults\ntoo. A more serious case was detected in Brunei and a\n2-year-old boy died of HFMD yesterday.

The\nchildren with these symptoms should be taken to see a doctor quickly\nto prevent any delay in obtaining treatment for the potentially\nlethal disease, Wu said.\nAccording to CDC statistics, 3 children have died of the virus this\nyear [2005], one in February in Taichung County, and the other 2 last\nweek [2nd week May 2005] in Yunlin and Changhua counties.\nDeaths\n------\nAccording to the CDC, the 3 young children all died of [pnfection with]\nEnterovirus 71, which often presents like other enterovirus infections and\ncan have no symptoms, or the patient may show signs of hand, foot & mouth\ndisease, rashes, meningitis, encephalitis or some combination of these.

'Normally, the\n2nd child to be infected by the virus is more serious than the 1st\nchild in one family, as the magnitude of the virus will increase as\ntime goes by,' Wu said. Because of this, Wu added, if one child has\nbecome infected with the virus, the parents should be watchful for\nany possibility that it will be transmitted to other children.\nHealth officials say there is no known vaccine for the intestinal bug.\nEnterovirus 71 was 1st isolated in 1969 and has since been associated\nwith sporadic outbreaks in various parts of world, including the\nUSA, Brazil, Europe, Australia and Malaysia.\n[Byline: Shih Hsiu-chuan]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Taiwan is currently facing the annual outbreak season for hand, foot &\nmouth disease (HFMD). Viruses from the group called enteroviruses cause\nHFMD. The most common cause is coxsackievirus A16; sometimes, HFMD is caused\nby enterovirus 71 or other enteroviruses. The enterovirus group includes\npolioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses and other enteroviruses. HFMD\ncaused by coxsackievirus A16 infection is a mild disease, and nearly all\npatients recover without medical treatment in 7 to 10 days. Complications\nare uncommon. Rarely, the patient with coxsackievirus A16 infection may also\ndevelop 'aseptic' or viral meningitis, in which the person has fever,\nheadache, stiff neck, or back pain, and may need to be hospitalized for a\nfew days. Another cause of HFMD, EV71 virus may also produce viral\nmeningitis and, rarely, more serious diseases, such as encephalitis, or a\npoliomyelitis-like paralysis. EV71 encephalitis may be fatal. Cases of fatal\nencephalitis occurred during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia in 1997 and in\nTaiwan in 1998.\nHand, foot & mouth disease is usually characterized by tiny blisters\non the inside of the mouth and the palms of the hands, fingers, and\nsoles of the feet. Young children are primarily affected, but it may\nbe seen in adults. Most cases occur in the summer and early fall.\nOutbreaks may occur among groups of children, especially in child\ncare centers or nursery schools. Symptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days\nafter exposure.\nHand, foot & mouth disease is usually spread through person-to-person\ncontact. People can spread the disease when they are shedding the virus in\ntheir feces. It is also spread by the respiratory tract from mouth or\nrespiratory secretions (such as from saliva on hands or toys). The virus has\nalso been found in the fluid from the skin blisters. The infection is spread\nmost easily during the acute phase/stage of illness when people are feeling\nill, but the virus can be spread for several weeks after the onset of\ninfection.\nThe symptoms are much like a common cold with a rash The rash appears\nas blisters or ulcers in the mouth, on the inner cheeks, gums, sides\nof the tongue, and as bumps or blisters on the hands, feet, and\nsometimes other parts of the skin. The skin rash may last for 7 to 10\ndays.\nThere is no specific treatment for the virus that causes HFMD. Help prevent\nand control its spread by:\n- Washing hands well, especially after going to the bathroom,\nchanging diapers and/or handling diapers or other stool-soiled\nmaterial.\n- Covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.\n- Washing toys and other surfaces that have saliva on them.\n- Excluding children from child care or school settings if there is\na fever, or ulcers in the mouth and the child is drooling.\nFor reviews, please see refs: [Taiwan] CDC HFMD Fact sheet:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/enterovirus/hfhf.htm>;\nEpidemiology and Disease Control Program (EDCP) Fact sheet:\n<http://edcp.org/factsheets/handfoot.html>.\nWith annual timely public awareness campaigns by the Taiwan CDC and\nthe island-wide public health network, the frequency of reporting\noutbreaks of Enterovirus 71 or HFMD has been chronologically reduced.\nProMED welcomes further information from Taiwan health authorities. -\nMod.RY]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n After his\ndeath, his brother was also found infected with the same virus, CDC\nsaid, adding that his parents must not have thought their older child\nwas infected, and missed the opportunity to send their younger child\nto see the doctor before the disease became serious.

One HFMD case was\nreported from Bandung, West Java province, and the other from Jakarta. So\nfar, there have been no deaths.\nHFMD is a common illness of infants and children. It is characterized by\nfever, sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters. HFMD begins with a\nmild fever, poor appetite, malaise ('feeling sick'), and frequently a sore\nthroat. One or 2 days after the fever begins, painful sores develop in the\nmouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become\nulcers. They are usually located on the tongue, gums, and inside of the\ncheeks. The skin rash develops over 1 to 2 days with flat or raised red\nspots, some with blisters. The rash does not itch, and it is usually\nlocated on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It may also appear\non the buttocks. A person with HFMD may have only the rash or the mouth ulcers.\nHFMD usually is not serious. HFMD caused by Coxsackievirus A16 infection is\na mild disease, and nearly all patients recover without medical treatment\nin 7 to 10 days. Complications are uncommon. Rarely, the patient with\ncoxsackievirus A16 infection may also develop 'aseptic' or viral\nmeningitis, in which the person has fever, headache, stiff neck, or back\npain, and may need to be hospitalized for a few days. Another cause of\nHFMD, enterovirus 71 (EV71) may also cause viral meningitis and, rarely,\nmore serious diseases, such as encephalitis, or a poliomyelitis-like\nparalysis. EV71 encephalitis may be fatal. Cases of fatal encephalitis\noccurred during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia in 1997 and in Taiwan in 1998.\nHFMD is moderately contagious. Infection is spread from person to person by\ndirect contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from\nblisters, or the stool of infected persons. A person is most contagious\nduring the 1st week of the illness. HFMD is not transmitted to or from pets\nor other animals.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[These sporadic cases of hand, foot and mouth disease, though insignificant\nin number, may be the forerunners of a more serious epidemic, particularly\nif Enterovirus 71 proves to be the etiologic agent.

No public announcement has been made about\nthe outbreak by the Department of Health, and officials only\nconfirmed the infections after questions were filed by the Sunday\nMorning Post last week.\nA department spokeswoman said 5 children from the kindergarten\nsection of the respected Yew Chung International School in Kowloon\nTong had contracted the disease. The children, all aged 4, have been\ntold to stay at home. None of the children, whose parents have been\ncontacted by the department, have developed complications. The\ndepartment spokeswoman said the parents of all the other children at\nthe school were notified on Thu 11 Mar 2004 -- at least 48 hours\nafter the first child fell ill.\nHealth officials did not say whether the school had acted properly in\nnotifying the parents.

'There is no need to confirm or deny this,\nbecause I have no information on this aspect. We have very strict\nhygiene measures to sterilise the school compound. Our cleaners wipe\ndown the furniture, stationary and playground equipment on a daily\nbasis,' she said.\nHand, foot and mouth disease, which caused a public health scare when\nit spread across Asia 6 years ago, is a viral infection that can lead\nto flu-like symptoms in the early stages.

'What the school clearly has on its hands now is an outbreak\nof hand, foot and mouth disease,' he said. 'Once a school has\nconfirmed that its students have contracted the disease, then they\nshould contact other parents as soon as possible so they will be\nalert, and this will minimise the risk of others contracting the\ndisease.'

Director Zhao of the Beijing City Haidian Hospital Pediatric\nDepartment says that since the start of winter this year, the number of\nhand, foot and mouth disease patients treated at Haidian Hospital's\nPediatric Department has shown a clear increase over previous years.\nDuring the peak period of this disease in the past, there would be one case\nevery 2 or 3 days. But this year there are 3 or 4 children diagnosed with\nhand, foot and mouth disease each day. Expert Jin Qi of China's CDC says,\nhand, foot and mouth disease appears every year in Beijing. Although the\nmortality rate for patients with hand, foot and mouth disease does not\nexceed 1 percent, if it leads to meningitis, at this [time] there is still\nno effective medical treatment.\nAccording to a report in 'The Beijing News', a child was diagnosed by\ndoctors at Haidian Hospital with hand, foot and mouth disease. Conditions\nin one class at his preschool are serious. Within that class there are only\n3 of 4 pupils still in attendance. And within his class of 35 students,\nthere are already over 10 who have come down with this illness.

A Health\nDepartment spokesman said on Tue 18 Jun 2002 that they were first told of\nthe outbreak on Thu 13 Jun 2002 and the number of infected children at the\nschool in the New Territories had since doubled.\nThe children were treated but none have needed hospitalization. Authorities\nhave allowed the school in Tsuen Kwan O, a newly developed residential\ndistrict in Hong Kong's outlying territories, to remain open for the time\nbeing. 'It may not be necessary to shut the school since the disease may be\n[restricted] to kids belonging to a [single] class. We have told the school\nto advise parents to keep their children at home until they are fully well.'\nThis viral infection, which can be fatal, is spread through contact with\nnasal discharges, saliva, faeces and fluid from blisters, and contact with\nitems used by an infected individual. The incubation period for the disease\nis 3 to 7 days. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, runny nose, mouth\nulcers, a painless rash on the hands, feet or buttocks, vomiting and\ndiarrhea. Officials were checking whether the children were infected with\nthe potentially deadly virus species known as _Enterovirus 71_, which\nkilled 30 children in Malaysia in 1997 and more than 50 in Taiwan the\nfollowing year.\nEnterovirus 71 is one of several viruses that can cause hand, foot & mouth\ndisease, which is not usually life-threatening but sometimes causes\npotentially fatal inflammation of the heart muscles, spinal cord, or brain.\nSo far this year 4 people in Hong Kong have been infected with enterovirus\n71 but all have recovered, Lee said.
