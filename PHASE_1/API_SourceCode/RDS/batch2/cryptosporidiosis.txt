Human cryptosporidiosis became a notifiable disease in Ireland in 2004, which means all medical practitioners are required to report an incidence of the illness to the Department of Public Health.\n\nCryptosporidiosis is passed on through infected water sources, farm or animal exposure or through direct contact.\n\nLimerick's public water supply has been tested for the presence of the parasite but it has not been detected, the Department of Public Health confirmed.\n\nThe Tall Trees Creche has been temporarily closed following the outbreak in order to break the cycle of transmission, according to owner and manager Pamela Walsh Hennessy. 'We wanted to take every precaution so our cr\u00e8che has been stripped back to 4 walls and decontaminated. We started from scratch, replacing items that couldn't be sterilised, getting rid of items. It has been a huge undertaking but the most important thing is the health and safety of our kids,' she said.\n\nChildren attending day care centres have an increased risk of contracting the illness. This is the 1st case of the parasite at the centre in 13 years, according to Ms Walsh Hennessy.\n\nA control team including representatives from the HSE and TUSLA was immediately convened to manage the current outbreak, according to the HSE spokesperson. 'Parents of the cr\u00e8che have been contacted directly by the Department of Public Health with relevant advice,' said a spokesperson. The cr\u00e8che is expected to reopen this [Thu 11 Jan 2017], following its closure on [Sat 6 Jan 2017], but is awaiting confirmation.\n\n[Byline: Jess Casey]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Infection caused by _Cryptosporidium_ spp. (often _C. parvum_ in human infections) is a zoonosis with reservoir in ruminants.

There were 629 cryptosporidium cases in Ireland in 2018.\n\n_Cryptosporidium_ is a parasite that causes the diarrheal disease cryptosporidiosis. Symptoms generally begin 2 to 10 days after becoming infected. The most common symptom is watery diarrhea but other signs include stomach cramps or pain, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss.\n\nThey usually last about one to 2 weeks in those with healthy immune systems. Occasionally, people may experience a recurrence after a brief period of recovery before the illness ends. Symptoms can come and go for up to 30 days.

Two people have been discharged, but one woman is still recovering in hospital.\n\nStaff became unwell last week [week ending 8 Apr 2018] after treating sick lambs in an isolation unit at Pet Mania on Portrack Lane, Stockton. The cause of the illness is thought to be the parasite _Cryptosporidium_, which can lead to symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever and vomiting.\n\nThe pet shop, known for its array of exotic animals, remains open after management said there was 'no risk to the public'. Business development manager William Smith said: 'There have been 3 members of the team who have been in hospital. They became ill after looking after some lambs that were unwell. Most have been in for a day and were OK after. They are now out. Only one person is still in hospital. I spoke to her this morning and she seems to be improving.'\n\nThe infected lambs arrived at the pet shop at the end of March [2018] and were then treated in a non-public isolation unit.

The parasite can spread when people swallow something that has come into contact with the feces (poop) of a sick person, such as pool water contaminated with diarrhea.\n\nIn comparison, 20 Crypto outbreaks linked to swimming were reported in 2011, 16 in 2012, and 13 in 2013. It is not clear whether the number of outbreaks has increased or whether better surveillance and laboratory methods are leading to better outbreak detection.\n\nCrypto is the most common cause of diarrheal illness and outbreaks linked to swimming pools or water playgrounds because it is not easily killed by chlorine and can survive up to 10 days in properly treated water. Swallowing just a mouthful of water contaminated with Crypto can make otherwise healthy people sick for up to 3 weeks with watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, or vomiting, and can lead to dehydration.\n\n'To help protect your family and friends from Crypto and other diarrhea-causing germs, do not swim or let your kids swim if sick with diarrhea,' said Michele Hlavsa, R.N., M.P.H., chief of CDC's Healthy Swimming Program. 'Protect yourself from getting sick by not swallowing the water in which you swim.'\n\nPrevent the spread of germs in the pool and other recreational water\nStandard levels of chlorine and other pool disinfectants kill most germs within a few minutes. However, Crypto is extremely hard to kill at standard levels of pool disinfectants. CDC recommends closing pools and treating the water with high levels of chlorine, called hyperchlorination, when responding to a diarrheal incident in the water or a Crypto outbreak.\n\nThe best way to help protect yourself and others from germs that cause diarrhea is to follow these steps:\n\n- Don't swim or let your kids swim if sick with diarrhea.\n- If diarrhea is caused by Crypto, wait until 2 weeks after diarrhea has stopped to go swimming.\n- Don't swallow the water in which you swim.\n- Rinse off in the shower before getting in the water to help remove any germs on your body that could contaminate the water.\n- Take kids on bathroom breaks often, and check diapers in a diaper-changing area and not right next to the pool.\n\nExamples of large Crypto outbreaks in the United States\nIn 2016, Alabama, Arizona, Ohio, and other states investigated and controlled Crypto outbreaks linked to swimming pools or water playgrounds. Those outbreaks highlight the ongoing challenges that treated recreational water venues have with Crypto due to how difficult it is to kill and the small number of germs that can make people sick. Arizona identified 352 people sick with Crypto for July-October 2016, compared with no more than 62 cases for any one year in 2011-2015. Ohio identified 1940 people sick with Crypto in 2016, compared with no more than 571 cases for any one year in 2012-2015.\n\nUsing CryptoNet for tracking cryptosporidiosis\nCryptoNet, launched in 2010, is the 1st U.S. DNA fingerprinting-based tracking system for illness caused by a parasite. The system helps states detect and control outbreaks by identifying which types of Crypto are infecting people. For example, Arizona used CryptoNet in 2016 to confirm the spread of a particular type of Crypto in multiple swimming pools in the Phoenix area.\n\nCDC is working to upgrade CryptoNet with more advanced DNA fingerprinting techniques. Examining the results combined with information on what patients were doing before they became sick will help CDC and its public health partners develop more effective strategies to stop the spread of Crypto.\n\nHealthy and Safe Swimming Week\nHealthy and Safe Swimming Week begins on May 22 [2017].

Health officials reported 17 people became ill after the farm trip, including 16 children aged 3 to 5 years old. Most were infected with _Campylobacter_ but a few patients were also diagnosed with infections from the parasite _Cryptosporidium_ after contact with animals. The children fell ill after the farm visit in Viken, a county in eastern Norway, where they were served raw, unpasteurized milk as part of their packed lunch. Pasteurization kills bacteria, viruses and parasites often found in raw milk.\n\nThe Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Mattilsynet) and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet) recommend that children, pregnant women, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems avoid drinking raw milk, because infections can have serious consequences for them.\n\nMattilsynet inspected the farm and took a milk sample from the tank. The farm had a relatively new barn and the milk appeared to be of good quality as the bacterial count was low, officials said. However, _Campylobacter_ was detected. Folkehelseinstituttet examined Campylobacter from some of the sick children, and found they carry the same _Campylobacter jejuni_ strain and that it is genetically similar to the strain detected in the raw milk.\n\nMattilsynet encourages good hand hygiene when visiting farms but added school staff have an extra responsibility to ensure that children do not drink raw milk.\n\nNorway recently continued a ban on selling raw milk based on the risk of becoming ill. This means serving it to children who visit a farm is illegal. Milk intended for direct consumption must be heat-treated. In 2017, the Ministry of Health and Care Services told Mattilsynet to prepare a draft regulation that allowed a limited sale of unpasteurized, raw milk and raw cream for human consumption. Proposed changes in the rules could have seen farms sell up to 5000 liters of raw milk or raw cream per year if certain conditions were met, such as satisfactory hygiene and including a warning statement. In its decision not to change the regulations, the Ministry of Health and Care Services cited warnings from agencies that raised questions about the possible risk of infection and serious illness.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This publication is a good read about the topic:\n\nClaeys WL, Cardoen S, Daube G, et al: Raw or heated cow milk consumption: Review of risks and benefits. Food Control 2013; 31(1): 251-62. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.09.035.\n\nThe abstract, introduction, and conclusions are given below with the citations removed.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n'In the context of the prevailing trend toward more natural products, there seems to be an increasing preference for raw milk consumption as raw milk is associated with several perceived health benefits that are believed to be destroyed upon heating. However, many human pathogens can be isolated from raw cow milk. The prevalence of foodborne pathogens in raw cow milk varies, but their presence has been demonstrated in many surveys and foodborne infections have been repeatedly reported for _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_ spp. and human pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ [VTEC]. In industrialized countries, milk-borne and milk product-borne outbreaks represent 2-6% of the bacterial foodborne outbreaks.\n\n'The aim of this review is to present scientifically sound data regarding the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw and heated cow milk. Both microbiological aspects (such as, the prevalence of milk-borne pathogens, pathogen growth inhibition by antimicrobial systems and by lactic acid producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria, etc.) and nutritional or health aspects (nutritional value, immunity, allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, milk digestibility, etc.) are considered.\n\n'As such, it is demonstrated that consumption of raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. With the exception of an altered organoleptic profile [taste], heating (in particular ultra-high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n'The consumption of raw milk is not well-documented, but in the context of the current trend toward 'consuming natural' and 'purchasing locally', raw milk consumption is becoming more popular. This is nourished by the perception that heating destroys the nutritional and health benefits of milk, and can even induce some detrimental effects. However, due to its high nutritional value together with the neutral pH and high water activity, raw milk serves as an excellent growth medium for different micro-organisms, whose multiplication depends mainly on temperature and on competing micro-organisms and their metabolic products. In order to guarantee its microbial safety and to prolong its shelf-life, milk is heat treated.\n\n'The impact of milk pasteurization on public health can be clearly illustrated by means of historical data. Before 1938, an estimated 25% of all foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks in the USA were associated with milk, whereas nowadays, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk is estimated to be below 1%. Between 1880 and 1907, 29 milk-borne outbreaks were reported on average each year in the USA. With the adoption of pasteurization in 1938, milk-borne diseases dropped to only 46 outbreaks during the 19-year period from 1973 to 1992, corresponding to an average of 2.4 outbreaks each year. A recent report of the USA CDC indicates that the vast majority of milk-borne outbreaks in the USA are in states that permit the sale of raw milk. In England and Wales, the great majority of milk-borne outbreaks during the 1980s were attributed to the consumption of raw milk. In Scotland, a similar situation existed until the sale of unpasteurized milk was prohibited in 1983, which led to a significant drop of the incidence of diseases related to liquid milk consumption.\n\n'In the mid-20th century, the main illnesses associated with raw milk consumption were brucellosis and tuberculosis. These have been eradicated as milk-borne diseases in developed countries, mainly through herd certification programs which included culling of infected animals, the installation of refrigerated bulk tanks for milk collection on farms, and the introduction of pasteurization. In the past, pasteurization conditions were standardized based on the destruction of _Mycobacterium bovis_, a relatively heat-resistant non-sporogenic bacterium that formerly was among the most serious pathogenic bacteria present in milk. Pasteurization standards today are based upon the destruction of _Coxiella burnetii_ the most heat-resistant milk-borne zoonotic pathogen known. In the past 30 years, several previously unrecognized foodborne bacterial infections, including infection with _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Escherichia coli_ strain O157 (or more general verocytotoxin-producing pathogenic _E. coli_ [VTEC]), have emerged as significant causes of human morbidity and mortality. Pathogens mainly present in raw milk today are, among others, _C. jejuni_, _Salmonella_ spp., _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, pathogenic _E. coli_ and _Yersinia enterocolitica_.\n\n'In Europe, the current regulatory microbial criteria for raw cow milk are less than or equal to 100 000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for plate count (at 30 deg C/86 deg F) and less than or equal to 400 000 cfu/ml for somatic cells, as is stipulated in Regulation (EC) 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs. In this Regulation, health requirements for production animals and hygienic requirements on milk production holdings (such as, regarding premises and equipment, hygiene during milking, collection, and transport, staff hygiene) are established as well. In general, raw milk intended for human consumption must meet the requirements of the General Food Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002) and be free of pathogens. Even though improvements in hygiene resulted in routine production of raw cow milk with less than 20 000 cfu (total flora)/ml), this does not guarantee raw milk to be free of pathogens. In approximately 1-6% of the human outbreaks reported in developed countries, milk has been identified as the vehicle of infection. An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5% of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1% attributed to milk, 53.1% to cheese, and 7.8% to other milk products.\n\n'Whereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw cow milk at one hand, and to evaluate the effect of heat treatments of milk on these risks and benefits on the other hand, considering the microbiological as well as the nutritional (health) aspects.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n'In this evaluation it is clearly demonstrated that the consumption of raw milk poses a realistic and unnecessary health threat because of its possible contamination with pathogenic bacteria. It is therefore recommended to heat [raw] milk before consumption, especially when served to young children, pregnant women, or any person suffering from a chronic disease or a suppressed immune system. In this context the attention is drawn to raw milk provided on farms to the general public (such as during a school visit) and raw milk distributors allowing the automatic supply of raw milk from a bulk reservoir to the consumer. From a nutritional point of view, infants should only be given 'infant formula' since unprocessed milk does not fulfill the nutritional needs of this age group [as opposed to breast milk - Mod.JW].\n\n'Historical data show that the pasteurization of milk has led to improved public health and more recent data on occasional raw milk consumption indicate the hazard of bacterial infections, which could be avoided by a heat treatment. At present, thermal treatment remains the most frequently used and most effective method to increase the microbiological safety of milk without substantially changing the nutritional value of milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption. Table 4 [see original URL above] summarizes the main (claimed) benefits of raw milk consumption and the (claimed) detrimental effects of heating discussed in the present paper. Almost all arguments put forward by raw milk proponents for not heating milk, can be refuted, and the only substantial disadvantage of heating is the change in the organoleptic profile [taste] of milk. It is clear that this 'detrimental' effect of heating does not countervail the risk posed by raw milk consumption, namely of a milk-borne pathogen infection, which can have serious health consequences.' - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nNorway: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/107]", "summary": "In this context the attention is drawn to raw milk provided on farms to the general public (such as during a school visit) and raw milk distributors allowing the automatic supply of raw milk from a bulk reservoir to the consumer.

With the exception of an altered organoleptic profile [taste], heating (in particular ultra-high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption. In the context of the prevailing trend toward more natural products, there seems to be an increasing preference for raw milk consumption as raw milk is associated with several perceived health benefits that are believed to be destroyed upon heating. Almost all arguments put forward by raw milk proponents for not heating milk, can be refuted, and the only substantial disadvantage of heating is the change in the organoleptic profile [taste] of milk. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw cow milk at one hand, and to evaluate the effect of heat treatments of milk on these risks and benefits on the other hand, considering the microbiological as well as the nutritional (health) aspects. The consumption of raw milk is not well-documented, but in the context of the current trend toward 'consuming natural' and 'purchasing locally', raw milk consumption is becoming more popular. \n\n'Historical data show that the pasteurization of milk has led to improved public health and more recent data on occasional raw milk consumption indicate the hazard of bacterial infections, which could be avoided by a heat treatment. Even though improvements in hygiene resulted in routine production of raw cow milk with less than 20 000 cfu (total flora)/ml), this does not guarantee raw milk to be free of pathogens. It is clear that this 'detrimental' effect of heating does not countervail the risk posed by raw milk consumption, namely of a milk-borne pathogen infection, which can have serious health consequences.' Both microbiological aspects (such as, the prevalence of milk-borne pathogens, pathogen growth inhibition by antimicrobial systems and by lactic acid producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria, etc.) and nutritional or health aspects (nutritional value, immunity, allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, milk digestibility, etc.) are considered. In England and Wales, the great majority of milk-borne outbreaks during the 1980s were attributed to the consumption of raw milk. A recent report of the USA CDC indicates that the vast majority of milk-borne outbreaks in the USA are in states that permit the sale of raw milk. Whereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates. In industrialized countries, milk-borne and milk product-borne outbreaks represent 2-6% of the bacterial foodborne outbreaks. In 2017, the Ministry of Health and Care Services told Mattilsynet to prepare a draft regulation that allowed a limited sale of unpasteurized, raw milk and raw cream for human consumption. Before 1938, an estimated 25% of all foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks in the USA were associated with milk, whereas nowadays, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk is estimated to be below 1%. These have been eradicated as milk-borne diseases in developed countries, mainly through herd certification programs which included culling of infected animals, the installation of refrigerated bulk tanks for milk collection on farms, and the introduction of pasteurization. In Scotland, a similar situation existed until the sale of unpasteurized milk was prohibited in 1983, which led to a significant drop of the incidence of diseases related to liquid milk consumption. \n\n'The aim of this review is to present scientifically sound data regarding the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw and heated cow milk. \n\n'As such, it is demonstrated that consumption of raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. Proposed changes in the rules could have seen farms sell up to 5000 liters of raw milk or raw cream per year if certain conditions were met, such as satisfactory hygiene and including a warning statement. From a nutritional point of view, infants should only be given 'infant formula' since unprocessed milk does not fulfill the nutritional needs of this age group [as opposed to breast milk - Mod. \n\n'In Europe, the current regulatory microbial criteria for raw cow milk are less than or equal to 100 000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for plate count (at 30 deg C/86 deg F) and less than or equal to 400 000 cfu/ml for somatic cells, as is stipulated in Regulation (EC) In this evaluation it is clearly demonstrated that the consumption of raw milk poses a realistic and unnecessary health threat because of its possible contamination with pathogenic bacteria.

Meanwhile, Heaven on Earth Farm owner Jahjah Melhem announced Friday [17 Mar 2017] that the farm is no longer open to the public.\n\n'In the past 4 years, Heaven on Earth Farm has had the pleasure of meeting so many of you. There has been a ton of love and support that visited the property at any given time,' Melhem says on the farm's Facebook page. 'We have decided that it is in our best interest to close the farm to the public so that we can focus on the well-being of the animals.'\n\nHe said he is working with the Health Department to determine the origin of the reported sicknesses. He said he isn't sure anyone was infected at the farm, but it is possible. 'People come every day with their kids, and we never had a problem,' Melhem said. 'I'm fine. I'm here every day. Three or 4 women are here every day, and none of them are sick.'\n\nThe farm has attracted 600 people since mid-February 2017 to help Melhem with 30 baby goats he rescued to avoid their slaughter. He asked for volunteers, he said, because the goats needed bottle-feeding 4 times a day.\n\nOn Thursday [16 Mar 2017], a Health Department researcher told him she had 3-4 cases of people who visited the farm becoming sick later. Since then, the department has associated additional illnesses with the farm. To help prevent a spread of the infections, those sickened after the Heaven on Earth visits should wash their hands frequently and, in some cases, they should avoid working in food services, schools, and other group settings, officials said.\n\nThe Health Department is focusing on the cryptosporidium parasite as the main culprit in the illnesses. 'Cryptosporidium can be found in water, food, soil or on surfaces and dirty hands that have been contaminated with the feces of humans and animals infected with the parasite,' the department's advisory says. The parasite is spread by 'the fecal-oral route,' the advisory says. Someone touches feces, possibly on materials contaminated by animal droppings or human diarrhea, and then the infection enters the body by touching the mouth.\n\nThe department encourages hand washing with hot water. Its advisory says hand sanitizer is not adequate; even the chlorine in swimming pools is not enough to kill the parasite.\n\nFor most people, the cryptosporidium infection lasts up to 20 days while the body fights it off, the advisory says. But in people with weaker immune systems, such as those with HIV infections, the parasite can have more serious complications, including death.\n\nIn its 4 years, the Heaven on Earth Farm has rescued 75 to 80 animals, Melhem said. Among the animals are goats, sheep, pot-bellied pigs, sows, alpacas, donkeys, peacocks, cows and bulls.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is well known that so called 'petting farms' -- where children come in close contact with young animals -- include a risk of infections.

Any products made from raw milk should also be viewed as a health danger, the state warns. Raw milk is any milk that has not gone through pasteurization, a heating process to destroy potentially harmful bacteria, including _Campylobacter_, _E. coli_, _Listeria_, _Salmonella_ and _Cryptosporidium_.\n\nThe crypto parasite is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside a host body for some time. It is very tolerant of chlorine disinfection. There are numerous strains of crypto that can infect animals and a few that can infect humans. Water, including drinking and recreational water, is the most common way for the parasite to spread. It is the leading cause of waterborne disease in the USA, where some of the larger outbreaks have been at swimming pools and splash parks in Southwestern states.\n\nThe Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on 27 Feb 2015, said unpasteurized, raw milk was the source of 2 cryptosporidiosis cases in August 2014 that were linked to a state-licensed dairy in Idaho.

There have been 20 cases of the disease, usually spread by water, reported in Devon.\n\nDr Toyin Ejidokun, from PHE South West, said: 'Cryptosporidiosis is predominantly a waterborne disease and infection can be caused by drinking contaminated water or swallowing contaminated water in swimming pools or streams. 'It can also be acquired by animal and human contact.'\n\nPHE is investigating to find the source or sources of the infection.\n\n_Cryptosporidium_ is a parasite that lives in, or on, another organism. It can infect your bowels and cause cryptosporidiosis. This is a form of bowel infection called gastroenteritis, which leads to diarrhoea and vomiting. Infection can occur in humans and animals and is spread by contact with soil, water, food or surfaces that have been contaminated by infected faeces containing the parasite.\n\nYoung children are most likely to become infected. Symptoms usually last for up to 2 weeks, sometimes longer. Symptoms can be very severe in people whose immune system is not working properly. No specific treatment is needed for most people but you should drink plenty of fluids to avoid lack of body fluid (dehydration). You should not use a swimming pool for 14 days after the infection has cleared.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of infection is possible -- for example, by not washing your hands after changing the nappy of an infected child and then putting your hands in your mouth. Outbreaks can occur within a household or, for example, within nurseries. Animal-to-human transmission is also possible. This is commonly through contact with infected animals in farms or zoos or through contact with infected animal dung.\n\nYou may also become infected if you drink contaminated water. In fact, the largest outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have occurred when drinking water becomes contaminated with sewage or manure. Adequate filtration of water is needed to remove the parasite. Swimming in contaminated water (for example, in lakes or rivers) can also cause infection. Outbreaks have also occurred through swimming pool contamination, as chlorination doesn't always kill the parasite.\n\nEating contaminated food is a less common way that you may become infected with _Cryptosporidium_. For example, food that is washed in contaminated water or fruit or vegetables that are contaminated by infected manure that has been used to encourage them to grow. Unpasteurised milk may also be a source of infection.\n\n[Byline: Neil Shaw]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Infection with _Cryptosporidium_ spp. is well known in areas where drinking water is drawn from surface water sources, including the UK.

This year's [2016] cases of diagnosed cryptosporidiosis spiked to 423 [Mon 31 Aug 2016], up from 250 last week, marking a nearly 70 per cent increase in just a few days, according to Jose Rodriguez, spokesman for Columbus Public Health.\n\nThe 2-county outbreak is the largest one that health departments in Columbus and Franklin and Delaware counties have seen in 15 years. On average, the entire state typically logs about 400 cases of cryptosporidiosis in a year, said Melanie Amato, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Health.\n\nSince declaring it a community outbreak on [11 Aug 2016], health officials have emphasized the parasitic disease's ability to spread quickly through water in swimming pools, splash pads, and water parks. But the highly contagious illness also can be transferred through human-to-human contact in homes, schools, and daycare centers -- the likely cause of many recent cases, said Dr Teresa Long, the city's health commissioner. 'We're seeing more transmission within families, which is one reason why the number is going up so fast,' Long said.\n\nOf this year's [2016] 423 central Ohio cases, 249 are in Columbus, 130 are in Franklin County, and 44 are in Delaware County. About 60 per cent of the patients are younger than 18 years old.\n\nCryptosporidiosis is caused by a microscopic parasite that is spread through feces and can cause infection when swallowed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The parasite most commonly moves through water and is resistant to chlorine disinfection. If people who are sick don't regularly wash their hands, especially after using the restroom, they can contaminate objects and spread cryptosporidiosis by people touching that object and then their mouth, Long said. And a sick person can spread the germs several days after diarrhea subsides, sometimes as long as 2 weeks after, Long said.\n\nAs families gather over Labor Day weekend [3-5 Sep 2016], it's crucial to practice good hygiene if an infected person is present, she said. That includes regularly disinfecting shared spaces and objects in kitchens and bathrooms, and practicing frequent hand-washing with soap and water. The cryptosporidiosis germ is hardy and gel hand sanitizers likely won't kill it.\n\nHealth officials already have reached out to pool operators and physicians about the outbreak, and are working with schools and day-care centers. Many area pools have been 'hyper-chlorinated' to flush out traces of the disease before the pools close for the season. But because infected people stay contagious for so long, 'we haven't seen the numbers stabilize yet,' Long said. 'We'd like to get to that plateau phase very soon.'\n\nSymptoms of cryptosporidiosis include watery diarrhea, stomach pains, and vomiting. The disease can be serious for people with compromised immune systems. It typically isn't life-threatening in healthy people, but it's important to stay home and hydrated if you're experiencing frequent diarrhea, officials say.\n\nCryptosporidiosis often occurs in isolated cases. Outbreaks are less common. Central Ohio most recently encountered this many cases in 2008, when Delaware and Franklin counties saw nearly 350 cases, Rodriguez said.\n\nMost counties across Ohio have reported just a handful of cryptosporidiosis cases this summer [2016], according to data provided by the Ohio Department of Health. Union County, which borders Delaware County, reported 34 infected people. Stark County, in northeast Ohio, reported 20 cases.\n\n[byline: Alissa Widman Neese]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is an interesting hypothesis that the spread of infection is due to spread in families which then contaminate new common water recreational areas.

MMWR Surveill Summ. 2011 Sep 23;60(12):1-32\n\nSince 1978, CDC, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists have collaborated on the Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance System (WBDOSS) for collecting and reporting data on waterborne disease outbreaks associated with recreational water. This surveillance system is the primary source of data concerning the scope and health effects of waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States. In addition, data are collected on other select recreational water--associated health events, including pool chemical--associated health events and single cases of Vibrio wound infection and primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).\n\nData presented summarize recreational water--associated outbreaks and other health events that occurred during January 2007--December 2008. Previously unreported data on outbreaks that have occurred since 1978 also are presented. The WBDOSS database includes data on outbreaks associated with recreational water, drinking water, water not intended for drinking (excluding recreational water), and water use of unknown intent. Public health agencies in the states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Freely Associated States are primarily responsible for detecting and investigating waterborne disease outbreaks and voluntarily reporting them to CDC using a standard form. Only data on outbreaks associated with recreational water are summarized in this report. Data on other recreational water--associated health events reported to CDC, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) also are summarized.\n\nRESULTS\n-------------\nA total of 134 recreational water--associated outbreaks were reported by 38 states and Puerto Rico for 2007--2008. These outbreaks resulted in at least 13 966 cases. The median outbreak size was 11 cases (range: 2--5,697 cases). A total of 116 (86.6%) outbreaks were associated with treated recreational water (e.g., pools and interactive fountains) and resulted in 13 480 (96.5%) cases. Of the 134 outbreaks, 81 (60.4%) were outbreaks of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI); 24 (17.9%) were outbreaks of dermatologic illnesses, conditions, or symptoms; and 17 (12.7%) were outbreaks of acute respiratory illness. Outbreaks of AGI resulted in 12 477 (89.3%) cases. The etiology was laboratory-confirmed for 105 (78.4%) of the 134 outbreaks. Of the 105 outbreaks with a laboratory-confirmed etiology, 68 (64.8%) were caused by parasites, 22 (21.0%) by bacteria, five (4.8%) by viruses, nine (8.6%) by chemicals or toxins, and one (1.0%) by multiple etiology types. Cryptosporidium was confirmed as the etiologic agent of 60 (44.8%) of 134 outbreaks, resulting in 12 154 (87.0%) cases; 58 (96.7%) of these outbreaks, resulting in a total of 12 137 (99.9%) cases, were associated with treated recreational water. A total of 32 pool chemical--associated health events that occurred in a public or residential setting were reported to WBDOSS by Maryland and Michigan. These events resulted in 48 cases of illness or injury; 26 (81.3%) events could be attributed at least partially to chemical handling errors (e.g., mixing incompatible chemicals). ATSDR's Hazardous Substance Emergency Events Surveillance System received 92 reports of hazardous substance events that occurred at aquatic facilities. More than half of these events (55 [59.8%]) involved injured persons; the most frequently reported primary contributing factor was human error. Estimates based on CPSC's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) data indicate that 4574 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2703--6446) emergency department (ED) visits attributable to pool chemical--associated injuries occurred in 2008; the most frequent diagnosis was poisoning (1784 ED visits [95% CI: 585--2984]). NEISS data indicate that pool chemical--associated health events occur frequently in residential settings. A total of 236 Vibrio wound infections were reported to be associated with recreational water exposure; 36 (48.6%) of the 74 hospitalized vibriosis patients and six (66.7%) of the nine vibriosis patients who died had V. vulnificus infections. Eight fatal cases of PAM occurred after exposure to warm untreated freshwater.\n\nINTERPRETATION\n-------------------------\nThe 134 recreational water--associated outbreaks reported for 2007--2008 represent a substantial increase over the 78 outbreaks reported for 2005--2006 and the largest number of outbreaks ever reported to WBDOSS for a 2-year period. Outbreaks, especially the largest ones, were most frequently associated with treated recreational water and characterized by AGI. Cryptosporidium remains the leading etiologic agent. Pool chemical--associated health events occur frequently but are preventable. Data on other select recreational water--associated health events further elucidate the epidemiology of U.S. waterborne disease by highlighting less frequently implicated types of recreational water (e.g., oceans) and detected types of recreational water--associated illness (i.e., not AGI).\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS\n--------------------------------------\nCDC uses waterborne disease outbreak surveillance data to 1) identify the types of etiologic agents, recreational water venues, and settings associated with waterborne disease outbreaks; 2) evaluate the adequacy of regulations and public awareness activities to promote healthy and safe swimming; and 3) establish public health priorities to improve prevention efforts, guidelines, and regulations at the local, state, and federal levels. - Mod.

But she said each facility has been working with the Maricopa County Environmental Services Department to follow CDC-recommended procedures for decontamination.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, crypto and other germs that cause recreational water illnesses can be spread by swallowing water contaminated with fecal matter. Most of these germs, such as _E. coli_ or _Giardia_, are killed or neutralized within minutes of exposure to chlorine.

This outbreak is not tied to any one location. A spokesperson with Columbus Public Health says there have been 62 cases in Columbus, 34 in Franklin County and 11 in Delaware County.\n\nA large portion of the cases include people with multiple exposures at various recreational water facilities throughout the 3 jurisdictions.\n\nRecently, Zoombezi Bay reported several cases of illnesses from crypto, and according to Columbus Public Health there is an overall increase of cases in area communities.\n\nPublic health officials are calling for safety measures residents can take to reduce the spread of the illness. When heading to a spray fountain, pool or water park:\n- Do not swim when you have diarrhea and for 2 weeks after you recovered.\n- Do not pee or poop in the water.\n- Take a shower/bathe before going in the water.\n- Wash hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, changing diapers and before eating.\n- Change diapers in a bathroom and not by the pool.\n- Take kids on frequent bathroom breaks and check diapers often.\n- Avoid swallowing any water and keep it out of your mouth.\n\n'So, you don't really have to have a fecal accident in the water or a poop accident in the water to contaminate the water system or contaminate others,' said Jose Rodriguez, Director of Public Affairs and Communications for Columbus Public Health. 'It is really important that if you go to the bathroom and have a bowel movement you cleanse yourself thoroughly.'\n\n'The key message is if people are sick, (they) should not go to a swimming pool,' said Rodriguez.\n\nCrypto is found in the fecal matter of a person who has been infected by crypto. It is spread by swallowing water that has been contaminated with fecal matter containing crypto. It can also be spread from human-to-human contact.\n\nSymptoms include watery diarrhea with abdominal pain and cramping, which can be accompanied by dehydration, weight loss, fever, nausea and vomiting. Symptoms can last for 2 weeks, with improvement often followed by recurrence. Infected persons can continue to spread the disease for several weeks after diarrhea subsides, so they should avoid activities involving recreational waters for at least 2 weeks after diarrhea subsides and practice diligent handwashing.\n\nFor more information, visit Columbus Public Health [https://www.columbus.gov/publichealth/alerts/Increase-in-Cryptosporidium-Cases-Prompts-Public-Health-Recommendations/], Delaware General Health District [http://www.delawarehealth.org/], or Franklin County Public Health [http://myfcph.org/] or on Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/ColumbusPublicHealth/] or Twitter [https://twitter.com/columbushealth].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[It is interesting that the cases are spread over many locations but a common denominator is contact with recreational water sources.

In all cases, individuals had taken field trips to Nelson Farm, according to a health advisory issued by the agency 26 May [2016].\n\nOn the morning of 26 May [2016], Department of Health officials visited the farm to tour its facilities, according to the Nelson Farm owner.\n\n'Right now we don't even know if it came from our farm,' he said. 'We won't know until next week (when the test results come back).'\n\nOutbreaks associated with farm animal contact may include multiple pathogens including _Salmonella_, _Campylobacter_, Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC), and _Cryptosporidium_, the health advisory states. The incubation period for these illnesses range from 12 hours to as long as 14 days.\n\nThe Nelson Farm owner said he was informed the evening of 25 May [2016] of the possible outbreak, which came as a surprise. 'We won't deny that there is chance we wouldn't have anything because everything has bacteria,' she added, but emphasized that the Department of Health has not confirmed whether Nelson Farm caused the outbreak.\n\nSince being notified by the state, the Nelson Farm owner has called all the schools that visited Nelson Farm since May 9 to see if children have gotten sick, one of which was the School of St. Philip. Nearly 20 kindergarten, 1st-grade and 2nd-grade students at the School of St. Philip visited the farm 23 May [2016] for their annual spring field trip. 'At this point we have not heard of any instances associated with that outbreak, the school principal said.\n\nWhile on the farm, students toured an old barn, visited animals, played in the hay barn and had lunch at the farm. 'I'm sure we'll be back at Nelson Farm next year. These things happen, and we have to take every precaution that we can, but we're not going to cut them out of our school schedule because they have a very great deal to add to our programming here,' the school principal said.\n\nNelson Farm hosted field trips until 25 May [2016], and field trips will resume in the fall [2016] when school starts again. For the Nelson Farm owners the investigation has become a teaching opportunity in how to prevent the transmission of illnesses. The Nelson Farm owners emphasize the importance of washing hands when touching livestock at the farm as well as county and state fairs.\n\nHand sanitizer is different than hand washing, he said. Some hand sanitizers kill about 99 percent of germs, but the remaining 1 percent is left on the hands. Whereas if a visitor were to wash their hands the 1 percent would go down the drain.\n\n[Byline: Martha Lueders]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See also the Minnesota Department of Health press release: http://www.crowrivermedia.com/mdh-diarrheal-illness-outbreak-news-release/pdf_c5401200-6fa8-5cde-a8c3-1b60aa064a35.html.\n\nCryptosporidia is endemic in farm animals and it is probably not possible to have a cryptosporidia free farm.

PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016;10(4):e0004534, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004534] and I would like to offer a clarification.\n\nThe Moderator is correct that _Cryptosporidium_ spp. is not a tropical parasite. Many news agencies reported our findings with a similar headline, but this was not suggested in our report. Rather, this outbreak investigation provides 2 new insights:\n\nFirst, we detail the sustained transmission of human cryptosporidiosis in the Arctic, moving across 10 remote villages over a period of more than 1 year, in a region where this disease was not previously known. The annual incidence rates (IR) in Nunavik for 2013 and 2014 were respectively 322.5 and 246.4 / 100 000 persons, compared to an IR of 2.4 / 100 000 persons for Canada as a whole in 2013.\n\nSecond, the identification by molecular typing of _C. hominis_ subtype Id in all specimens tested rules-out zoonotic transmission for these specimens, though the possibility remains that other _Cryptosporidium_ subtypes could have been present in specimens that were not characterised. Anthroponotic genospecies of _Cryptosporidium_, with epidemiologic features that suggest sustained person-to-person transmission, are more typically seen in low-income countries than elsewhere in North-America.\n\nSporadic human infections with subtype Id have previously been reported in Ontario and British Columbia, but not in Arctic ecosystems. No animal-derived subtype Id strains have been described. To the best of our knowledge, the _C. hominis_ 'Id subtypes' identified in this study have not been reported previously in Canada.\n\nThere are no farm livestock animals in most Arctic regions. However, in Nunavik, _Cryptosporidium_ spp. has been previously detected in ringed seals, bearded seals and blue mussels, making food-borne transmission through the consumption of marine animals a possible route of infection. Elsewhere in Arctic North America, dogs and caribou have been found to carry _Cryptosporidium_ and may be another source of zoonotic infection. Indeed, in contrast to the current report, the only other study involving the molecular characterization of _Cryptosporidium_ infections in humans in the Arctic, reported only _C. parvum IIa_ in diarrhoeic patients in Nunavut [Iqbal A, Goldfarb DM, Slinger R and Dixon BR.; Prevalence and molecular characterization of _Cryptosporidium_ spp. and _Giardia duodenalis_ in diarrhoeic patients in the Qikiqtani Region, Nunavut, Canada. Int J Circumpolar Health. 2015;74, available at http://www.circumpolarhealthjournal.net/index.php/ijch/article/view/27713]\n\nThe high IR of the Nunavik outbreak and the recent recognition of widespread human cryptosporidiosis in neighboring Nunavut are cause for concern about the possible long-term effects on growth and development of children in Inuit communities facing myriad other challenges. Though repeated enteric infections are thought to be prevalent in these regions, little data currently inform our understanding of their clinical burden and etiologic spectrum. Such data are needed for the development of preventive strategies that take into account human practices and environmental changes that disproportionately affect the Arctic.\n\n--\nCedric Yansouni\nDivision of Infectious Diseases,\nDepartment of Medical Microbiology\nMcGill University Health Centre, Montr\u00e9al\nCanada\n<cpyansouni@yahoo.ca>\n\n[ProMED thanks Professor Cedric Yansouni for this clarifying comments.

The parasite cyst is passed on to humans through contact with animals, contaminated water or food, or through direct contact with human waste such as when changing nappies.\n\nThe disease usually causes diarrhoea, but children may go off their food and vomit before the diarrhoea starts. Diarrhoea is often watery and tends to be accompanied by stomach cramps. Symptoms can come and go but have usually stopped within 4 weeks. In rare cases when a person's immune system is very weak the disease can go on longer and cause complications.\n\nHand hygiene is the key to preventing spread in households and is particularly important for parents with sick children in nappies. Parents should keep young children away from day care for at least 48 hours after symptoms clear. Anyone who has symptoms and handles food at work should also stay off work for 48 hours after symptoms clear.\n\nAnyone with symptoms should stay out of swimming pools for at least 2 weeks after symptoms disappear.

The salads are believed to have been bought from Morrisons and Asda, although an HPA spokeswoman pointed out that most supermarket chains in the UK have the same suppliers, so any one of them could have been affected.\n\nA sample of 25 percent of those who became unwell found 46 percent recalled eating mixed-leaf bagged salad from Morrisons, while 11 percent ate spinach from the Asda chain, the HPA reported. The recall rate is 'extremely high,' as people often cannot remember what they bought, and the figures provide a 'statistically significant association,' the agency say.\n\nExperts believe that the cryptosporidium infection may have come from the spinach, which would have been in both bags. But Morrisons denied that claim, saying the HPA seemed to want to make an 'eye catching announcement' before they are disbanded in 2 weeks.\n\nThe infection is caused by a parasite [_Cryptosporidium_] in the intestine, which causes an acute, short term infection, the most common symptom of which is diarrhoea. The pre-packed salads have come under criticism before, with scientists claiming that they would lead to an increase in food poisoning.\n\nAfter the cryptosporidium outbreak in England and Scotland in May 2012, the HPA launched an investigation. The outbreak was short lived, with most experiencing only moderate symptoms, and the numbers of cases returned to expected seasonal levels within a month of the 1st cases being reported. When they interviewed the people who became unwell about their food history, the HPA discovered the link between the illness and the salads sold at the 2 supermarkets.\n\nThis is not the 1st time pre-packaged vegetables have been linked to illness. A salmonella outbreak in the UK in 2007 was traced back to imported basil, while an _E. coli_ outbreak in America in 2006 was linked back to pre-packed baby spinach. A link to spinach from retailers other than Morrisons and Asda was also suggested but was found to be inconclusive. A spokesperson said: 'Together, these findings suggest that one or more types of salad vegetables could have been contaminated.'\n\nThe HPA confirmed that they could not identify contaminated products in any particular chain of supermarkets because of the time lapse, but interviewing a sample of those who fell ill was a investigation method accepted by health organisations across the world.\n\nThe Food Standards Agency also gathered information on the production and distribution of salad vegetables to try to identify the likely source of the outbreak. But despite investigating the food chain, including the practice and procedures throughout each stage of growing, processing, packing and distribution, they have not managed to identify a source of contamination.\n\nBagged salad on sale in supermarkets is often sourced from the same suppliers for most leaf types, often with common production lines packing product for several retailers at the same time. This was the situation in this case. Dr Stephen Morton, regional director of the HPA's Yorkshire and the Humber region and head of the multi-agency Outbreak Control Team, said: 'This outbreak was fortunately short lived, but it was important to see if we could find the source. Our findings suggest that eating mixed leaf bagged salad was the most likely cause of illness. It is, however, often difficult to identify the source of short lived outbreaks of this type, as by the time that the outbreak can be investigated, the affected food and much of the microbiological evidence may no longer be available.'\n\n'As this was an isolated and short lived outbreak, there is no specific action for the public to take, but we hope the investigations between the FSA and the food industry will help to prevent further outbreaks of this type from happening again.' The FSA added: 'This would appear to have been an isolated, short-lived outbreak, and it does not appear that there are any on-going problems.' They said that consumers should continue to have 'confidence' in ready to eat products.\n\nDr Alison Gleadle, director of food safety at the FSA, reminded people to keep their kitchens clean and wash non-ready-to-eat vegetables. Morrisons say that there is no conclusive evidence for a link between their salad and the outbreak. A spokesperson said: 'Morrisons is not the source of this outbreak. We have received no complaints of illness, and no Morrisons products have tested positive for cryptosporidia. The HPA's claim is based solely on statistics, not testing. The very same statistics also implicated products from other retailers that the HPA recognise as 'implausible.' ... 'The HPA appears to be concerned with making an eye catching announcement before being disbanded in 2 weeks time.'\n\nThere are a number of potential sources for the cryptosporidium parasite, including consumption of contaminated water or food, swimming in contaminated water, or through contact with contaminated food or affected animals. Asda have also denied links to the virus outbreak, claiming that investigation by the HPA is 'statistically flawed.' A spokesperson added: 'Product safety is our top priority, and if we had any serious concerns, we'd act immediately. So far, this has not been necessary.'\n\n[Byline: Hayley Dixon]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Food processing and manufacture are increasingly centralized and distributed to many shops.

During a normal year the health district might see 10 cases.\n\nCrypto [Cryptosporidium] is a parasite that can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting and fever. It can spread through swimming pools and other recreational water. Crypto cases have been reported in Boise and Meridian, but the disease appears to be widespread in the community.\n\nAs a result of the outbreak, the health department is urging the public to take precautions to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nThe health department has advised area swimming pool operators of the situation and many responded by hyper-chlorinating the pools, a technique that kills the parasite. Still, those efforts can be rendered ineffective when people carrying the disease use recreational waters.\n\n'We know the hot weather is driving people to seek relief in area pools, lakes and rivers,' Kimberly Link, Program Manager for Communicable Disease Control at CDHD, said in a press release. 'If you've been ill with diarrhea we can't emphasize enough how important it is to stay out of recreational waters for at least two weeks after your symptoms resolve.'\n\nCryptosporidiosis, commonly known as crypto, is usually spread by accidentally swallowing water that has been contaminated with human stool or animal waste. The most frequent symptom is watery diarrhea with abdominal cramping, which can be accompanied by dehydration, weight loss, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. If people have been in recreational waters and are experiencing persistent, watery diarrhea they are urged to consult their healthcare provider.\n\nOnce a person is infected, the parasites live in the intestines and are passed in the stool. In most instances, infected persons recover without medication. However, a healthcare provider may choose to use medication in cases that do not improve or when other medical issues exist. Infected persons can continue to spread the disease up to two weeks after diarrhea subsides, so they should avoid activities involving recreational waters.\n\nBecause crypto can survive for days even in properly chlorinated pools, the health department is urging people to follow these six steps to help reduce the spread of recreational water illnesses:\n\n1. Don't swim when you have diarrhea. This is especially important for kids in diapers. If you have been diagnosed with crypto, please stay out of swimming pools and recreational waters for at least two weeks after symptoms are gone.\n2. Don't swallow the pool water. In fact, avoid getting water in your mouth.\n3. Practice good hygiene. Take a shower before swimming and wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers. Germs on your body end up in the water.\n4. Take your kids on regular bathroom breaks or change diapers often, and use swim diapers. Waiting to hear 'I have to go' may mean that it's too late.\n5. Change diapers in a bathroom; not at the poolside. Germs can spread to surfaces around the pool and spread illness.\n6. Wash your child thoroughly (especially the rear end) with soap and water before swimming. Everyone has invisible amounts of fecal matter on their bottoms that end up in the pool.Day care providers are urged not to take children with diarrhea to swimming pools. Pool users are also reminded to wash their hands with soap and water\nbefore eating or snacking at poolside.\n\nFor additional information about cryptosporidiosis, please visit the CDC's website at: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto.\n\n--\nCommunicated by ProMED-mail from Health map alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Transmission of cryptosporidia in swimming polls is well known.

The parasite Cryptosporidium is normally associated with contained swimming pools, lakes and salad foods but no source has yet been identified in this outbreak.\n\nPeople in the North East, Yorkshire, West and East Midlands have been\ninfected. Usually outbreaks remain isolated and the source of the infection is quickly identified.\n\nThe Health Protection Agency has investigated the drinking water supply and\nit is thought this is an unlikely cause of the outbreak. The organism can live in soil, food, water and on surfaces contaminated by human or animal faeces.\n\nThe infection known as cryptosporidiosis causes diarrhoea, stomach pains,\ndehydration, weight loss and fever which can least a month or more. Symptoms\ncan be severe in the very young and the elderly, however most people\naffected in the outbreak so far are adults aged between 15 and 45.\n\nA 'handful' of people have been admitted to hospital and have now recovered,\na spokesman for the HPA said. Dr Stephen Morton, who is leading the investigation for the HPA, said: 'It is usual to see an increase in cryptosporidiosis cases in the early summer, but, the increase is higher than we might expect so we are working with NHS partners, local Environmental Health Officers the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Food Standards Agency to see if there is a common source of infection.\n\n'GPs in affected areas have been informed about the recent rise in cases and\nasked to be vigilant to further possible cases.

Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) epidemiologist Trisha Robinson said the confirmed cases probably only represent a fraction of people who were actually sickened by the parasite. The investigation of the outbreak is still in progress.\n\n'One different thing with cryptosporidiosis is the time from when a person is exposed to the time when they become sick can be as long as 2 weeks,' Robinson said. 'Pools were closed on 26 March, so we could still have people becoming ill 2 weeks after that, and their symptoms last anywhere from one to 2 weeks.'\n\nAnother unrelated cryptosporidiosis outbreak in Brainerd [Minnesota] last month resulted in 36 reported cases, with one case being confirmed in a laboratory.\n\nThe symptoms of cryptosporidiosis include stomach cramps, fevers or diarrhea. It can be contracted by swimming in infected water, contact with animals or even drinking raw unpasteurized milk.\n\n'The way that cryptosporidiosis is typically introduced into the water park,and which we believe is the instance in both of these cases, is that it comes in from an infected user,' Robinson said.\n\nIn 2011, there were 305 laboratory-confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis, according to preliminary MDH numbers. Robinson said one person was hospitalized in each of the Brainerd and Duluth outbreaks.\n\n'It certainly can be more dangerous to those who are immune-compromised: the children, the very elderly, pregnant individuals,' Robinson said. 'In Minnesota, we can see about 20 percent of individuals that would require hospitalization for this, so it is something that can cause very serious illness.' Robinson said that people who have been sick with diarrhea in the previous 2 weeks should avoid swimming in recreational waters.\n\n--\nCommunicated by\nPromed Mail from Health Map alerts\n\n[Cryptosporidiosis is endemic in the United States and outbreaks in water parks have been reported before, although not as frequently as outbreaks in swimming pools.

The outbreak has severely\naffected homes and businesses in Ireland's 3rd-biggest city, and\nresidents have been warned that the crisis could last for months.\nDoctors have warned that the parasite could be life threatening,\nespecially to young children, the elderly and people with low immune systems.\nTests found that the city's water supply contained nearly 60 times\nthe safe limit of cryptosporidium pollution.\nResidents have already been unable to drink or use water for food\npreparation for weeks and have complained that no free clean water\nhas been made available by the authorities.\nParents with young families have also expressed real concerns and\ndemanded action. 'It's not right, we shouldn't have to pay for our\nwater when the local supply is polluted,' said Galway resident Sarah Doran.\nGalway City Council has told the BBC News website that they have been\nadvised by the health authorities that tankers of free water could\ncreate further health problems, by increasing the risk of spreading\nbacteria. The mayor of Galway, Niall O Brolchain, has called on the\nIrish government to provide more funding to upgrade water treatment\nservices. However, Irish Environment Minister Dick Roche said that\nthe government had already made 21 million euros [over USD 28\nmillion] available for such projects in Galway, but the local council\nhad failed to make use of the money.\nBusiness leaders have also expressed worries over the impact the\ncrisis will have on what is traditionally the beginning of the\ntourist season in the west of Ireland. One hotelier said it was\ncosting him up to 2000 euros [USD 2700] a week to provide bottled\nwater for his guests, and he was now being forced to install his own\nfiltration system.

'If you've got 51 cases confirmed in a lab, chances are there are hundreds out there,' Public Health medical officer Dr Steven Donohue said.\n\nCairns and Hinterland Health District recorded 51 lab-tested cases of crypto in January [2012], Dr Donohue said. 'In a normal year you might get 10 or 20 cases,' he said, adding the last outbreak in Cairns was in 2008. Dr Donohue sent a warning letter to day care centres to alert them to the outbreak of crypto.\n\nIn the letter, Dr Donohue instructed day care centres to exclude children with diarrhoea until they have not had symptoms for 48 hours. He also recommended that swimming pools at day care centres be disinfected with adequate chlorination or refilled after each session.\n\nQueensland Health is also in the process of notifying swimming pool operators about the health risk, Dr Donohue said. 'We're not blaming the pools but they are a known factor in magnifying the outbreak,' he said. 'The pool operators should be very careful to make sure children with diarrhoea or dirty nappies are not in pools.' Dr Donohue said children who have had diarrhoea should not swim in a public pool for at least 2 weeks after symptoms stop. Cairns Regional Council pools are tested regularly and would continue to be monitored closely, a spokeswoman said.\n\nIn May 2010, the parasite that causes crypto was detected in southern Cairns' water supply, prompting warnings at that time for thousands of residents to boil their drinking water. A council spokeswoman yesterday said the drinking water supply is regularly tested and there was no sign of the parasite that causes crypto in the water.\n\nWhile crypto is generally not serious for most people, those with weakened immune systems could develop severe and long-lasting illness, which may contribute to death. The best protection from crypto is thorough hand washing before eating and after using the toilet, Dr Donohue said.\n\n[Byline: Tarina White]\n\n[Promed Mail from\nHealth map alerts]\n\n[The 2009 outbreak in Sydney (Mayne DJ et al.

The finding means it\nis unlikely that an infected animal or environmental conditions, such\nas the weather, are to blame. Since the beginning of last month\n[February 2009], when the latest outbreak appeared, 628 people have\nfallen ill, compared with 482 in all of last year [2008].\n\nMacquarie University researchers say their testing is experimental,\nand unlikely to identify the origin of the current outbreak, but they\nhope their work will lead to the development of a world-leading,\ninexpensive automated test to quickly identify parasite strains\ninvolved in future outbreaks, allowing sources to be rapidly traced\nand infections contained.\n\nMichelle Power, of Macquarie's biological sciences department, said\ncryptosporidium outbreaks were difficult to trace using existing\ntechnology. There are 2 key parasite 'species' that infect people:\n_Cryptosporidium hominis_, only contracted by direct human to human\ncontact, and _Cryptosporidium parvum_, which can also be transmitted by\nanimals. For each type there were about 40 different strains.\n\nHowever, virtually nothing was known about which strains were\nresponsible for most outbreaks. A decade after the contamination of\nWarragamba Dam, which forced Sydneysiders to boil their water, 'we\nstill just know that it was cryptosporidium,' Dr Power said. 'To put\nit simply, we're looking for the easiest way to fingerprint the organisms.'\n\nWith the new test it should be possible to compare results from\nindividual patients to seek common patterns.\n\n'We could look to see if they had all eaten at the same restaurant,\nor been to the same day-care centre or swimming pool.'\n\nThe NSW Health Department has provided hundreds of fecal samples from\nthe latest outbreak for testing by a Macquarie University parasite\nresearcher, Liette Waldron.\n\n'We have analysed about 250 samples from the current outbreak, and\nthey are all the same strain' of _Cryptosporidium hominis_, Dr Power said.\n\nIf it had originated from different sources she would have expected\nto see multiple strains. When sporadic cases, reported over the past\n12 months, were analysed they identified 24 strains, involving both\nthe human and animal species.\n\nDr Power said people who were infected, but not necessarily appearing\nill, usually had 5000 to 10 000 parasites per gram of faeces.\nHowever, some samples from the latest outbreak contained more than 1\nmillion. 'The more parasites you see, the more nasty it is.'\n\nOver the next 2 years the project, funded by the Australian Research\nCouncil and the Health Department,will 'fingerprint' parasites from\nup to 4000 cryptosporidium patients.\n\n[Byline: Richard Macey]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Genetic fingerprinting is a very useful tool to identify the spread\nof microorganisms in a community and thus to help identify the source\nand transmissison routes.

All 7\nreported drinking raw milk, and those who named a source said it was\nthe Hartmann Dairy Farm, the department said.\n\nLaboratory tests determined the bacterium and parasite in most of the\nill people were genetically identical to samples taken from the farm\nthis summer. Both result in similar symptoms, including fever,\ndiarrhea and vomiting. Cryptosporidiosis can be life threatening for\npeople with weak immune systems.\n\n'We know all these things are carried by cattle and transmitted by\nraw milk. It's not unexpected,' said Kirk Smith, a foodborne diseases\nexpert with the health department. 'Whatever is in cow poop is going\nto wind up in raw milk. It is impossible to produce raw milk without\nthose kinds of things happening.'\n\nSmith said the 7 people were sickened from late July to late August\n2010. He said the lag between the illnesses and the department's\nreport Thursday was due to the time needed for the investigation and\nlaboratory tests.\n\nThe department said it has identified 47 other people who became ill\nsince 1 Jan 2010, after drinking raw milk from a variety of other\nsources throughout the state. Most of those cases have been young\nadults or children.\n\nHartmann's farm was implicated as the source of an outbreak of 8\nconfirmed E. coli infections in May and June. In response, the\nMinnesota Department of Agriculture ordered Hartmann to stop selling\nall milk until he remedied the unsanitary conditions on the farm.\nNichole Neeser, who leads the dairy inspection program for the state\nAgriculture Department, said the restriction remained in effect\nThursday. Because of an ongoing investigation of the farm, she said\nshe couldn't comment further.\n\nAlso this summer, the department prohibited the sale of specific lots\nof meat, cheese and other dairy products from the farm. Hartmann\nfought the embargo in Sibley County court. Neeser said arguments\nfinished in late September 2010 and the judge hasn't yet ruled.\n\nFederal and state regulators have said raw milk carries a risk of\ndisease because it hasn't been through the germ-destroying\npasteurization process. However, interest in raw milk has been\ngrowing among those who think pasteurization reduces milk's nutritional value.\n\n9 U.S. states allow retail sales of raw milk, while another 19,\nincluding Minnesota, allow only direct sales from farmers to consumers.\n\n[Byline: Chris Williams]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella\nmelitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria\nmonocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species,\n_Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with raw\nmilk ingestion.\n\nNon-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_\nTyphi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species,\n_Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from\n_Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated\nwith raw milk ingestion.\n\nOther diseases that can be related to unpasteurized milk are\nhighlighted in these paragraphs extracted from Leedom JM: Milk and\nInfectious Diseases in Humans.

Milk from rabid cows can contain\nrabies virus, and transmission via unpasteurized milk is\ntheoretically possible. Temperatures reached during pasteurization\nkill the virus. 80 persons consumed unpasteurized milk that was\ncollected from the 2 cows, and 9 more had contact with saliva from\nthe cows. All 89 persons received postexposure rabies prophylaxis,\nand no human cases of rabies eventuated. A similar report in Oklahoma\nof possible rabies exposure associated with the consumption of raw\nmilk or cream from a rabid cow was circulated in 2006 (2).\n\nTickborne encephalitis, a zoonotic arbovirus infection usually\ntransmitted to humans by the bite of an _Ixodes persulcatus_ or\n_Ixodes ricinus_ tick, is endemic to Central Europe, Eastern Europe,\nand Russia (3). However, the virus can be found in the milk of cows\nand goats with tickborne encephalitis and was reported to be\ntransmissible to humans by the consumption of unpasteurized milk (4).\nA case-control study failed to confirm oral transmission (5).\n\nA diarrhea syndrome (later named Brainerd diarrhea) occurred among\n122 residents of Brainerd, Minnesota, during the period December\n1983-July 1984 (6). It was characterized by acute onset, marked\nurgency, lack of systemic symptoms, failure to respond to\nconventional antimicrobial agents, and a long median duration of\nillness (median duration, 16.5 months). The syndrome was linked to\nconsumption of raw milk from a single dairy (6). No etiologic agent\nwas ever isolated. The outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea stopped when all\nof the dairy's output was diverted and pasteurized (6, MT Osterholm,\npersonal communication).\n\nSubsequent outbreaks in Illinois and Texas were not directly\nassociated with milk, although cattle had been in the vicinity of an\nIllinois well that had its water implicated as a vehicle of\ntransmission (7). Another outbreak of Brainerd-like diarrhea,\nalthough not associated with raw milk, affected 58 (15 percent) of\n394 passengers aboard a cruise ship visiting the Galapagos Islands in\nEcuador (8).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Our experience\nin Australia, is that cryptosporidiosis is commonly spread from one\ninfected person to another as shown by case control studies and the\ncommonness of secondary spread in households (Robertson et al, 2002).\nIt is often assumed that _Cryptosporidium_ is predominantly a\nwaterborne parasitic infection because of well-publicised waterborne\ndisease outbreaks. Waterborne cryptosporidiosis is clearly important\nwhere water supplies have become contaminated by animal waste (Smith\net al, 2006). However, the vast majority of cases of\ncryptosporidiosis reported to health departments are sporadic with no\nknown source.\nIn Australia, outbreaks of waterborne disease of any aetiology are\nrare. In 1998, Sydney residents were advised to boil water due to\nconcerns about contamination of the water supply with\n_Cryptosporidium_, although numbers of oocysts in water were\nsubsequently thought to be overestimated and there were no associated\nhuman infections.\nEvery 4-6 years, State and Territory health departments report major\ncommunity-wide outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis with some clustering of\ncases occurring around swimming pools and petting zoos (Puech et al,\n2001; Ashbolt et al, 2003). These community-wide increases are not\nrelated to water supplies, as they cross multiple water supply\nsystems and a source cannot be identified for the majority of cases.\nIn reality, the 2 main modes of transmission operating for\n_Cryptosporidium sp._ are from infected animals and infected people\nto susceptible individuals. These 2 modes of transmission probably\nreflect the 2 main species infecting humans: _C. hominis_ and _C.\nparvum_ (Hunter et al, 2007).\nReferences:\n1.

The outbreak was\nreported to the food safety authorities by the company management on 2 Sep\n2005, following the onset of diarrhoea among a large number of employees\nduring that week (week 35). To investigate the cause of diarrhoea, people\nwith symptoms were urged to submit faecal samples for examination, and a\ncase-control study was initiated. The faecal samples tested negative for\ndiarrhoea-causing viruses and bacteria, but 13 of 17 patients were found by\nmicroscopy to be infected with Cryptosporidium.\nThe parasite was subsequently typed as _Cryptosporidium hominis_ by PCR.\nResults of the case-control study indicated that disease was associated\nwith eating in the company canteen in the 1st part of the previous week\n(week 34). Eating food from the salad bar in the canteen was also\nassociated with disease. A 2nd questionnaire-study was conducted during\nweek 39. This was conducted as a cohort study using an electronic form\ndistributed by email to all employees of the company, and contained\nquestions about the individual food items available from the salad bar.\nA total of 364 out of about 600 employees of the company participated in\nthe 2nd study. Of these, 78 met the case definition (diarrhoea with onset\nafter 20 Aug 2005). Disease was associated with eating in the company\ncanteen on Monday (relative risk [RR]: 4.1, 95 percent confidence intervals\n[CI]: 2.2-7.6) or Tuesday (RR: 4.4, 95 percent CI: 2.2-8.8) in week 34, and\neating from the salad bar on those days (RR: 3.1, 95 percent CI: 2.0-4.8\nand RR: 3.1, 95 percent CI: 2.0-4.7, respectively).\nAn analysis of questionnaire responses from people who reported eating from\nthe salad bar found that 2 food items in particular were associated with\ndisease: whole peeled carrots (RR: 2.4, 95 percent CI: 1.5-4.0) and grated\ncarrots (RR: 2.0, 95 percent CI: 1.2-3.5). In a multivariate analysis, only\nthese 2 food items were associated with disease. The whole carrots were\nconsidered to be a probable vehicle for infection, as they were kept in a\nlarge bowl with water. One hypothesis is that employees using the canteen\nmay have taken carrots from the bowl using their hands, and that this\naction could have contaminated the carrots if any of these people were\nhuman carriers of the parasite. There was no evidence to suggest that the\ncarrots were contaminated by the kitchen staff. As a consequence of the\noutbreak, the canteen management has announced that raw vegetables will no\nlonger be served in water.\nA total of 99 people reported onset of diarrhoea after 20 Aug 2005. Only\n2/3 of the individuals assumed to have been exposed to canteen food during\nthe relevant time period participated in the studies, and so the actual\nnumber of infected patients may have been higher.\nOutbreaks of cryptosporidium infections are uncommon in Denmark. The only\nprevious report was a hospital-associated outbreak in 1989, where the\nlikely source of the outbreak was an ice cube machine contaminated by a\npatient excreting the parasite [1]. In Denmark, cryptosporidium infections\nare not notifiable and faecal samples from patients with gastrointestinal\nsymptoms are not always examined for parasites. Therefore, a reliable\nestimate of the incidence is not available. However, based on the number of\npositive samples reported from the diagnostic laboratory at Statens Serum\nInstitut, the infection is believed to be relatively rare compared with\nother gastrointestinal infections.\nReferences:\nRavn P, Lundgren JD, Kjaeldgaard P, Holten-Anderson W, Hojlyng N, Nielsen\nJO et al.

The director of public health, Matsae Balosang,\nsaid on Monday that they suspect the outbreak might be caused by\ncryptosporidium parasites. However, she asserted that further\ninvestigations and tests are needed to confirm the causative organism.\nMicroscopic parasites of the genus _Cryptosporidium_ cause a type of\ndiarrhoea known as cryptosporidiosis. The parasite lives in the intestines\nof human beings and animals and is usually found in the stool.\nBalosang said investigations at the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in\nAtlanta, America have found cryptosporidium in 31 of the 55 samples sent\nfrom Francistown. She emphasised hygienic practices such as washing of\nhands with soap at all times. She encouraged people to boil all drinking\nwater regardless of whether it is from the taps or not and to thoroughly\nwash vegetables and fruits. Balosang said that CDC Atlanta and WHO have\noffered a team of experts -- a virologist and epidemiologist -- to help.\nShe said that although they will observe the affected 10 districts, they\nare currently keeping a keen eye on Mahalapye and Good Hope.\nBalosang said that health workers have been mobilised to areas where there\nis an outbreak. Resources such as bedding, mattresses and back up tents\nhave been dispatched to the districts. She encouraged mothers to\nbreastfeed, emphasising that it is better than formula-feeding. She\ncautioned that bottle feeding require a high level of hygiene. She said\nthat babies are more disadvantaged because of body size and loss of fluids.\nShe called for parents to bring their children to health facilities\nimmediately they show signs of diarrhoea. Meanwhile Bobirwa and\nSelebi-Phikwe areas have experienced at least 18 diarrhoea deaths. Selebi\nPhikwe mayor, Molosiwa Molosiwa said the dead are babies under one year and\nthey were weak even before the onset of diarrhoea. During a full council\nmeeting yesterday Molosiwa called for people to distinguish diarrhoea from\ncholera. He said Botswana has never had a single verified cholera case.\n[byline: Thato Chwaane and Onnalena Modikwa, Staff writers, Mmegi-online]\n--\nAlfonso Rodriguez, M.D.\n<ajrm_msds@yahoo.es>\n[_Cryptosporidium_ spp. occur worldwide and are a well known cause of\ndiarrhoea in children in tropical Africa.

Those affected have come from 32 counties across\nthe state, and from several states, Mexico and Canada.

The\nCommissioner also announced the spray park attraction has been closed for\nthe remainder of the 2005 season.\nThe number of reported illnesses possibly linked to the park has grown to\n746 in 8 counties, prompting the Commissioner to again stress precautionary\nmeasures people should take to keep the illness from spreading further. The\n746 cases have been reported by the following counties: Ontario (309\ncases), Seneca (130 cases), Wayne (97 cases), Monroe (75 cases), Cayuga (56\ncases), Livingston (50 cases), Onondaga (24 cases), and Tompkins (5 cases).\nThe most common symptoms reported are diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea,\nvomiting, fever, headache and loss of appetite. To date, 5 of the cases\nhave been confirmed as cryptosporidiosis: one in Wayne County, one in\nOntario County and 3 in Cayuga County. Additional tests for other possible\ncauses of illness are pending. Of the 746 cases reported, many people have\nsince recovered, and those who are ill are instructed to see their physician.\nThe reported dates of illness range from early July to the present. The\nState Health Department is working with local health departments and the\nState Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to investigate\nthe outbreak. The review is ongoing. Dr. Novello is recommending the\nfollowing precautions:\n1. Persons who visited the Seneca Lake State Park or family members and/or\nclose contacts of ill individuals who visited the park since July and are\nexperiencing gastrointestinal illness should contact their medical provider\nand their local health department (phone numbers below).\n2. Health care workers with patient contact and food workers should notify\ntheir employer if they are experiencing gastrointestinal illness symptoms\nbefore returning to work.\n3. Children and staff with stomach/intestinal illness should refrain from\nattending day care. Day care centers should consult with their local health\ndepartment for recommendations on the timing for return to the day care\nsetting. Children should not be transferred to another day care center.\nDr. Novello also recommends that people take action to minimize the chances\nof acquiring and spreading illness, including thoroughly washing hands\nafter using the toilet, changing diapers, or coming in contact with fecal\nmaterial in any way. Also, swimmers should avoid swallowing water,\nespecially in lakes, ponds, or rivers. To help prevent the spread of\nillness, individuals who are experiencing gastrointestinal illness should\nnot swim while they are sick and for 2 weeks after their symptoms subside.\nIndividuals or family members who visited the State Park and are\nexperiencing gastrointestinal illness should contact their health care\nprovider.\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri, 19 Aug 2005\nFrom: John Marr <jsmarr4@earthlink.com>\nSource: NY Times [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/19/nyregion/19sick.html>\n\nA play area filled with water jets and sprinklers at a state park in\ncentral New York has been identified as the source of a severe intestinal\nillness that has stricken nearly 750 people in 3 weeks, the State Health\nDepartment said yesterday.\nNearly all of the confirmed cases of the disease, a highly contagious\nwaterborne infection called cryptosporidiosis, have so far been traced to\nthe attraction, known as the Sprayground, at Seneca Lake State Park in\nGeneva, N.Y., a Health Department spokesman, Jeffrey W. Hammond, said.\nAlthough none of the people who were infected are known to be critically\nill, the outbreak may be among the largest ever involving cryptosporidiosis\nin New York State, which typically has fewer than 500 cases a year.\nThe Sprayground, which gets about 43 000 visitors every August, was closed\non Monday after health officials noted more than 100 cases of the disease\nin 8 counties. Last night, health officials said tests on a water tank that\nfeeds the play area had tested positive for cryptosporidiosis. The tank,\nwhich uses water supplied by the nearby town of Waterloo, is used solely\nfor the Sprayground and has a chlorination and a filtration system.\nA spokeswoman for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and\nHistoric Preservation, Wendy Gibson, said she thought the tank was the only\nsource of contaminated water, and said that a beach in the park would\nremain open.\nHealth officials said, however, that they had not determined the extent of\nthe contamination and that they planned to run tests on drinking fountains\nand other areas of the park. 'Our investigation is ongoing, but so far we\nknow that that there was crypto in that tank,' Mr. Hammond said.\nThe disease, which emerged in the United States in the 1970's, is known to\nbe one of the most frequent causes of traveler's diarrhea. Experts say it\nis contracted primarily through contaminated food and tainted water\nsupplies and spreads very easily. Once it is picked up, the parasite lodges\nitself in the victim's intestines for days or weeks, producing eggs and\ncausing severe abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea.\nOutbreaks of the disease are fairly common. One of the worst, in Milwaukee\nin 1993, sickened 400 000 people and killed a half-dozen. But generally the\ndisease is not deadly and lasts only about a week in most people, then goes\naway on its own.\nLast night, health officials advised those who had recently visited the\nSprayground and then experienced stomach problems to see a doctor. They\nstressed that people who suspect they have contracted the disease should\nwash their hands frequently and stay away from others; many cases reported\nso far have occurred in groups, often among people in the same household.\nThe first cases in the 8 counties near Seneca Lake emerged in early July,\nofficials said. After an investigation, they found that most of the victims\nwere children who had played in the Sprayground and complained of nausea\nand diarrhea a short time later. 'We closed the Sprayground down\nimmediately, and it's now going to be closed for the season,' Ms. Gibson said.\nThe largest number of cases, 309 as of last night, was in Ontario County,\nand the bulk of all the cases, 746 as of last night, were confirmed this\nweek after the public was alerted to the outbreak. In Tompkins County, 25\ncases were reported Tuesday and Wednesday -- compared with 2-3 in an\naverage year.\nMs. Gibson said the extent of the outbreak might have to do with the\npopularity of the Sprayground, which is about 11 000 square feet and often\nused by parents as well as children.\n'It's accessible for different ages,' Ms. Gibson said. 'The beauty of it is\nthat it is pretty accessible for people and doesn't involve a pool. It's a\nwhole series of sprinklers.'\n[Byline: Anahad O'Connor, NY Times]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 19 Aug 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: WSTM.com\n<http://www.wstm.com/Global/story.asp?s=3742696>\n\nNumber stricken by water park illness tops 1700\n----------------------\nThe number of people who've reported getting sick after visiting an upstate\nNew York water playground has risen to more than 1700.\nThat's according to officials at the state Department of Health in Albany.\nThe agency says 1738 cases of illness have been reported in 20 counties.\nOfficials have traced the illness to the presence of cryptosporidium in 2\nstorage tanks that supply water to the popular 'sprayground' at a park just\noutside Geneva.\nKnown as crypto, the illness causes diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting and\nheadache.\nSo far, health officials have confirmed 13 cases among those who have\nreported getting ill after visiting the park.\nThe state has shut down the sprayground for the rest of the season.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[ProMED-mail would like to thank Lois Levitan <lcl3@cornell.edu> for\nsubmitting an article with similar material on this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]\n[Such parks distribute water as an aerosol, which apparently is a very\neffective way of disseminating cryptosporidia.

Up to 60 cases have been identified in the\nworst-affected regions, such as Lothian. Only Orkney, Shetland, and the\nWestern Isles have not reported the bug in the past month.

'We'll probably start testing soon,'\nsaid Shari Stamer, the city's water quality manager. The number of\ncryptosporidium cases in Lawrence has increased to 15, up from 11 when the\noutbreak was disclosed a week ago today [22 Aug 2003], said Kay Kent,\ndirector of the Lawrence-Douglas County Health Department. There were no\ncases reported in Douglas County in 2002. Federal and state health\nofficials are in Lawrence helping investigate the outbreak.\nStudents at 4 Lawrence elementary schools Thursday were sent home with\nquestionnaires designed to help authorities determine how far the disease\nhas spread -- and whether the outbreak has a common source. 'We've had some\nanecdotal information that there may be more diarrhea in the community, so\nwe're really thinking there might be more cases out there,' Kent said. She\nadded: 'The truth of the matter is we do not know the source.'\nMore than 2/3 of those who contract cryptosporidiosis are children -- and\nKent said Thursday that 11 of the 15 Lawrence victims were younger than 18.\nThe parasite is easily passed in swimming pools, because it is able to\nsurvive outside the body for long periods of time and is resistant to\nlevels of chlorine typically found in pools. In Lawrence, the outbreak was\nserious enough for officials to temporarily shut 4 swimming pools for\ndecontamination.\nThey were closed from Friday until Sunday, some of the hottest days of the\nsummer. Kent said Thursday officials had known since late July 2003 that at\nleast one person with cryptosporidium had been swimming, but they chose not\nto take action at the pools until the number of cases grew larger. The\nclosure orders came after consultation with the federal Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.\nShe said there was not a standard number of cases that prompts pool\nclosures. 'One is not it,' she said. 'But it really had to do with the fact\nof the number (of cases), the number that had ... some similar type of\ncontact.'\nWhile the source is unknown, Kent said some suspects were low on the list\nof possible causes. Terrorism, for example, is unlikely. 'We've asked that\nquestion ourselves,' she said. 'Just because of the location of the cases\nand where they occurred, we don't believe so. But we asked that question --\nyou always ask that question these days.'\nKent said the city's water supply was not suspected. 'At this point in\ntime, we have no reason to believe that the general water supply is\nimplicated,' she said. 'We are looking at all risk factors, though.' Stamer\nsaid the city was not required to test the water supply for\ncryptosporidium, but federal officials were expected to order monthly\ntesting by 2004. An effective test only recently became available. Other\ntests of the system are designed to detect drinking water contamination,\nStamer said.\n'Filtration is the barrier for cryptosporidium -- chlorine does not kill\nit,' she said. 'We watch our filter performance, we've done filter\nperformance testing and that type of thing.' Lawrence draws its water from\nClinton Lake and the notoriously dirty Kansas River. Stamer said\ncryptosporidium might be lurking in those waters before arriving at the\ncity's treatment plants. 'I can't tell the public it's not out there, at\nleast in the source water,' she said. 'It's not a sterile environment, we\nknow that. Because of how we handle our business here, at the plants, and\nhow the work is being done, I'm pretty confident the water is safe.' City\npools aren't regularly tested for the parasite in Lawrence or elsewhere,\nsaid Jimmy Gibbs, the city's aquatics supervisor. Such tests would cost\nupwards of $1000 per sample, he said.\n'Right now, there are no basic regulations or standards,' Gibbs said. 'It's\nkind of one of those things that when it does show up, then you react to\nit.' Kent said city pools on Thursday were tested for the parasite for the\nfirst time. It was not known late Thursday when those test results would be\navailable. 4 officials from the CDC and one from KDHE have been in Lawrence\nthis week helping to investigate the source of the outbreak. Questionnaires\nwent to students of 4 randomly selected schools -- Hillcrest, Prairie Park,\nQuail Run, and Sunflower.\nThe cases do not appear to be centered in any particular neighborhood, Kent\nsaid. 'We actually are going to be pinpointing them,' she said. 'Just\ngetting addresses at this point; they appear to be scattered throughout'\nthe city. She said families should return the surveys today, so officials\ncould analyze the results this weekend. Officials also will conduct phone\ninterviews with residents in coming weeks. 'We will be interviewing the\ncases, then, to find out what they've been doing, to find out what the risk\nfactor is,' Kent said. She did not have a target date for completing the\ninvestigation. 'It's unusual,' Kent said of the outbreak.

The victims had been swimming at the 4 pools.\n'Even if swimming pools were not the original source' of the infection, she\nsaid, 'we're recommending the hyperchlorination of the pools where we have\nhad positive cases.'\nKent closed the city's Lawrence Aquatic Center and the pool at Alvamar Golf\nand Country Club. She also requested the closing of pools at Kansas\nUniversity's Robinson Center and Haskell Indian Nations University. Those\nare state and federal facilities, respectively, not subject to the health\ndepartment's jurisdiction. Officials said Lawrence's water supply was not\nin danger.\nCryptosporidium is a microscopic parasite that causes diarrhea, loose or\nwatery stool, stomach cramps, upset stomach, and a slight fever. It can be\nfatal to patients with weakened immune systems, such as the young, elderly,\nor people with HIV. More than 2/3 of those who contract cryptosporidiosis\nare children.\nThe parasite is easily passed in swimming pools, because it is able to\nsurvive outside the body for long periods of time and is resistant to\nchlorine disinfection. The city's outdoor pool closed at 5 p.m. Friday\ninstead of the usual 9 p.m. City Manager Mike Wildgen said Carl Knox\nNatatorium was being shut down and also would be treated. The Indoor\nAquatic Center was already closed for maintenance.\nLynn Bretz, a KU spokeswoman, said a diving pool at Robinson already was\nclosed for maintenance. The university is complying with the health\ndepartment's request and closing the other pool at the center, a lap pool.\nKent said there were no outbreaks of cryptosporidium in Douglas County in\n2002. 2003's first case appeared in early July; by 23 July, officials knew\nthat more than one person had contracted the parasite. 10 of the 11 people\ndiagnosed with illness had recently been swimming at one of the 4 pools,\nKent said.

Most cases of the illness caused by cryptosporidium have been\nlinked to day care centers and swimming pools. So far, 99 cases have\nbeen reported.\nNone are linked to public drinking-water supplies, said Gianfranco\nPezzino, epidemiologist with the Kansas Department of Health and\nEnvironment. However, the agency is warning health officials and\nresidents of 24 northeast Kansas counties to look out for symptoms.\nCases have been reported in counties that include 3 of the state's\nlargest population centers: Topeka, Lawrence, and suburban Kansas\nCity. The Sedgwick County Health Department is sending out an alert\nto infection-control nurses at area hospitals and to doctors who\nspecialize in infectious disease. Physicians are being asked to test\nfor the parasite if patients have prolonged watery diarrhea or have\nsymptoms of a food-borne or gastrointestinal illness.\nNo cases have been reported in Sedgwick County. Mansoor Tahir, a\nsenior epidemiologist at the Sedgwick County Health Department, said\nhe does not expect an outbreak in Wichita because most swimming pools\nare closed for the year. Cryptosporidium is a one-cell parasite that\ncauses diarrhea and stomach cramps. Though seldom deadly, it can be a\nthreat to people with weakened immune systems, such as AIDS patients.\nSo far, no one has been hospitalized, Pezzino said.\n3 of the people suffering from the parasite were known to have been\nat the Great Wolf Lodge water park in Wyandotte County. The facility\nwas closed and the water was hyperchlorinated to kill the parasite.\nNormal levels of chlorine in pools will not kill cryptosporidium,\nPezzino said. The first cases of cryptosporidiosis surfaced in late\nJuly 2003 in Lawrence, and the total there had reached 82 Friday. 54\nof those were in people under age 18, and many others were in family\nmembers of children who stayed at day care centers where the parasite\nwas found, said Kay Kent, director of the Lawrence-Douglas County\nHealth Department. 5 of the 17 cases in neighboring counties were\nlinked to the Lawrence cases. In addition to Douglas County, 8 cases\nwere identified in Johnson County, 4 in Shawnee County, 2 each in\nJefferson and Leavenworth counties, and one in Wyandotte County.

The majority are associated with\none hotel, but there are a few cases associated with other hotels and with\nno history of having visited the main outbreak hotel. 2 possibilities that\nneed to be considered are contamination of the drinking water supply or\ncontamination of a water theme park used as a popular excursion venue.\nReports are being received of a small number of cases associated with other\nresorts in Mallorca and Menorca.\n\n[Prof. Cartwright has provided information on management of swimming pools\nprovided below. - Mod.MPP]\nThe management of swimming pools associated with Cryptosporidiosis or\ncontaminated by Cryptosporidium oocysts; Pilot Guidance for the U.K.\nFederation of Tour Operators Prepared by Prof. Rodney Cartwright August 2003\nThese notes have been prepared for guidance on the actions to be taken when\ncryptosporidium infection is associated with a swimming pool. They do not\ncover action for prevention of contamination such as a faecal accident\npolicy. Many of the procedures recommended should be undertaken only by an\noperative with the appropriate training. The use of high chlorine levels\nis hazardous and the appropriate health and safety precautions must be\nfollowed.\n1. I am unaware of any published procedure for the decontamination of a\nswimming pool contaminated with cryptosporidium oocysts. There are no\npublished studies on the efficacy of any procedures on the disinfection of\nswimming pools against cryptosporidium, although there is anecdotal\nevidence that certain actions have been associated with the cessation of\nfurther cases of cryptosporidiosis.\n2. There are recommendations for a response to a faecal accident. US\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention in their weekly publication\n(MMWR) of 25 May 2001 includes advice for contamination by a liquid stool.\na. Raise the free available chlorine concentration to 20 mg/L and maintain\nthe pH between 7.2 and 7.5. Ensure this concentration is found throughout\nall co-circulating pools by sampling at least 3 widely spaced locations\naway from return water outlets. This chlorine and pH level should be\nsufficient to inactivate Cryptosporidium and should be maintained for at\nleast 8 hours, equivalent to a CT inactivation value of 9600. A higher or\nlower free available chlorine level/inactivation time can be used as long\nas a CT inactivation value equalling 9600 is maintained for Cryptosporidium\ninactivation. State or local regulators may require higher free available\nchlorine levels in the presence of chlorine stabilizers such as chlorinated\nisocyanurates. If necessary, consult an aquatics professional to determine\nand identify the feasibility, practical methods, and safety considerations\nbefore attempting the hyperchlorination of any pool.\nb. Ensure that the filtration system is operating while the pool reaches\nand maintains the proper free available chlorine concentration during\ndisinfection.\nc. Backwash the filter thoroughly after reaching the CT value. Be sure the\neffluent is discharged directly to waste and in accordance with state or\nlocal regulations. Do not return the backwash through the filter. Where\nappropriate, replace the filter media.\nd. Swimmers may be allowed into the pool after the required CT value has\nbeen achieved and the free available chlorine level has been returned to\nthe normal operating range allowed by the state or local regulatory\nauthority. Maintain the free available chlorine concentration and pH at\nstandard operating levels based on state or local regulations. If\nnecessary, consult state or local regulatory authorities for\nrecommendations on bringing the free available chlorine levels back to an\nacceptable operating range.\nThis guidance assumes a correctly installed and maintained water treatment\nsystem.\n3. The UK Pool Water Treatment Advisory Group (PWTAG) Swimming Pool Water\n-treatment and Quality Standards (1999) following a faecal accident where\nthere is a possibility of cryptosporidium contamination it states and\nrecommends that:\nThe appropriate procedure relies on the fact that the cysts are, in\nprinciple, large enough to be filtered out.\n- The pool is cleared of people immediately.\n- Disinfectant levels are maintained at the top of the recommended range.\n- The pool is vacuumed and swept.\n- Using a coagulant, the water is filtered for 6 turnover cycles (which\ncould well take up to a day, and so might mean closing the pool until the\nnext day).\n- The filter is backwashed.\n- The pool can then be reopened.\nClearly this is a fairly drastic course of action that any pool operator\nwould want to avoid if possible. But if there is a good reason to suspect\nthat Cryptosporidium or Giardia is responsible (certainly if the person\ninvolved has had diarrhoea for some days), it would be the safest\nprocedure. The local consultant in communicable disease control (CCDC)\nshould be notified. A copy of such emergency measures can usefully be\nincluded in the operation and maintenance manual.\n4. In the PWTAG technical guidance note of February 2001 on Cryptosporidium\nconcentrates on coagulation and filtration but does not deal directly with\ndecontamination of a known contaminated pool. They mention chlorine at a\nlevel of 30mg/L for 4 hours as being necessary to kill cryptosporidium\noocysts but make no recommendations on the use of chlorine. Further\ndetailed advice is given on the use of coagulants and filters.\n5. In the UK there is concern on relying on high chlorine levels alone as a\nmeans of disinfection because\na. There are no published data on the effect of chlorine on cryptosporidium\noocysts in a swimming pool. It is understood that the studies that have\nbeen undertaken are in a laboratory setting.\nb. Chlorine is inactivated by organic material and there may be high levels\nof such material in parts of a pool and especially in filters.\nc. It would be necessary for the chlorine to be evenly distributed\nthroughout the pool.\nd. For chlorine to be effective the pH must be carefully controlled (CDC\nrecommend 7.2 - 7.5)\ne. Other chemicals may interfere with the action of the chlorine.\n6. Concerns with filtration include\na. The need for the filters to be operated at the correct pressure and\nwater flow. The optimum operating conditions should be provided by the\nfilter suppliers\nb. The use of sand of the correct particle size in the filters.\nc. Proper maintenance and back washing of the filters.\nd. The time taken for all the pool water to be filtered. Water equivalent\nto the pool volume may pass through in a given time, but the structure of\nthe pool may be such that all the water has not passed through. That is\nthere may be areas of poor circulation in the pool.\n7. Water can be tested for the presence of cryptosporidium\noocysts. Normally 10L grab samples are tested but larger volumes can be\nexamined by the use of a cartridge filter. The volume of water and\ncollection method should be discussed with the test laboratory. Before\nconsidering the appropriate action, an understanding of the water test\nresults is necessary so that misunderstandings do not occur.\na. Cryptosporidium oocysts are not evenly distributed in the\nwater. Therefore the numbers in a sample do not on their own have any\nsignificance. If oocysts are present, that water is contaminated and poses\na potential risk to bathers.\nb. The absence of oocysts in a sample does not mean that there are no\noocysts elsewhere in the pool that could be a hazard to bathers.\nc. All laboratory tests should be undertaken in a laboratory with\naccreditation for cryptosporidium testing in water. The test method should\nbe based on the US EPA Analytical Method 1662 'Cryptosporidium in Water by\nFiltraion/IMS/FA'\nd. The tests undertaken do not distinguish between live and dead\noocysts. As a rule of thumb they should all be regarded as alive and\npotentially infectious.\ne. If a suspect pool has negative test results for oocysts, further samples\n-- including a backwash and a sample of sand from the top 30cm of the\nfilter -- should be examined.\nf. Examining the deposit from the pump strainer is also worth considering.\n8. The following scenarios are being met associated with hotel pools.\na. 3 or more cases of cryptosporidiosis from different families using a\nswimming pool. This may be accompanied by an increase in illnesses with\ndiarrhoea, and no other obvious cause, among other pool users. Pool water\nsamples containing cryptosporidium oocysts\nb. As for (a) with no oocysts demonstrated in water samples.\nc. Oocysts demonstrated in pool water samples but no associated cases of\nunexplained diarrhoea.\n9. Scenario 3 or more cases of cryptosporidiosis from different families\nusing a swimming pool. This may be accompanied by an increase in illnesses\nwith diarrhoea, and no other obvious cause, among other pool\nusers. Oocysts found in water tests\na. Empty the pool\nb. Thoroughly clean all pipe work and associated tanks\nc. Replace the sand in the filters\nd. Refill the pool and chlorinate to 20 mg/L at pH 7.2 - 7.5 for 8 hours\n10. Scenario 3 or more cases of cryptosporidiosis from different families\nusing a swimming pool. This may be accompanied by an increase in illnesses\nwith diarrhoea, and no other obvious cause, among other pool users. No\noocysts found in water tests\na. Test further water samples and especially backwash samples. Test\nsamples of sand taken from the top 30 cm of the sand filters.

Using optimised coagulation, filter for 6 turnover cycles (which may\nmean closing the pool for a day). This assumes good hydraulics and filters\nthat have been correctly installed and maintained.\ne. Backwash the filters individually, NOT through other filters.\nf. Check free chlorine residuals and pH and if they are satisfactory reopen\nthe pool.\n12. General Considerations in all scenarios\na. Ensure that any water used to fill or top up the pool is free from\nCryptosporidium\nb. Ensure that the pool operation is in accordance with sound water\ntreatment principles as for example in the PWTAG Swimming Pool Water\n-Treatment and Quality Standards (1999)\nc.

The incubation period was\nassumed to be within a range of 2 to 10 days, and duration of the illness\nwas between several days and 2 weeks.\nThe recruits were stationed in barracks with a permanent kitchen catered\nfor by a cook. The meals were transported into the field in insulating\ncontainers or eaten in the barracks. Drinks included mainly bottled mineral\nwater, juice concentrate diluted with tap water, and tea. The menu included\nvarious hot and cold meals and leafy and mixed salads. During the exercise\nthe weather was very hot and no rain fell. Sheep graze regularly on the field.\nAnalyses of stool specimens helped to rule out bacterial pathogens, such as\n_Salmonella_, _Yersinia_, _Shigella_, [pathogenic] _Escherichia coli_, or\n_Bacillus cereus_ only a few days into the investigation. Cryptosporidia\nwere found. In 15 of 217 the stool specimens requested after from recovered\nand still ill participants in the exercise, and _Cryptosporidium_ enzyme\nlinked immunosorbent assay found _Cryptosporidium_ antigen. These findings\nwere confirmed by immunofluorescence assay and microscopy.\nThe low number of positives may be due to the fact that the specimens were\ntaken only 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. Most people did not have\ngastrointestinal complaints any more and therefore would not have excreted\noocysts. Analysis of food samples did not show any fecal or bacterial\ncontamination. No investigation for _Cryptosporidium_ was performed because\nat this point no parasites were taken into consideration.\nThe result of the microbiological analysis of the drinking water on the\nsite was inconclusive. A second analysis of the reservoir for drinking\nwater and the kitchen water supply for cryptosporidia (filtration of 300\nlitres) and of 5 liters of mineral water imported from Italy yielded no\nresults, as did an examination of sheep droppings.\nReference:\n----------\nRKI.
