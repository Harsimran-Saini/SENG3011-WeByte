As of 25 Dec [2019] at 4 p.m., the number of people testing positive for brucellosis had reached 181. Aside from one person with clinical symptoms, all the others did not have clinical symptoms and were not ill.\n\nThe official website stated that this event happened from 24 Jul-20 Aug 2019. China Animal Husbandry Industry Co., Ltd.'s biopharmaceutical plant produces brucellosis vaccine for animal use. Because disinfectant [used in the fermenter] had expired, exhaust gas containing vaccine strain was insufficiently sterilized. As the Lanzhou Veterinary Institute is downwind from the biopharmaceutical plant, [the exhaust gas] was inhaled or made contact with mucous membranes causing the positive brucellosis antibodies event.\n\nInvestigation found that from July to August 2019, winds in Lanzhou are mainly southeastern at windspeed level 2 to 3. Waste gases containing pathogen released by the biopharmaceutical plant were aerosolized and carried by the wind to a limited distance. Exposure levels were very low. So there would not be large numbers of people with positive antibodies. Thorough investigations led to the official conclusion that this was an accidental event.\n\nChina Animal Husbandry Industry Co., Ltd.'s biopharmaceutical plant's brucellosis vaccine production plant stopped production on 7 Dec 2019.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver\n\n[An explanation of the 2019 event. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nGansu Province, China: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/333]\nSee Also\n2019\n----\nBrucellosis - China: (GS) veterinary institute, RFI 20191209.6831365\nBrucellosis - Algeria (02): (BU) humans, goats, unpasteurized milk 20190904.6657507\nBrucellosis - Turkey: (MU) 20190801.6600568\nBrucellosis - Iran 20190730.6596338\nBrucellosis - USA (03): (DE) Mexican unpasteurized dairy products 20190615.6522381\nBrucellosis - Algeria: (TR) unpasteurized dairy 20190611.6514716\nBrucellosis - Mexico: (SLP) unpasteurized goat cheese 20190318.6374217\nBrucellosis - USA (02): CDC, sale of unpasteurized milk across state lines 20190219.6325115\nBrucellosis - USA: sale of unpasteurized milk across state lines 20190128.6280591\nBrucellosis - South Africa: (LP) unpasteurized milk, fatal 20190126.6278984\n2018\n----\nBrucellosis - USA (08): (PA) bovine, human 20181227.6223249\nBrucellosis - Algeria: (TO) unpasteurized cow's milk 20180710.5896040\nBrucellosis - USA (03): (OR) B. abortus vaccine infection, needle stick, 2017 20180705.5890072\nBrucellosis - USA: (TX) unpasteurized milk, B. abortus vaccine strain, 2017, CDC 20180308.5674369\nBrucellosis - Nigeria: (BA) butchers, serosurvey 20180214.5626680\nBrucellosis - Paraguay (02): (AS) veterinary school 20180111.5550970\nBrucellosis - Paraguay: (AS) veterinary school, fatal 20180104.5538260\n2017\n----\nBrucellosis - USA (16): (NJ) raw milk, B. abortus vaccine strain, RFI 20171122.5458227\nBrucellosis - Paraguay (04): (AS) veterinary school 20171120.5454707\nBrucellosis - USA (15): (TX) unpasteurized milk, B. abortus vaccine strain, RFI 20171114.5444451\nBrucellosis - Paraguay (03): (AS) veterinary school, RFI 20171031.5415585\nBrucellosis - Paraguay (02): (AS) veterinary school, RFI 20171023.5397373\nBrucellosis - Paraguay: (AS) veterinary students, RFI 20171022.5395742\nBrucellosis - Nepal: (KT) 20171017.5386874\nBrucellosis - USA (14): (TX) raw milk, B. abortus vaccine, poss 2nd case (TN) 20171013.5376527\nBrucellosis - USA (11): (TX) unpasteurized milk, B. abortus vaccine strain, alert 20170916.5320826\nBrucellosis - USA (10): (TX) unpasteurized milk, B. abortus vaccine strain 20170913.5314638\nBrucellosis - Syria: (HM) human, livestock, spread 20170913.5313086\nBrucellosis - USA (09): (TX) unpasteurized milk, vaccine strain, recall, RFI 20170912.5311097\n2015\n----\nBrucellosis - China : (Macau) RFI 20150904.3622928\n2012\n----\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - China: (HL) 20120612.1165496\n2011\n----\nBrucellosis, students - China: (HL) vet anatomy lab 20110905.2712\n2007\n----\nBrucellosis, human, animals - China 20071206.3936\n06 Aug 2007 Brucellosis, human - China (Hong Kong) 20070806.2553\n24 Dec 2004 Brucellosis - China (02): Hong Kong 20041224.3396\n22 Dec 2004 Brucellosis - China 20041222.3371\n.................................................ds/ll/tw/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2019-12-15 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-07-15 00:00:00", "2019-08-15 00:00:00", "2019-12-07 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2007-03-15 00:00:00", "2004-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2004-12-15 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Macau", "country": "Macao"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "Hong Kong"}, {"location": "Lanzhou", "country": "China"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Gansu Province", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Hong Kong 20041224.3396", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "8121439", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis, canine - Italy: (MH) dog", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8121439", "date": "2020-05-16 22:18:51", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - CHINA: (GANSU) VETERINARY INSTITUTE, 2019\n*******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 27 Dec 2019\nSource: China News Network [in Chinese, trans.

As of 25 Dec [2019] at 4 p.m., the number of people testing positive for brucellosis had reached 181. Aside from one person with clinical symptoms, all the others did not have clinical symptoms and were not ill.\n\nThe official website stated that this event happened from 24 Jul-20 Aug 2019. China Animal Husbandry Industry Co., Ltd.'s biopharmaceutical plant produces brucellosis vaccine for animal use. Because disinfectant [used in the fermenter] had expired, exhaust gas containing vaccine strain was insufficiently sterilized. As the Lanzhou Veterinary Institute is downwind from the biopharmaceutical plant, [the exhaust gas] was inhaled or made contact with mucous membranes causing the positive brucellosis antibodies event.\n\nInvestigation found that from July to August 2019, winds in Lanzhou are mainly southeastern at windspeed level 2 to 3. Waste gases containing pathogen released by the biopharmaceutical plant were aerosolized and carried by the wind to a limited distance. Exposure levels were very low. So there would not be large numbers of people with positive antibodies.

The most common source of infection is through the consumption of raw, unpasteurized dairy products. Prior to becoming ill, the patient in this case had consumed unpasteurized homemade dairy products from Mexico. No other risk factors have been identified.\n\nThe individual was hospitalized and is recovering after being treated for the illness. A 2nd, related case of brucellosis is also pending confirmation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n\"Cases such as this one can serve as an unfortunate reminder that we are vulnerable to certain bacteria and should take precautions to protect ourselves,\" said Department of Public Health (DPH) Medical Director Dr. Rick Hong. \"Delawareans are encouraged to avoid purchasing and consuming unpasteurized dairy products. Consuming questionable food items is not worth the risk to your health.\"\n\nBrucellosis infection is most frequently transmitted by eating or drinking raw/unpasteurized dairy products such as milk and cheese, yet can also be contracted through inhalation or physical contact with infected animals or animal products. When sheep, goats, cows or camels are infected, their milk becomes contaminated with the bacteria. If the milk from infected animals is not pasteurized, the infection will be transmitted to people who consume the milk and/or cheese products. Brucellosis is not common in the USA. Nationally, the average is fewer than 200 human cases each year. Person-to-person transmission is rare. Prior to this case, the DPH has confirmed 3 cases since 2010; those cases occurred in 2010, 2017 and 2018. The case in 2010 was associated with consumption of unpasteurized milk while the nature of exposure in the 2017 and 2018 cases is unknown.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although these cases are related to unpasteurized dairy products from Mexico, cases of infection from US dairy also occur. In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al. Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis 2012;18(3):385-391; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60%) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. A total of 65 (54%) involved cheese (42% made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 (46%) involved fluid milk (82% involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp. were responsible for 54% of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp. (22%), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13%), _Brucella_ spp. (4%), _Listeria_ (4%), and _Shigella_ spp. (3%).\n\nClearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14%), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.\n\nThe reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.\n\nClassical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp., _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nDelaware, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/211]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis - USA (02): CDC, sale of unpasteurized milk across state lines 20190219.6325115\nBrucellosis - USA: sale of unpasteurized milk across state lines 20190128.6280591\n2018\n----\nBrucellosis - USA (08): (PA) bovine, human 20181227.6223249\nBrucellosis - USA (07): (WY) bovine 20181122.6158858\nBrucellosis - USA (06): (WY) bovine 20181116.6148746\nBrucellosis - USA (05): (Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem) elk, bovine 20181031.6122576\nBrucellosis - USA (04): (WY) bovine 20181012.6088330\nBrucellosis, canine - USA: public health risk 20180818.5974044\nBrucellosis - USA (03): (OR) B. abortus vaccine infection, needle stick, 2017 20180705.5890072\nBrucellosis - USA (02): (MT) elk, 20180326.5711704\nBrucellosis - USA: (TX) unpasteurized milk, B. abortus vaccine strain, 2017, CDC 20180308.5674369\n2017\n----\nBrucellosis - USA (07): (MT) bovine 20170826.5275885\nBrucellosis - USA (06): (TX) unpasteurized milk, alert, recall, RFI 20170816.5253834\nBrucellosis - USA (05): (TX) human, unpasteurized milk, alert 20170815.5251979\n.................................................sb/ll/rd/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "brucellosis", "hepatitis a"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2010-03-15 00:00:00", "2010-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2010-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Delaware", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "Mexico"}, {"location": "US", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Sussex County", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6865212", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - USA (04): (MT) cow", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6865212", "date": "2019-06-15 19:35:45", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - USA (03): (DELAWARE) MEXICAN UNPASTEURIZED DAIRY PRODUCTS\n***********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 14 Jun 2019\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/raw-milk-brucellosis-infection-prompts-health-warning-from-delaware-officials-61474/\n\n\nDelaware state health officials are reminding the public to avoid consuming raw dairy products as it announced a confirmed case of brucellosis caused by _Brucella melitensis_ in a 46-year-old Sussex County woman.\n\nThe illness is a bacterial infection that primarily affects those consuming, or coming into contact with, contaminated animals or animal products.

One case of RB51 infection (brucellosis) has been confirmed in New York, and an unknown number of people may have been exposed to RB51 from drinking the milk from this farm. This type of _Brucella_ is resistant to first-line drugs and can be difficult to diagnose because of limited testing options and the fact that early brucellosis symptoms are similar to those of more common illnesses like influenza.\n\nThe New York case is the 3rd known instance of an infection with RB51 associated with consuming raw milk or raw milk products produced in the USA. The other 2 human cases occurred in October 2017 in New Jersey and in August 2017 in Texas. Those cases reported drinking raw milk from an online retailer and a Texas farm, respectively. In addition to these 3 confirmed cases, hundreds of others were potentially exposed to RB51 during these 3 incidents.\n\nSymptoms of _Brucella_ infection (brucellosis)\n----------------------------------------------\n- Initial symptoms of brucellosis can include fever, sweats, loss of appetite, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and potentially more serious complications.\n- In pregnant patients, _Brucella_ infections can lead to miscarriage.\n- Symptoms can start anywhere from 5 days to 6 months after exposure.\n- People who are infected but are not treated can go on to develop more serious complications like arthritis; heart problems; enlargement of the spleen or liver; and, in rare cases, nervous system problems, like meningitis.\n\nAdvice to consumers\n-------------------\n- Raw milk and raw milk products are those that have not undergone a process called pasteurization that kills disease-causing germs.\n- RB51 is a live, weakened strain used in a vaccine to protect cows against a more severe form of _Brucella_ infection that can cause abortions in cows and severe illness in people. On rare occasions, cows vaccinated with RB51 vaccine can shed the bacteria in their milk. People who drink raw milk from cows that are shedding RB51 can develop brucellosis.\n- RB51 is resistant to rifampin, one of the antimicrobials that would typically be used to prevent or treat brucellosis. CDC recommends that anyone who may have been exposed to RB51 go to their doctor to see if they need antibiotics to prevent infection and symptoms from developing.\n- People who consumed raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm since January 2016 may have been exposed and should talk to their doctor.\n-- People who are still within 6 months of the date they last consumed the raw milk are at an increased risk for brucellosis and should receive antimicrobials to prevent an infection and symptoms, and should monitor their health for possible symptoms for 6 months. If symptoms develop, they should see their doctor immediately for testing.\n-- People who last drank raw milk from this dairy more than 6 months ago and have had symptoms of brucellosis - but not been treated - should see their doctor immediately for testing that can determine if they are infected and need antibiotics to prevent long-term health problems caused by brucellosis.\n- Discard any leftover or stored raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm.\n\nInvestigation details\n---------------------\n- A New York resident, who drank raw milk purchased from Miller's Biodiversity Farm in Quarryville, Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with brucellosis in November 2018.\n- Milk samples from Miller's Biodiversity tested positive for RB51. A cow that tested positive for RB51 has been removed from the milking herd.\n- As of 22 Jan 2019, investigators have determined that people in 19 states have bought or consumed raw milk from the implicated farm. The states are Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al.

The other 2 human cases occurred in October 2017 in New Jersey and in August 2017 in Texas. Those cases reported drinking raw milk from an online retailer and a Texas farm, respectively. In addition to these 3 confirmed cases, hundreds of others were potentially exposed to RB51 during these 3 incidents.\n\nSymptoms of _Brucella_ infection (brucellosis)\n----------------------------------------------\n- Initial symptoms of brucellosis can include fever, sweats, loss of appetite, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and potentially more serious complications.\n- In pregnant patients, _Brucella_ infections can lead to miscarriage.\n- Symptoms can start anywhere from 5 days to 6 months after exposure.\n- People who are infected but are not treated can go on to develop more serious complications like arthritis; heart problems; enlargement of the spleen or liver; and, in rare cases, nervous system problems, like meningitis.\n\nAdvice to consumers\n-------------------\n- Raw milk and raw milk products are those that have not undergone a process called pasteurization that kills disease-causing germs.\n- RB51 is a live, weakened strain used in a vaccine to protect cows against a more severe form of _Brucella_ infection that can cause abortions in cows and severe illness in people. On rare occasions, cows vaccinated with RB51 vaccine can shed the bacteria in their milk. People who drink raw milk from cows that are shedding RB51 can develop brucellosis.\n- RB51 is resistant to rifampin, one of the antimicrobials that would typically be used to prevent or treat brucellosis. CDC recommends that anyone who may have been exposed to RB51 go to their doctor to see if they need antibiotics to prevent infection and symptoms from developing.\n- People who consumed raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm since January 2016 may have been exposed and should talk to their doctor.\n-- People who are still within 6 months of the date they last consumed the raw milk are at an increased risk for brucellosis and should receive antimicrobials to prevent an infection and symptoms, and should monitor their health for possible symptoms for 6 months. If symptoms develop, they should see their doctor immediately for testing.\n-- People who last drank raw milk from this dairy more than 6 months ago and have had symptoms of brucellosis - but not been treated - should see their doctor immediately for testing that can determine if they are infected and need antibiotics to prevent long-term health problems caused by brucellosis.\n- Discard any leftover or stored raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm.\n\nInvestigation details\n---------------------\n- A New York resident, who drank raw milk purchased from Miller's Biodiversity Farm in Quarryville, Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with brucellosis in November 2018.\n- Milk samples from Miller's Biodiversity tested positive for RB51. A cow that tested positive for RB51 has been removed from the milking herd.\n- As of 22 Jan 2019, investigators have determined that people in 19 states have bought or consumed raw milk from the implicated farm. The states are Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al.

One case of RB51 infection (brucellosis) has been confirmed in New York, and an unknown number of people may have been exposed to RB51 from drinking the milk from this farm. This type of _Brucella_ is resistant to first-line drugs and can be difficult to diagnose because of limited testing options and the fact that early brucellosis symptoms are similar to those of more common illnesses like influenza.\n\nThe New York case is the 3rd known instance of an infection with RB51 associated with consuming raw milk or raw milk products produced in the USA. The other 2 human cases occurred in October 2017 in New Jersey and in August 2017 in Texas. Those cases reported drinking raw milk from an online retailer and a Texas farm, respectively. In addition to these 3 confirmed cases, hundreds of others were potentially exposed to RB51 during these 3 incidents.\n\nSymptoms of _Brucella_ infection (brucellosis)\n----------------------------------------------\n- Initial symptoms of brucellosis can include fever, sweats, loss of appetite, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and potentially more serious complications.\n- In pregnant patients, _Brucella_ infections can lead to miscarriage.\n- Symptoms can start anywhere from 5 days to 6 months after exposure.\n- People who are infected but are not treated can go on to develop more serious complications like arthritis; heart problems; enlargement of the spleen or liver; and, in rare cases, nervous system problems, like meningitis.\n\nAdvice to consumers\n-------------------\n- Raw milk and raw milk products are those that have not undergone a process called pasteurization that kills disease-causing germs.\n- RB51 is a live, weakened strain used in a vaccine to protect cows against a more severe form of _Brucella_ infection that can cause abortions in cows and severe illness in people. On rare occasions, cows vaccinated with RB51 vaccine can shed the bacteria in their milk. People who drink raw milk from cows that are shedding RB51 can develop brucellosis.\n- RB51 is resistant to rifampin, one of the antimicrobials that would typically be used to prevent or treat brucellosis. CDC recommends that anyone who may have been exposed to RB51 go to their doctor to see if they need antibiotics to prevent infection and symptoms from developing.\n- People who consumed raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm since January 2016 may have been exposed and should talk to their doctor.\n-- People who are still within 6 months of the date they last consumed the raw milk are at an increased risk for brucellosis and should receive antimicrobials to prevent an infection and symptoms, and should monitor their health for possible symptoms for 6 months. If symptoms develop, they should see their doctor immediately for testing.\n-- People who last drank raw milk from this dairy more than 6 months ago and have had symptoms of brucellosis - but not been treated - should see their doctor immediately for testing that can determine if they are infected and need antibiotics to prevent long-term health problems caused by brucellosis.\n- Discard any leftover or stored raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm.\n\nInvestigation details\n---------------------\n- A New York resident, who drank raw milk purchased from Miller's Biodiversity Farm in Quarryville, Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with brucellosis in November 2018.\n- Milk samples from Miller's Biodiversity tested positive for RB51. A cow that tested positive for RB51 has been removed from the milking herd.\n- As of 22 Jan 2019, investigators have determined that people in 19 states have bought or consumed raw milk from the implicated farm. The states are Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al.

One case of RB51 infection (brucellosis) has been confirmed in New York, and an unknown number of people may have been exposed to RB51 from drinking the milk from this farm. This type of _Brucella_ is resistant to first-line drugs and can be difficult to diagnose because of limited testing options and the fact that early brucellosis symptoms are similar to those of more common illnesses like influenza.\n\nThe New York case is the 3rd known instance of an infection with RB51 associated with consuming raw milk or raw milk products produced in the USA. The other 2 human cases occurred in October 2017 in New Jersey and in August 2017 in Texas. Those cases reported drinking raw milk from an online retailer and a Texas farm, respectively. In addition to these 3 confirmed cases, hundreds of others were potentially exposed to RB51 during these 3 incidents.\n\nSymptoms of _Brucella_ infection (brucellosis)\n----------------------------------------------\n- Initial symptoms of brucellosis can include fever, sweats, loss of appetite, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and potentially more serious complications.\n- In pregnant patients, _Brucella_ infections can lead to miscarriage.\n- Symptoms can start anywhere from 5 days to 6 months after exposure.\n- People who are infected but are not treated can go on to develop more serious complications like arthritis; heart problems; enlargement of the spleen or liver; and, in rare cases, nervous system problems, like meningitis.\n\nAdvice to consumers\n-------------------\n- Raw milk and raw milk products are those that have not undergone a process called pasteurization that kills disease-causing germs.\n- RB51 is a live, weakened strain used in a vaccine to protect cows against a more severe form of _Brucella_ infection that can cause abortions in cows and severe illness in people. On rare occasions, cows vaccinated with RB51 vaccine can shed the bacteria in their milk. People who drink raw milk from cows that are shedding RB51 can develop brucellosis.\n- RB51 is resistant to rifampin, one of the antimicrobials that would typically be used to prevent or treat brucellosis. CDC recommends that anyone who may have been exposed to RB51 go to their doctor to see if they need antibiotics to prevent infection and symptoms from developing.\n- People who consumed raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm since January 2016 may have been exposed and should talk to their doctor.\n-- People who are still within 6 months of the date they last consumed the raw milk are at an increased risk for brucellosis and should receive antimicrobials to prevent an infection and symptoms, and should monitor their health for possible symptoms for 6 months. If symptoms develop, they should see their doctor immediately for testing.\n-- People who last drank raw milk from this dairy more than 6 months ago and have had symptoms of brucellosis - but not been treated - should see their doctor immediately for testing that can determine if they are infected and need antibiotics to prevent long-term health problems caused by brucellosis.\n- Discard any leftover or stored raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm.\n\nInvestigation details\n---------------------\n- A New York resident, who drank raw milk purchased from Miller's Biodiversity Farm in Quarryville, Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with brucellosis in November 2018.\n- Milk samples from Miller's Biodiversity tested positive for RB51. A cow that tested positive for RB51 has been removed from the milking herd.\n- As of 22 Jan 2019, investigators have determined that people in 19 states have bought or consumed raw milk from the implicated farm. The states are Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al.

While these efforts were successful at eliminating transmission within cattle nation-wide, sporadic transmission from wildlife to cattle in and around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has been on the increase.

While these efforts were successful at eliminating transmission within cattle nation-wide, sporadic transmission from wildlife to cattle in and around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has been on the increase.

The National Agency for High Education Assessment and Credits reported in a release that the Mercosur certification, ARCU-Sur, of the Asunci\u00f3n University Veterinary School had been suspended. The sanction stands until the school has implemented the effective and efficient biosecurity mechanisms of the practical components in grass root work, and academic tests.\n\nThe release adds that once the academic year begins next February 2018, the agency will visit the Veterinary School and reconsider the certification. The process will count with the coordination of the Asunci\u00f3n University, which has been supportive all along.\n\nThis is the 1st time such a drastic action has been implemented in one of Mercosur member and associate countries, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia, particularly since the 1st outbreak was first reported last October 2017 when a student and a professor reported positive to brucellosis. This followed what is believed to be contagion from a goat flock at the Veterinary School which subsequently were diagnosed positive.\n\nIt is believed that one of the persons who developed brucellosis died in late December 2017. This triggered the immediate removal of the Veterinary School dean Azucena Cabrera.\n\nFor Mercosur, and particularly Paraguay, an outbreak of brucellosis is extremely serious since the region is the world's main producer of beef and Paraguay is among the top 10 exporters, with an annual overseas sales of USD 1.7 billion dollars.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It remains unclear how many of the diagnosed and suspected cases of brucellosis had symptoms consistent with clinical brucellosis and how many were asymptomatic but had positive brucellosis serology in this outbreak of _Brucella melitensis_ infection. The last ProMED-mail post noted 15 documented cases under treatment but did not note the fatality. It is not known how the fatal case was exposed to the goats and if the case was a student, a faculty member, or otherwise.\n\nThe symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure -- from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, employment as a veterinarian or veterinary student, in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab -- is vital.\n\nMaps of Paraguay can be seen at http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/paraguay-administrative-map.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4191.

The National Agency for High Education Assessment and Credits reported in a release that the Mercosur certification, ARCU-Sur, of the Asunci\u00f3n University Veterinary School had been suspended. The sanction stands until the school has implemented the effective and efficient biosecurity mechanisms of the practical components in grass root work, and academic tests.\n\nThe release adds that once the academic year begins next February 2018, the agency will visit the Veterinary School and reconsider the certification. The process will count with the coordination of the Asunci\u00f3n University, which has been supportive all along.\n\nThis is the 1st time such a drastic action has been implemented in one of Mercosur member and associate countries, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia, particularly since the 1st outbreak was first reported last October 2017 when a student and a professor reported positive to brucellosis. This followed what is believed to be contagion from a goat flock at the Veterinary School which subsequently were diagnosed positive.\n\nIt is believed that one of the persons who developed brucellosis died in late December 2017. This triggered the immediate removal of the Veterinary School dean Azucena Cabrera.\n\nFor Mercosur, and particularly Paraguay, an outbreak of brucellosis is extremely serious since the region is the world's main producer of beef and Paraguay is among the top 10 exporters, with an annual overseas sales of USD 1.7 billion dollars.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It remains unclear how many of the diagnosed and suspected cases of brucellosis had symptoms consistent with clinical brucellosis and how many were asymptomatic but had positive brucellosis serology in this outbreak of _Brucella melitensis_ infection. The last ProMED-mail post noted 15 documented cases under treatment but did not note the fatality. It is not known how the fatal case was exposed to the goats and if the case was a student, a faculty member, or otherwise.\n\nThe symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms.

The bacteria may be transmitted through ingestion, usually of contaminated products such as milk, or cheese, or other milk related products. It may also be contracted through inhalation or an open wound for those who work with the animals. Blood, urine and tissues of the infected animal(s) have high concentrations of the bacterium. The placenta from an infected animal is particularly highly concentrated with the causative _Brucella_ agent. Veterinarians or others who are assisting in difficult birthings of an infected animal are particularly at risk.\n\nSymptoms of brucellosis in humans may seem like the flu and may include: an undulating fever (one that comes and goes), headaches, joint pain, lethargy and a listless feeling, chills, loss of appetite, weight loss, back pain.\n\nTell your physician you have been around brucellosis-infected animals. Brucellosis may be diagnosed by blood tests, a culture of the urine and/or blood marrow. Cerebral spinal fluid may be cultured, but likely one of the others will be positive.\n\nIf you test positive for this disease, it is treatable with several antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics. Generally, it is a 6-week course of antibiotics. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/297.]\nSee Also\n2016\n----\nBrucellosis, bovine - India: (KA) 20160905.4466872\n2013\n----\nLeptospirosis, brucellosis - India: (UP) zoo employees 20131116.2058788\nBrucellosis, bovine - India: (PB) RFI 20131101.2032822\n2000\n----\nBrucellosis - India (Calcutta) (02) 20000826.1426\nBrucellosis - India (Calcutta) 20000823.1407\n.................................................sb/tg/mpp/msp/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Australia", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "Japan"}, {"location": "Tamil Nadu State", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Tirupati", "country": "India"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Thailand", "country": "Thailand"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "New Zealand"}, {"location": "Chiang Mai", "country": "Thailand"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5256690", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - Algeria: (EO)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5256690", "date": "2017-07-16 11:49:18", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - INDIA: (ANDHRA PRADESH) BOVINE\n********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 13 Jul 2017\nSource: Times of India [edited]\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/brucellosis-plagues-ttd-goshala-cows/articleshow/59567830.cms\n\n\nMore than 50 cows were infected with brucellosis at the Gosamrakshana Sala of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD).\n\nAnimals infected by the pathogenic bacteria have been segregated to prevent the spread of the disease.

Antibiotic treatment lasted for weeks.\n\nWith this kind of ailment, symptoms may return several months after treatment concludes and symptoms may appear anywhere from 5 days to 5 months from exposure.\n\nWhere did this infection come from if New York is brucellosis free? Isn't the US free of brucellosis? The answer to those questions is yes, the US is free of the disease in commercial herds.\n\nBut there are other production methods and other potential sources for the bacteria. Pasture-raised farms have pigs outdoors. These pigs may have access to feral hogs. Could these outdoor pigs or feral pigs been the source for the human infection?\n\nThe person infected was assisting with farrowing on the family's farm in Schoharie County. The diagnosis was made via blood culture, testing positive for _B. suis_ biotype 1. The pasture-raised swine had no known contact with feral hogs.\n\nThe USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's Wildlife Services was called in to assist. All adult breeding hogs on the farm were tested with 7 of the 29 hogs testing positive on multiple tests for the same strain.\n\nAll but 2 that tested negative were humanely euthanized due to zoonotic -- human transmission -- risk. The 2 remaining hogs were kept under quarantine for \"testing out.\"\n\nIn swine, brucellosis infection causes reproductive issues such as infertility, abortion, stillborn or weak piglets, testicular swelling, and reluctance to mate. There may also be signs of lameness with painful, swollen joints. It may be transmitted through breeding or ingestion of urine or placentas, aborted fetuses, or uterine fluids.\n\nThe farm had sold feeder pigs or breeding stock to numerous farms with 4 herds testing positive for _B. suis_ biotype 1. 2 were in New York -- Schoharie and Rensselaer counties -- 1 herd was in Virginia, and 1 herd was in New Jersey. They were all pasture-raised operations.\n\nThe initial infected farm purchased a breeding boar from a farm in Washington County, New York. Back in 2004, the Washington County farm observed a feral boar gain access and breed 2 sows, and then escape. Both sows had litters that sold as feeders or directly to restaurants. The farm kept 1 pig from each litter -- male and female.\n\nThe breeding boar died in 2014 but the sow farrowed multiple litters. Over 78 percent of the herd tested positive for brucellosis -- 59 of 75. They had sold or shared hogs with multiple farms.\n\nA total of 50 herds in 13 states were investigated. 9 brucellosis-infected herds were found, all pasture-raised swine, with 6 infected herds in New York: 2 in Schoharie County, 1 in Rensselaer County, and 3 in Washington County.\n\nAs of [26 Sep 2016], all known infected and exposed pigs had been depopulated. These farms received indemnity paid by the New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets and the USDA.\n\nThe farm owners performed dry cleaning on their premises and then disinfected with Virkon. Pastures were required to be fallow for 60 to 120 days. Restocking of the herds was done from validated herds, those that had tested brucellosis free.\n\nThere were 2 strains of _B. suis_ identified from this outbreak.\n\nWas the strain around a long time, opening the possibility for variation? Were there multiple sources of infected pigs? What's the takeaway message here?\n\nBiosecurity and traceability are important, especially when it comes to diseases such as brucellosis.\n\nHere are some other biosecurity tips:\n- feral hog populations need to be kept away from domestic hogs with secure fencing;\n- avoid sharing breeding boars between herds or have the boar tested for brucellosis before using him for breeding;\n- purchase only tested animals or animals from validated free herds (herds that undergo routine testing for brucellosis);\n- isolate newly purchased animals for 30 days and consider retesting them for brucellosis before using them for breeding or mixing them with the rest of the herd. Don't borrow or lend disease to your neighbor;\n- avoid sharing equipment that comes in contact with animals. Thoroughly clean and disinfect all equipment that is borrowed;\n- practice good herd hygiene. Do not feed aborted fetuses and placenta to other pigs or dogs;\n- keep equipment clean including transport trailers, chutes; and other tools for handling swine;\n- thoroughly clean feed and water troughs before reusing with another group of animals;\n- practice good manure management and remove manure as each group cycles through, or sooner if needed;\n- keep yourself safe, too. Wear protective clothing such as coveralls or barrier aprons and rubber boots when working with swine;\n- thoroughly clean and disinfect your boots and apron when you are finished and wash your coveralls;\n- Be very careful when handling aborted fetuses or placentas, or when assisting with farrowing;\n- use rubber gloves, safety goggles, and a mask to cover your nose and mouth.\n- Afterward, wash thoroughly with soap and water, paying close attention to any areas where birth products have accidentally touched your skin or soaked through your clothing;\n- During cooking and food prep, avoid eating under-cooked meat and wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw meat.\n\n[Byline: Nancy Glazier, Cornell Extension]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis in people has many other names, including Malta fever, and undulating fever. The fever associated with this disease seems to be present for a few days and then gone for a few days only to return again. This cycle repeats. In other words, a recurrent fever.\n\nIn addition to the recurrent fever the patients with this disease experience malaise, fatigue, headaches, anorexia, and body pain, often in the back, legs, joints, and spine. The pain and recurrent fever and sweats and general malaise often produce depression. The abdomen may be tender to painful as the liver and/or spleen generally swell with this disease.\n\nSadly as in this case, physicians believe the state is free of this bacterial disease and it is often not their differential radar. However, if it is diagnosed, this bacterial disease can be treated with antibiotics. The combination of rifampin and doxycycline generally works well. Treatment may be needed for as long as 6-8 weeks depending on the patient and how long the bacteria have been propagating the human being. There are cases where patients have been on antibiotic therapy for a couple of months.\n\nRegardless of the state designation of a disease, this disease and others should be on the differential list. Diseases travel widely in this age of jetting about our global community.\n\nThis article raises some good points on biosecurity of farm raised swine and trading or loaning boars. Wild boars are notorious for getting through a variety of fencing to breed with sows.

Antibiotic treatment lasted for weeks.\n\nWith this kind of ailment, symptoms may return several months after treatment concludes and symptoms may appear anywhere from 5 days to 5 months from exposure.\n\nWhere did this infection come from if New York is brucellosis free? Isn't the US free of brucellosis? The answer to those questions is yes, the US is free of the disease in commercial herds.\n\nBut there are other production methods and other potential sources for the bacteria. Pasture-raised farms have pigs outdoors. These pigs may have access to feral hogs. Could these outdoor pigs or feral pigs been the source for the human infection?\n\nThe person infected was assisting with farrowing on the family's farm in Schoharie County. The diagnosis was made via blood culture, testing positive for _B. suis_ biotype 1. The pasture-raised swine had no known contact with feral hogs.\n\nThe USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's Wildlife Services was called in to assist. All adult breeding hogs on the farm were tested with 7 of the 29 hogs testing positive on multiple tests for the same strain.\n\nAll but 2 that tested negative were humanely euthanized due to zoonotic -- human transmission -- risk. The 2 remaining hogs were kept under quarantine for \"testing out.\"\n\nIn swine, brucellosis infection causes reproductive issues such as infertility, abortion, stillborn or weak piglets, testicular swelling, and reluctance to mate. There may also be signs of lameness with painful, swollen joints. It may be transmitted through breeding or ingestion of urine or placentas, aborted fetuses, or uterine fluids.\n\nThe farm had sold feeder pigs or breeding stock to numerous farms with 4 herds testing positive for _B. suis_ biotype 1. 2 were in New York -- Schoharie and Rensselaer counties -- 1 herd was in Virginia, and 1 herd was in New Jersey. They were all pasture-raised operations.\n\nThe initial infected farm purchased a breeding boar from a farm in Washington County, New York. Back in 2004, the Washington County farm observed a feral boar gain access and breed 2 sows, and then escape. Both sows had litters that sold as feeders or directly to restaurants. The farm kept 1 pig from each litter -- male and female.\n\nThe breeding boar died in 2014 but the sow farrowed multiple litters. Over 78 percent of the herd tested positive for brucellosis -- 59 of 75. They had sold or shared hogs with multiple farms.\n\nA total of 50 herds in 13 states were investigated. 9 brucellosis-infected herds were found, all pasture-raised swine, with 6 infected herds in New York: 2 in Schoharie County, 1 in Rensselaer County, and 3 in Washington County.\n\nAs of [26 Sep 2016], all known infected and exposed pigs had been depopulated. These farms received indemnity paid by the New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets and the USDA.\n\nThe farm owners performed dry cleaning on their premises and then disinfected with Virkon. Pastures were required to be fallow for 60 to 120 days. Restocking of the herds was done from validated herds, those that had tested brucellosis free.\n\nThere were 2 strains of _B. suis_ identified from this outbreak.\n\nWas the strain around a long time, opening the possibility for variation? Were there multiple sources of infected pigs? What's the takeaway message here?\n\nBiosecurity and traceability are important, especially when it comes to diseases such as brucellosis.\n\nHere are some other biosecurity tips:\n- feral hog populations need to be kept away from domestic hogs with secure fencing;\n- avoid sharing breeding boars between herds or have the boar tested for brucellosis before using him for breeding;\n- purchase only tested animals or animals from validated free herds (herds that undergo routine testing for brucellosis);\n- isolate newly purchased animals for 30 days and consider retesting them for brucellosis before using them for breeding or mixing them with the rest of the herd. Don't borrow or lend disease to your neighbor;\n- avoid sharing equipment that comes in contact with animals. Thoroughly clean and disinfect all equipment that is borrowed;\n- practice good herd hygiene. Do not feed aborted fetuses and placenta to other pigs or dogs;\n- keep equipment clean including transport trailers, chutes; and other tools for handling swine;\n- thoroughly clean feed and water troughs before reusing with another group of animals;\n- practice good manure management and remove manure as each group cycles through, or sooner if needed;\n- keep yourself safe, too. Wear protective clothing such as coveralls or barrier aprons and rubber boots when working with swine;\n- thoroughly clean and disinfect your boots and apron when you are finished and wash your coveralls;\n- Be very careful when handling aborted fetuses or placentas, or when assisting with farrowing;\n- use rubber gloves, safety goggles, and a mask to cover your nose and mouth.\n- Afterward, wash thoroughly with soap and water, paying close attention to any areas where birth products have accidentally touched your skin or soaked through your clothing;\n- During cooking and food prep, avoid eating under-cooked meat and wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw meat.\n\n[Byline: Nancy Glazier, Cornell Extension]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis in people has many other names, including Malta fever, and undulating fever. The fever associated with this disease seems to be present for a few days and then gone for a few days only to return again. This cycle repeats. In other words, a recurrent fever.\n\nIn addition to the recurrent fever the patients with this disease experience malaise, fatigue, headaches, anorexia, and body pain, often in the back, legs, joints, and spine. The pain and recurrent fever and sweats and general malaise often produce depression. The abdomen may be tender to painful as the liver and/or spleen generally swell with this disease.\n\nSadly as in this case, physicians believe the state is free of this bacterial disease and it is often not their differential radar. However, if it is diagnosed, this bacterial disease can be treated with antibiotics. The combination of rifampin and doxycycline generally works well.

Antibiotic treatment lasted for weeks.\n\nWith this kind of ailment, symptoms may return several months after treatment concludes and symptoms may appear anywhere from 5 days to 5 months from exposure.\n\nWhere did this infection come from if New York is brucellosis free? Isn't the US free of brucellosis? The answer to those questions is yes, the US is free of the disease in commercial herds.\n\nBut there are other production methods and other potential sources for the bacteria. Pasture-raised farms have pigs outdoors. These pigs may have access to feral hogs. Could these outdoor pigs or feral pigs been the source for the human infection?\n\nThe person infected was assisting with farrowing on the family's farm in Schoharie County. The diagnosis was made via blood culture, testing positive for _B. suis_ biotype 1. The pasture-raised swine had no known contact with feral hogs.\n\nThe USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's Wildlife Services was called in to assist. All adult breeding hogs on the farm were tested with 7 of the 29 hogs testing positive on multiple tests for the same strain.\n\nAll but 2 that tested negative were humanely euthanized due to zoonotic -- human transmission -- risk. The 2 remaining hogs were kept under quarantine for \"testing out.\"\n\nIn swine, brucellosis infection causes reproductive issues such as infertility, abortion, stillborn or weak piglets, testicular swelling, and reluctance to mate. There may also be signs of lameness with painful, swollen joints. It may be transmitted through breeding or ingestion of urine or placentas, aborted fetuses, or uterine fluids.\n\nThe farm had sold feeder pigs or breeding stock to numerous farms with 4 herds testing positive for _B. suis_ biotype 1. 2 were in New York -- Schoharie and Rensselaer counties -- 1 herd was in Virginia, and 1 herd was in New Jersey. They were all pasture-raised operations.\n\nThe initial infected farm purchased a breeding boar from a farm in Washington County, New York.

Antibiotic treatment lasted for weeks.\n\nWith this kind of ailment, symptoms may return several months after treatment concludes and symptoms may appear anywhere from 5 days to 5 months from exposure.\n\nWhere did this infection come from if New York is brucellosis free? Isn't the US free of brucellosis? The answer to those questions is yes, the US is free of the disease in commercial herds.\n\nBut there are other production methods and other potential sources for the bacteria. Pasture-raised farms have pigs outdoors. These pigs may have access to feral hogs. Could these outdoor pigs or feral pigs been the source for the human infection?\n\nThe person infected was assisting with farrowing on the family's farm in Schoharie County. The diagnosis was made via blood culture, testing positive for _B. suis_ biotype 1. The pasture-raised swine had no known contact with feral hogs.\n\nThe USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's Wildlife Services was called in to assist. All adult breeding hogs on the farm were tested with 7 of the 29 hogs testing positive on multiple tests for the same strain.\n\nAll but 2 that tested negative were humanely euthanized due to zoonotic -- human transmission -- risk. The 2 remaining hogs were kept under quarantine for \"testing out.\"\n\nIn swine, brucellosis infection causes reproductive issues such as infertility, abortion, stillborn or weak piglets, testicular swelling, and reluctance to mate. There may also be signs of lameness with painful, swollen joints. It may be transmitted through breeding or ingestion of urine or placentas, aborted fetuses, or uterine fluids.\n\nThe farm had sold feeder pigs or breeding stock to numerous farms with 4 herds testing positive for _B. suis_ biotype 1. 2 were in New York -- Schoharie and Rensselaer counties -- 1 herd was in Virginia, and 1 herd was in New Jersey. They were all pasture-raised operations.\n\nThe initial infected farm purchased a breeding boar from a farm in Washington County, New York. Back in 2004, the Washington County farm observed a feral boar gain access and breed 2 sows, and then escape. Both sows had litters that sold as feeders or directly to restaurants. The farm kept 1 pig from each litter -- male and female.\n\nThe breeding boar died in 2014 but the sow farrowed multiple litters. Over 78 percent of the herd tested positive for brucellosis -- 59 of 75. They had sold or shared hogs with multiple farms.\n\nA total of 50 herds in 13 states were investigated. 9 brucellosis-infected herds were found, all pasture-raised swine, with 6 infected herds in New York: 2 in Schoharie County, 1 in Rensselaer County, and 3 in Washington County.\n\nAs of [26 Sep 2016], all known infected and exposed pigs had been depopulated. These farms received indemnity paid by the New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets and the USDA.\n\nThe farm owners performed dry cleaning on their premises and then disinfected with Virkon. Pastures were required to be fallow for 60 to 120 days. Restocking of the herds was done from validated herds, those that had tested brucellosis free.\n\nThere were 2 strains of _B. suis_ identified from this outbreak.\n\nWas the strain around a long time, opening the possibility for variation? Were there multiple sources of infected pigs? What's the takeaway message here?\n\nBiosecurity and traceability are important, especially when it comes to diseases such as brucellosis.\n\nHere are some other biosecurity tips:\n- feral hog populations need to be kept away from domestic hogs with secure fencing;\n- avoid sharing breeding boars between herds or have the boar tested for brucellosis before using him for breeding;\n- purchase only tested animals or animals from validated free herds (herds that undergo routine testing for brucellosis);\n- isolate newly purchased animals for 30 days and consider retesting them for brucellosis before using them for breeding or mixing them with the rest of the herd. Don't borrow or lend disease to your neighbor;\n- avoid sharing equipment that comes in contact with animals. Thoroughly clean and disinfect all equipment that is borrowed;\n- practice good herd hygiene. Do not feed aborted fetuses and placenta to other pigs or dogs;\n- keep equipment clean including transport trailers, chutes; and other tools for handling swine;\n- thoroughly clean feed and water troughs before reusing with another group of animals;\n- practice good manure management and remove manure as each group cycles through, or sooner if needed;\n- keep yourself safe, too. Wear protective clothing such as coveralls or barrier aprons and rubber boots when working with swine;\n- thoroughly clean and disinfect your boots and apron when you are finished and wash your coveralls;\n- Be very careful when handling aborted fetuses or placentas, or when assisting with farrowing;\n- use rubber gloves, safety goggles, and a mask to cover your nose and mouth.\n- Afterward, wash thoroughly with soap and water, paying close attention to any areas where birth products have accidentally touched your skin or soaked through your clothing;\n- During cooking and food prep, avoid eating under-cooked meat and wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw meat.\n\n[Byline: Nancy Glazier, Cornell Extension]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis in people has many other names, including Malta fever, and undulating fever.

There have been 13 brucellosis infections in residents so far in 2016, affecting patients between 6 and 80 years old, according to a health advisory notice released on Thursday, 15 Sep 2016.\n\nAll of the patients reported eating cheese brought into the USA from Mexico by friends or relatives, consuming the cheese while traveling in Mexico, or eating unidentified cheese products from local street vendors, officials said. The county typically sees 2 to 6 cases a year, though 11 were recorded in 2004.\n\nHealth officials confirmed all the Dallas County cases by blood culture. In 2 instances, hospital lab personnel were exposed while handling the samples.\n\nThe brucella bacterium can infect livestock and is most commonly transmitted to humans who consume unpasteurized dairy products. Some areas, such as Mexico and Central and South America, are considered high-risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nProponents of raw milk products say it's more natural, tastes better and has health benefits. But many state and federal agencies are less keen, saying it can lead to more foodborne illnesses, such as listeriosis. A listeria outbreak at Brenham [Texas]-based Blue Bell Creameries in 2015 sickened 10 people and was linked to 3 deaths.\n\nWhile legal in Texas, raw milk may only be sold at the dairy. State Rep Dan Flynn, R-Van, drafted a bill in 2015 to allow people who produce raw milk or raw milk products to sell directly to consumers at their homes or farmers' markets. Sale at supermarkets would have remained against the law. The bill failed to pass.\n\nSymptoms of brucellosis include fever, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, night sweats and headaches.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 per cent) were associated with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 per cent) involved cheese (42 per cent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 per cent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp were responsible for 54 per cent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 per cent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 per cent), _Brucella_ spp (4 per cent), listeria (4 per cent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 per cent).\n\nClearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 per cent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.\n\nThe reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.\n\nClassical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ spp, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ spp, _Yersinia_ spp, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk.\n\nThe following (http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/08/study-finds-amazing-bacterial-diversity-in-californias-raw-milk/) is a recent report involving the bacterial diversity of raw milk (interestingly the classical Enterobacteriaceae such as _E. coli_, salmonella and campylobacter were not found):\n\n\"Researchers at the University of California-Davis report that samples of raw cow's milk shipped by tanker truck for processing show 'amazing bacterial diversity' which varies by season. Their findings were reported [23 Aug 2016] in mBio, the online, open-access journal of the American Society of Microbiology. The researchers sampled and analyzed raw cow's milk from 899 tanker trucks as they arrived at 2 dairy processors in California's San Joaquin Valley during spring, summer and fall. The samples were analyzed using gene sequencing. This collection included 229 tankers filled in the fall of 2013 and another 264 and 406 tankers filled in the spring and summer of 2014, respectively. The larger set of samples collected in the summer included milk collected from 2 sampling dates a week apart.\n\n'The level of bacterial diversity that we discovered in these shipments of raw milk was amazing,' said lead author and microbiologist Maria Marco, an associate professor in the UC-Davis Department of Food Science and Technology. 'More than half of the bacterial groups identified represented less than 1 per cent of the total microbial content.' She said the broad mix of bacteria could be due to raw milk's high nutrient content, as well as the many potential sources of bacteria associated with dairies. These include bacteria from the cows' skin, feed, bedding and aerosols, and from human handlers and the equipment and containers used to collect, store and transport the raw milk.\n\nRaw milk is known to harbor diverse strains of bacteria that strongly influence shelf life, sensory qualities and safety of fluid milk, as well as that of fermented dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. While pasteurization of raw milk kills microbes which can cause disease in humans, not all bacteria and their associated enzymes are eliminated in the process. The remaining bacteria can still cause spoilage and quality defects in dairy foods.\n\nResearchers found that a 'core community' of microbes remains constant throughout the seasons and across farms where the milk is collected. This core community represented 29 different bacterial groups and included high proportions of streptococcus and staphylococcus, as well as Clostridiales, bacteria frequently associated with dairy cattle. The study revealed that milk collected in the spring contained the most diverse bacterial communities with the highest total cell numbers and highest proportions of Actinobacteria (such as actinomyces and streptomyces), one of the largest known groups of bacteria. The group includes some pathogens.\n\nResearchers also found that the bacterial composition of raw milk stored in silos at processing plants was distinct from that of the tanker trucks. One group of silos contained microbial populations similar in makeup to the milk from the tanker trucks, while the other group of silos had distinctly different microbial populations dominated by acinetobacter and lactococcus bacteria.\n\n'This finding demonstrates how the built environment in food-processing plants can have significant but still unpredictable impacts on the microbial quality of foods,' Marco said.\n\nIdentification of these raw milk microbes and their abundance should help dairy processors develop new and more effective sanitation procedures and process controls to make sure the milk and resulting dairy foods are safe and of consistently high quality, according to the report.\" - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis - Israel (05): camel milk, unpasteurized, human infection 20160908.4475736\nBrucellosis - Israel (04): camel milk, human infection, comment 20160819.4427272\nBrucellosis - Israel (03): camel milk, human infection confirmed, spread 20160817.4423219\nBrucellosis - Israel (02): camel milk, human infection susp, RFI 20160814.4416170\nBrucellosis - Israel: camel milk, multiple contaminants, recalls, RFI 20160814.4414452\nBrucellosis - USA: (TX) unpasteurized cheese, alert 20160311.4085659\n2015\n---\nBrucellosis - USA: (NY) imported, laboratory exposures 20150721.3525860\n2013\n---\nBrucellosis, human, abortus - USA: (NY) ex Ecuador, cheese 20130111.1492801\n2012\n---\nBrucellosis, human, canine - USA: (NY) B. canis 20120608.1160121\nBrucellosis, human - USA (03): (MA), unpasteurized milk, NOT 20120128.1024159\nBrucellosis, human - USA (02): (MA), unpasteurized milk 20120123.1019236\nBrucellosis, human - USA: (MA), unpasteurized milk 20120121.1017730\n2009\n---\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico (03): background 20090818.2933\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico (02): (GJ) 20090817.2909\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico: (GJ) 20090313.1028\n.................................................ll/je/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "hepatitis a", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2016-09-15 00:00:00", "2004-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "TEXAS", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Dallas", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Joaquin Valley", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Dallas County", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Actinobacteria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "Mexico"}, {"location": "Ecuador", "country": "Ecuador"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4699691", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - Belgium: (LX) bovine, B. suis, OIE", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4699691", "date": "2016-09-16 17:50:14", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - USA (02): (TEXAS) UNPASTEURIZED CHEESE ex MEXICO, ALERT\n*********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 16 Sep 2016\nSource: Dallas News [edited]\nhttp://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20160916-unpasteurized-cheese-making-record-number-sick-in-dallas-county.ece\n\n\nA record number of people in Dallas County [Texas] have been sickened from an infection caused by consuming unpasteurized cheese, health officials said. There have been 13 brucellosis infections in residents so far in 2016, affecting patients between 6 and 80 years old, according to a health advisory notice released on Thursday, 15 Sep 2016.\n\nAll of the patients reported eating cheese brought into the USA from Mexico by friends or relatives, consuming the cheese while traveling in Mexico, or eating unidentified cheese products from local street vendors, officials said. The county typically sees 2 to 6 cases a year, though 11 were recorded in 2004.\n\nHealth officials confirmed all the Dallas County cases by blood culture. In 2 instances, hospital lab personnel were exposed while handling the samples.\n\nThe brucella bacterium can infect livestock and is most commonly transmitted to humans who consume unpasteurized dairy products. Some areas, such as Mexico and Central and South America, are considered high-risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nProponents of raw milk products say it's more natural, tastes better and has health benefits. But many state and federal agencies are less keen, saying it can lead to more foodborne illnesses, such as listeriosis. A listeria outbreak at Brenham [Texas]-based Blue Bell Creameries in 2015 sickened 10 people and was linked to 3 deaths.\n\nWhile legal in Texas, raw milk may only be sold at the dairy. State Rep Dan Flynn, R-Van, drafted a bill in 2015 to allow people who produce raw milk or raw milk products to sell directly to consumers at their homes or farmers' markets. Sale at supermarkets would have remained against the law. The bill failed to pass.\n\nSymptoms of brucellosis include fever, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, night sweats and headaches. Antimicrobials are used to treat the infection, and recovery can take weeks to several months. While rarely fatal, some people can also develop chronic or severe conditions. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned that pregnant women and children should not consume raw milk or raw milk products.\n\n[byline: Claire Z Cardona]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al.

There have been 13 brucellosis infections in residents so far in 2016, affecting patients between 6 and 80 years old, according to a health advisory notice released on Thursday, 15 Sep 2016.\n\nAll of the patients reported eating cheese brought into the USA from Mexico by friends or relatives, consuming the cheese while traveling in Mexico, or eating unidentified cheese products from local street vendors, officials said. The county typically sees 2 to 6 cases a year, though 11 were recorded in 2004.\n\nHealth officials confirmed all the Dallas County cases by blood culture. In 2 instances, hospital lab personnel were exposed while handling the samples.\n\nThe brucella bacterium can infect livestock and is most commonly transmitted to humans who consume unpasteurized dairy products. Some areas, such as Mexico and Central and South America, are considered high-risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nProponents of raw milk products say it's more natural, tastes better and has health benefits. But many state and federal agencies are less keen, saying it can lead to more foodborne illnesses, such as listeriosis. A listeria outbreak at Brenham [Texas]-based Blue Bell Creameries in 2015 sickened 10 people and was linked to 3 deaths.\n\nWhile legal in Texas, raw milk may only be sold at the dairy. State Rep Dan Flynn, R-Van, drafted a bill in 2015 to allow people who produce raw milk or raw milk products to sell directly to consumers at their homes or farmers' markets. Sale at supermarkets would have remained against the law. The bill failed to pass.\n\nSymptoms of brucellosis include fever, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, night sweats and headaches. Antimicrobials are used to treat the infection, and recovery can take weeks to several months. While rarely fatal, some people can also develop chronic or severe conditions. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned that pregnant women and children should not consume raw milk or raw milk products.\n\n[byline: Claire Z Cardona]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al. Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 per cent) were associated with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 per cent) involved cheese (42 per cent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 per cent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp were responsible for 54 per cent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 per cent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 per cent), _Brucella_ spp (4 per cent), listeria (4 per cent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 per cent).\n\nClearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 per cent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.\n\nThe reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.\n\nClassical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ spp, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ spp, _Yersinia_ spp, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk.\n\nThe following (http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/08/study-finds-amazing-bacterial-diversity-in-californias-raw-milk/) is a recent report involving the bacterial diversity of raw milk (interestingly the classical Enterobacteriaceae such as _E. coli_, salmonella and campylobacter were not found):\n\n\"Researchers at the University of California-Davis report that samples of raw cow's milk shipped by tanker truck for processing show 'amazing bacterial diversity' which varies by season. Their findings were reported [23 Aug 2016] in mBio, the online, open-access journal of the American Society of Microbiology. The researchers sampled and analyzed raw cow's milk from 899 tanker trucks as they arrived at 2 dairy processors in California's San Joaquin Valley during spring, summer and fall. The samples were analyzed using gene sequencing. This collection included 229 tankers filled in the fall of 2013 and another 264 and 406 tankers filled in the spring and summer of 2014, respectively. The larger set of samples collected in the summer included milk collected from 2 sampling dates a week apart.\n\n'The level of bacterial diversity that we discovered in these shipments of raw milk was amazing,' said lead author and microbiologist Maria Marco, an associate professor in the UC-Davis Department of Food Science and Technology. 'More than half of the bacterial groups identified represented less than 1 per cent of the total microbial content.' She said the broad mix of bacteria could be due to raw milk's high nutrient content, as well as the many potential sources of bacteria associated with dairies. These include bacteria from the cows' skin, feed, bedding and aerosols, and from human handlers and the equipment and containers used to collect, store and transport the raw milk.\n\nRaw milk is known to harbor diverse strains of bacteria that strongly influence shelf life, sensory qualities and safety of fluid milk, as well as that of fermented dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. While pasteurization of raw milk kills microbes which can cause disease in humans, not all bacteria and their associated enzymes are eliminated in the process. The remaining bacteria can still cause spoilage and quality defects in dairy foods.\n\nResearchers found that a 'core community' of microbes remains constant throughout the seasons and across farms where the milk is collected. This core community represented 29 different bacterial groups and included high proportions of streptococcus and staphylococcus, as well as Clostridiales, bacteria frequently associated with dairy cattle. The study revealed that milk collected in the spring contained the most diverse bacterial communities with the highest total cell numbers and highest proportions of Actinobacteria (such as actinomyces and streptomyces), one of the largest known groups of bacteria. The group includes some pathogens.\n\nResearchers also found that the bacterial composition of raw milk stored in silos at processing plants was distinct from that of the tanker trucks. One group of silos contained microbial populations similar in makeup to the milk from the tanker trucks, while the other group of silos had distinctly different microbial populations dominated by acinetobacter and lactococcus bacteria.\n\n'This finding demonstrates how the built environment in food-processing plants can have significant but still unpredictable impacts on the microbial quality of foods,' Marco said.\n\nIdentification of these raw milk microbes and their abundance should help dairy processors develop new and more effective sanitation procedures and process controls to make sure the milk and resulting dairy foods are safe and of consistently high quality, according to the report.\" - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis - Israel (05): camel milk, unpasteurized, human infection 20160908.4475736\nBrucellosis - Israel (04): camel milk, human infection, comment 20160819.4427272\nBrucellosis - Israel (03): camel milk, human infection confirmed, spread 20160817.4423219\nBrucellosis - Israel (02): camel milk, human infection susp, RFI 20160814.4416170\nBrucellosis - Israel: camel milk, multiple contaminants, recalls, RFI 20160814.4414452\nBrucellosis - USA: (TX) unpasteurized cheese, alert 20160311.4085659\n2015\n---\nBrucellosis - USA: (NY) imported, laboratory exposures 20150721.3525860\n2013\n---\nBrucellosis, human, abortus - USA: (NY) ex Ecuador, cheese 20130111.1492801\n2012\n---\nBrucellosis, human, canine - USA: (NY) B. canis 20120608.1160121\nBrucellosis, human - USA (03): (MA), unpasteurized milk, NOT 20120128.1024159\nBrucellosis, human - USA (02): (MA), unpasteurized milk 20120123.1019236\nBrucellosis, human - USA: (MA), unpasteurized milk 20120121.1017730\n2009\n---\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico (03): background 20090818.2933\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico (02): (GJ) 20090817.2909\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico: (GJ) 20090313.1028\n.................................................ll/je/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "hepatitis a", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2016-09-15 00:00:00", "2004-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "TEXAS", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Dallas", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Joaquin Valley", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Dallas County", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Actinobacteria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "Mexico"}, {"location": "Ecuador", "country": "Ecuador"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4640757", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - Croatia: (KA) melitensis, ovine, OIE", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4640757", "date": "2016-09-16 17:50:14", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - USA (02): (TEXAS) UNPASTEURIZED CHEESE ex MEXICO, ALERT\n*********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 16 Sep 2016\nSource: Dallas News [edited]\nhttp://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20160916-unpasteurized-cheese-making-record-number-sick-in-dallas-county.ece\n\n\nA record number of people in Dallas County [Texas] have been sickened from an infection caused by consuming unpasteurized cheese, health officials said.

There have been 13 brucellosis infections in residents so far in 2016, affecting patients between 6 and 80 years old, according to a health advisory notice released on Thursday, 15 Sep 2016.\n\nAll of the patients reported eating cheese brought into the USA from Mexico by friends or relatives, consuming the cheese while traveling in Mexico, or eating unidentified cheese products from local street vendors, officials said. The county typically sees 2 to 6 cases a year, though 11 were recorded in 2004.\n\nHealth officials confirmed all the Dallas County cases by blood culture. In 2 instances, hospital lab personnel were exposed while handling the samples.\n\nThe brucella bacterium can infect livestock and is most commonly transmitted to humans who consume unpasteurized dairy products. Some areas, such as Mexico and Central and South America, are considered high-risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nProponents of raw milk products say it's more natural, tastes better and has health benefits. But many state and federal agencies are less keen, saying it can lead to more foodborne illnesses, such as listeriosis. A listeria outbreak at Brenham [Texas]-based Blue Bell Creameries in 2015 sickened 10 people and was linked to 3 deaths.\n\nWhile legal in Texas, raw milk may only be sold at the dairy. State Rep Dan Flynn, R-Van, drafted a bill in 2015 to allow people who produce raw milk or raw milk products to sell directly to consumers at their homes or farmers' markets. Sale at supermarkets would have remained against the law. The bill failed to pass.\n\nSymptoms of brucellosis include fever, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, night sweats and headaches. Antimicrobials are used to treat the infection, and recovery can take weeks to several months. While rarely fatal, some people can also develop chronic or severe conditions. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned that pregnant women and children should not consume raw milk or raw milk products.\n\n[byline: Claire Z Cardona]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al. Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 per cent) were associated with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 per cent) involved cheese (42 per cent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 per cent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp were responsible for 54 per cent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 per cent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 per cent), _Brucella_ spp (4 per cent), listeria (4 per cent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 per cent).\n\nClearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 per cent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.\n\nThe reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.\n\nClassical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ spp, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ spp, _Yersinia_ spp, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk.\n\nThe following (http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/08/study-finds-amazing-bacterial-diversity-in-californias-raw-milk/) is a recent report involving the bacterial diversity of raw milk (interestingly the classical Enterobacteriaceae such as _E. coli_, salmonella and campylobacter were not found):\n\n\"Researchers at the University of California-Davis report that samples of raw cow's milk shipped by tanker truck for processing show 'amazing bacterial diversity' which varies by season. Their findings were reported [23 Aug 2016] in mBio, the online, open-access journal of the American Society of Microbiology. The researchers sampled and analyzed raw cow's milk from 899 tanker trucks as they arrived at 2 dairy processors in California's San Joaquin Valley during spring, summer and fall. The samples were analyzed using gene sequencing. This collection included 229 tankers filled in the fall of 2013 and another 264 and 406 tankers filled in the spring and summer of 2014, respectively. The larger set of samples collected in the summer included milk collected from 2 sampling dates a week apart.\n\n'The level of bacterial diversity that we discovered in these shipments of raw milk was amazing,' said lead author and microbiologist Maria Marco, an associate professor in the UC-Davis Department of Food Science and Technology. 'More than half of the bacterial groups identified represented less than 1 per cent of the total microbial content.' She said the broad mix of bacteria could be due to raw milk's high nutrient content, as well as the many potential sources of bacteria associated with dairies. These include bacteria from the cows' skin, feed, bedding and aerosols, and from human handlers and the equipment and containers used to collect, store and transport the raw milk.\n\nRaw milk is known to harbor diverse strains of bacteria that strongly influence shelf life, sensory qualities and safety of fluid milk, as well as that of fermented dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. While pasteurization of raw milk kills microbes which can cause disease in humans, not all bacteria and their associated enzymes are eliminated in the process. The remaining bacteria can still cause spoilage and quality defects in dairy foods.\n\nResearchers found that a 'core community' of microbes remains constant throughout the seasons and across farms where the milk is collected. This core community represented 29 different bacterial groups and included high proportions of streptococcus and staphylococcus, as well as Clostridiales, bacteria frequently associated with dairy cattle. The study revealed that milk collected in the spring contained the most diverse bacterial communities with the highest total cell numbers and highest proportions of Actinobacteria (such as actinomyces and streptomyces), one of the largest known groups of bacteria. The group includes some pathogens.\n\nResearchers also found that the bacterial composition of raw milk stored in silos at processing plants was distinct from that of the tanker trucks. One group of silos contained microbial populations similar in makeup to the milk from the tanker trucks, while the other group of silos had distinctly different microbial populations dominated by acinetobacter and lactococcus bacteria.\n\n'This finding demonstrates how the built environment in food-processing plants can have significant but still unpredictable impacts on the microbial quality of foods,' Marco said.\n\nIdentification of these raw milk microbes and their abundance should help dairy processors develop new and more effective sanitation procedures and process controls to make sure the milk and resulting dairy foods are safe and of consistently high quality, according to the report.\" - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis - Israel (05): camel milk, unpasteurized, human infection 20160908.4475736\nBrucellosis - Israel (04): camel milk, human infection, comment 20160819.4427272\nBrucellosis - Israel (03): camel milk, human infection confirmed, spread 20160817.4423219\nBrucellosis - Israel (02): camel milk, human infection susp, RFI 20160814.4416170\nBrucellosis - Israel: camel milk, multiple contaminants, recalls, RFI 20160814.4414452\nBrucellosis - USA: (TX) unpasteurized cheese, alert 20160311.4085659\n2015\n---\nBrucellosis - USA: (NY) imported, laboratory exposures 20150721.3525860\n2013\n---\nBrucellosis, human, abortus - USA: (NY) ex Ecuador, cheese 20130111.1492801\n2012\n---\nBrucellosis, human, canine - USA: (NY) B. canis 20120608.1160121\nBrucellosis, human - USA (03): (MA), unpasteurized milk, NOT 20120128.1024159\nBrucellosis, human - USA (02): (MA), unpasteurized milk 20120123.1019236\nBrucellosis, human - USA: (MA), unpasteurized milk 20120121.1017730\n2009\n---\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico (03): background 20090818.2933\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico (02): (GJ) 20090817.2909\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico: (GJ) 20090313.1028\n.................................................ll/je/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "hepatitis a", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2016-09-15 00:00:00", "2004-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "TEXAS", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Dallas", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Joaquin Valley", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Dallas County", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Actinobacteria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "Mexico"}, {"location": "Ecuador", "country": "Ecuador"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4595618", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis, canine - USA: (WI) canine", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4595618", "date": "2016-09-16 17:50:14", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - USA (02): (TEXAS) UNPASTEURIZED CHEESE ex MEXICO, ALERT\n*********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 16 Sep 2016\nSource: Dallas News [edited]\nhttp://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20160916-unpasteurized-cheese-making-record-number-sick-in-dallas-county.ece\n\n\nA record number of people in Dallas County [Texas] have been sickened from an infection caused by consuming unpasteurized cheese, health officials said.

There have been 13 brucellosis infections in residents so far in 2016, affecting patients between 6 and 80 years old, according to a health advisory notice released on Thursday, 15 Sep 2016.\n\nAll of the patients reported eating cheese brought into the USA from Mexico by friends or relatives, consuming the cheese while traveling in Mexico, or eating unidentified cheese products from local street vendors, officials said. The county typically sees 2 to 6 cases a year, though 11 were recorded in 2004.\n\nHealth officials confirmed all the Dallas County cases by blood culture. In 2 instances, hospital lab personnel were exposed while handling the samples.\n\nThe brucella bacterium can infect livestock and is most commonly transmitted to humans who consume unpasteurized dairy products. Some areas, such as Mexico and Central and South America, are considered high-risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nProponents of raw milk products say it's more natural, tastes better and has health benefits. But many state and federal agencies are less keen, saying it can lead to more foodborne illnesses, such as listeriosis. A listeria outbreak at Brenham [Texas]-based Blue Bell Creameries in 2015 sickened 10 people and was linked to 3 deaths.\n\nWhile legal in Texas, raw milk may only be sold at the dairy. State Rep Dan Flynn, R-Van, drafted a bill in 2015 to allow people who produce raw milk or raw milk products to sell directly to consumers at their homes or farmers' markets. Sale at supermarkets would have remained against the law. The bill failed to pass.\n\nSymptoms of brucellosis include fever, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, night sweats and headaches. Antimicrobials are used to treat the infection, and recovery can take weeks to several months. While rarely fatal, some people can also develop chronic or severe conditions. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned that pregnant women and children should not consume raw milk or raw milk products.\n\n[byline: Claire Z Cardona]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al. Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 per cent) were associated with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 per cent) involved cheese (42 per cent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 per cent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp were responsible for 54 per cent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 per cent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 per cent), _Brucella_ spp (4 per cent), listeria (4 per cent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 per cent).\n\nClearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 per cent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.\n\nThe reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.\n\nClassical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ spp, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ spp, _Yersinia_ spp, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk.\n\nThe following (http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/08/study-finds-amazing-bacterial-diversity-in-californias-raw-milk/) is a recent report involving the bacterial diversity of raw milk (interestingly the classical Enterobacteriaceae such as _E. coli_, salmonella and campylobacter were not found):\n\n\"Researchers at the University of California-Davis report that samples of raw cow's milk shipped by tanker truck for processing show 'amazing bacterial diversity' which varies by season. Their findings were reported [23 Aug 2016] in mBio, the online, open-access journal of the American Society of Microbiology. The researchers sampled and analyzed raw cow's milk from 899 tanker trucks as they arrived at 2 dairy processors in California's San Joaquin Valley during spring, summer and fall. The samples were analyzed using gene sequencing. This collection included 229 tankers filled in the fall of 2013 and another 264 and 406 tankers filled in the spring and summer of 2014, respectively. The larger set of samples collected in the summer included milk collected from 2 sampling dates a week apart.\n\n'The level of bacterial diversity that we discovered in these shipments of raw milk was amazing,' said lead author and microbiologist Maria Marco, an associate professor in the UC-Davis Department of Food Science and Technology. 'More than half of the bacterial groups identified represented less than 1 per cent of the total microbial content.' She said the broad mix of bacteria could be due to raw milk's high nutrient content, as well as the many potential sources of bacteria associated with dairies. These include bacteria from the cows' skin, feed, bedding and aerosols, and from human handlers and the equipment and containers used to collect, store and transport the raw milk.\n\nRaw milk is known to harbor diverse strains of bacteria that strongly influence shelf life, sensory qualities and safety of fluid milk, as well as that of fermented dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. While pasteurization of raw milk kills microbes which can cause disease in humans, not all bacteria and their associated enzymes are eliminated in the process. The remaining bacteria can still cause spoilage and quality defects in dairy foods.\n\nResearchers found that a 'core community' of microbes remains constant throughout the seasons and across farms where the milk is collected. This core community represented 29 different bacterial groups and included high proportions of streptococcus and staphylococcus, as well as Clostridiales, bacteria frequently associated with dairy cattle. The study revealed that milk collected in the spring contained the most diverse bacterial communities with the highest total cell numbers and highest proportions of Actinobacteria (such as actinomyces and streptomyces), one of the largest known groups of bacteria. The group includes some pathogens.\n\nResearchers also found that the bacterial composition of raw milk stored in silos at processing plants was distinct from that of the tanker trucks. One group of silos contained microbial populations similar in makeup to the milk from the tanker trucks, while the other group of silos had distinctly different microbial populations dominated by acinetobacter and lactococcus bacteria.\n\n'This finding demonstrates how the built environment in food-processing plants can have significant but still unpredictable impacts on the microbial quality of foods,' Marco said.\n\nIdentification of these raw milk microbes and their abundance should help dairy processors develop new and more effective sanitation procedures and process controls to make sure the milk and resulting dairy foods are safe and of consistently high quality, according to the report.\" - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis - Israel (05): camel milk, unpasteurized, human infection 20160908.4475736\nBrucellosis - Israel (04): camel milk, human infection, comment 20160819.4427272\nBrucellosis - Israel (03): camel milk, human infection confirmed, spread 20160817.4423219\nBrucellosis - Israel (02): camel milk, human infection susp, RFI 20160814.4416170\nBrucellosis - Israel: camel milk, multiple contaminants, recalls, RFI 20160814.4414452\nBrucellosis - USA: (TX) unpasteurized cheese, alert 20160311.4085659\n2015\n---\nBrucellosis - USA: (NY) imported, laboratory exposures 20150721.3525860\n2013\n---\nBrucellosis, human, abortus - USA: (NY) ex Ecuador, cheese 20130111.1492801\n2012\n---\nBrucellosis, human, canine - USA: (NY) B. canis 20120608.1160121\nBrucellosis, human - USA (03): (MA), unpasteurized milk, NOT 20120128.1024159\nBrucellosis, human - USA (02): (MA), unpasteurized milk 20120123.1019236\nBrucellosis, human - USA: (MA), unpasteurized milk 20120121.1017730\n2009\n---\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico (03): background 20090818.2933\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico (02): (GJ) 20090817.2909\nBrucellosis, unpasteurized cheese - Mexico: (GJ) 20090313.1028\n.................................................ll/je/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "hepatitis a", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2016-09-15 00:00:00", "2004-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "TEXAS", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Dallas", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Joaquin Valley", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Dallas County", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Actinobacteria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "Mexico"}, {"location": "Ecuador", "country": "Ecuador"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4475736", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - Israel (05): camel milk, unpasteurized, human infection", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4475736", "date": "2016-08-19 17:07:39", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - ISRAEL (04): CAMEL MILK, HUMAN INFECTION, COMMENT\n***************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 18 Aug 2016\nSource: Joshua Fierer <jfierer@ucsd.edu> [edited]\n\n\nLest we start feeling superior to Israel in this matter, so called certified raw milk is legally sold in at least 12 states in the USA, mostly in the west and the New England area.

I saw cases of _S._ Dublin associated with unpasteurized milk from the Altadena Dairy during my ID fellowship at Stanford 1974-1976.\n\nIn the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis 2012; 18(3): 385-91; available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article.htm), the authors reported on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products; 65 (54 percent) involved cheese, 42 percent made from unpasteurized milk; and 56 involved fluid milk, 82 percent involving unpasteurized milk.

Food Control 2013; 31(1): 251-62) is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.09.035. It addresses the arguments that pasteurization removes significant nutrients from milk.\n\nThe abstract, introduction, and conclusions are given below with the citations removed.\n\n\"Abstract\n---------\n\"In the context of the prevailing trend toward more natural products, there seems to be an increasing preference for raw milk consumption as raw milk is associated with several perceived health benefits that are believed to be destroyed upon heating. However, many human pathogens can be isolated from raw cow milk. The prevalence of foodborne pathogens in raw cow milk varies, but their presence has been demonstrated in many surveys, and foodborne infections have been repeatedly reported for _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_ spp and human pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ [VTEC]. In industrialized countries, milk-borne and milk product-borne outbreaks represent 2-6 percent of the bacterial foodborne outbreaks.\n\n\"The aim of this review is to present scientifically sound data regarding the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw and heated cow milk. Both microbiological aspects (such as the prevalence of milk-borne pathogens, pathogen growth inhibition by antimicrobial systems and by lactic acid producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria, etc) and nutritional or health aspects (nutritional value, immunity, allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, milk digestibility, etc) are considered.\n\n\"As such, it is demonstrated that consumption of raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. With the exception of an altered organoleptic profile [taste], heating (in particular ultra high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\n\n\"Introduction\n------------\n\"The consumption of raw milk is not well-documented, but in the context of the current trend toward 'consuming natural' and 'purchasing locally,' raw milk consumption is becoming more popular. This is nourished by the perception that heating destroys the nutritional and health benefits of milk, and can even induce some detrimental effects. However, due to its high nutritional value together with the neutral pH and high water activity [content?], raw milk serves as an excellent growth medium for different micro-organisms, whose multiplication depends mainly on temperature and on competing micro-organisms and their metabolic products. In order to guarantee its microbial safety and to prolong its shelf-life, milk is heat treated.\n\n\"The impact of milk pasteurization on public health can be clearly illustrated by means of historical data. Before 1938, an estimated 25 percent of all foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks in the USA were associated with milk, whereas nowadays, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk is estimated to be below 1 percent. Between 1880 and 1907, 29 milk-borne outbreaks were reported on average each year in the USA. With the adoption of pasteurization in 1938, milk-borne diseases dropped to only 46 outbreaks during the 19-year period from 1973 to 1992, corresponding to an average of 2.4 outbreaks each year. A recent report of the USA CDC indicates that the vast majority of milk-borne outbreaks in the USA are in states that permit the sale of raw milk. In England and Wales, the great majority of milk-borne outbreaks during the 1980s were attributed to the consumption of raw milk. In Scotland, a similar situation existed until the sale of unpasteurized milk was prohibited in 1983, which led to a significant drop of the incidence of diseases related to liquid milk consumption.\n\n\"In the mid-20th century, the main illnesses associated with raw milk consumption were brucellosis and tuberculosis. These have been eradicated as milk-borne diseases in developed countries, mainly through herd certification programs which included culling of infected animals, the installation of refrigerated bulk tanks for milk collection on farms, and the introduction of pasteurization. In the past, pasteurization conditions were standardized based on the destruction of _Mycobacterium bovis_, a relatively heat-resistant non-sporogenic bacterium that formerly was among the most serious pathogenic bacteria present in milk. Pasteurization standards today are based upon the destruction of _Coxiella burnetii_, the most heat-resistant milk-borne zoonotic pathogen known. In the past 30 years, several previously unrecognized foodborne bacterial infections, including infection with _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Escherichia coli_ strain O157 (or more general verocytotoxin-producing pathogenic _E. coli_ [VTEC]), have emerged as significant causes of human morbidity and mortality. Pathogens mainly present in raw milk today are, among others, _C. jejuni_, _Salmonella_ spp., _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, pathogenic _E. coli_ and _Yersinia enterocolitica_.\n\n\"In Europe, the current regulatory microbial criteria for raw cow milk are less than or equal to 100 000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for plate count (at 30 deg C/86 deg F) and less than or equal to 400 000 cfu/ml for somatic cells, as is stipulated in Regulation (EC) 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs. In this Regulation, health requirements for production animals and hygienic requirements on milk production holdings (such as regarding premises and equipment, hygiene during milking, collection, and transport, staff hygiene) are established as well. In general, raw milk intended for human consumption must meet the requirements of the General Food Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002) and be free of pathogens. Even though improvements in hygiene resulted in routine production of raw cow milk with less than 20 000 cfu (total flora)/ml), this does not guarantee raw milk to be free of pathogens. In approximately 1-6 percent of the human outbreaks reported in developed countries, milk has been identified as the vehicle of infection. An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 percent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 percent attributed to milk, 53.1 percent to cheese, and 7.8 percent to other milk products.\n\n\"Whereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw cow milk at one hand, and to evaluate the effect of heat treatments of milk on these risks and benefits on the other hand, considering the microbiological as well as the nutritional (health) aspects.\n\n\"Conclusions\n-----------\n\"In this evaluation it is clearly demonstrated that the consumption of raw milk poses a realistic and unnecessary health threat because of its possible contamination with pathogenic bacteria. It is therefore recommended to heat [raw] milk before consumption, especially when served to young children, pregnant women, or any person suffering from a chronic disease or a suppressed immune system. In this context the attention is drawn to raw milk provided on farms to the general public (such as during a school visit) and raw milk distributors allowing the automatic supply of raw milk from a bulk reservoir to the consumer.\n\n\"Historical data show that the pasteurization of milk has led to improved public health, and more recent data on occasional raw milk consumption indicate the hazard of bacterial infections, which could be avoided by a heat treatment. At present, thermal treatment remains the most frequently used and most effective method to increase the microbiological safety of milk without substantially changing the nutritional value of milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.

I saw cases of _S._ Dublin associated with unpasteurized milk from the Altadena Dairy during my ID fellowship at Stanford 1974-1976.\n\nIn the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis 2012; 18(3): 385-91; available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article.htm), the authors reported on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products; 65 (54 percent) involved cheese, 42 percent made from unpasteurized milk; and 56 involved fluid milk, 82 percent involving unpasteurized milk. In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, following by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ spp (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent).\n\nA recently published paper (Claeys WL, Cardoen S, Daube G, et al: Raw or heated cow milk consumption: Review of risks and benefits. Food Control 2013; 31(1): 251-62) is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.09.035. It addresses the arguments that pasteurization removes significant nutrients from milk.\n\nThe abstract, introduction, and conclusions are given below with the citations removed.\n\n\"Abstract\n---------\n\"In the context of the prevailing trend toward more natural products, there seems to be an increasing preference for raw milk consumption as raw milk is associated with several perceived health benefits that are believed to be destroyed upon heating. However, many human pathogens can be isolated from raw cow milk. The prevalence of foodborne pathogens in raw cow milk varies, but their presence has been demonstrated in many surveys, and foodborne infections have been repeatedly reported for _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_ spp and human pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ [VTEC]. In industrialized countries, milk-borne and milk product-borne outbreaks represent 2-6 percent of the bacterial foodborne outbreaks.\n\n\"The aim of this review is to present scientifically sound data regarding the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw and heated cow milk. Both microbiological aspects (such as the prevalence of milk-borne pathogens, pathogen growth inhibition by antimicrobial systems and by lactic acid producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria, etc) and nutritional or health aspects (nutritional value, immunity, allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, milk digestibility, etc) are considered.\n\n\"As such, it is demonstrated that consumption of raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. With the exception of an altered organoleptic profile [taste], heating (in particular ultra high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\n\n\"Introduction\n------------\n\"The consumption of raw milk is not well-documented, but in the context of the current trend toward 'consuming natural' and 'purchasing locally,' raw milk consumption is becoming more popular. This is nourished by the perception that heating destroys the nutritional and health benefits of milk, and can even induce some detrimental effects. However, due to its high nutritional value together with the neutral pH and high water activity [content?], raw milk serves as an excellent growth medium for different micro-organisms, whose multiplication depends mainly on temperature and on competing micro-organisms and their metabolic products. In order to guarantee its microbial safety and to prolong its shelf-life, milk is heat treated.\n\n\"The impact of milk pasteurization on public health can be clearly illustrated by means of historical data. Before 1938, an estimated 25 percent of all foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks in the USA were associated with milk, whereas nowadays, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk is estimated to be below 1 percent. Between 1880 and 1907, 29 milk-borne outbreaks were reported on average each year in the USA. With the adoption of pasteurization in 1938, milk-borne diseases dropped to only 46 outbreaks during the 19-year period from 1973 to 1992, corresponding to an average of 2.4 outbreaks each year. A recent report of the USA CDC indicates that the vast majority of milk-borne outbreaks in the USA are in states that permit the sale of raw milk. In England and Wales, the great majority of milk-borne outbreaks during the 1980s were attributed to the consumption of raw milk. In Scotland, a similar situation existed until the sale of unpasteurized milk was prohibited in 1983, which led to a significant drop of the incidence of diseases related to liquid milk consumption.\n\n\"In the mid-20th century, the main illnesses associated with raw milk consumption were brucellosis and tuberculosis. These have been eradicated as milk-borne diseases in developed countries, mainly through herd certification programs which included culling of infected animals, the installation of refrigerated bulk tanks for milk collection on farms, and the introduction of pasteurization. In the past, pasteurization conditions were standardized based on the destruction of _Mycobacterium bovis_, a relatively heat-resistant non-sporogenic bacterium that formerly was among the most serious pathogenic bacteria present in milk. Pasteurization standards today are based upon the destruction of _Coxiella burnetii_, the most heat-resistant milk-borne zoonotic pathogen known. In the past 30 years, several previously unrecognized foodborne bacterial infections, including infection with _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Escherichia coli_ strain O157 (or more general verocytotoxin-producing pathogenic _E. coli_ [VTEC]), have emerged as significant causes of human morbidity and mortality. Pathogens mainly present in raw milk today are, among others, _C. jejuni_, _Salmonella_ spp., _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, pathogenic _E. coli_ and _Yersinia enterocolitica_.\n\n\"In Europe, the current regulatory microbial criteria for raw cow milk are less than or equal to 100 000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for plate count (at 30 deg C/86 deg F) and less than or equal to 400 000 cfu/ml for somatic cells, as is stipulated in Regulation (EC) 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs. In this Regulation, health requirements for production animals and hygienic requirements on milk production holdings (such as regarding premises and equipment, hygiene during milking, collection, and transport, staff hygiene) are established as well. In general, raw milk intended for human consumption must meet the requirements of the General Food Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002) and be free of pathogens. Even though improvements in hygiene resulted in routine production of raw cow milk with less than 20 000 cfu (total flora)/ml), this does not guarantee raw milk to be free of pathogens. In approximately 1-6 percent of the human outbreaks reported in developed countries, milk has been identified as the vehicle of infection. An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 percent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 percent attributed to milk, 53.1 percent to cheese, and 7.8 percent to other milk products.\n\n\"Whereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw cow milk at one hand, and to evaluate the effect of heat treatments of milk on these risks and benefits on the other hand, considering the microbiological as well as the nutritional (health) aspects.\n\n\"Conclusions\n-----------\n\"In this evaluation it is clearly demonstrated that the consumption of raw milk poses a realistic and unnecessary health threat because of its possible contamination with pathogenic bacteria. It is therefore recommended to heat [raw] milk before consumption, especially when served to young children, pregnant women, or any person suffering from a chronic disease or a suppressed immune system. In this context the attention is drawn to raw milk provided on farms to the general public (such as during a school visit) and raw milk distributors allowing the automatic supply of raw milk from a bulk reservoir to the consumer.\n\n\"Historical data show that the pasteurization of milk has led to improved public health, and more recent data on occasional raw milk consumption indicate the hazard of bacterial infections, which could be avoided by a heat treatment. At present, thermal treatment remains the most frequently used and most effective method to increase the microbiological safety of milk without substantially changing the nutritional value of milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption. Table 4 [see source URL above] summarizes the main (claimed) benefits of raw milk consumption and the (claimed) detrimental effects of heating discussed in the present paper. Almost all arguments put forward by raw milk proponents for not heating milk, can be refuted, and the only substantial disadvantage of heating is the change in the organoleptic profile [taste] of milk. It is clear that this 'detrimental' effect of heating does not countervail the risk posed by raw milk consumption, namely of a milk-borne pathogen infection, which can have serious health consequences.\" - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis - Israel (03): camel milk, human infection confirmed, spread 20160817.4423219\nBrucellosis - Israel (02): camel milk, human infection susp, RFI 20160814.4416170\nBrucellosis - Israel: camel milk, multiple contaminants, recalls, RFI 20160814.4414452\nListeriosis - France: (LR) unpasteurized cheese, recall 20160723.4365160\nCampylobacteriosis - USA: (UT) unpasteurized milk, 2014 20160401.4131443\nListeriosis - USA (02): (FL, CA) fatal, unpasteurized milk, club membership, 2014 20160320.4107103\nSalmonellosis - USA (04): (CA) unpasteurized Mexican-style soft cheeses 20160318.4104009\nFoodborne illness - USA: (WV) susp. unpasteurized milk, state legislators 20160313.4089612\nBrucellosis - USA: (TX) unpasteurized cheese, alert 20160311.4085659\nBrucellosis - Israel: (HD) melitensis, bovine, human, RFI 20160302.4061936\nE. coli EHEC - USA (05): (CA) O157, unpasteurized milk, alert, recall 20160224.4047551\n2015\n----\nE. coli EHEC - USA (19): (CA) O111, unpasteurized apple juice, alert, recall 20151107.3774944\nCampylobacteriosis, E. coli EHEC - USA (02): (ID) unpasteurized milk 20151030.3755260\nCampylobacteriosis - USA: (CA) unpasteurized milk 20150327.3258683\nUnpasteurized milk - Ireland: infection risk 20150312.3224170\n2014\n----\nUnpasteurized milk - USA: infection risk, 2007-2012 20141224.3051804\nE. coli EHEC - Australia (02): (VI) unpasteurized cosmetic milk 20141213.3031852\nE. coli EHEC - Australia: (VI) unpasteurized milk, fatality 20141211.3027818\nE. coli EHEC - UK (15): O157, unpasteurized milk, alert 20141107.2936836\nE. coli EHEC - Canada (06): (ON) O157, unpasteurized cider, alert, recall 20141101.2920416\nE. coli EHEC - UK (13): (England) unpasteurized milk, alert, recall 20141005.2826830\nE. coli EHEC - USA (27): (KY) HUS cluster, unpasteurized milk 20140930.2817381\nCampylobacteriosis - USA (03): (UT) unpasteurized milk 20140827.2727937\nCampylobacteriosis - New Zealand: (CA) unpasteurized milk 20140329.2365370\n2013\n----\nUnpasteurized milk - USA: (MN) infection risk estimate 20131213.2114476\n.................................................ll/mj/arn/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "salmonellosis", "tuberculosis", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2016-08-18 00:00:00", "1980-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "1938-03-15 00:00:00", "1938-03-15 00:00:00", "1983-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "England", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Dublin", "country": "Ireland"}, {"location": "Regulation", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Scotland", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "Israel", "country": "Israel"}, {"location": "Wales", "country": "Australia"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4427272", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - Israel (04): camel milk, human infection, comment", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4427272", "date": "2016-08-19 17:07:39", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - ISRAEL (04): CAMEL MILK, HUMAN INFECTION, COMMENT\n***************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 18 Aug 2016\nSource: Joshua Fierer <jfierer@ucsd.edu> [edited]\n\n\nLest we start feeling superior to Israel in this matter, so called certified raw milk is legally sold in at least 12 states in the USA, mostly in the west and the New England area.

An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 percent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 percent attributed to milk, 53.1 percent to cheese, and 7.8 percent to other milk products.\n\n\"Whereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw cow milk at one hand, and to evaluate the effect of heat treatments of milk on these risks and benefits on the other hand, considering the microbiological as well as the nutritional (health) aspects.\n\n\"Conclusions\n-----------\n\"In this evaluation it is clearly demonstrated that the consumption of raw milk poses a realistic and unnecessary health threat because of its possible contamination with pathogenic bacteria. It is therefore recommended to heat [raw] milk before consumption, especially when served to young children, pregnant women, or any person suffering from a chronic disease or a suppressed immune system. In this context the attention is drawn to raw milk provided on farms to the general public (such as during a school visit) and raw milk distributors allowing the automatic supply of raw milk from a bulk reservoir to the consumer.\n\n\"Historical data show that the pasteurization of milk has led to improved public health, and more recent data on occasional raw milk consumption indicate the hazard of bacterial infections, which could be avoided by a heat treatment. At present, thermal treatment remains the most frequently used and most effective method to increase the microbiological safety of milk without substantially changing the nutritional value of milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption. Table 4 [see source URL above] summarizes the main (claimed) benefits of raw milk consumption and the (claimed) detrimental effects of heating discussed in the present paper. Almost all arguments put forward by raw milk proponents for not heating milk, can be refuted, and the only substantial disadvantage of heating is the change in the organoleptic profile [taste] of milk. It is clear that this 'detrimental' effect of heating does not countervail the risk posed by raw milk consumption, namely of a milk-borne pathogen infection, which can have serious health consequences.\" - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis - Israel (03): camel milk, human infection confirmed, spread 20160817.4423219\nBrucellosis - Israel (02): camel milk, human infection susp, RFI 20160814.4416170\nBrucellosis - Israel: camel milk, multiple contaminants, recalls, RFI 20160814.4414452\nListeriosis - France: (LR) unpasteurized cheese, recall 20160723.4365160\nCampylobacteriosis - USA: (UT) unpasteurized milk, 2014 20160401.4131443\nListeriosis - USA (02): (FL, CA) fatal, unpasteurized milk, club membership, 2014 20160320.4107103\nSalmonellosis - USA (04): (CA) unpasteurized Mexican-style soft cheeses 20160318.4104009\nFoodborne illness - USA: (WV) susp. unpasteurized milk, state legislators 20160313.4089612\nBrucellosis - USA: (TX) unpasteurized cheese, alert 20160311.4085659\nBrucellosis - Israel: (HD) melitensis, bovine, human, RFI 20160302.4061936\nE. coli EHEC - USA (05): (CA) O157, unpasteurized milk, alert, recall 20160224.4047551\n2015\n----\nE. coli EHEC - USA (19): (CA) O111, unpasteurized apple juice, alert, recall 20151107.3774944\nCampylobacteriosis, E. coli EHEC - USA (02): (ID) unpasteurized milk 20151030.3755260\nCampylobacteriosis - USA: (CA) unpasteurized milk 20150327.3258683\nUnpasteurized milk - Ireland: infection risk 20150312.3224170\n2014\n----\nUnpasteurized milk - USA: infection risk, 2007-2012 20141224.3051804\nE. coli EHEC - Australia (02): (VI) unpasteurized cosmetic milk 20141213.3031852\nE. coli EHEC - Australia: (VI) unpasteurized milk, fatality 20141211.3027818\nE. coli EHEC - UK (15): O157, unpasteurized milk, alert 20141107.2936836\nE. coli EHEC - Canada (06): (ON) O157, unpasteurized cider, alert, recall 20141101.2920416\nE. coli EHEC - UK (13): (England) unpasteurized milk, alert, recall 20141005.2826830\nE. coli EHEC - USA (27): (KY) HUS cluster, unpasteurized milk 20140930.2817381\nCampylobacteriosis - USA (03): (UT) unpasteurized milk 20140827.2727937\nCampylobacteriosis - New Zealand: (CA) unpasteurized milk 20140329.2365370\n2013\n----\nUnpasteurized milk - USA: (MN) infection risk estimate 20131213.2114476\n.................................................ll/mj/arn/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "salmonellosis", "tuberculosis", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2016-08-18 00:00:00", "1980-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "1938-03-15 00:00:00", "1938-03-15 00:00:00", "1983-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "England", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Dublin", "country": "Ireland"}, {"location": "Regulation", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Scotland", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "Israel", "country": "Israel"}, {"location": "Wales", "country": "Australia"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4423219", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - Israel (03): camel milk, human infection confirmed, spread", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4423219", "date": "2016-08-19 17:07:39", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - ISRAEL (04): CAMEL MILK, HUMAN INFECTION, COMMENT\n***************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 18 Aug 2016\nSource: Joshua Fierer <jfierer@ucsd.edu> [edited]\n\n\nLest we start feeling superior to Israel in this matter, so called certified raw milk is legally sold in at least 12 states in the USA, mostly in the west and the New England area.

Emerg Infect Dis 2012; 18(3): 385-91; available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article.htm), the authors reported on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products; 65 (54 percent) involved cheese, 42 percent made from unpasteurized milk; and 56 involved fluid milk, 82 percent involving unpasteurized milk.

Food Control 2013; 31(1): 251-62) is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.09.035. It addresses the arguments that pasteurization removes significant nutrients from milk.\n\nThe abstract, introduction, and conclusions are given below with the citations removed.\n\n\"Abstract\n---------\n\"In the context of the prevailing trend toward more natural products, there seems to be an increasing preference for raw milk consumption as raw milk is associated with several perceived health benefits that are believed to be destroyed upon heating. However, many human pathogens can be isolated from raw cow milk. The prevalence of foodborne pathogens in raw cow milk varies, but their presence has been demonstrated in many surveys, and foodborne infections have been repeatedly reported for _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_ spp and human pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ [VTEC]. In industrialized countries, milk-borne and milk product-borne outbreaks represent 2-6 percent of the bacterial foodborne outbreaks.\n\n\"The aim of this review is to present scientifically sound data regarding the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw and heated cow milk. Both microbiological aspects (such as the prevalence of milk-borne pathogens, pathogen growth inhibition by antimicrobial systems and by lactic acid producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria, etc) and nutritional or health aspects (nutritional value, immunity, allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, milk digestibility, etc) are considered.\n\n\"As such, it is demonstrated that consumption of raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. With the exception of an altered organoleptic profile [taste], heating (in particular ultra high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\n\n\"Introduction\n------------\n\"The consumption of raw milk is not well-documented, but in the context of the current trend toward 'consuming natural' and 'purchasing locally,' raw milk consumption is becoming more popular. This is nourished by the perception that heating destroys the nutritional and health benefits of milk, and can even induce some detrimental effects. However, due to its high nutritional value together with the neutral pH and high water activity [content?], raw milk serves as an excellent growth medium for different micro-organisms, whose multiplication depends mainly on temperature and on competing micro-organisms and their metabolic products. In order to guarantee its microbial safety and to prolong its shelf-life, milk is heat treated.\n\n\"The impact of milk pasteurization on public health can be clearly illustrated by means of historical data. Before 1938, an estimated 25 percent of all foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks in the USA were associated with milk, whereas nowadays, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk is estimated to be below 1 percent. Between 1880 and 1907, 29 milk-borne outbreaks were reported on average each year in the USA. With the adoption of pasteurization in 1938, milk-borne diseases dropped to only 46 outbreaks during the 19-year period from 1973 to 1992, corresponding to an average of 2.4 outbreaks each year. A recent report of the USA CDC indicates that the vast majority of milk-borne outbreaks in the USA are in states that permit the sale of raw milk. In England and Wales, the great majority of milk-borne outbreaks during the 1980s were attributed to the consumption of raw milk. In Scotland, a similar situation existed until the sale of unpasteurized milk was prohibited in 1983, which led to a significant drop of the incidence of diseases related to liquid milk consumption.\n\n\"In the mid-20th century, the main illnesses associated with raw milk consumption were brucellosis and tuberculosis. These have been eradicated as milk-borne diseases in developed countries, mainly through herd certification programs which included culling of infected animals, the installation of refrigerated bulk tanks for milk collection on farms, and the introduction of pasteurization. In the past, pasteurization conditions were standardized based on the destruction of _Mycobacterium bovis_, a relatively heat-resistant non-sporogenic bacterium that formerly was among the most serious pathogenic bacteria present in milk. Pasteurization standards today are based upon the destruction of _Coxiella burnetii_, the most heat-resistant milk-borne zoonotic pathogen known. In the past 30 years, several previously unrecognized foodborne bacterial infections, including infection with _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Escherichia coli_ strain O157 (or more general verocytotoxin-producing pathogenic _E. coli_ [VTEC]), have emerged as significant causes of human morbidity and mortality. Pathogens mainly present in raw milk today are, among others, _C. jejuni_, _Salmonella_ spp., _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, pathogenic _E. coli_ and _Yersinia enterocolitica_.\n\n\"In Europe, the current regulatory microbial criteria for raw cow milk are less than or equal to 100 000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for plate count (at 30 deg C/86 deg F) and less than or equal to 400 000 cfu/ml for somatic cells, as is stipulated in Regulation (EC) 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs. In this Regulation, health requirements for production animals and hygienic requirements on milk production holdings (such as regarding premises and equipment, hygiene during milking, collection, and transport, staff hygiene) are established as well. In general, raw milk intended for human consumption must meet the requirements of the General Food Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002) and be free of pathogens. Even though improvements in hygiene resulted in routine production of raw cow milk with less than 20 000 cfu (total flora)/ml), this does not guarantee raw milk to be free of pathogens. In approximately 1-6 percent of the human outbreaks reported in developed countries, milk has been identified as the vehicle of infection. An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 percent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 percent attributed to milk, 53.1 percent to cheese, and 7.8 percent to other milk products.\n\n\"Whereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates.

Pasteurization standards today are based upon the destruction of _Coxiella burnetii_, the most heat-resistant milk-borne zoonotic pathogen known. In the past 30 years, several previously unrecognized foodborne bacterial infections, including infection with _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Escherichia coli_ strain O157 (or more general verocytotoxin-producing pathogenic _E. coli_ [VTEC]), have emerged as significant causes of human morbidity and mortality. Pathogens mainly present in raw milk today are, among others, _C. jejuni_, _Salmonella_ spp., _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, pathogenic _E. coli_ and _Yersinia enterocolitica_.\n\n\"In Europe, the current regulatory microbial criteria for raw cow milk are less than or equal to 100 000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for plate count (at 30 deg C/86 deg F) and less than or equal to 400 000 cfu/ml for somatic cells, as is stipulated in Regulation (EC) 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs. In this Regulation, health requirements for production animals and hygienic requirements on milk production holdings (such as regarding premises and equipment, hygiene during milking, collection, and transport, staff hygiene) are established as well. In general, raw milk intended for human consumption must meet the requirements of the General Food Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002) and be free of pathogens. Even though improvements in hygiene resulted in routine production of raw cow milk with less than 20 000 cfu (total flora)/ml), this does not guarantee raw milk to be free of pathogens. In approximately 1-6 percent of the human outbreaks reported in developed countries, milk has been identified as the vehicle of infection. An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 percent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 percent attributed to milk, 53.1 percent to cheese, and 7.8 percent to other milk products.\n\n\"Whereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw cow milk at one hand, and to evaluate the effect of heat treatments of milk on these risks and benefits on the other hand, considering the microbiological as well as the nutritional (health) aspects.\n\n\"Conclusions\n-----------\n\"In this evaluation it is clearly demonstrated that the consumption of raw milk poses a realistic and unnecessary health threat because of its possible contamination with pathogenic bacteria. It is therefore recommended to heat [raw] milk before consumption, especially when served to young children, pregnant women, or any person suffering from a chronic disease or a suppressed immune system. In this context the attention is drawn to raw milk provided on farms to the general public (such as during a school visit) and raw milk distributors allowing the automatic supply of raw milk from a bulk reservoir to the consumer.\n\n\"Historical data show that the pasteurization of milk has led to improved public health, and more recent data on occasional raw milk consumption indicate the hazard of bacterial infections, which could be avoided by a heat treatment. At present, thermal treatment remains the most frequently used and most effective method to increase the microbiological safety of milk without substantially changing the nutritional value of milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption. Table 4 [see source URL above] summarizes the main (claimed) benefits of raw milk consumption and the (claimed) detrimental effects of heating discussed in the present paper. Almost all arguments put forward by raw milk proponents for not heating milk, can be refuted, and the only substantial disadvantage of heating is the change in the organoleptic profile [taste] of milk. It is clear that this 'detrimental' effect of heating does not countervail the risk posed by raw milk consumption, namely of a milk-borne pathogen infection, which can have serious health consequences.\" - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis - Israel (03): camel milk, human infection confirmed, spread 20160817.4423219\nBrucellosis - Israel (02): camel milk, human infection susp, RFI 20160814.4416170\nBrucellosis - Israel: camel milk, multiple contaminants, recalls, RFI 20160814.4414452\nListeriosis - France: (LR) unpasteurized cheese, recall 20160723.4365160\nCampylobacteriosis - USA: (UT) unpasteurized milk, 2014 20160401.4131443\nListeriosis - USA (02): (FL, CA) fatal, unpasteurized milk, club membership, 2014 20160320.4107103\nSalmonellosis - USA (04): (CA) unpasteurized Mexican-style soft cheeses 20160318.4104009\nFoodborne illness - USA: (WV) susp. unpasteurized milk, state legislators 20160313.4089612\nBrucellosis - USA: (TX) unpasteurized cheese, alert 20160311.4085659\nBrucellosis - Israel: (HD) melitensis, bovine, human, RFI 20160302.4061936\nE. coli EHEC - USA (05): (CA) O157, unpasteurized milk, alert, recall 20160224.4047551\n2015\n----\nE. coli EHEC - USA (19): (CA) O111, unpasteurized apple juice, alert, recall 20151107.3774944\nCampylobacteriosis, E. coli EHEC - USA (02): (ID) unpasteurized milk 20151030.3755260\nCampylobacteriosis - USA: (CA) unpasteurized milk 20150327.3258683\nUnpasteurized milk - Ireland: infection risk 20150312.3224170\n2014\n----\nUnpasteurized milk - USA: infection risk, 2007-2012 20141224.3051804\nE. coli EHEC - Australia (02): (VI) unpasteurized cosmetic milk 20141213.3031852\nE. coli EHEC - Australia: (VI) unpasteurized milk, fatality 20141211.3027818\nE. coli EHEC - UK (15): O157, unpasteurized milk, alert 20141107.2936836\nE. coli EHEC - Canada (06): (ON) O157, unpasteurized cider, alert, recall 20141101.2920416\nE. coli EHEC - UK (13): (England) unpasteurized milk, alert, recall 20141005.2826830\nE. coli EHEC - USA (27): (KY) HUS cluster, unpasteurized milk 20140930.2817381\nCampylobacteriosis - USA (03): (UT) unpasteurized milk 20140827.2727937\nCampylobacteriosis - New Zealand: (CA) unpasteurized milk 20140329.2365370\n2013\n----\nUnpasteurized milk - USA: (MN) infection risk estimate 20131213.2114476\n.................................................ll/mj/arn/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "salmonellosis", "tuberculosis", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2016-08-18 00:00:00", "1980-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "1938-03-15 00:00:00", "1938-03-15 00:00:00", "1983-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "England", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Dublin", "country": "Ireland"}, {"location": "Regulation", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Scotland", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "Israel", "country": "Israel"}, {"location": "Wales", "country": "Australia"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4414452", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - Israel: camel milk, multiple contaminants, recalls, RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4414452", "date": "2016-08-19 17:07:39", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - ISRAEL (04): CAMEL MILK, HUMAN INFECTION, COMMENT\n***************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 18 Aug 2016\nSource: Joshua Fierer <jfierer@ucsd.edu> [edited]\n\n\nLest we start feeling superior to Israel in this matter, so called certified raw milk is legally sold in at least 12 states in the USA, mostly in the west and the New England area.

Emerg Infect Dis 2012; 18(3): 385-91; available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article.htm), the authors reported on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products; 65 (54 percent) involved cheese, 42 percent made from unpasteurized milk; and 56 involved fluid milk, 82 percent involving unpasteurized milk.

It addresses the arguments that pasteurization removes significant nutrients from milk.\n\nThe abstract, introduction, and conclusions are given below with the citations removed.\n\n\"Abstract\n---------\n\"In the context of the prevailing trend toward more natural products, there seems to be an increasing preference for raw milk consumption as raw milk is associated with several perceived health benefits that are believed to be destroyed upon heating. However, many human pathogens can be isolated from raw cow milk. The prevalence of foodborne pathogens in raw cow milk varies, but their presence has been demonstrated in many surveys, and foodborne infections have been repeatedly reported for _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_ spp and human pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ [VTEC]. In industrialized countries, milk-borne and milk product-borne outbreaks represent 2-6 percent of the bacterial foodborne outbreaks.\n\n\"The aim of this review is to present scientifically sound data regarding the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw and heated cow milk. Both microbiological aspects (such as the prevalence of milk-borne pathogens, pathogen growth inhibition by antimicrobial systems and by lactic acid producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria, etc) and nutritional or health aspects (nutritional value, immunity, allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, milk digestibility, etc) are considered.\n\n\"As such, it is demonstrated that consumption of raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. With the exception of an altered organoleptic profile [taste], heating (in particular ultra high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\n\n\"Introduction\n------------\n\"The consumption of raw milk is not well-documented, but in the context of the current trend toward 'consuming natural' and 'purchasing locally,' raw milk consumption is becoming more popular. This is nourished by the perception that heating destroys the nutritional and health benefits of milk, and can even induce some detrimental effects. However, due to its high nutritional value together with the neutral pH and high water activity [content?], raw milk serves as an excellent growth medium for different micro-organisms, whose multiplication depends mainly on temperature and on competing micro-organisms and their metabolic products. In order to guarantee its microbial safety and to prolong its shelf-life, milk is heat treated.\n\n\"The impact of milk pasteurization on public health can be clearly illustrated by means of historical data. Before 1938, an estimated 25 percent of all foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks in the USA were associated with milk, whereas nowadays, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk is estimated to be below 1 percent. Between 1880 and 1907, 29 milk-borne outbreaks were reported on average each year in the USA. With the adoption of pasteurization in 1938, milk-borne diseases dropped to only 46 outbreaks during the 19-year period from 1973 to 1992, corresponding to an average of 2.4 outbreaks each year. A recent report of the USA CDC indicates that the vast majority of milk-borne outbreaks in the USA are in states that permit the sale of raw milk. In England and Wales, the great majority of milk-borne outbreaks during the 1980s were attributed to the consumption of raw milk. In Scotland, a similar situation existed until the sale of unpasteurized milk was prohibited in 1983, which led to a significant drop of the incidence of diseases related to liquid milk consumption.\n\n\"In the mid-20th century, the main illnesses associated with raw milk consumption were brucellosis and tuberculosis. These have been eradicated as milk-borne diseases in developed countries, mainly through herd certification programs which included culling of infected animals, the installation of refrigerated bulk tanks for milk collection on farms, and the introduction of pasteurization. In the past, pasteurization conditions were standardized based on the destruction of _Mycobacterium bovis_, a relatively heat-resistant non-sporogenic bacterium that formerly was among the most serious pathogenic bacteria present in milk. Pasteurization standards today are based upon the destruction of _Coxiella burnetii_, the most heat-resistant milk-borne zoonotic pathogen known.

However, due to its high nutritional value together with the neutral pH and high water activity [content?], raw milk serves as an excellent growth medium for different micro-organisms, whose multiplication depends mainly on temperature and on competing micro-organisms and their metabolic products. In order to guarantee its microbial safety and to prolong its shelf-life, milk is heat treated.\n\n\"The impact of milk pasteurization on public health can be clearly illustrated by means of historical data. Before 1938, an estimated 25 percent of all foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks in the USA were associated with milk, whereas nowadays, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk is estimated to be below 1 percent. Between 1880 and 1907, 29 milk-borne outbreaks were reported on average each year in the USA. With the adoption of pasteurization in 1938, milk-borne diseases dropped to only 46 outbreaks during the 19-year period from 1973 to 1992, corresponding to an average of 2.4 outbreaks each year. A recent report of the USA CDC indicates that the vast majority of milk-borne outbreaks in the USA are in states that permit the sale of raw milk. In England and Wales, the great majority of milk-borne outbreaks during the 1980s were attributed to the consumption of raw milk. In Scotland, a similar situation existed until the sale of unpasteurized milk was prohibited in 1983, which led to a significant drop of the incidence of diseases related to liquid milk consumption.\n\n\"In the mid-20th century, the main illnesses associated with raw milk consumption were brucellosis and tuberculosis. These have been eradicated as milk-borne diseases in developed countries, mainly through herd certification programs which included culling of infected animals, the installation of refrigerated bulk tanks for milk collection on farms, and the introduction of pasteurization. In the past, pasteurization conditions were standardized based on the destruction of _Mycobacterium bovis_, a relatively heat-resistant non-sporogenic bacterium that formerly was among the most serious pathogenic bacteria present in milk. Pasteurization standards today are based upon the destruction of _Coxiella burnetii_, the most heat-resistant milk-borne zoonotic pathogen known. In the past 30 years, several previously unrecognized foodborne bacterial infections, including infection with _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Escherichia coli_ strain O157 (or more general verocytotoxin-producing pathogenic _E. coli_ [VTEC]), have emerged as significant causes of human morbidity and mortality. Pathogens mainly present in raw milk today are, among others, _C. jejuni_, _Salmonella_ spp., _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, pathogenic _E. coli_ and _Yersinia enterocolitica_.\n\n\"In Europe, the current regulatory microbial criteria for raw cow milk are less than or equal to 100 000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for plate count (at 30 deg C/86 deg F) and less than or equal to 400 000 cfu/ml for somatic cells, as is stipulated in Regulation (EC) 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs. In this Regulation, health requirements for production animals and hygienic requirements on milk production holdings (such as regarding premises and equipment, hygiene during milking, collection, and transport, staff hygiene) are established as well. In general, raw milk intended for human consumption must meet the requirements of the General Food Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002) and be free of pathogens. Even though improvements in hygiene resulted in routine production of raw cow milk with less than 20 000 cfu (total flora)/ml), this does not guarantee raw milk to be free of pathogens. In approximately 1-6 percent of the human outbreaks reported in developed countries, milk has been identified as the vehicle of infection. An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 percent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 percent attributed to milk, 53.1 percent to cheese, and 7.8 percent to other milk products.\n\n\"Whereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw cow milk at one hand, and to evaluate the effect of heat treatments of milk on these risks and benefits on the other hand, considering the microbiological as well as the nutritional (health) aspects.\n\n\"Conclusions\n-----------\n\"In this evaluation it is clearly demonstrated that the consumption of raw milk poses a realistic and unnecessary health threat because of its possible contamination with pathogenic bacteria. It is therefore recommended to heat [raw] milk before consumption, especially when served to young children, pregnant women, or any person suffering from a chronic disease or a suppressed immune system. In this context the attention is drawn to raw milk provided on farms to the general public (such as during a school visit) and raw milk distributors allowing the automatic supply of raw milk from a bulk reservoir to the consumer.\n\n\"Historical data show that the pasteurization of milk has led to improved public health, and more recent data on occasional raw milk consumption indicate the hazard of bacterial infections, which could be avoided by a heat treatment. At present, thermal treatment remains the most frequently used and most effective method to increase the microbiological safety of milk without substantially changing the nutritional value of milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption. Table 4 [see source URL above] summarizes the main (claimed) benefits of raw milk consumption and the (claimed) detrimental effects of heating discussed in the present paper. Almost all arguments put forward by raw milk proponents for not heating milk, can be refuted, and the only substantial disadvantage of heating is the change in the organoleptic profile [taste] of milk. It is clear that this 'detrimental' effect of heating does not countervail the risk posed by raw milk consumption, namely of a milk-borne pathogen infection, which can have serious health consequences.\" - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis - Israel (03): camel milk, human infection confirmed, spread 20160817.4423219\nBrucellosis - Israel (02): camel milk, human infection susp, RFI 20160814.4416170\nBrucellosis - Israel: camel milk, multiple contaminants, recalls, RFI 20160814.4414452\nListeriosis - France: (LR) unpasteurized cheese, recall 20160723.4365160\nCampylobacteriosis - USA: (UT) unpasteurized milk, 2014 20160401.4131443\nListeriosis - USA (02): (FL, CA) fatal, unpasteurized milk, club membership, 2014 20160320.4107103\nSalmonellosis - USA (04): (CA) unpasteurized Mexican-style soft cheeses 20160318.4104009\nFoodborne illness - USA: (WV) susp. unpasteurized milk, state legislators 20160313.4089612\nBrucellosis - USA: (TX) unpasteurized cheese, alert 20160311.4085659\nBrucellosis - Israel: (HD) melitensis, bovine, human, RFI 20160302.4061936\nE. coli EHEC - USA (05): (CA) O157, unpasteurized milk, alert, recall 20160224.4047551\n2015\n----\nE. coli EHEC - USA (19): (CA) O111, unpasteurized apple juice, alert, recall 20151107.3774944\nCampylobacteriosis, E. coli EHEC - USA (02): (ID) unpasteurized milk 20151030.3755260\nCampylobacteriosis - USA: (CA) unpasteurized milk 20150327.3258683\nUnpasteurized milk - Ireland: infection risk 20150312.3224170\n2014\n----\nUnpasteurized milk - USA: infection risk, 2007-2012 20141224.3051804\nE. coli EHEC - Australia (02): (VI) unpasteurized cosmetic milk 20141213.3031852\nE. coli EHEC - Australia: (VI) unpasteurized milk, fatality 20141211.3027818\nE. coli EHEC - UK (15): O157, unpasteurized milk, alert 20141107.2936836\nE. coli EHEC - Canada (06): (ON) O157, unpasteurized cider, alert, recall 20141101.2920416\nE. coli EHEC - UK (13): (England) unpasteurized milk, alert, recall 20141005.2826830\nE. coli EHEC - USA (27): (KY) HUS cluster, unpasteurized milk 20140930.2817381\nCampylobacteriosis - USA (03): (UT) unpasteurized milk 20140827.2727937\nCampylobacteriosis - New Zealand: (CA) unpasteurized milk 20140329.2365370\n2013\n----\nUnpasteurized milk - USA: (MN) infection risk estimate 20131213.2114476\n.................................................ll/mj/arn/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "salmonellosis", "tuberculosis", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2016-08-18 00:00:00", "1980-03-15 00:00:00", "2012-03-15 00:00:00", "1938-03-15 00:00:00", "1938-03-15 00:00:00", "1983-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "England", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Dublin", "country": "Ireland"}, {"location": "Regulation", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Scotland", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "Israel", "country": "Israel"}, {"location": "Wales", "country": "Australia"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4288677", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - China: (HK) melitensis", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4288677", "date": "2016-08-19 17:07:39", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - ISRAEL (04): CAMEL MILK, HUMAN INFECTION, COMMENT\n***************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 18 Aug 2016\nSource: Joshua Fierer <jfierer@ucsd.edu> [edited]\n\n\nLest we start feeling superior to Israel in this matter, so called certified raw milk is legally sold in at least 12 states in the USA, mostly in the west and the New England area.

It addresses the arguments that pasteurization removes significant nutrients from milk.\n\nThe abstract, introduction, and conclusions are given below with the citations removed.\n\n\"Abstract\n---------\n\"In the context of the prevailing trend toward more natural products, there seems to be an increasing preference for raw milk consumption as raw milk is associated with several perceived health benefits that are believed to be destroyed upon heating. However, many human pathogens can be isolated from raw cow milk. The prevalence of foodborne pathogens in raw cow milk varies, but their presence has been demonstrated in many surveys, and foodborne infections have been repeatedly reported for _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_ spp and human pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ [VTEC]. In industrialized countries, milk-borne and milk product-borne outbreaks represent 2-6 percent of the bacterial foodborne outbreaks.\n\n\"The aim of this review is to present scientifically sound data regarding the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw and heated cow milk. Both microbiological aspects (such as the prevalence of milk-borne pathogens, pathogen growth inhibition by antimicrobial systems and by lactic acid producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria, etc) and nutritional or health aspects (nutritional value, immunity, allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, milk digestibility, etc) are considered.\n\n\"As such, it is demonstrated that consumption of raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. With the exception of an altered organoleptic profile [taste], heating (in particular ultra high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\n\n\"Introduction\n------------\n\"The consumption of raw milk is not well-documented, but in the context of the current trend toward 'consuming natural' and 'purchasing locally,' raw milk consumption is becoming more popular. This is nourished by the perception that heating destroys the nutritional and health benefits of milk, and can even induce some detrimental effects. However, due to its high nutritional value together with the neutral pH and high water activity [content?], raw milk serves as an excellent growth medium for different micro-organisms, whose multiplication depends mainly on temperature and on competing micro-organisms and their metabolic products. In order to guarantee its microbial safety and to prolong its shelf-life, milk is heat treated.\n\n\"The impact of milk pasteurization on public health can be clearly illustrated by means of historical data.

Results were received Wednesday [9 Dec 2015] from the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL) in Laramie. Logan, with concurrence of USDA-APHIS, has designated the herd from which the reactor cows originated as \"brucellosis affected\" as of Wed [9 Dec 2015].\n\nCattle from the Sublette County herd, located within Wyoming's Designated Surveillance Area (DSA), were positive to blood tests at the WSVL and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. Specified cattle from the DSA are required to be tested within 30 days prior to change of ownership or movement from counties within the DSA. The herd was quarantined on 19 Nov 2015 when preliminary tests were suspicious for brucellosis. The quarantine will remain in effect until the herd has undergone 3 consecutive, negative, whole-herd tests after any reactors have been removed from the herd.\n\nWhole-herd testing was conducted on the \"affected\" herd on 3 and 4 Dec 2015, and additional reactor animals were identified. There are 5 contact herds also under quarantine for herd testing. The contact herds will be released from quarantine if their herd tests are negative.\n\nThe testing is being conducted as a cooperative effort between herd owners, Wyoming Livestock Board (WLSB) personnel, and private veterinary practitioners. Epidemiologic interviews with herd owners are ongoing and quarantine herd plans will be developed with each herd owner associated with the case. Epidemiologic tracing will continue in the upcoming weeks by WLSB and APHIS personnel.\n\n\"Finding brucellosis in our DSA is not an unexpected event,\" said Logan. \"We have a reservoir of brucellosis in wildlife in northwest Wyoming that occasionally will spill over into cattle. Our producers do a good job of mitigating their risks and trying to prevent brucellosis in their cattle herds. This situation illustrates the value and effectiveness of our surveillance program in Wyoming.

Results were received Wednesday [9 Dec 2015] from the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL) in Laramie. Logan, with concurrence of USDA-APHIS, has designated the herd from which the reactor cows originated as \"brucellosis affected\" as of Wed [9 Dec 2015].\n\nCattle from the Sublette County herd, located within Wyoming's Designated Surveillance Area (DSA), were positive to blood tests at the WSVL and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. Specified cattle from the DSA are required to be tested within 30 days prior to change of ownership or movement from counties within the DSA. The herd was quarantined on 19 Nov 2015 when preliminary tests were suspicious for brucellosis. The quarantine will remain in effect until the herd has undergone 3 consecutive, negative, whole-herd tests after any reactors have been removed from the herd.\n\nWhole-herd testing was conducted on the \"affected\" herd on 3 and 4 Dec 2015, and additional reactor animals were identified. There are 5 contact herds also under quarantine for herd testing. The contact herds will be released from quarantine if their herd tests are negative.\n\nThe testing is being conducted as a cooperative effort between herd owners, Wyoming Livestock Board (WLSB) personnel, and private veterinary practitioners. Epidemiologic interviews with herd owners are ongoing and quarantine herd plans will be developed with each herd owner associated with the case. Epidemiologic tracing will continue in the upcoming weeks by WLSB and APHIS personnel.\n\n\"Finding brucellosis in our DSA is not an unexpected event,\" said Logan. \"We have a reservoir of brucellosis in wildlife in northwest Wyoming that occasionally will spill over into cattle. Our producers do a good job of mitigating their risks and trying to prevent brucellosis in their cattle herds. This situation illustrates the value and effectiveness of our surveillance program in Wyoming. We believe we found this case before the disease spread to other areas, and we are dealing with it appropriately.

Results were received Wednesday [9 Dec 2015] from the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL) in Laramie. Logan, with concurrence of USDA-APHIS, has designated the herd from which the reactor cows originated as \"brucellosis affected\" as of Wed [9 Dec 2015].\n\nCattle from the Sublette County herd, located within Wyoming's Designated Surveillance Area (DSA), were positive to blood tests at the WSVL and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. Specified cattle from the DSA are required to be tested within 30 days prior to change of ownership or movement from counties within the DSA. The herd was quarantined on 19 Nov 2015 when preliminary tests were suspicious for brucellosis. The quarantine will remain in effect until the herd has undergone 3 consecutive, negative, whole-herd tests after any reactors have been removed from the herd.\n\nWhole-herd testing was conducted on the \"affected\" herd on 3 and 4 Dec 2015, and additional reactor animals were identified. There are 5 contact herds also under quarantine for herd testing. The contact herds will be released from quarantine if their herd tests are negative.\n\nThe testing is being conducted as a cooperative effort between herd owners, Wyoming Livestock Board (WLSB) personnel, and private veterinary practitioners. Epidemiologic interviews with herd owners are ongoing and quarantine herd plans will be developed with each herd owner associated with the case. Epidemiologic tracing will continue in the upcoming weeks by WLSB and APHIS personnel.\n\n\"Finding brucellosis in our DSA is not an unexpected event,\" said Logan. \"We have a reservoir of brucellosis in wildlife in northwest Wyoming that occasionally will spill over into cattle. Our producers do a good job of mitigating their risks and trying to prevent brucellosis in their cattle herds. This situation illustrates the value and effectiveness of our surveillance program in Wyoming. We believe we found this case before the disease spread to other areas, and we are dealing with it appropriately. At this time, we do not have verification that this case has resulted from wildlife exposure, but that is very likely. The epidemiological investigation will give us an answer with time. All of Wyoming's cases of brucellosis, from 2003 to 2011, have been verified as elk source exposure.\"\n\nLogan would like to thank all the producers and veterinarians in the area for their good cooperation in a very difficult situation. \"We expect to complete the initial stages of this response by the end of December [2015] with follow-up testing to occur in the ensuing months.\"\n\nThe WLSB also has one Park County herd under quarantine for a brucellosis case verified in mid-November [2015].

Results were received Wednesday [9 Dec 2015] from the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL) in Laramie. Logan, with concurrence of USDA-APHIS, has designated the herd from which the reactor cows originated as \"brucellosis affected\" as of Wed [9 Dec 2015].\n\nCattle from the Sublette County herd, located within Wyoming's Designated Surveillance Area (DSA), were positive to blood tests at the WSVL and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. Specified cattle from the DSA are required to be tested within 30 days prior to change of ownership or movement from counties within the DSA. The herd was quarantined on 19 Nov 2015 when preliminary tests were suspicious for brucellosis. The quarantine will remain in effect until the herd has undergone 3 consecutive, negative, whole-herd tests after any reactors have been removed from the herd.\n\nWhole-herd testing was conducted on the \"affected\" herd on 3 and 4 Dec 2015, and additional reactor animals were identified. There are 5 contact herds also under quarantine for herd testing. The contact herds will be released from quarantine if their herd tests are negative.\n\nThe testing is being conducted as a cooperative effort between herd owners, Wyoming Livestock Board (WLSB) personnel, and private veterinary practitioners. Epidemiologic interviews with herd owners are ongoing and quarantine herd plans will be developed with each herd owner associated with the case. Epidemiologic tracing will continue in the upcoming weeks by WLSB and APHIS personnel.\n\n\"Finding brucellosis in our DSA is not an unexpected event,\" said Logan. \"We have a reservoir of brucellosis in wildlife in northwest Wyoming that occasionally will spill over into cattle. Our producers do a good job of mitigating their risks and trying to prevent brucellosis in their cattle herds. This situation illustrates the value and effectiveness of our surveillance program in Wyoming. We believe we found this case before the disease spread to other areas, and we are dealing with it appropriately. At this time, we do not have verification that this case has resulted from wildlife exposure, but that is very likely. The epidemiological investigation will give us an answer with time. All of Wyoming's cases of brucellosis, from 2003 to 2011, have been verified as elk source exposure.\"\n\nLogan would like to thank all the producers and veterinarians in the area for their good cooperation in a very difficult situation. \"We expect to complete the initial stages of this response by the end of December [2015] with follow-up testing to occur in the ensuing months.\"\n\nThe WLSB also has one Park County herd under quarantine for a brucellosis case verified in mid-November [2015].

Results were received Wednesday [9 Dec 2015] from the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL) in Laramie. Logan, with concurrence of USDA-APHIS, has designated the herd from which the reactor cows originated as \"brucellosis affected\" as of Wed [9 Dec 2015].\n\nCattle from the Sublette County herd, located within Wyoming's Designated Surveillance Area (DSA), were positive to blood tests at the WSVL and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. Specified cattle from the DSA are required to be tested within 30 days prior to change of ownership or movement from counties within the DSA. The herd was quarantined on 19 Nov 2015 when preliminary tests were suspicious for brucellosis. The quarantine will remain in effect until the herd has undergone 3 consecutive, negative, whole-herd tests after any reactors have been removed from the herd.\n\nWhole-herd testing was conducted on the \"affected\" herd on 3 and 4 Dec 2015, and additional reactor animals were identified. There are 5 contact herds also under quarantine for herd testing. The contact herds will be released from quarantine if their herd tests are negative.\n\nThe testing is being conducted as a cooperative effort between herd owners, Wyoming Livestock Board (WLSB) personnel, and private veterinary practitioners. Epidemiologic interviews with herd owners are ongoing and quarantine herd plans will be developed with each herd owner associated with the case. Epidemiologic tracing will continue in the upcoming weeks by WLSB and APHIS personnel.\n\n\"Finding brucellosis in our DSA is not an unexpected event,\" said Logan. \"We have a reservoir of brucellosis in wildlife in northwest Wyoming that occasionally will spill over into cattle. Our producers do a good job of mitigating their risks and trying to prevent brucellosis in their cattle herds. This situation illustrates the value and effectiveness of our surveillance program in Wyoming. We believe we found this case before the disease spread to other areas, and we are dealing with it appropriately. At this time, we do not have verification that this case has resulted from wildlife exposure, but that is very likely. The epidemiological investigation will give us an answer with time. All of Wyoming's cases of brucellosis, from 2003 to 2011, have been verified as elk source exposure.\"\n\nLogan would like to thank all the producers and veterinarians in the area for their good cooperation in a very difficult situation. \"We expect to complete the initial stages of this response by the end of December [2015] with follow-up testing to occur in the ensuing months.\"\n\nThe WLSB also has one Park County herd under quarantine for a brucellosis case verified in mid-November [2015]. That herd has since undergone one negative herd test. The only contact herd in this case has been released from quarantine, having tested clean on a whole-herd test.\n\nFor further information, please contact Logan at 307-857-4140 or 307-421-1682.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is Wyoming's 2nd case in a very short time.\n\nFor more information on brucellosis, readers are encouraged to read the moderator's comments on ProMED-mail posting 20151122.3811521. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/865.]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA: (WY) 20151122.3811521\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA (02): (WY) surveillance in elk 20150921.3660083\nBrucellosis - USA: (NY) imported, laboratory exposures 20150721.3525860\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA: (MT) ex WY NOT 20150127.3123696\n2014\n----\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (02): (MT) 20141217.3038019\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (MT) 20141207.3016488\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA (03): (ID) elk 20141121.2978284\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA (02): (WY) 20141114.2954061\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA: (MT) 20140319.2342816\n2013\n----\nBrucellosis, canine - USA: (MI) 20131201.2084249\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA: (MT) 20130927.1972253\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA (02): (WY) 20130531.1747202\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA: (WY) 20130404.1622341\nBrucellosis, human, abortus - USA: (NY) ex Ecuador, cheese 20130111.1492801\n2012\n----\nBrucellosis, pseudorabies, feral swine - USA: (AR) 20121214.1451750\nBrucellosis, marine mammal - USA: (ME) porpoise 20120701.1186087\nBrucellosis, human, canine - USA: (NY) B. canis 20120608.1160121\nBrucellosis, feral swine - USA: (NC) 20120416.1103073\nBrucellosis, cervids - USA (MT) 20120226.1052828\nBrucellosis - USA: (Gulf Coast) cetaceans, susp, RFI 20120201.1028538\nBrucellosis, human - USA (03): (MA), unpasteurized milk, NOT 20120128.1024159\nBrucellosis, human - USA (02): (MA), unpasteurized milk 20120123.1019236\nBrucellosis, human - USA: (MA), unpasteurized milk 20120121.1017730\n2011\n----\nBrucellosis, bison - USA (09) (MT) 20111204.3528\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (08): (MT) 20111118.3396\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (07): (WY) 20111015.3098\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (06): (MT) 20110925.2906\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (05): (MT) 20110915.2811\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (04): (TX) 20110322.0896\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (03): (TX) 20110320.0881\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (02): (TX) 20110316.0834\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA): (MT) 20110228.0659\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA: (WY) 20110212.0481\n2010\n----\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (04): (WY) bison 20101202.4325\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (03): (WY) 20101126.4261\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (02): (MT, WY) 20101107.4041\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA: (WY) 20101101.3956\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA (05): Yellowstone 20100427.1352\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA (04): Yellowstone 20100425.1340\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA (03): (Gtr.

This infection causes significant losses from decreased productivity and lost trade in much of the developing world. _B. melitensis_ is considered to be a re-emerging pathogen in the Middle East. It has been eradicated from some nations, but the cost of surveillance to remain _B. melitensis_-free is significant.\n\n_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is considered to be the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational exposure is seen in laboratory workers, farmers, veterinarians and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections. People who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. The Rev-1 _B. melitensis_ vaccine is also pathogenic for humans and must be handled with caution to avoid accidental injection or contamination of mucous membranes or abraded skin.\n\nAsymptomatic infections can occur in humans. In symptomatic cases, the disease is extremely variable, and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, brucellosis begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Some patients recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis and dermatitis can also occur. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes.\n\nTreatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms appear, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 percent to 5 percent. Death is usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis.\"\n\nTo date, 13 individuals have been diagnosed with brucellosis in the municipality of Rila.

This infection causes significant losses from decreased productivity and lost trade in much of the developing world. _B. melitensis_ is considered to be a re-emerging pathogen in the Middle East. It has been eradicated from some nations, but the cost of surveillance to remain _B. melitensis_-free is significant.\n\n_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is considered to be the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational exposure is seen in laboratory workers, farmers, veterinarians and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections. People who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. The Rev-1 _B. melitensis_ vaccine is also pathogenic for humans and must be handled with caution to avoid accidental injection or contamination of mucous membranes or abraded skin.\n\nAsymptomatic infections can occur in humans. In symptomatic cases, the disease is extremely variable, and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, brucellosis begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Some patients recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis and dermatitis can also occur. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes.\n\nTreatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms appear, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 percent to 5 percent. Death is usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis.\"\n\nTo date, 13 individuals have been diagnosed with brucellosis in the municipality of Rila. Given the occurrence of _B. melitensis_ in Bulgaria, many of these cases could be directly associated with infected herds detected in this municipality. It is not known whether human cases have been detected in the district of Pleven.

This infection causes significant losses from decreased productivity and lost trade in much of the developing world. _B. melitensis_ is considered to be a re-emerging pathogen in the Middle East. It has been eradicated from some nations, but the cost of surveillance to remain _B. melitensis_-free is significant.\n\n_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is considered to be the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational exposure is seen in laboratory workers, farmers, veterinarians and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections. People who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. The Rev-1 _B. melitensis_ vaccine is also pathogenic for humans and must be handled with caution to avoid accidental injection or contamination of mucous membranes or abraded skin.\n\nAsymptomatic infections can occur in humans. In symptomatic cases, the disease is extremely variable, and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, brucellosis begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Some patients recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis and dermatitis can also occur. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes.\n\nTreatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms appear, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 percent to 5 percent. Death is usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis.\"\n\nTo date, 13 individuals have been diagnosed with brucellosis in the municipality of Rila. Given the occurrence of _B. melitensis_ in Bulgaria, many of these cases could be directly associated with infected herds detected in this municipality. It is not known whether human cases have been detected in the district of Pleven.

This infection causes significant losses from decreased productivity and lost trade in much of the developing world. _B. melitensis_ is considered to be a re-emerging pathogen in the Middle East. It has been eradicated from some nations, but the cost of surveillance to remain _B. melitensis_-free is significant.\n\n_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is considered to be the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational exposure is seen in laboratory workers, farmers, veterinarians and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections. People who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. The Rev-1 _B. melitensis_ vaccine is also pathogenic for humans and must be handled with caution to avoid accidental injection or contamination of mucous membranes or abraded skin.\n\nAsymptomatic infections can occur in humans. In symptomatic cases, the disease is extremely variable, and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, brucellosis begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Some patients recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis and dermatitis can also occur. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes.\n\nTreatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms appear, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 percent to 5 percent. Death is usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis.\"\n\nTo date, 13 individuals have been diagnosed with brucellosis in the municipality of Rila. Given the occurrence of _B. melitensis_ in Bulgaria, many of these cases could be directly associated with infected herds detected in this municipality. It is not known whether human cases have been detected in the district of Pleven.

This infection causes significant losses from decreased productivity and lost trade in much of the developing world. _B. melitensis_ is considered to be a re-emerging pathogen in the Middle East. It has been eradicated from some nations, but the cost of surveillance to remain _B. melitensis_-free is significant.\n\n_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is considered to be the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational exposure is seen in laboratory workers, farmers, veterinarians and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections. People who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. The Rev-1 _B. melitensis_ vaccine is also pathogenic for humans and must be handled with caution to avoid accidental injection or contamination of mucous membranes or abraded skin.\n\nAsymptomatic infections can occur in humans. In symptomatic cases, the disease is extremely variable, and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, brucellosis begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Some patients recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis and dermatitis can also occur. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes.\n\nTreatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms appear, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 percent to 5 percent. Death is usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis.\"\n\nTo date, 13 individuals have been diagnosed with brucellosis in the municipality of Rila. Given the occurrence of _B. melitensis_ in Bulgaria, many of these cases could be directly associated with infected herds detected in this municipality. It is not known whether human cases have been detected in the district of Pleven.

Sporadic cases caused by _B. abortus_ have been rarely observed in these species.\n\nClinically, the disease is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of Brucella from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem.\n\nPresumptive diagnosis of _Brucella_ infection can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.\n\n_Brucella melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans, causing Malta fever, one of the most serious zoonoses in the world. All infected tissues, cultures, and potentially contaminated materials should therefore be handled at containment level 3. _B. melitensis_ is included in OIE list of reportable diseases/pathogens.\n\n_Brucella melitensis_ is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread world-wide. North America (except Mexico) is believed to be free from the agent, as are Northern and Central Europe, South-East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Southern and some central territories of the Russian Federation are long known to be infected by _B. melitensis_. The most recent Russian periodic report to the OIE, covering January-June 2014, mentions 19 new outbreaks (total of 30). In relation to the Tver oblast (north of Moscow; see maps at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tver_Oblast#/media/File:Tver_in_Russia.svg and http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/russia-political-enlarged-map.jpg) the following information could be derived from OIE's WAHID system, covering the period January 2005-June 2014: _B. melitensis_ cases have been reported only during the period July-December 2009 (2 cases in sheep/goats, destroyed) and January-June 2010 (7 cases in seep/goats, destroyed).\n\nAccording to a 2013 paper (Ref 1), brucellosis is still reported from all types of farms and domestic livestock in Russia, including strains of _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, and _B. ovis_. Between 1999 and 2009, the number of infected sites slightly increased, ranging from 54 in 2001 to 112 in 2009. The number of sites affected with _B. melitensis_ reportedly increased but remained low: 13 in 2004 and 21 in 2009 (see Fig. 2 \"Ovine brucellosis in the Russian Federation, 2003 to 2009\" in Ref 1). The current cases in Tver may be indicative of increased incidence.\n\n\"However\", the authors of Ref 1 say, \"relatively low number of brucellosis-infected areas does not diminish the epizootic and epidemic significance of sheep and goats in the transmission of brucellosis. Since the Soviet Union's dissolution at the beginning of the 1990s, social and economic changes in Russia have led to huge changes in the management and ownership of agricultural animals. About 80 percent of all sheep and goats, and more than 50 percent of all cattle, were transferred from state to private farms. New livestock owners were largely unable to implement costly anti-brucellosis measures. As these private farms now included multiple livestock species, favourable conditions arose for the transmission of _B. melitensis_ to cattle, leading to a dramatic rise in new cases of brucellosis in humans (adults and children), due to this pathogen. Over the last 2 decades, large and small animal brucellosis has become a considerable problem within the Southern Federal District, the Southern Volga region, and the Siberian Federal District.\"\n\n\"In recent years, the epizootic situation of brucellosis in Russia has been complicated by:\n- economic difficulties that led to drastic reductions in regulatory efforts to stem brucellosis,\n- less effective veterinary and customs controls in areas bordering brucellosis-infected territories (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia),\n- a decline in serological testing and vaccination of animals,\n- a reduction in microbiological evaluation of animal infection, leading to a lack of knowledge about the origin of infection,\n- a reduction in the ability to plan and implement brucellosis control policies in infected territories.\"\n\nAdditional updated information on brucellosis in animal and man is available in Ref 2.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

In relation to the Tver oblast (north of Moscow; see maps at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tver_Oblast#/media/File:Tver_in_Russia.svg and http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/russia-political-enlarged-map.jpg) the following information could be derived from OIE's WAHID system, covering the period January 2005-June 2014: _B. melitensis_ cases have been reported only during the period July-December 2009 (2 cases in sheep/goats, destroyed) and January-June 2010 (7 cases in seep/goats, destroyed).\n\nAccording to a 2013 paper (Ref 1), brucellosis is still reported from all types of farms and domestic livestock in Russia, including strains of _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, and _B. ovis_. Between 1999 and 2009, the number of infected sites slightly increased, ranging from 54 in 2001 to 112 in 2009. The number of sites affected with _B. melitensis_ reportedly increased but remained low: 13 in 2004 and 21 in 2009 (see Fig. 2 \"Ovine brucellosis in the Russian Federation, 2003 to 2009\" in Ref 1). The current cases in Tver may be indicative of increased incidence.\n\n\"However\", the authors of Ref 1 say, \"relatively low number of brucellosis-infected areas does not diminish the epizootic and epidemic significance of sheep and goats in the transmission of brucellosis. Since the Soviet Union's dissolution at the beginning of the 1990s, social and economic changes in Russia have led to huge changes in the management and ownership of agricultural animals. About 80 percent of all sheep and goats, and more than 50 percent of all cattle, were transferred from state to private farms. New livestock owners were largely unable to implement costly anti-brucellosis measures. As these private farms now included multiple livestock species, favourable conditions arose for the transmission of _B. melitensis_ to cattle, leading to a dramatic rise in new cases of brucellosis in humans (adults and children), due to this pathogen. Over the last 2 decades, large and small animal brucellosis has become a considerable problem within the Southern Federal District, the Southern Volga region, and the Siberian Federal District.\"\n\n\"In recent years, the epizootic situation of brucellosis in Russia has been complicated by:\n- economic difficulties that led to drastic reductions in regulatory efforts to stem brucellosis,\n- less effective veterinary and customs controls in areas bordering brucellosis-infected territories (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia),\n- a decline in serological testing and vaccination of animals,\n- a reduction in microbiological evaluation of animal infection, leading to a lack of knowledge about the origin of infection,\n- a reduction in the ability to plan and implement brucellosis control policies in infected territories.\"\n\nAdditional updated information on brucellosis in animal and man is available in Ref 2.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Sporadic cases caused by _B. abortus_ have been rarely observed in these species.\n\nClinically, the disease is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of Brucella from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem.\n\nPresumptive diagnosis of _Brucella_ infection can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.\n\n_Brucella melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans, causing Malta fever, one of the most serious zoonoses in the world. All infected tissues, cultures, and potentially contaminated materials should therefore be handled at containment level 3. _B. melitensis_ is included in OIE list of reportable diseases/pathogens.\n\n_Brucella melitensis_ is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread world-wide. North America (except Mexico) is believed to be free from the agent, as are Northern and Central Europe, South-East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Southern and some central territories of the Russian Federation are long known to be infected by _B. melitensis_. The most recent Russian periodic report to the OIE, covering January-June 2014, mentions 19 new outbreaks (total of 30). In relation to the Tver oblast (north of Moscow; see maps at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tver_Oblast#/media/File:Tver_in_Russia.svg and http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/russia-political-enlarged-map.jpg) the following information could be derived from OIE's WAHID system, covering the period January 2005-June 2014: _B. melitensis_ cases have been reported only during the period July-December 2009 (2 cases in sheep/goats, destroyed) and January-June 2010 (7 cases in seep/goats, destroyed).\n\nAccording to a 2013 paper (Ref 1), brucellosis is still reported from all types of farms and domestic livestock in Russia, including strains of _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, and _B. ovis_. Between 1999 and 2009, the number of infected sites slightly increased, ranging from 54 in 2001 to 112 in 2009. The number of sites affected with _B. melitensis_ reportedly increased but remained low: 13 in 2004 and 21 in 2009 (see Fig. 2 \"Ovine brucellosis in the Russian Federation, 2003 to 2009\" in Ref 1). The current cases in Tver may be indicative of increased incidence.\n\n\"However\", the authors of Ref 1 say, \"relatively low number of brucellosis-infected areas does not diminish the epizootic and epidemic significance of sheep and goats in the transmission of brucellosis. Since the Soviet Union's dissolution at the beginning of the 1990s, social and economic changes in Russia have led to huge changes in the management and ownership of agricultural animals. About 80 percent of all sheep and goats, and more than 50 percent of all cattle, were transferred from state to private farms. New livestock owners were largely unable to implement costly anti-brucellosis measures. As these private farms now included multiple livestock species, favourable conditions arose for the transmission of _B. melitensis_ to cattle, leading to a dramatic rise in new cases of brucellosis in humans (adults and children), due to this pathogen. Over the last 2 decades, large and small animal brucellosis has become a considerable problem within the Southern Federal District, the Southern Volga region, and the Siberian Federal District.\"\n\n\"In recent years, the epizootic situation of brucellosis in Russia has been complicated by:\n- economic difficulties that led to drastic reductions in regulatory efforts to stem brucellosis,\n- less effective veterinary and customs controls in areas bordering brucellosis-infected territories (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia),\n- a decline in serological testing and vaccination of animals,\n- a reduction in microbiological evaluation of animal infection, leading to a lack of knowledge about the origin of infection,\n- a reduction in the ability to plan and implement brucellosis control policies in infected territories.\"\n\nAdditional updated information on brucellosis in animal and man is available in Ref 2.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Mod.NR, edited]\nhttp://www.afanasy.biz/news/health/?ELEMENT_ID=82792\n\n\nTver veterinary laboratory specialists confirmed brucellosis in 7 out of 10 samples obtained from small ruminants in the village Danilovsk, Kalininsky district.\n\nThe information about the outbreak is being sent to the department of veterinary surveillance of the Tver and Pskov regions to initiate prevention measures addressing further spread of infection.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-RUS\n<promed-rus@promedmail.org>\n\n[The term \"small ruminants\", applied in the media report above, refers to goats (caprines) and sheep (ovines) combined. These 2 species share a common title name, also in several Middle Eastern countries, probably because many flocks are composed of both.\n\n_Brucella melitensis_ (biovars 1, 2, or 3) is the main causative agent of 'caprine and ovine brucellosis'. Sporadic cases caused by _B. abortus_ have been rarely observed in these species.\n\nClinically, the disease is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of Brucella from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem.\n\nPresumptive diagnosis of _Brucella_ infection can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.\n\n_Brucella melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans, causing Malta fever, one of the most serious zoonoses in the world. All infected tissues, cultures, and potentially contaminated materials should therefore be handled at containment level 3. _B. melitensis_ is included in OIE list of reportable diseases/pathogens.\n\n_Brucella melitensis_ is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread world-wide. North America (except Mexico) is believed to be free from the agent, as are Northern and Central Europe, South-East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Southern and some central territories of the Russian Federation are long known to be infected by _B. melitensis_. The most recent Russian periodic report to the OIE, covering January-June 2014, mentions 19 new outbreaks (total of 30). In relation to the Tver oblast (north of Moscow; see maps at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tver_Oblast#/media/File:Tver_in_Russia.svg and http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/russia-political-enlarged-map.jpg) the following information could be derived from OIE's WAHID system, covering the period January 2005-June 2014: _B. melitensis_ cases have been reported only during the period July-December 2009 (2 cases in sheep/goats, destroyed) and January-June 2010 (7 cases in seep/goats, destroyed).\n\nAccording to a 2013 paper (Ref 1), brucellosis is still reported from all types of farms and domestic livestock in Russia, including strains of _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, and _B. ovis_. Between 1999 and 2009, the number of infected sites slightly increased, ranging from 54 in 2001 to 112 in 2009. The number of sites affected with _B. melitensis_ reportedly increased but remained low: 13 in 2004 and 21 in 2009 (see Fig. 2 \"Ovine brucellosis in the Russian Federation, 2003 to 2009\" in Ref 1). The current cases in Tver may be indicative of increased incidence.\n\n\"However\", the authors of Ref 1 say, \"relatively low number of brucellosis-infected areas does not diminish the epizootic and epidemic significance of sheep and goats in the transmission of brucellosis. Since the Soviet Union's dissolution at the beginning of the 1990s, social and economic changes in Russia have led to huge changes in the management and ownership of agricultural animals. About 80 percent of all sheep and goats, and more than 50 percent of all cattle, were transferred from state to private farms. New livestock owners were largely unable to implement costly anti-brucellosis measures. As these private farms now included multiple livestock species, favourable conditions arose for the transmission of _B. melitensis_ to cattle, leading to a dramatic rise in new cases of brucellosis in humans (adults and children), due to this pathogen. Over the last 2 decades, large and small animal brucellosis has become a considerable problem within the Southern Federal District, the Southern Volga region, and the Siberian Federal District.\"\n\n\"In recent years, the epizootic situation of brucellosis in Russia has been complicated by:\n- economic difficulties that led to drastic reductions in regulatory efforts to stem brucellosis,\n- less effective veterinary and customs controls in areas bordering brucellosis-infected territories (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia),\n- a decline in serological testing and vaccination of animals,\n- a reduction in microbiological evaluation of animal infection, leading to a lack of knowledge about the origin of infection,\n- a reduction in the ability to plan and implement brucellosis control policies in infected territories.\"\n\nAdditional updated information on brucellosis in animal and man is available in Ref 2.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The patients were found infected by the brucellosis bacterium, known to contaminate cheese and unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The cases have been reported to the Ministry of Health.\n\nThe bacteria cause a disease known as \"Malta fever.\" The disease is found mainly in the non-Jewish sector in the Galilee [north], Wadi Ara [centre] and the Negev [south].\n\nThe Director of the pediatric infectious disease service in the Galilee medical center, Dr. Daniel Glickman, said the patients, arriving during the last 2 weeks at the hospital, are residents of the Druze villages Yarka and Julis, half of them children who consumed unpasteurized cheese; many of them relatives (father and daughter, cousins) who most probably consumed cheese from a common source.\n\n\"The signs of the disease are usually joint and bone pain, accompanied by high fever. The disease is not contagious among humans and is mainly treated by antibiotics,\" he said.\n\nThe patients were hospitalized in the pediatric and internal departments. One case, a 5-year-old girl, had to be hospitalized in the ICU to stabilize her condition.\n\nIt has been said that the current wave may continue, since the incubation period of exposed persons may take weeks and sometimes even months before clinically manifested. According to the Medical Center, throughout the course of 2013, only 10 patients had to be treated.\n\nAfter questioning by the hospital's doctors, 3 possible sources of infection have been identified.\n\nAbout 10 days ago, another cluster of brucellosis was discovered, in Jerusalem; 14 people were found infected following the consumption of unpasteurized cheese brought from the territory of the Palestinian Authority [West Bank].\n\n[Byline: Achiya Rabbed]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most likely, all reported cases of Malta fever (the commonly used name for brucellosis in Israel) have been caused by _Brucella melitensis_, the bacteria species which is regarded endemic. There is a concerning increase of reported human cases during recent years (see further data of 2011-2013). The true number of human infections is generally considered to be significantly higher, many remaining unreported.\n\nUnfortunately, humans seem to have become the sentinels of brucellosis in sheep/goat flocks.\n\nNumber of outbreaks in animals and human cases (OIE data)\n---------------------------------------------------------\nYear / Outbreaks in animals / Human cases / Rate per 100 000 population\n2011 / 6 / 127 / 1.8076\n2012 / 14 / 183 / 2.6046\n2013 / 11 / 336 / 4.7822\n\nThe majority of the human brucellosis cases in Israel are caused by the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products produced from family-owned sheep and/or goat flocks. Exposure to infected farm animals (occupational infection) is another common cause of infection. Though most of the human cases have been encountered, during previous years, in southern Israel, the current events are indicative of significant circulation of the agent in other parts of the country. The situation in the Palestinian territories is known to be even worse.\n\nThe main reservoir of _B. melitensis_ are sheep and goats, with the main symptom being abortions. _B. melitensis_ may occasionally infect cattle. In contrast to _B. abortus_, which causes abortions in cattle, _B. melitensis_ is not abortifacient in cattle, but will infect the udders, followed by massive discharge of the highly pathogenic bacteria in the milk and consequent human infections.\n\nResults of laboratory investigations, confirming the clinical diagnosis of the described cases, will be appreciated. It will be interesting to follow the epidemiological investigations at the 3 suspected sources of infection (Western Galilee) and obtain their results, hopefully identifying the source(s). Similarly, updates on ongoing and contemplated control measures will be welcomed.\n\nProMED-mail's request for information on a previous event is pending (see 20140513.2467609).\n\nFor the number of _Brucella melitensis_ outbreaks in Israel between 1990-2012, see page 47 (sheep/goats) and 48 (cattle) at http://www.moag.gov.il/agri/files/doh_shnati_2012.pdf.\n\nFurther reading:\n1.

The disease is caused by various bacteria of the family Brucella, which [each] tend to infect a specific animal species. However, most species of Brucella are able to infect other animal species as well. The disease affects cattle, swine, sheep and goats, camels, equines, and dogs. It may also infect other ruminants, some marine mammals, and humans.\n\nThe disease in animals is characterized by abortions or reproductive failure. While animals typically recover and will be able to have live offspring following the initial abortion, they may continue to shed the bacteria.\n\nBrucellosis in cattle (_B. abortus_) in sheep and goats (_B. melitensis_) and in swine (_B. suis_) are diseases listed in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (Terrestrial Animal Health Code).\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonosis highly infectious for humans causing a disease often called undulant fever or Malta fever, since it was 1st recognized in Malta during the 1850s http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/BCLS-EN.pdf.\n\nQuantitative information obtained from the OIE's WAHID database shows that during 2012, 9586 outbreaks of brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_) were reported in the region of the Americas: Bolivia (44), Brazil (1188), Canada (1), Chile (32), Colombia (9), Costa Rica (201), Cuba (33), Dominican Republic (101), Ecuador (62), El Salvador (31), Guatemala (173), Honduras (49), Mexico (6994), Nicaragua (22), Panama (1), Paraguay (508), Peru (4) and Uruguay (131). This information is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.\n\nIn the United States of America, 2 outbreaks were reported during 2012. The disease was limited to free-ranging bison (_Bison bison_) and wapiti (_Cervus elaphus_) in the Greater Yellowstone National Park area. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist/note/id/249/disn/Brucellosis%2B%2528Brucella%2Babortus%2529.\n\nThe disease is also present in Argentina and Venezuela, but no quantitative data are available http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist.\n\nPanama is the southernmost country of Central America. The country is situated on the isthmus connecting North and South America and is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama. The country is divided into 9 provinces: Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui, Cocle, Colon, Darien, Herrera, Los Santos, Panama and Veraguas. Capira is a district of the province of Panama http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capira_District.\n\nFrom January 2006 to December 2012, Panama reported 59 outbreaks of brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_).

The disease is caused by various bacteria of the family Brucella, which [each] tend to infect a specific animal species. However, most species of Brucella are able to infect other animal species as well. The disease affects cattle, swine, sheep and goats, camels, equines, and dogs. It may also infect other ruminants, some marine mammals, and humans.\n\nThe disease in animals is characterized by abortions or reproductive failure. While animals typically recover and will be able to have live offspring following the initial abortion, they may continue to shed the bacteria.\n\nBrucellosis in cattle (_B. abortus_) in sheep and goats (_B. melitensis_) and in swine (_B. suis_) are diseases listed in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (Terrestrial Animal Health Code).\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonosis highly infectious for humans causing a disease often called undulant fever or Malta fever, since it was 1st recognized in Malta during the 1850s http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/BCLS-EN.pdf.\n\nQuantitative information obtained from the OIE's WAHID database shows that during 2012, 9586 outbreaks of brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_) were reported in the region of the Americas: Bolivia (44), Brazil (1188), Canada (1), Chile (32), Colombia (9), Costa Rica (201), Cuba (33), Dominican Republic (101), Ecuador (62), El Salvador (31), Guatemala (173), Honduras (49), Mexico (6994), Nicaragua (22), Panama (1), Paraguay (508), Peru (4) and Uruguay (131). This information is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.\n\nIn the United States of America, 2 outbreaks were reported during 2012. The disease was limited to free-ranging bison (_Bison bison_) and wapiti (_Cervus elaphus_) in the Greater Yellowstone National Park area. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist/note/id/249/disn/Brucellosis%2B%2528Brucella%2Babortus%2529.\n\nThe disease is also present in Argentina and Venezuela, but no quantitative data are available http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist.\n\nPanama is the southernmost country of Central America.

The disease is caused by various bacteria of the family Brucella, which [each] tend to infect a specific animal species. However, most species of Brucella are able to infect other animal species as well. The disease affects cattle, swine, sheep and goats, camels, equines, and dogs. It may also infect other ruminants, some marine mammals, and humans.\n\nThe disease in animals is characterized by abortions or reproductive failure. While animals typically recover and will be able to have live offspring following the initial abortion, they may continue to shed the bacteria.\n\nBrucellosis in cattle (_B. abortus_) in sheep and goats (_B. melitensis_) and in swine (_B. suis_) are diseases listed in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (Terrestrial Animal Health Code).\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonosis highly infectious for humans causing a disease often called undulant fever or Malta fever, since it was 1st recognized in Malta during the 1850s http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/BCLS-EN.pdf.\n\nQuantitative information obtained from the OIE's WAHID database shows that during 2012, 9586 outbreaks of brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_) were reported in the region of the Americas: Bolivia (44), Brazil (1188), Canada (1), Chile (32), Colombia (9), Costa Rica (201), Cuba (33), Dominican Republic (101), Ecuador (62), El Salvador (31), Guatemala (173), Honduras (49), Mexico (6994), Nicaragua (22), Panama (1), Paraguay (508), Peru (4) and Uruguay (131). This information is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.\n\nIn the United States of America, 2 outbreaks were reported during 2012. The disease was limited to free-ranging bison (_Bison bison_) and wapiti (_Cervus elaphus_) in the Greater Yellowstone National Park area. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist/note/id/249/disn/Brucellosis%2B%2528Brucella%2Babortus%2529.\n\nThe disease is also present in Argentina and Venezuela, but no quantitative data are available http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist.\n\nPanama is the southernmost country of Central America.

The disease is caused by various bacteria of the family Brucella, which [each] tend to infect a specific animal species. However, most species of Brucella are able to infect other animal species as well. The disease affects cattle, swine, sheep and goats, camels, equines, and dogs. It may also infect other ruminants, some marine mammals, and humans.\n\nThe disease in animals is characterized by abortions or reproductive failure. While animals typically recover and will be able to have live offspring following the initial abortion, they may continue to shed the bacteria.\n\nBrucellosis in cattle (_B. abortus_) in sheep and goats (_B. melitensis_) and in swine (_B. suis_) are diseases listed in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (Terrestrial Animal Health Code).\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonosis highly infectious for humans causing a disease often called undulant fever or Malta fever, since it was 1st recognized in Malta during the 1850s http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/BCLS-EN.pdf.\n\nQuantitative information obtained from the OIE's WAHID database shows that during 2012, 9586 outbreaks of brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_) were reported in the region of the Americas: Bolivia (44), Brazil (1188), Canada (1), Chile (32), Colombia (9), Costa Rica (201), Cuba (33), Dominican Republic (101), Ecuador (62), El Salvador (31), Guatemala (173), Honduras (49), Mexico (6994), Nicaragua (22), Panama (1), Paraguay (508), Peru (4) and Uruguay (131). This information is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.\n\nIn the United States of America, 2 outbreaks were reported during 2012. The disease was limited to free-ranging bison (_Bison bison_) and wapiti (_Cervus elaphus_) in the Greater Yellowstone National Park area. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist/note/id/249/disn/Brucellosis%2B%2528Brucella%2Babortus%2529.\n\nThe disease is also present in Argentina and Venezuela, but no quantitative data are available http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist.\n\nPanama is the southernmost country of Central America.

Therefore, according to national regulations, modified stamping out, in this case of the reactors, is applied. No signs compatible with the disease were observed in the farm during the investigation, but, following the results obtained, an investigation has been launched in the farms in the zone in order to get more data and a possible source of infection.\n\nSummary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1\nTotal animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\nCattle / 78 / 4 / 0 / 0 / 4\nOutbreak statistics:\nSpecies / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\nCattle / 5.13 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 5.13 percent\n*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter\n\nEpidemiology:\nSource of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive\n\nEpidemiological comments: A field investigation has been launched in all the surrounding farms in order to detect additional outbreaks and the source of infection. It is appropriate to note that for this report, it has been taken into account that the disease has occurred in a zone where sampling was being done in order to declare the zone free from bovine brucellosis; no reactors had been detected previously in this zone.

The disease is caused by various bacteria of the family Brucella, which [each] tend to infect a specific animal species. However, most species of Brucella are able to infect other animal species as well. The disease affects cattle, swine, sheep and goats, camels, equines, and dogs. It may also infect other ruminants, some marine mammals, and humans.\n\nThe disease in animals is characterized by abortions or reproductive failure. While animals typically recover and will be able to have live offspring following the initial abortion, they may continue to shed the bacteria.\n\nBrucellosis in cattle (_B. abortus_) in sheep and goats (_B. melitensis_) and in swine (_B. suis_) are diseases listed in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (Terrestrial Animal Health Code).\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonosis highly infectious for humans causing a disease often called undulant fever or Malta fever, since it was 1st recognized in Malta during the 1850s http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/BCLS-EN.pdf.\n\nQuantitative information obtained from the OIE's WAHID database shows that during 2012, 9586 outbreaks of brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_) were reported in the region of the Americas: Bolivia (44), Brazil (1188), Canada (1), Chile (32), Colombia (9), Costa Rica (201), Cuba (33), Dominican Republic (101), Ecuador (62), El Salvador (31), Guatemala (173), Honduras (49), Mexico (6994), Nicaragua (22), Panama (1), Paraguay (508), Peru (4) and Uruguay (131). This information is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.\n\nIn the United States of America, 2 outbreaks were reported during 2012. The disease was limited to free-ranging bison (_Bison bison_) and wapiti (_Cervus elaphus_) in the Greater Yellowstone National Park area. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist/note/id/249/disn/Brucellosis%2B%2528Brucella%2Babortus%2529.\n\nThe disease is also present in Argentina and Venezuela, but no quantitative data are available http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist.\n\nPanama is the southernmost country of Central America. The country is situated on the isthmus connecting North and South America and is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama. The country is divided into 9 provinces: Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui, Cocle, Colon, Darien, Herrera, Los Santos, Panama and Veraguas. Capira is a district of the province of Panama http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capira_District.\n\nFrom January 2006 to December 2012, Panama reported 59 outbreaks of brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_). These 59 outbreaks were located in 7 of the 9 provinces. The incidence of brucellosis during this 7-year period and the distribution by province is summarized as follows:\nProvinces /2006 / 2007 / 2008 / 2009 / 2010 / 2011 / 2012\nBocas del Toro / / / 4 / 3 / 4 / / /\nChiriqui / 2 / 6 / 2 / 3 / 2 / / /\nCocle / 1 / 1 / / / / / /\nColon / / 1 / / / / / /\nDarien / / 1 / / / / / /\nLos Santos / / / 1 / / / / /\nVeraguas / 4 / 15 / 19 / 11 / 6 / 3 / 1\n\nThis information and additional data on Panama's outbreaks can be found in the OIE's WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.

In general, the geographical distribution of biovar 2 has historically been in a broad range between Scandinavia and the Balkans. The prevalence in wild boars appears to be high throughout continental Europe. In recent outbreaks in Europe, wild boars have been implicated as the source of transmission of biovar 2 to outdoor reared pigs; in rare cases, such as the one recently described in Belgium (see 20120520.1139015), other domestic animals, such as bovines, may become infected.\n\nIn addition to wild boars, the European hare (_Lepus capensis_) is also considered to be a reservoir for _B. suis_ biovar 2 and has been implicated as a possible source of transmission to domestic livestock. _Brucella suis_ biovar 2 causes miliary lesions, particularly in reproductive tissues, that often become purulent.

In recent outbreaks in Europe, wild boars have been implicated as the source of transmission of biovar 2 to outdoor reared pigs; in rare cases, such as the one recently described in Belgium (see 20120520.1139015), other domestic animals, such as bovines, may become infected.\n\nIn addition to wild boars, the European hare (_Lepus capensis_) is also considered to be a reservoir for _B. suis_ biovar 2 and has been implicated as a possible source of transmission to domestic livestock. _Brucella suis_ biovar 2 causes miliary lesions, particularly in reproductive tissues, that often become purulent. To date, biovar 2 has rarely been reported as the cause of human brucellosis. However, biovar 2 infection has been reported in 2 immuno-compromised hunters who had been extensively exposed through gutting or skinning boars or hares.\n\nThe above information is mainly derived from chapter 2.8.5 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, where additional information can be found; available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.05_PORCINE_BRUC.pdf.\n\nThe above OIE notification includes an interactive map.

In the context of a bulk tank milk screening aimed at controlling this outbreak, a sample from a farm near Florennes (Province of Namur) was found ELISA positive by the local 1st-line laboratory (ARSIA). Subsequent individual serum testing of all (155) lactating animals of this herd identified a single 4-year old cow (born on the farm and not pregnant) that tested positive by ELISA and sero-agglutination. This animal displayed no clinical symptom of brucellosis and was slaughtered on 23 Apr 2012.\n\nBacteriological tests were conducted at the national reference laboratory (CERVA-CODA) on lymph nodes, spleen and uterus. The lymph nodes were found negative, but colonies of a _Brucella_ sp. were isolated from both the spleen and the uterus and were unexpectedly identified as _Brucella suis biovar 2_ (_B. suis bv2_) using both biochemical and molecular typing methods. A B. suis-specific real-time PCR test (Ref 1) turned positive on DNA extracted directly from the uterus, ruling out a possible cross-contamination in the laboratory. Molecular typing of this cow isolate demonstrated a genetic profile highly related to the profile of _B. suis bv2_ strains normally retrieved from wild boars in Belgium. None of the other animals in the herd was found positive for Brucella.\n\nAuthorities have ordered a one-month hunting campaign in the surroundings of Florennes [which] started on 19 May 2012 with the aim of reducing urgently the local wild boar population while providing an opportunity to investigate _B. suis_ carriage in these animals. A key issue will be achieved by comparing the genetic profile of the cow isolate to that of the local wild boar strains, if those turn out to be carriers of _B. suis bv2_.\n\nWild boars and hares are known to be infected by _B. suis bv 2_ in many European countries. A case of cattle infection by _B. suis bv2_ probably transmitted from an infected wild hare was reported in Denmark in 1995 (Ref 2). In the present case, contaminated wild boars are the most probable source of infection. The wild boar population of the Walloon region in Belgium is known to be steadily increasing since the last 2 decades, with a concomitant risk of introducing swine brucellosis in pig farms, especially when pigs are raised outdoors. However, the way _B. suis bv2_ can be passed from wild boars to cattle as reported here remains elusive.\n\nContaminated viscera from a hunted animal or aborted material left over in a pasture are possible contamination sources. It should be reminded that harvested viscera and carcasses of wild boars shot dead by hunters represent a potential contamination risk for susceptible animals and [should] not be left over in the natural environment, especially in the vicinity of pastures or farming areas.\n\nReferences\n1.

In the context of a bulk tank milk screening aimed at controlling this outbreak, a sample from a farm near Florennes (Province of Namur) was found ELISA positive by the local 1st-line laboratory (ARSIA). Subsequent individual serum testing of all (155) lactating animals of this herd identified a single 4-year old cow (born on the farm and not pregnant) that tested positive by ELISA and sero-agglutination. This animal displayed no clinical symptom of brucellosis and was slaughtered on 23 Apr 2012.\n\nBacteriological tests were conducted at the national reference laboratory (CERVA-CODA) on lymph nodes, spleen and uterus. The lymph nodes were found negative, but colonies of a _Brucella_ sp. were isolated from both the spleen and the uterus and were unexpectedly identified as _Brucella suis biovar 2_ (_B. suis bv2_) using both biochemical and molecular typing methods. A B. suis-specific real-time PCR test (Ref 1) turned positive on DNA extracted directly from the uterus, ruling out a possible cross-contamination in the laboratory. Molecular typing of this cow isolate demonstrated a genetic profile highly related to the profile of _B. suis bv2_ strains normally retrieved from wild boars in Belgium. None of the other animals in the herd was found positive for Brucella.\n\nAuthorities have ordered a one-month hunting campaign in the surroundings of Florennes [which] started on 19 May 2012 with the aim of reducing urgently the local wild boar population while providing an opportunity to investigate _B. suis_ carriage in these animals. A key issue will be achieved by comparing the genetic profile of the cow isolate to that of the local wild boar strains, if those turn out to be carriers of _B. suis bv2_.\n\nWild boars and hares are known to be infected by _B. suis bv 2_ in many European countries. A case of cattle infection by _B. suis bv2_ probably transmitted from an infected wild hare was reported in Denmark in 1995 (Ref 2). In the present case, contaminated wild boars are the most probable source of infection. The wild boar population of the Walloon region in Belgium is known to be steadily increasing since the last 2 decades, with a concomitant risk of introducing swine brucellosis in pig farms, especially when pigs are raised outdoors. However, the way _B. suis bv2_ can be passed from wild boars to cattle as reported here remains elusive.\n\nContaminated viscera from a hunted animal or aborted material left over in a pasture are possible contamination sources. It should be reminded that harvested viscera and carcasses of wild boars shot dead by hunters represent a potential contamination risk for susceptible animals and [should] not be left over in the natural environment, especially in the vicinity of pastures or farming areas.\n\nReferences\n1.

Researchers found that about 9 percent of feral pigs studied in Johnston County and less than one percent surveyed randomly at 13 other sites across the state showed exposure to _B. suis_.\n\nSuzanne Kennedy-Stoskopf, a North Carolina State research professor of wildlife infectious diseases, says that testing positive for antibodies to _B. suis_ means the feral pigs have been exposed to and mounted an immune response against the bacteria. Antibodies do not eliminate _B. suis_ from pigs, so the animals are considered infected and capable of transmitting the bacteria to other pigs and people. The United States has long had a swine brucellosis control and eradication program, which by the late 1990s eliminated the disease from all commercial pig populations.\n\nFor the domestic swine herd, the risk is that the bacteria can spread beyond feral hogs and cause abortions in affected swine. Kennedy-Stoskopf says that _B.suis_ can be transmitted when pigs ingest infected tissue or fluids. Also, direct contact with infected pigs or ingestion of contaminated food and water could cause currently uninfected pig populations to become infected.\n\nBiosecurity protocols in place to prevent herd exposure to other pathogens are important in preventing the spread of _B.suis_ into a domestic herd. \"Spillover from infected feral pigs to commercial pigs is an economic and a public-health concern,\" Kennedy-Stoskopf said. \"The biggest public-health risk is to pork processors and hunters who field dress feral pigs.\"\n\nThe study\"s co-author, Chris DePerno, associate professor of forestry and environmental resources at North Carolina State, points out the bacteria are transmitted to humans by unsafe butchering and consumption of undercooked meat. \"Now that exposure to _B. suis_ has been found in North Carolina's feral pig populations, people need to take care when hunting, butchering and cooking feral pigs,\" he said. \"That means wearing gloves when field dressing feral pigs and cooking the meat to the proper temperature.\"\n\nKennedy-Stoskopf emphasizes that although cases of brucellosis are rare in the United States, people need to understand the clinical signs, which mimic the flu and feature intermittent fevers and persistent headaches. \"Because clinical signs are so non-specific, it's important to tell your physician if you have had any exposure to feral swine carcasses and meat,\" she added.\n\nFeral pig populations are exploding across the country, and are in nearly every state. Efforts to control them often meet with controversy. \"Control of feral pig populations is difficult at best,\" DePerno says. \"Research indicates that about 70 percent of the population will need to be removed each year to keep a wild population stable. Regarding feral pigs, hunting usually removes from 8-50 percent of a given wild population.\"\n\nDePerno hopes that more research on how far feral pigs travel -- and increased scrutiny of hunters who move feral pigs from place to place -- will help keep feral populations from spreading.\n\nThe North Carolina State research is published in Journal of Wildlife Diseases.\n\n[Byline: Marlys Miller]\n\n---\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The article referred to can be found at http://www.jwildlifedis.org/content/48/2/462.abstract?sid=1258a59a-28d4-4c99-b9bc-a33c02853735.\n\nThe rapid growth of the feral swine population in the USA raises concern and entails health risks for humans, domestic animals and the whole ecosystem. _Brucella suis_ is a pathogen that can be transmitted to humans, and spillover into the domestic swine population can adversely impact profits. Enhancing feral swine control measures is crucial to avoiding the emergence or re-emergence of this and other infectious diseases in humans, domestic swine, and even native wildlife species.\n\nThe interactive HealthMap/ProMED-mail map for the affected region is available at: http://healthmap.org/r/1s-V. - Mod.PMB]\n\n[The human cases in Pennsylvania & South Carolina (reported in the 2009 ProMED archives below) were in people who had hunted feral swine in Florida in December 2007.

Researchers found that about 9 percent of feral pigs studied in Johnston County and less than one percent surveyed randomly at 13 other sites across the state showed exposure to _B. suis_.\n\nSuzanne Kennedy-Stoskopf, a North Carolina State research professor of wildlife infectious diseases, says that testing positive for antibodies to _B. suis_ means the feral pigs have been exposed to and mounted an immune response against the bacteria. Antibodies do not eliminate _B. suis_ from pigs, so the animals are considered infected and capable of transmitting the bacteria to other pigs and people. The United States has long had a swine brucellosis control and eradication program, which by the late 1990s eliminated the disease from all commercial pig populations.\n\nFor the domestic swine herd, the risk is that the bacteria can spread beyond feral hogs and cause abortions in affected swine. Kennedy-Stoskopf says that _B.suis_ can be transmitted when pigs ingest infected tissue or fluids. Also, direct contact with infected pigs or ingestion of contaminated food and water could cause currently uninfected pig populations to become infected.\n\nBiosecurity protocols in place to prevent herd exposure to other pathogens are important in preventing the spread of _B.suis_ into a domestic herd. \"Spillover from infected feral pigs to commercial pigs is an economic and a public-health concern,\" Kennedy-Stoskopf said. \"The biggest public-health risk is to pork processors and hunters who field dress feral pigs.\"\n\nThe study\"s co-author, Chris DePerno, associate professor of forestry and environmental resources at North Carolina State, points out the bacteria are transmitted to humans by unsafe butchering and consumption of undercooked meat. \"Now that exposure to _B. suis_ has been found in North Carolina's feral pig populations, people need to take care when hunting, butchering and cooking feral pigs,\" he said. \"That means wearing gloves when field dressing feral pigs and cooking the meat to the proper temperature.\"\n\nKennedy-Stoskopf emphasizes that although cases of brucellosis are rare in the United States, people need to understand the clinical signs, which mimic the flu and feature intermittent fevers and persistent headaches. \"Because clinical signs are so non-specific, it's important to tell your physician if you have had any exposure to feral swine carcasses and meat,\" she added.\n\nFeral pig populations are exploding across the country, and are in nearly every state.

Brucellosis has been put on CDC's list of 60-plus transmittable diseases that must be reported in order to lower the risk of its spread, said Chou Jih-haw, its deputy director-general.\n\nTaiwan had been free of brucellosis for 3 decades, but there were 5 imported cases last year between May and October 2011, Chou said, explaining why CDC has taken the decision to list brucellosis as a notifiable disease. The 5 confirmed cases were Taiwan nationals who had contracted the disease during overseas travel, one in North Africa, 3 in Malaysia, and the 5th in China, Chou said.\n\nHe urged doctors to be vigilant in checking patients for symptoms of the disease, which include fever, abdominal pain, excessive sweating, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, fatigue and depression. Brucellosis is caused by a bacteria that can infect cattle, goats, camels, dogs and pigs. The bacteria can spread to humans if they come in contact with infected meat or the placenta of infected animals, or if they eat or drink unpasteurized milk or cheese.\n\nPeople visiting countries at risk, those in Africa, the Middle East, and South East Asia, should avoid close contact with animals and should not consume raw meat, unpasteurized milk, or cheese during their trip, CDC advised.\n\n[byline: Nancy Liu]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[No information is given in the posting regarding the manifestations of brucellosis in these imported cases or the species of _Brucella_ involved.

He was reacting to\nreports made by one media organisation that some\npeople were dying due to being in contact with\nand looking after livestock infected with brucellosis.\n\n\"What we know and understand that cows have been\ninfected and have died from brucellosis,\" Col\nSmith said. Col Smith said one of his senior\nstaff said comments conducted in Fijian were\nmisinterpreted by the media organisation when translating it for news.\n\nEarlier last week, Col Mason Smith said 7 farms\nwhich were quarantined for brucellosis had been\ninformed of the latest test results received from\nAustralia. He said the 7 farms were still being\nquarantined but this would be reviewed after they\nreceived the results from Australia.\n\nCol Smith said the farms that were not being\nquarantined by their officers had been given \"the\ngreen light\" to continue with their daily work.\nHe said this also included selling their cattle to other farms or customers.\n\n[Byline: Reijeli Kikau]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promedmail@promedmail.org>\n\n[These articles do not say if these are dairy\ncattle, but it is strongly likely they are dairy operations.\n\nDairy cattle infected with brucellosis can\ntransmit the disease to humans through the\nconsumption of raw or unpasteurized milk.\n\nThe disease in cattle, water buffalo, and bison\nis caused almost exclusively by _Brucella\nabortus_ ; however, _B suis_ or _B melitensis_ is\noccasionally implicated in some cattle herds. B\nsuis does not appear to be contagious from cow to\ncow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many\nabortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in\nwhich disease is endemic, an infected cow\ntypically aborts only once after exposure;\nsubsequent gestations and lactations appear normal.\n\nAfter exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a\nshort period and develop agglutinins and other\nantibodies; some resist infection and a small\npercentage of infected cows recover. A positive\nserum agglutination test usually precedes an\nabortion or a normal parturition but may be\ndelayed in approximately 15 percent of cows. The\nincubation period may be variable and is\ninversely related to stage of gestation at time\nof exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and\nuterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile.\n\nBacteria may be found in the uterus during\npregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently,\nfor a prolonged time in the nongravid uterus.\nShedding from the vagina largely disappears with\nthe decrease of fluids following parturition.\nSome infected cows that previously aborted shed\nbrucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal\nparturitions.

B\nsuis does not appear to be contagious from cow to\ncow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many\nabortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in\nwhich disease is endemic, an infected cow\ntypically aborts only once after exposure;\nsubsequent gestations and lactations appear normal.\n\nAfter exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a\nshort period and develop agglutinins and other\nantibodies; some resist infection and a small\npercentage of infected cows recover. A positive\nserum agglutination test usually precedes an\nabortion or a normal parturition but may be\ndelayed in approximately 15 percent of cows. The\nincubation period may be variable and is\ninversely related to stage of gestation at time\nof exposure.

He was reacting to\nreports made by one media organisation that some\npeople were dying due to being in contact with\nand looking after livestock infected with brucellosis.\n\n\"What we know and understand that cows have been\ninfected and have died from brucellosis,\" Col\nSmith said. Col Smith said one of his senior\nstaff said comments conducted in Fijian were\nmisinterpreted by the media organisation when translating it for news.\n\nEarlier last week, Col Mason Smith said 7 farms\nwhich were quarantined for brucellosis had been\ninformed of the latest test results received from\nAustralia. He said the 7 farms were still being\nquarantined but this would be reviewed after they\nreceived the results from Australia.\n\nCol Smith said the farms that were not being\nquarantined by their officers had been given \"the\ngreen light\" to continue with their daily work.\nHe said this also included selling their cattle to other farms or customers.\n\n[Byline: Reijeli Kikau]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promedmail@promedmail.org>\n\n[These articles do not say if these are dairy\ncattle, but it is strongly likely they are dairy operations.\n\nDairy cattle infected with brucellosis can\ntransmit the disease to humans through the\nconsumption of raw or unpasteurized milk.\n\nThe disease in cattle, water buffalo, and bison\nis caused almost exclusively by _Brucella\nabortus_ ; however, _B suis_ or _B melitensis_ is\noccasionally implicated in some cattle herds. B\nsuis does not appear to be contagious from cow to\ncow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many\nabortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in\nwhich disease is endemic, an infected cow\ntypically aborts only once after exposure;\nsubsequent gestations and lactations appear normal.\n\nAfter exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a\nshort period and develop agglutinins and other\nantibodies; some resist infection and a small\npercentage of infected cows recover. A positive\nserum agglutination test usually precedes an\nabortion or a normal parturition but may be\ndelayed in approximately 15 percent of cows. The\nincubation period may be variable and is\ninversely related to stage of gestation at time\nof exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and\nuterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile.\n\nBacteria may be found in the uterus during\npregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently,\nfor a prolonged time in the nongravid uterus.\nShedding from the vagina largely disappears with\nthe decrease of fluids following parturition.\nSome infected cows that previously aborted shed\nbrucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal\nparturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a\nvariable length of time\u0097in most cattle for life.\n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of\norganisms, which are present in large numbers in\naborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine\ndischarges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed\nand water, or lick contaminated genitals of other\nanimals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls\nto susceptible cows appears to be rare.\nTransmission may occur by artificial insemination\nwhen Brucella -contaminated semen is deposited in\nthe uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited in\nthe midcervix. _Brucellae_ may enter the body\nthrough mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.\n\n_Brucellae_ have been recovered from fetuses and\nfrom manure that has remained in a cool\nenvironment for greater than 2 months. Exposure\nto direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.\n\nEfforts are directed at detection and prevention\nbecause no practical treatment is available.\nEventual eradication depends on testing and\neliminating reactors. The disease has been\neradicated from many individual herds and areas\nby this method. Herds must be tested at regular\nintervals until 2 or 3 successive tests are negative.\n\nBecause organisms are shed in the milk,\nunpasteurized milk, and cheese represent a human\nhealth concern. Many individuals believe drinking\nunpasteurized milk is better for their health.\nDiseases that are not killed by pasteurization\nrepresent a risk to the consumer. Brucellosis in\nhumans (undulant fever, Malta fever) causes\nmalaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck\npain, low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain,\noccasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia,\nweight loss, abdominal pain, weakness,\nirritability, insomnia, and depression.\nBrucellosis has been called undulant fever\nbecause of its habit of producing fever and signs\nthat wax and wane over an extended period of time.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/Brucellosis_g.htm>\nand from\n<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/110502.htm&word=Brucellosis>.\n- Mod.TG]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis, caprine, human - Malaysia: (PG) RFI 20100725.2492\nBrucellosis, livestock, human - Kazakhstan: (AM) 20100707.2263\nBrucellosis, bovine - UK: (Northern Ireland) 20100613.1979\nBrucellosis, bovine - Canada (02): (BC), clarification 20100528.1781\nBrucellosis, bovine - Canada: (BC) 20100528.1769\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA (05): Yellowstone 20100427.1352\nBrucellosis, cervid - USA (04): Yellowstone 20100425.1340\nBrucellosis, ovine - Croatia: (SD) OIE 20100418.1258\n....................tg/ejp/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

His brucellosis was traced\nto him cleaning a feral hog in March 2009. He and his son butchered\none of the many feral hogs they had shot or trapped.\n\n\"People need to know that they should be cautious when they handle\nthose pigs, and always wear gloves,\" he said. \"I wouldn't want what's\nhappened to me to happen to anybody.\"\n\nThe man faces months of more treatment for the disease, which is\ncaused by a bacterium linked to feral hogs. An estimated 2 million of\nthe wild creatures roam Texas. The Houston Chronicle reported Thursday\n[17 Sep 2009] that about 10 percent of Texas feral hogs test positive\nfor brucellosis bacteria, but the rate in eastern parts of the state\nhas been known to be higher. The disease can cause pregnant animals to\nprematurely abort their young.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The CDC, earlier in 2009, reported on similar cases in the\nsoutheastern USA. As an occupation-related disease, brucellosis can\nresult from the organism from diseased animals entering through skin\nlesions or mucous membranes, or from the inhalation of contamination\ndust or aerosols.\n\nInhalation is involved with many cases associated with abattoir\nworkers (1). Contamination of skin lesions is also common in meat\npacking workers or veterinarians.

To simplify this process,\nreal-time polymerase chain reaction technology looking at single\nnucleotide polymorphism can be used (3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

A total\nof 50 cow elk tested positive for the brucellosis over January and February\n2009, including 5 that tested positive on Friday and were shipped to slaughter.\n\nIn 2 separate efforts in January and February 2009, state wildlife\nofficials trapped and processed 932 elk through the chutes at the 3\nfeed-grounds, including 421 adult females that were subject to brucellosis\ntesting. All 50 cow elk that tested positive for the disease were\ntransported to an eastern Idaho slaughterhouse for processing.\n\nThe brucellosis testing project is a recommendation of the Wyoming\nBrucellosis Coordination Team in an effort to reduce the brucellosis rate\nin the Pinedale elk herd.\n\nBrucellosis is a contagious disease that causes abortions in hoofed animals\nand is present in elk and bison in the Yellowstone region. Brucellosis\ntransmitted to cattle herds from elk caused Wyoming to lose its\nbrucellosis-free market status in 2004.\n\nWyoming later regained its brucellosis-free status in September 2006.\nHowever, cattle from a herd near Daniel were found to be positive for the\ndisease in June 2008. That cattle herd was sent to slaughter.\n\n[byline: Cat Urbigkit]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis has always been a problem in the Greater Yellowstone area. The\ntransmission between elk and cattle has always been an issue.

Strangely\nenough, interference with fertility caused by orchitis seems to be limited.\nInfected sheep and goats may excrete Brucella in the milk for years but\nsheep may also cease excretion during one or more lactation periods.\"\n(Alton, 1985; Stableforth and Galloway, 1959).\n\n--\nTom Kelly, MVB\nDonegal, Ireland\n<katjak@eirco,.net>\n\n[Tom Kelly's observation is appreciated; indeed, orchitis is a\nmanifestation of _B. melitensis_ infection in rams (and he-goats). It\nremains to be informed which \"strange behavior\" was seen in the sheep on\nthe affected farm and whether the 100-strong consignment of sheep,\nreportedly (illegally) transported from Volgograd to the Moscow region,\nconsisted of males.\n\nIn female sheep, reproductive signs, namely abortion (usually in late\npregnancy), weak newborns, stillbirth, or retained placentae are the main\n(and in most cases only) clinical expressions of _B. melitensis_ infection;\nacute mastitis with palpable nodules may also sometimes occur, with clotted\nand watery secretion. Cases may remain subclinical.\n\nIn rather exceptional cases, general signs (lameness or stiffness, limping)\nand respiratory signs (coughing) may be seen. - Mod.AS]\n\nFurther reading:\n1.

The\ngroup used Texas freedom-of-information requests to obtain documents\nabout the lab incidents.\nIn April 2007, the Sunshine Project reported that a Texas A&M\nresearcher had been infected with _Brucella_ after a February 2006\naerosol chamber mishap and that the school did not immediately notify\nthe CDC as required by federal law.\n[On 26 Jun 2007], the watchdog group reported that the exposure of 3\nother Texas A&M workers to _C. burnetii_, which causes Q fever, was\nconfirmed in April 2006 but also was not reported to the CDC.\nThe Sunshine Project said its investigation of Texas A&M came about\nthrough its review of select-agent labs that are vying to host the\nfederal government's planned new national biodefense facility,\naccording to a 27 Jun 2007 report in the Dallas Morning News.\nThe laboratory is affiliated with the Foreign Animal and Zoonotic\nDisease Defense Center, a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\ncenter of excellence that focuses on the study of foot-and-mouth\ndisease, avian influenza, and Rift Valley fever, according to the\ncenter's website. The center is funded by a USD 18 million DHS grant,\naccording to an Associated Press report.\nAccording to the Sunshine Project, Texas A&M notified the CDC about\nthe case of brucellosis in April 2007, a year after the worker's\nillness was confirmed. Shortly after Texas A&M report,\nrepresentatives from the CDC's Select Agents and Toxins Division\ninspected the laboratory and, in a 30 Jun 2007 memo, obtained and\nreleased by the Sunshine Project, ordered the lab to stop its work on\nall select agents and toxins until further notice.\nVon Roebuck, a CDC spokesman, told CIDRAP News that the agency has\nnever issued such a broad suspension order to a lab before. He said\nthe 30 Jun 2007 order applies to every agent the lab works with. The\nlist of affected agents is not public information because of security\nconcerns, Roebuck said. In the letter, the CDC outlined the concerns\nit has about the lab, which include the adequacy of biosafety plans,\nsecurity of the facility from unauthorized visitors, occupational\nsafety protocols, authorization from the CDC to work with certain\nagents, and compliance with federal select agent regulations.\nRoebuck said CDC officials would visit the Texas laboratory again in\nthe next few weeks to gather more information about its procedures\nand protocols. \"Then the agency will move forward with any\nrecommendations to get them under compliance,\" he said.\nIn a statement sent to Texas A&M faculty and staff on Fri 29 Jun\n2007, the school's interim president, Eddie J. Davis, said the\nlaboratory incidents did not pose a threat to anyone on or off\ncampus, but conceded that the university should have reported the\nworker's brucellosis in a more timely manner. (The university\nprovided CIDRAP News with a copy of the statement.)\nDavis said none of the workers who were exposed to the Q fever agent\ngot sick and that Texas A&M was going beyond health monitoring\nstandards at other select-agent labs by monitoring workers' blood for\nthe organism. He said the University believed that the threshold for\nreporting worker exposure was a confirmed illness.\n\"We are unequivocally committed to taking all appropriate steps to\nensure we are in full compliance with all CDC and any other relevant\npolicies and regulations,\" he said.\n_Coxiella burnetii_ causes an influenza-like disease in humans that\nis rarely fatal, according to the CDC. However, it is highly\ninfectious when it becomes airborne and is inhaled by humans. The\nagent has previously been weaponized and is considered a potential\nterrorist threat.\nBrucellosis presents prolonged fever and a wide range of other\npossible manifestations, such as arthritis, hepatitis, and\nmeningitis. Symptoms can be prolonged, but the disease is rarely\nfatal. In livestock, brucellosis causes infertility and abortions. As\nbioterrorism agents, _Brucella_ strains are inexpensive to produce\nand disperse, according to an August 2005 article in the CDC journal\nEmerging Infectious Diseases (EID).\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\n--\nContributed by:\nProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[Texas A&M (Agriculture and Mining) University is located in College\nStation, TX, which can be found near the state capital of Austin on a\nmap of the state at\n<http://biochemistry.tamu.edu/images/tour/txmap.gif>\nPress releases from the Sunshine Project regarding these episodes can\nbe found at\n<http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr120407.html> and\n<http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr260607.html>. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nQ fever - Australia (SA) 20070624.2038\n2006\n----\nQ fever - USA (IA, IL): RFI 20061130.3391\nBrucellosis, human - Kyrgyzstan (Osh) 20061120.3311\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Kyrgyzstan (02): background 20060924.2725\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Kyrgyzstan (Chuiskiy) 20060923.2715\nQ fever, meat processing plant - UK (Scotland) (02) 20060825.2394\nQ fever, meat processing plant - UK (Scotland) 20060721.2001\n2005\n----\nQ fever, calving - Australia (NSW) 20051103.3222\nQ fever, contaminated wool - Russia (Moscow) 20051025.3118\nBrucellosis, human - Czech Republic ex Turkey (02) 20051018.3039\nBrucellosis, human - Czech Republic ex Turkey 20051017.3030\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Venezuela 20051007.2932\nBrucellosis, human, caprine - Thailand (Kanchanaburi) 20050907.2646\nBrucellosis, human - Russia (Dagestan) 20050826.2523\nQ fever - Israel 20050814.2378\nQ fever - USA (CO) 20050810.2329\nBrucellosis, human - Kyrgyzstan (Jelalabad) 20050712.1975\nQ fever, human - USA (TX) 20050701.1861\nBrucellosis, human - Bosnia & Herzegovina 20050614.1658\nBrucellosis, human - Bulgaria ex Greece 20050328.0896\n2004\n----\nQ fever, farmers - Australia (S.

The\ngroup used Texas freedom-of-information requests to obtain documents\nabout the lab incidents.\nIn April 2007, the Sunshine Project reported that a Texas A&M\nresearcher had been infected with _Brucella_ after a February 2006\naerosol chamber mishap and that the school did not immediately notify\nthe CDC as required by federal law.\n[On 26 Jun 2007], the watchdog group reported that the exposure of 3\nother Texas A&M workers to _C. burnetii_, which causes Q fever, was\nconfirmed in April 2006 but also was not reported to the CDC.\nThe Sunshine Project said its investigation of Texas A&M came about\nthrough its review of select-agent labs that are vying to host the\nfederal government's planned new national biodefense facility,\naccording to a 27 Jun 2007 report in the Dallas Morning News.\nThe laboratory is affiliated with the Foreign Animal and Zoonotic\nDisease Defense Center, a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\ncenter of excellence that focuses on the study of foot-and-mouth\ndisease, avian influenza, and Rift Valley fever, according to the\ncenter's website. The center is funded by a USD 18 million DHS grant,\naccording to an Associated Press report.\nAccording to the Sunshine Project, Texas A&M notified the CDC about\nthe case of brucellosis in April 2007, a year after the worker's\nillness was confirmed. Shortly after Texas A&M report,\nrepresentatives from the CDC's Select Agents and Toxins Division\ninspected the laboratory and, in a 30 Jun 2007 memo, obtained and\nreleased by the Sunshine Project, ordered the lab to stop its work on\nall select agents and toxins until further notice.\nVon Roebuck, a CDC spokesman, told CIDRAP News that the agency has\nnever issued such a broad suspension order to a lab before. He said\nthe 30 Jun 2007 order applies to every agent the lab works with. The\nlist of affected agents is not public information because of security\nconcerns, Roebuck said. In the letter, the CDC outlined the concerns\nit has about the lab, which include the adequacy of biosafety plans,\nsecurity of the facility from unauthorized visitors, occupational\nsafety protocols, authorization from the CDC to work with certain\nagents, and compliance with federal select agent regulations.\nRoebuck said CDC officials would visit the Texas laboratory again in\nthe next few weeks to gather more information about its procedures\nand protocols. \"Then the agency will move forward with any\nrecommendations to get them under compliance,\" he said.\nIn a statement sent to Texas A&M faculty and staff on Fri 29 Jun\n2007, the school's interim president, Eddie J. Davis, said the\nlaboratory incidents did not pose a threat to anyone on or off\ncampus, but conceded that the university should have reported the\nworker's brucellosis in a more timely manner. (The university\nprovided CIDRAP News with a copy of the statement.)\nDavis said none of the workers who were exposed to the Q fever agent\ngot sick and that Texas A&M was going beyond health monitoring\nstandards at other select-agent labs by monitoring workers' blood for\nthe organism. He said the University believed that the threshold for\nreporting worker exposure was a confirmed illness.\n\"We are unequivocally committed to taking all appropriate steps to\nensure we are in full compliance with all CDC and any other relevant\npolicies and regulations,\" he said.\n_Coxiella burnetii_ causes an influenza-like disease in humans that\nis rarely fatal, according to the CDC. However, it is highly\ninfectious when it becomes airborne and is inhaled by humans. The\nagent has previously been weaponized and is considered a potential\nterrorist threat.\nBrucellosis presents prolonged fever and a wide range of other\npossible manifestations, such as arthritis, hepatitis, and\nmeningitis. Symptoms can be prolonged, but the disease is rarely\nfatal. In livestock, brucellosis causes infertility and abortions. As\nbioterrorism agents, _Brucella_ strains are inexpensive to produce\nand disperse, according to an August 2005 article in the CDC journal\nEmerging Infectious Diseases (EID).\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\n--\nContributed by:\nProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[Texas A&M (Agriculture and Mining) University is located in College\nStation, TX, which can be found near the state capital of Austin on a\nmap of the state at\n<http://biochemistry.tamu.edu/images/tour/txmap.gif>\nPress releases from the Sunshine Project regarding these episodes can\nbe found at\n<http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr120407.html> and\n<http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr260607.html>. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nQ fever - Australia (SA) 20070624.2038\n2006\n----\nQ fever - USA (IA, IL): RFI 20061130.3391\nBrucellosis, human - Kyrgyzstan (Osh) 20061120.3311\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Kyrgyzstan (02): background 20060924.2725\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Kyrgyzstan (Chuiskiy) 20060923.2715\nQ fever, meat processing plant - UK (Scotland) (02) 20060825.2394\nQ fever, meat processing plant - UK (Scotland) 20060721.2001\n2005\n----\nQ fever, calving - Australia (NSW) 20051103.3222\nQ fever, contaminated wool - Russia (Moscow) 20051025.3118\nBrucellosis, human - Czech Republic ex Turkey (02) 20051018.3039\nBrucellosis, human - Czech Republic ex Turkey 20051017.3030\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Venezuela 20051007.2932\nBrucellosis, human, caprine - Thailand (Kanchanaburi) 20050907.2646\nBrucellosis, human - Russia (Dagestan) 20050826.2523\nQ fever - Israel 20050814.2378\nQ fever - USA (CO) 20050810.2329\nBrucellosis, human - Kyrgyzstan (Jelalabad) 20050712.1975\nQ fever, human - USA (TX) 20050701.1861\nBrucellosis, human - Bosnia & Herzegovina 20050614.1658\nBrucellosis, human - Bulgaria ex Greece 20050328.0896\n2004\n----\nQ fever, farmers - Australia (S.

The\ngroup used Texas freedom-of-information requests to obtain documents\nabout the lab incidents.\nIn April 2007, the Sunshine Project reported that a Texas A&M\nresearcher had been infected with _Brucella_ after a February 2006\naerosol chamber mishap and that the school did not immediately notify\nthe CDC as required by federal law.\n[On 26 Jun 2007], the watchdog group reported that the exposure of 3\nother Texas A&M workers to _C. burnetii_, which causes Q fever, was\nconfirmed in April 2006 but also was not reported to the CDC.\nThe Sunshine Project said its investigation of Texas A&M came about\nthrough its review of select-agent labs that are vying to host the\nfederal government's planned new national biodefense facility,\naccording to a 27 Jun 2007 report in the Dallas Morning News.\nThe laboratory is affiliated with the Foreign Animal and Zoonotic\nDisease Defense Center, a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\ncenter of excellence that focuses on the study of foot-and-mouth\ndisease, avian influenza, and Rift Valley fever, according to the\ncenter's website. The center is funded by a USD 18 million DHS grant,\naccording to an Associated Press report.\nAccording to the Sunshine Project, Texas A&M notified the CDC about\nthe case of brucellosis in April 2007, a year after the worker's\nillness was confirmed. Shortly after Texas A&M report,\nrepresentatives from the CDC's Select Agents and Toxins Division\ninspected the laboratory and, in a 30 Jun 2007 memo, obtained and\nreleased by the Sunshine Project, ordered the lab to stop its work on\nall select agents and toxins until further notice.\nVon Roebuck, a CDC spokesman, told CIDRAP News that the agency has\nnever issued such a broad suspension order to a lab before. He said\nthe 30 Jun 2007 order applies to every agent the lab works with. The\nlist of affected agents is not public information because of security\nconcerns, Roebuck said. In the letter, the CDC outlined the concerns\nit has about the lab, which include the adequacy of biosafety plans,\nsecurity of the facility from unauthorized visitors, occupational\nsafety protocols, authorization from the CDC to work with certain\nagents, and compliance with federal select agent regulations.\nRoebuck said CDC officials would visit the Texas laboratory again in\nthe next few weeks to gather more information about its procedures\nand protocols. \"Then the agency will move forward with any\nrecommendations to get them under compliance,\" he said.\nIn a statement sent to Texas A&M faculty and staff on Fri 29 Jun\n2007, the school's interim president, Eddie J. Davis, said the\nlaboratory incidents did not pose a threat to anyone on or off\ncampus, but conceded that the university should have reported the\nworker's brucellosis in a more timely manner. (The university\nprovided CIDRAP News with a copy of the statement.)\nDavis said none of the workers who were exposed to the Q fever agent\ngot sick and that Texas A&M was going beyond health monitoring\nstandards at other select-agent labs by monitoring workers' blood for\nthe organism. He said the University believed that the threshold for\nreporting worker exposure was a confirmed illness.\n\"We are unequivocally committed to taking all appropriate steps to\nensure we are in full compliance with all CDC and any other relevant\npolicies and regulations,\" he said.\n_Coxiella burnetii_ causes an influenza-like disease in humans that\nis rarely fatal, according to the CDC. However, it is highly\ninfectious when it becomes airborne and is inhaled by humans. The\nagent has previously been weaponized and is considered a potential\nterrorist threat.\nBrucellosis presents prolonged fever and a wide range of other\npossible manifestations, such as arthritis, hepatitis, and\nmeningitis. Symptoms can be prolonged, but the disease is rarely\nfatal. In livestock, brucellosis causes infertility and abortions. As\nbioterrorism agents, _Brucella_ strains are inexpensive to produce\nand disperse, according to an August 2005 article in the CDC journal\nEmerging Infectious Diseases (EID).\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\n--\nContributed by:\nProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[Texas A&M (Agriculture and Mining) University is located in College\nStation, TX, which can be found near the state capital of Austin on a\nmap of the state at\n<http://biochemistry.tamu.edu/images/tour/txmap.gif>\nPress releases from the Sunshine Project regarding these episodes can\nbe found at\n<http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr120407.html> and\n<http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr260607.html>. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nQ fever - Australia (SA) 20070624.2038\n2006\n----\nQ fever - USA (IA, IL): RFI 20061130.3391\nBrucellosis, human - Kyrgyzstan (Osh) 20061120.3311\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Kyrgyzstan (02): background 20060924.2725\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Kyrgyzstan (Chuiskiy) 20060923.2715\nQ fever, meat processing plant - UK (Scotland) (02) 20060825.2394\nQ fever, meat processing plant - UK (Scotland) 20060721.2001\n2005\n----\nQ fever, calving - Australia (NSW) 20051103.3222\nQ fever, contaminated wool - Russia (Moscow) 20051025.3118\nBrucellosis, human - Czech Republic ex Turkey (02) 20051018.3039\nBrucellosis, human - Czech Republic ex Turkey 20051017.3030\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Venezuela 20051007.2932\nBrucellosis, human, caprine - Thailand (Kanchanaburi) 20050907.2646\nBrucellosis, human - Russia (Dagestan) 20050826.2523\nQ fever - Israel 20050814.2378\nQ fever - USA (CO) 20050810.2329\nBrucellosis, human - Kyrgyzstan (Jelalabad) 20050712.1975\nQ fever, human - USA (TX) 20050701.1861\nBrucellosis, human - Bosnia & Herzegovina 20050614.1658\nBrucellosis, human - Bulgaria ex Greece 20050328.0896\n2004\n----\nQ fever, farmers - Australia (S.

The\ngroup used Texas freedom-of-information requests to obtain documents\nabout the lab incidents.\nIn April 2007, the Sunshine Project reported that a Texas A&M\nresearcher had been infected with _Brucella_ after a February 2006\naerosol chamber mishap and that the school did not immediately notify\nthe CDC as required by federal law.\n[On 26 Jun 2007], the watchdog group reported that the exposure of 3\nother Texas A&M workers to _C. burnetii_, which causes Q fever, was\nconfirmed in April 2006 but also was not reported to the CDC.\nThe Sunshine Project said its investigation of Texas A&M came about\nthrough its review of select-agent labs that are vying to host the\nfederal government's planned new national biodefense facility,\naccording to a 27 Jun 2007 report in the Dallas Morning News.\nThe laboratory is affiliated with the Foreign Animal and Zoonotic\nDisease Defense Center, a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\ncenter of excellence that focuses on the study of foot-and-mouth\ndisease, avian influenza, and Rift Valley fever, according to the\ncenter's website. The center is funded by a USD 18 million DHS grant,\naccording to an Associated Press report.\nAccording to the Sunshine Project, Texas A&M notified the CDC about\nthe case of brucellosis in April 2007, a year after the worker's\nillness was confirmed. Shortly after Texas A&M report,\nrepresentatives from the CDC's Select Agents and Toxins Division\ninspected the laboratory and, in a 30 Jun 2007 memo, obtained and\nreleased by the Sunshine Project, ordered the lab to stop its work on\nall select agents and toxins until further notice.\nVon Roebuck, a CDC spokesman, told CIDRAP News that the agency has\nnever issued such a broad suspension order to a lab before. He said\nthe 30 Jun 2007 order applies to every agent the lab works with. The\nlist of affected agents is not public information because of security\nconcerns, Roebuck said. In the letter, the CDC outlined the concerns\nit has about the lab, which include the adequacy of biosafety plans,\nsecurity of the facility from unauthorized visitors, occupational\nsafety protocols, authorization from the CDC to work with certain\nagents, and compliance with federal select agent regulations.\nRoebuck said CDC officials would visit the Texas laboratory again in\nthe next few weeks to gather more information about its procedures\nand protocols. \"Then the agency will move forward with any\nrecommendations to get them under compliance,\" he said.\nIn a statement sent to Texas A&M faculty and staff on Fri 29 Jun\n2007, the school's interim president, Eddie J. Davis, said the\nlaboratory incidents did not pose a threat to anyone on or off\ncampus, but conceded that the university should have reported the\nworker's brucellosis in a more timely manner. (The university\nprovided CIDRAP News with a copy of the statement.)\nDavis said none of the workers who were exposed to the Q fever agent\ngot sick and that Texas A&M was going beyond health monitoring\nstandards at other select-agent labs by monitoring workers' blood for\nthe organism. He said the University believed that the threshold for\nreporting worker exposure was a confirmed illness.\n\"We are unequivocally committed to taking all appropriate steps to\nensure we are in full compliance with all CDC and any other relevant\npolicies and regulations,\" he said.\n_Coxiella burnetii_ causes an influenza-like disease in humans that\nis rarely fatal, according to the CDC. However, it is highly\ninfectious when it becomes airborne and is inhaled by humans. The\nagent has previously been weaponized and is considered a potential\nterrorist threat.\nBrucellosis presents prolonged fever and a wide range of other\npossible manifestations, such as arthritis, hepatitis, and\nmeningitis. Symptoms can be prolonged, but the disease is rarely\nfatal. In livestock, brucellosis causes infertility and abortions. As\nbioterrorism agents, _Brucella_ strains are inexpensive to produce\nand disperse, according to an August 2005 article in the CDC journal\nEmerging Infectious Diseases (EID).\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\n--\nContributed by:\nProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[Texas A&M (Agriculture and Mining) University is located in College\nStation, TX, which can be found near the state capital of Austin on a\nmap of the state at\n<http://biochemistry.tamu.edu/images/tour/txmap.gif>\nPress releases from the Sunshine Project regarding these episodes can\nbe found at\n<http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr120407.html> and\n<http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr260607.html>. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nQ fever - Australia (SA) 20070624.2038\n2006\n----\nQ fever - USA (IA, IL): RFI 20061130.3391\nBrucellosis, human - Kyrgyzstan (Osh) 20061120.3311\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Kyrgyzstan (02): background 20060924.2725\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Kyrgyzstan (Chuiskiy) 20060923.2715\nQ fever, meat processing plant - UK (Scotland) (02) 20060825.2394\nQ fever, meat processing plant - UK (Scotland) 20060721.2001\n2005\n----\nQ fever, calving - Australia (NSW) 20051103.3222\nQ fever, contaminated wool - Russia (Moscow) 20051025.3118\nBrucellosis, human - Czech Republic ex Turkey (02) 20051018.3039\nBrucellosis, human - Czech Republic ex Turkey 20051017.3030\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Venezuela 20051007.2932\nBrucellosis, human, caprine - Thailand (Kanchanaburi) 20050907.2646\nBrucellosis, human - Russia (Dagestan) 20050826.2523\nQ fever - Israel 20050814.2378\nQ fever - USA (CO) 20050810.2329\nBrucellosis, human - Kyrgyzstan (Jelalabad) 20050712.1975\nQ fever, human - USA (TX) 20050701.1861\nBrucellosis, human - Bosnia & Herzegovina 20050614.1658\nBrucellosis, human - Bulgaria ex Greece 20050328.0896\n2004\n----\nQ fever, farmers - Australia (S.

Shortly after Texas A&M report,\nrepresentatives from the CDC's Select Agents and Toxins Division\ninspected the laboratory and, in a 30 Jun 2007 memo, obtained and\nreleased by the Sunshine Project, ordered the lab to stop its work on\nall select agents and toxins until further notice.\nVon Roebuck, a CDC spokesman, told CIDRAP News that the agency has\nnever issued such a broad suspension order to a lab before. He said\nthe 30 Jun 2007 order applies to every agent the lab works with. The\nlist of affected agents is not public information because of security\nconcerns, Roebuck said. In the letter, the CDC outlined the concerns\nit has about the lab, which include the adequacy of biosafety plans,\nsecurity of the facility from unauthorized visitors, occupational\nsafety protocols, authorization from the CDC to work with certain\nagents, and compliance with federal select agent regulations.\nRoebuck said CDC officials would visit the Texas laboratory again in\nthe next few weeks to gather more information about its procedures\nand protocols. \"Then the agency will move forward with any\nrecommendations to get them under compliance,\" he said.\nIn a statement sent to Texas A&M faculty and staff on Fri 29 Jun\n2007, the school's interim president, Eddie J. Davis, said the\nlaboratory incidents did not pose a threat to anyone on or off\ncampus, but conceded that the university should have reported the\nworker's brucellosis in a more timely manner. (The university\nprovided CIDRAP News with a copy of the statement.)\nDavis said none of the workers who were exposed to the Q fever agent\ngot sick and that Texas A&M was going beyond health monitoring\nstandards at other select-agent labs by monitoring workers' blood for\nthe organism. He said the University believed that the threshold for\nreporting worker exposure was a confirmed illness.\n\"We are unequivocally committed to taking all appropriate steps to\nensure we are in full compliance with all CDC and any other relevant\npolicies and regulations,\" he said.\n_Coxiella burnetii_ causes an influenza-like disease in humans that\nis rarely fatal, according to the CDC. However, it is highly\ninfectious when it becomes airborne and is inhaled by humans. The\nagent has previously been weaponized and is considered a potential\nterrorist threat.\nBrucellosis presents prolonged fever and a wide range of other\npossible manifestations, such as arthritis, hepatitis, and\nmeningitis. Symptoms can be prolonged, but the disease is rarely\nfatal. In livestock, brucellosis causes infertility and abortions. As\nbioterrorism agents, _Brucella_ strains are inexpensive to produce\nand disperse, according to an August 2005 article in the CDC journal\nEmerging Infectious Diseases (EID).\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\n--\nContributed by:\nProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[Texas A&M (Agriculture and Mining) University is located in College\nStation, TX, which can be found near the state capital of Austin on a\nmap of the state at\n<http://biochemistry.tamu.edu/images/tour/txmap.gif>\nPress releases from the Sunshine Project regarding these episodes can\nbe found at\n<http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr120407.html> and\n<http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr260607.html>. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nQ fever - Australia (SA) 20070624.2038\n2006\n----\nQ fever - USA (IA, IL): RFI 20061130.3391\nBrucellosis, human - Kyrgyzstan (Osh) 20061120.3311\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Kyrgyzstan (02): background 20060924.2725\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Kyrgyzstan (Chuiskiy) 20060923.2715\nQ fever, meat processing plant - UK (Scotland) (02) 20060825.2394\nQ fever, meat processing plant - UK (Scotland) 20060721.2001\n2005\n----\nQ fever, calving - Australia (NSW) 20051103.3222\nQ fever, contaminated wool - Russia (Moscow) 20051025.3118\nBrucellosis, human - Czech Republic ex Turkey (02) 20051018.3039\nBrucellosis, human - Czech Republic ex Turkey 20051017.3030\nBrucellosis, human, bovine - Venezuela 20051007.2932\nBrucellosis, human, caprine - Thailand (Kanchanaburi) 20050907.2646\nBrucellosis, human - Russia (Dagestan) 20050826.2523\nQ fever - Israel 20050814.2378\nQ fever - USA (CO) 20050810.2329\nBrucellosis, human - Kyrgyzstan (Jelalabad) 20050712.1975\nQ fever, human - USA (TX) 20050701.1861\nBrucellosis, human - Bosnia & Herzegovina 20050614.1658\nBrucellosis, human - Bulgaria ex Greece 20050328.0896\n2004\n----\nQ fever, farmers - Australia (S.

These tests confirmed the animals are\ninfected with _Brucella abortus_ Biovar 1.\nThis herd of 39 cows, 2 bulls, and about 25 suckling calves has been\ndepopulated.\nThe cattle are run year around on the owner's deeded ground. The\nowner claims limited exposure to elk populations. The ranch is about\n1000 acres, of which about 800 acres may be pastured at various times\nof the year.\nNo females have been purchased for at least 10 years. The last bulls\nwere purchased in December 2003. There is no fence line contact with\nany other cattle.\nThis ranch is situated in an area through which numerous elk migrate\nin spring and fall. There are also elk that are winter residents in\nthis area. This ranch is also located near the Idaho Fish and Game\nRainey Creek feedground.\nThis feedground has been in existence since the late 70s to keep elk\nfrom depredating on haystacks and cattle feedlines.\nIDFG and ISDA has a trap, test and removal program on this feedground\nfor seropositive elk. The apparent seropositive rate on this\nfeedground has ranged from a high of 45 percent in 1999 to a low of 6\npercent in 2005.\nUp to 500 elk are fed at this site, depending on temperature, snow\ndepth and risk to cattle near the mouth of Rainey Creek Canyon.\nBrucellosis Biovar 1 and 4 have been isolated from elk on or from\nthis feedground when tested and removed at the trap in Rainey Creek.\nIt has been 3 years since the last case of brucellosis was identified\nin Idaho. Prior to the case in 2002, the most recent case in Idaho\nwas in 1989. Pending conclusion of the investigation into this most\nrecent case, Idaho may lose its Brucellosis Class Free status held\nsince 1991.\nThe ISDA and USDA are conducting an epidemiological investigation\nthat includes identification and testing of all herds that had\ncontact with the quarantined herd.\n--\nPhillip Mamer DVM\nWildlife Veterinarian\nIdaho Department of Fish and Game\nCaldwell Idaho\n<pmamer@idfg.idaho.gov>\nSee Also\n2005\n----\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (ID)(02): correction 20051229.3705, 20051229.3706\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (ID) 20051229.3702\n2004\n----\nBrucellosis, bovine - USA (WY) (02) 20040725.2035\nBrucellosis, bovine Panama 20040721.1976\nBrucellosis, human & caprines - Saudi Arabia (Jizan) 20040716.1926\nBrucellosis, humans & caprines - Lebanon 20040715.1907\nBrucellosis, bovine - UK (Cornwall) (02) 20040401.0891\nBrucellosis - Algeria (El-Aghuat) 20040401.0883\nBrucellosis, bison vaccination - USA (WY) 20040327.0847\n............tg/msp/lm\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

One has to\nre-emphasize that positive serological titers is either indicative of\na smooth _Brucella spp._ infection (one cannot make any inference as\nto whether _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_ or _B. suis_ is involved\nunless the most likely source of infection is identified) or/and _Y.\nenterocolitica_ O:9 infection.\nClinical symptoms help in classifying the case as probable or\nconfirmed brucellosis, according to the CDC case definition. In this\nparticular case, given the patient was in Turkey (where _B.\nmelitensis_ is enzootic in sheep) and given the fact that sheep\ncheese has been consumed, one can reasonably assume that _B.\nmelitensis_ is involved, not _B. abortus_. _B. abortus_ is seldom\nreported to infect sheep, but _B. melitensis_ is reported to\nregularly infect cattle in the Mediterranean basin (1).\nOne can argue that _B. abortus_ infects cattle in Turkey. Human\nbrucellosis cases reported in that country have predominantly been\nattributed to _B. melitensis_\n2) _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 serology\n----------------------------------\nSerological cross-reactivity after Smooth _Brucella spp_ (not just\n_B. abortus_) and _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 infection both in animals\nand humans has been well documented. This is why the antibody test\nfor _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 is likely to be a cross-reaction, unless\nthe diagnosis of the extraintestinal form of yersiniosis can be\nfurther substantiated.\n3) In the veterinary field\n-------------------------\nBrucellosis control or eradication programs are implemented\nworldwide, mainly for cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. In this\ncontext, the objective is not primarily to diagnose _Y.\nenterocolitica_ O:9 infections, but to exclude brucellosis. In other\nwords, the _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 status will not tell anything\nabout the brucellosis status. In this context, serology seems so far\nunable to differentiate beyond certain smooth _Brucella spp_\ninfection and _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 infection. This is why\nmeasurement of the cell-mediated immunity via the brucellosis skin\ntest is the only means by which one can beyond any reasonable doubt\ndifferentiate smooth _Brucella spp_ infection and _Y. enterocolitica_\nO:9 infection (2).\nMay I take this opportunity to thank for you for the invaluable\nsource of information ProMED is, particularly for those living and\nworking somewhere \"at the end of the world.\"\n1.

One has to\nre-emphasize that positive serological titers is either indicative of\na smooth _Brucella spp._ infection (one cannot make any inference as\nto whether _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_ or _B. suis_ is involved\nunless the most likely source of infection is identified) or/and _Y.\nenterocolitica_ O:9 infection.\nClinical symptoms help in classifying the case as probable or\nconfirmed brucellosis, according to the CDC case definition. In this\nparticular case, given the patient was in Turkey (where _B.\nmelitensis_ is enzootic in sheep) and given the fact that sheep\ncheese has been consumed, one can reasonably assume that _B.\nmelitensis_ is involved, not _B. abortus_. _B. abortus_ is seldom\nreported to infect sheep, but _B. melitensis_ is reported to\nregularly infect cattle in the Mediterranean basin (1).\nOne can argue that _B. abortus_ infects cattle in Turkey. Human\nbrucellosis cases reported in that country have predominantly been\nattributed to _B. melitensis_\n2) _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 serology\n----------------------------------\nSerological cross-reactivity after Smooth _Brucella spp_ (not just\n_B. abortus_) and _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 infection both in animals\nand humans has been well documented. This is why the antibody test\nfor _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 is likely to be a cross-reaction, unless\nthe diagnosis of the extraintestinal form of yersiniosis can be\nfurther substantiated.\n3) In the veterinary field\n-------------------------\nBrucellosis control or eradication programs are implemented\nworldwide, mainly for cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. In this\ncontext, the objective is not primarily to diagnose _Y.\nenterocolitica_ O:9 infections, but to exclude brucellosis. In other\nwords, the _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 status will not tell anything\nabout the brucellosis status. In this context, serology seems so far\nunable to differentiate beyond certain smooth _Brucella spp_\ninfection and _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 infection. This is why\nmeasurement of the cell-mediated immunity via the brucellosis skin\ntest is the only means by which one can beyond any reasonable doubt\ndifferentiate smooth _Brucella spp_ infection and _Y. enterocolitica_\nO:9 infection (2).\nMay I take this opportunity to thank for you for the invaluable\nsource of information ProMED is, particularly for those living and\nworking somewhere \"at the end of the world.\"\n1.

The patient was a 34-year-old\nhousewife, who suffered from recurrent headache and fever since mid Sep\n2004. She was admitted to a hospital on 7 Oct 2004 because of pyrexia of\nunknown origin without other focal symptoms or signs. Blood tests were\ngrossly normal except for liver derangement (ALT 280). Blood culture\nyielded slow-growing Gram-negative coccobacilli, which was later identified\nas _Brucella_ species in PHLSB, with species identification result\npending. The patient recalled a history of handling and consuming sheep\nplacenta outside Hong Kong. She was discharged on 26 Oct 2004 and put on\nantimicrobial therapy including doxycycline and rifamipicin.

The reason for that is their fear that their animals will be\ndestroyed by the Veterinary Services. During 2003, there was an outbreak in\nthe northern area, which was more heavily infected than the south.\n---\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[_Brucella melitensis_ is endemic throughout all countries in the\nMediterranean basin; Algeria is known to be one of the most severely\naffected countries. During 2002, 452 outbreaks (in animals, mostly goats)\nhave been reported. Tourists to this part of the world should be aware of\nthe risks associated with the consumption of (unpasteurized) dairy\nproducts. -Mod.AS]\n[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B\nbiowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after\noccupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food\nproducts. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the United\nStates and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination\nprograms, this condition remains a significant health problem in many\ndeveloping countries.\nEach species of Brucella has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic\ndisease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs\nof the animals, causing sterility and abortions, and are shed in large\nnumbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid.\nThis localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians,\nslaughterhouse workers, and consumers.\nAmong the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _Brucella melitensis_\n(from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most\nsevere and acute cases of brucellosis with disabling complications. A\nprolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative\ndestructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or\ncommercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo,\nand camels) is associated with mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is\nrarely associated with complications. _B. canis_ has a disease course that\nis indistinguishable from _B. abortus_ infection.- Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBrucellosis, human, livestock - Russia (Moscow) 20040102.0008\n2003\n----\nBrucellosis - Thailand (Ratchaburi)20030910.2280\nBrucellosis, human - Mexico: Background 20030808.1953\n2002\n----\nBrucellosis, human - New Zealand (02)20020329.3838\nBrucellosis, human - New Zealand 20020316.3756\n2001\n----\nBrucellosis, human, livestock - Kazakhstan (North) 20010603.1093\n1999\n----\nBrucellosis - Russia (Chechnya): alert 19991108.1999\nBrucellosis, human - Kazakhstan (Kzyl-Orda) 19990817.1421\n1997\n----\nBrucellosis, hunters (deer urine source?) - USA 19970802.1603\n.....................................jw/arn/ll/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Blood cultures\nperformed by Counties Manukau District Health Board and reviewed by the\nInstitute of Environmental Science and Research confirmed the infection, and\nbiochemical profiling by MAF National Centre for Disease Investigation\nsuggests the isolate is _Brucella suis_. The isolate has been sent to\nVeterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA), Weybridge UK, for typing. VLA report it\nis likely to be _Brucella suis_ biovar 3 (confirmation pending).\nCounties Manukau District Health Board clinicians and Auckland Regional\nPublic Health Service believe on clinical and epidemiological grounds that\nthe case most likely acquired the infection in December 2001 in New Zealand.\nAt that time the case purchased 2 pigs that were killed and butchered in a\nhome-kill situation for consumption at 2 family feasts. The case had not\ntravelled outside New Zealand for 10 years.

As a westerner\nhaving grown up in Oklahoma with open ranges and a firm belief in \"western\"\nphilosophies, I have a great affinity for ranchers, as a group. As you\nsay, though, ranchers have a disproportionate share of the political power\nin many places.\nI spent considerable time last summer slightly outside the duties for which\nI was hired. One of the issues I followed closely was the bison management\nplan for the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) area, which had just been\npublished in late summer [97? . I had several discussions with the GRTE\nChief of Resource Management about the issue. Many of the issues affecting\nthe Yellowstone herds generally do not affect the GRTE herd of bison,\nexcept in a broader concept. Some of the \"scientific\" principles invoked\nby the GYE bison management plan could hardly be called \"good science\",\neven in the US EPA vernacular.\nOne of the problems I had noted in managing the bison involved the\nassumption that the Yellowstone herd was a threat to Montana's\ncertification under USDA as a brucellosis-free area. Unlike most\nAmericans, I have seen the effects of brucellosis in animals and undulant\nfever as it known in both animals and people. I have great respect for the\nability of communicable diseases to create terror in local populations.\nThere is no reason to think most citizens of Montana have the same frame of\nreference. Upon checking into the facts of brucellosis transmission from\nbison to cattle, I learned several things which create some real\nepidemiological questions in my mind.\nIn recent years, it seems, one of the Yellowstone bison was captured\n(perhaps in Montana during a previous winter) and kept confined in a small\nstall. I am not certain of the disposition of the bison, however, according\nto the story, the stall was later used to contain a cow (non-bison). That\ncow later was diagnosed with brucellosis. Therefore, as illogic would\nfollow, the bison transmitted the brucellosis to the cow. Apparently, this\nwas the only such occurrence.\nThere is an immunization for cattle against brucellosis, but it is\napparently not totally useful. It is, as is true of most immunizations, not\n100% effective. Efficacy varies with the sex, age, and other factors of the\ncow.\nThe blood test being used to test Yellowstone bison for brucellosis when\nthey range into Montana was developed to check titer counts in cattle. It\nhas not been proven effective for determining the communicability of bison.\n\nIt has not been proven that the serotype of brucellosis in bison is the\nsame as the serotype which causes symptoms in cattle.\nThe bison management plane offered by the GYE Coalition listed several\n(perhaps 8, if I recall) options for actions to be taken. Of course, the\nrequisite option of doing nothing at all was listed, but never seriously\nconsidered, in my opinion. I remember one option which instantly came to my\nmind, but it was too politically-loaded for the GYE Coalition to even list\nas a potential consideration.\nI order to lure tourist dollars to the Yellowstone area during the winter\nmonths, the roads to the towns of Gardiner and West Yellowstone, MT\n[Montana, are packed each winter to allow snowmobile access through deep\nsnows. As you know, without snowmobiles, most tourists would go elsewhere\nwhere there was a little less \"real\" nature to challenge them. When the\nsnows in Yellowstone NP [National Park are deep, the bison naturally start\nusing the packed roadways to ease their travel. Some portions of the park's\nherds stay near the warmer geyser areas and never think to travel outside\nthe park. Other portions of the herds, notable those living in the north\nand northeast areas, find the packed roadways too hard to resist. Over the\ncourse of time, those herds have developed a tradition of traveling the\nroads in winter.\nThe one option not considered is to stop packing the roadways during the\nwinter. Of course, the tourist supply will dry up, and the economies in the\nboundary areas will need to shift to another source of income. To the south\nof Yellowstone, in Rockefeller Memorial Parkway and GRTE, the roadways are\noften allowed to become snowed in. Snowmobiles are allowed along certain\npathways, but the distances involved are usually in excess of what the\nJackson Hole [town in Wyoming tourists are willing to endure. Gardiner and\nWest Yellowstone access points are much closer for the casual tourist.\nAnother point of contention is that the bison management plan does not\nconsider the impact of elk on the spread of brucellosis. The elk may have a\nhigher infectivity rate than the bison in the GYE area. And they may be\nmore likely to spread the disease to cattle. Elk are often infected by the\nhabit of ingesting the afterbirths of their young.\nHowever, would the political battle be too large to handle if Montana\nconsidered that it should, to protect their brucellosis-free status, start\nshooting all the elk, as well as the bison? I believe, if that were the\ncase, there would be a much larger coalition opposed to the deliberate\nkilling of bison and elk. I do not pretend to know the answers nor do I\nhave the ability to predict the political will of the country in preventing\nthe deaths of the bison. I am of the opinion that Science has not yet\nentered into the picture with any clarity. I hope it doesn't arrive too late.\n--\nJim Moore\ne-mail: galileo2@earthlink.net\n[There is an unknown factor not addressed by Mr. Moore. Did the cow, housed\nin the same stall as the previous bison occupant, already have brucellosis?\nWas she tested negative prior to her housing in the stall? There are many\npolitical issues at stake in the brucellosis triangle between bison,\ncattle, and elk. It would be nice to have some real science to support the\nissues at hand. - Mod.TG\n..................................tg/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

This is the first\ntime we face this problem.\nThis is a community of 17 families (approximately 40 adults and 50\nchildren) that live in a condominium in northern Santiago, Chile. A month\nago, 2 dogs in one household became sick and [were] taken to the\nveterinarian. After a few lab tests and physical examination they\ndiagnosed brucellosis, as serological tests for _Brucella canis_ were\npositive. The veterinary recommendation, which actually was followed, was\nto sacrifice the dogs.\nFurther testing of 16 dogs living in the community showed 10 of them\npositive for _Brucella canis_. There have been no cases of adults or\nchildren presenting with symptoms that could suggest brucellosis; however\nthere is a big concern among families about children contracting the\ndisease considering the close contact they usually have with them.\nWe would appreciate input on how to manage this problem, estimation of risk\nfor humans, need of serological testing for humans contacts, advice on what\nto do (treatment, evaluation, follow up) with serologically positive but\nasymptomatic dogs and recommendations for further investigation of the\noutbreak.\n[It is very important to distinguish the genus and species causing human\nbrucellosis to evaluate the risk. Human infections due to _Brucella\nabortus_, _B. melitensis_ or _B. suis_ (originating with farm animals) can\nbe severe and require strict measures for control. Although I must admit I\nam not up to date on this subject, some time ago cases of _B. canis_ in\nhumans were rare, only 15 cases (8 of them originating in the laboratory)\nbetween discovery of the organism in 1966 and 1979, when LE Carmichael\nwrote his section in Jim Steele's CRC Handbook of the Zoonoses. More\nimportantly _B. canis_ caused a mild human disease which is easily\ntreatable with tetracycline. The disease was originally reported in kennel\ndogs and control consisted of removing infected animals from the kennel.\nInfected individuals can be identified with serological and bacteriological\ntests. More definitive comments from anyone who has substantial experience\nin such situations would be appreciated.\nIt appears that the condominium dog population may be large enough to\nsupport ongoing transmission. I wonder if the condominium housing pattern\nallowed a large enough population of dogs to live in close proximity and\ntherefore provide _B. canis_ with a new environment to exploit. - Mod.PC]\n--\nPablo Agustin Vial\nAssociate Professor\nUniversidad Catolica de Chile School of Medicine\nand Center for Medical Research.\n......................................pc/es\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
