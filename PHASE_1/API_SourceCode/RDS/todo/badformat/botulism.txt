A 28-year-old male from Eddy County is hospitalized with wound botulism. The suspected source of infection is contaminated black tar heroin, and the nerve toxin that causes botulism was identified from a patient specimen. Another 29-year-old male from Eddy County with a history of injection drug use is hospitalized with suspected wound botulism.\n\nBotulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin that is produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Wound botulism is caused by a toxin produced in a wound infected with the same bacterium. Injecting heroin under the skin where there is little or no oxygen available allows the organism to grow and produce a deadly toxin that leads to progressive descending muscle paralysis and sometimes death. \"Healthcare providers need to consider wound botulism in patients who are showing symptoms, especially if they have a history of injection drug use,\" said DOH Secretary-Designate Dr. Tracie Collins. \"People who inject drugs should be aware of wound botulism and seek immediate medical attention if they are experiencing any signs or symptoms of the disease.\"\n\nSigns and symptoms of botulism include:\n- double vision\n- blurred vision\n- drooping eyelids\n- slurred speech\n- difficulty swallowing\n- dry mouth\n- muscle weakness/descending paralysis\n- difficulty breathing/shortness of breath\n\nIf left untreated, initial symptoms may progress to include paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs, and trunk with subsequent death.\n\nNMDOH encourages New Mexicans to:\n- report suspected cases of wound botulism to NMDOH 24/7/365 at (505) 827-0006. If the patient is hospitalized in New Mexico so that antitoxin can be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention if indicated\n- warn persons who inject drugs about wound botulism and inform them of the signs and symptoms and the need to seek medical care immediately\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[Most drug-related cases of wound botulism are related to black tar heroin, which is injected subcutaneously instead of intravenously.\n\nBlack tar heroin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin) is heroin acetate. \"Other forms of heroin require additional steps of purification post acetylation. With black tar, the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency, however, is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in \"homebake heroin\" in Australia and New Zealand, the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass. Black tar as a type holds a variable admixture of morphine derivatives, predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid.\"\n\n\"Black tar heroin is often produced in Latin America and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose.\n\n\"People who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis than those who inject powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden, which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible. Researchers at University of California at San Francisco have found that the rapidity with which black tar heroin destroys veins, along with its gummier consistency, may put people who inject it at a lower risk of HIV infection because they may be forced to inject subcutaneously (rather than into veins), and needles must be thoroughly rinsed free of 'black tar' between injections if new sterilized ones are not available.\n\n\"The presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di-acetyl morphine, potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine. At least one study has drawn attention to lower rates of HIV infection among drug injectors in which black tar heroin is the major form of street-available heroin, suggesting that this may be due to the need to heat black tar heroin to dissolve it (which also inactivates any HIV present in the solution).\n\n\"However, black tar heroin injectors can be at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections, in particular necrotizing soft tissue infection. The practice of 'skin-popping,' or subcutaneous injection, predisposes to necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis from _Clostridium perfringens_, while deep intramuscular injection predisposes to necrotizing myositis.

A 28-year-old male from Eddy County is hospitalized with wound botulism. The suspected source of infection is contaminated black tar heroin, and the nerve toxin that causes botulism was identified from a patient specimen. Another 29-year-old male from Eddy County with a history of injection drug use is hospitalized with suspected wound botulism.\n\nBotulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin that is produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Wound botulism is caused by a toxin produced in a wound infected with the same bacterium. Injecting heroin under the skin where there is little or no oxygen available allows the organism to grow and produce a deadly toxin that leads to progressive descending muscle paralysis and sometimes death. \"Healthcare providers need to consider wound botulism in patients who are showing symptoms, especially if they have a history of injection drug use,\" said DOH Secretary-Designate Dr. Tracie Collins. \"People who inject drugs should be aware of wound botulism and seek immediate medical attention if they are experiencing any signs or symptoms of the disease.\"\n\nSigns and symptoms of botulism include:\n- double vision\n- blurred vision\n- drooping eyelids\n- slurred speech\n- difficulty swallowing\n- dry mouth\n- muscle weakness/descending paralysis\n- difficulty breathing/shortness of breath\n\nIf left untreated, initial symptoms may progress to include paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs, and trunk with subsequent death.\n\nNMDOH encourages New Mexicans to:\n- report suspected cases of wound botulism to NMDOH 24/7/365 at (505) 827-0006.

With black tar, the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency, however, is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in \"homebake heroin\" in Australia and New Zealand, the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass. Black tar as a type holds a variable admixture of morphine derivatives, predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid.\"\n\n\"Black tar heroin is often produced in Latin America and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose.\n\n\"People who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis than those who inject powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden, which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible. Researchers at University of California at San Francisco have found that the rapidity with which black tar heroin destroys veins, along with its gummier consistency, may put people who inject it at a lower risk of HIV infection because they may be forced to inject subcutaneously (rather than into veins), and needles must be thoroughly rinsed free of 'black tar' between injections if new sterilized ones are not available.\n\n\"The presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di-acetyl morphine, potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine.

Its wings often go next. Finally, its neck goes limp and it drowns.\n\nThis is the sad scene that Caroline Brady, a biologist with the California Waterfowl Association, has observed often this summer [2020]. As wildfires burn across the state, temperatures hit record highs, and communities cope with the COVID-19 crisis, she is helping respond to a different disaster: the worst avian botulism outbreak that anyone can remember at the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex.\n\nThere, thousands of acres of wetland and marsh that should be rich and verdant havens for millions of migrating waterfowl and shorebirds have become a wasteland of dried-up mud ponds strewn with dead ducks, geese, and other victims of avian botulism. Caused by toxin-producing bacteria, the disease -- which is different from the botulism that can infect canned foods -- tends to affect wetlands lacking flowing water that is cool, clean, and aerated. Thanks to drought and limited water deliveries, that's exactly what's missing this summer from much of the refuge.\n\nTo make a bad situation worse, a wildfire storm stalled the botulism response effort. Because firefighting helicopters were scooping water from the refuge to dump on the nearby Caldwell fire, refuge staff were barred from entering even as the disease began to spread. \"The disease outbreak had 2 weeks to fester before anyone was allowed to go in at all,\" Brady explains.\n\nAvian botulism is a regular problem of the Klamath system, which comprises 6 refuges managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. A local wildlife care center handled 494 sick birds in 2018 and 233 last year [2019], according to January Bill, founder of the organization Bird Ally X, which runs the refuge's so-called \"Duck Hospital.\" But this summer, between mid-July and early September [2020], her facility had received more than 2750 birds of several dozen species, including mallard, green-winged teal, gadwall, northern pintail, and northern shoveler. \"So, this year is out of control,\" she says.\n\nBill and her team, working in the makeshift field hospital of PVC-framed tents and shallow swimming pools for the birds, have successfully rehabilitated at least 90 percent of their patients and returned them to the wild in botulism-free parts of the refuge. However, the death toll of both waterfowl and shorebirds that don't make it to the facility is soaring off the charts. Field surveyors have collected about 20 000 dead birds, and they guess at least twice that many have perished.\n\n\"Back in the tule reeds, there are sometimes 10 dead birds all on top of each other,\" says Brady, who has personally collected several thousand birds since July [2020]. Removing the carcasses is important; if left in place, they quickly produce fly larvae which carry the disease and can spread it to other birds that eat the small worms. The disease thrives in warm temperatures, and refuge managers don't expect it to disappear until autumn brings subfreezing nighttime lows.\n\nThe disaster comes after a dry spring and summer and highlights challenges in sustainably and equitably using the Klamath River's water. Fish, birds, and other wildlife depend on the resource. So do thousands of local farmers, who grow crops like potatoes, horseradish, hay, and barley.\n\nTo provide water for these users, the US Bureau of Reclamation releases flows from southern Oregon's Upper Klamath Lake, a natural waterway that serves as the basin's major holding pond. The agency also must retain enough water in the lake to support 2 species of endangered suckers. This arrangement, Bureau critics argue, hasn't helped the fish much, and it has many stakeholders feeling shortchanged. In the lower reaches of the watershed, salmon runs have dwindled in part for lack of water, creating dissent among tribal communities and fishing interests. Farmers often want more water, too. In late spring [2020], Klamath Basin growers staged a protest of the Bureau's plans, announced in April, to reduce agricultural allocations.\n\nBut, as in many river basins in the arid West, the Klamath's water has been overallocated to users, leaving insufficient flows for the basin's aquatic ecosystems. Climate change, which is worsening drought conditions and diminishing the mountain snowpack that feeds the Klamath's tributaries, is likely to aggravate the situation.\n\nAmid these challenges, birds are also having a tough time. The Klamath's water allocation system places the basin's refuges last in line to receive flows, which can magnify impacts in dry years like 2020. This summer, the shrinkage of the refuge's wetlands has forced flocks of passing birds to aggregate tightly in warm stagnant water --perfect conditions for a botulism outbreak.\n\nTo try and stave off disaster, the Bureau of Reclamation in August [2020] released an emergency delivery of 4000 acre-feet of water, following a 4600-acre-foot release in July [2020], according to Mary Lee Knecht, a public affairs officer with the agency. It wasn't enough, though, and as the crisis escalated in early September, the Bureau announced it would release another shot of 5400 acre-feet water for the refuge. Altogether, the releases were but a trifle in the grand scheme of Klamath's water equation. Farmers, for instance, are receiving 147 000 acre-feet this year [2020].\n\nAt the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Greg Austin, the manager of the Klamath Basin refuge complex, said in an email that he and his agency \"appreciate every drop of water that [the Bureau of] Reclamation can make available.\" The water, he explains, will help keep portions of the refuge wet for a few more weeks as they wait for freezing temperatures to halt the disease's life cycle.\n\nMeghan Hertel, Audubon California's director of land and water conservation, visited the plague-stricken refuge in late August [2020] when daytime temperatures peaked around 100 deg F [37.8 deg C]. \"It was almost totally dry out there,\" she says. \"There were a few waterholes crammed with birds.\"\n\nHertel and colleagues have been advocating for allowing more water onto important bird refuges for years, both here in the Klamath system and farther south, in the San Joaquin Valley, where refuges are chronically shortchanged the water they're supposed to receive. As droughts, heat waves, and a growing human population add extra strain to water-dependent ecosystems like the Klamath Basin's wetlands, Hertel worries that, unless water allocation policies change, crises like the one now affecting the Klamath refuge will recur with greater frequency and intensity.\n\n\"This die-off should be a wakeup call for all the local stakeholders to sit down and think about how we can get more water out to the refuges,\" she says. \"Putting water out on this landscape is not wasting water.\"\n\n[Byline: Alastair Bland]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_.

Its wings often go next. Finally, its neck goes limp and it drowns.\n\nThis is the sad scene that Caroline Brady, a biologist with the California Waterfowl Association, has observed often this summer [2020]. As wildfires burn across the state, temperatures hit record highs, and communities cope with the COVID-19 crisis, she is helping respond to a different disaster: the worst avian botulism outbreak that anyone can remember at the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex.\n\nThere, thousands of acres of wetland and marsh that should be rich and verdant havens for millions of migrating waterfowl and shorebirds have become a wasteland of dried-up mud ponds strewn with dead ducks, geese, and other victims of avian botulism. Caused by toxin-producing bacteria, the disease -- which is different from the botulism that can infect canned foods -- tends to affect wetlands lacking flowing water that is cool, clean, and aerated. Thanks to drought and limited water deliveries, that's exactly what's missing this summer from much of the refuge.\n\nTo make a bad situation worse, a wildfire storm stalled the botulism response effort. Because firefighting helicopters were scooping water from the refuge to dump on the nearby Caldwell fire, refuge staff were barred from entering even as the disease began to spread. \"The disease outbreak had 2 weeks to fester before anyone was allowed to go in at all,\" Brady explains.\n\nAvian botulism is a regular problem of the Klamath system, which comprises 6 refuges managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. A local wildlife care center handled 494 sick birds in 2018 and 233 last year [2019], according to January Bill, founder of the organization Bird Ally X, which runs the refuge's so-called \"Duck Hospital.\" But this summer, between mid-July and early September [2020], her facility had received more than 2750 birds of several dozen species, including mallard, green-winged teal, gadwall, northern pintail, and northern shoveler. \"So, this year is out of control,\" she says.\n\nBill and her team, working in the makeshift field hospital of PVC-framed tents and shallow swimming pools for the birds, have successfully rehabilitated at least 90 percent of their patients and returned them to the wild in botulism-free parts of the refuge. However, the death toll of both waterfowl and shorebirds that don't make it to the facility is soaring off the charts. Field surveyors have collected about 20 000 dead birds, and they guess at least twice that many have perished.\n\n\"Back in the tule reeds, there are sometimes 10 dead birds all on top of each other,\" says Brady, who has personally collected several thousand birds since July [2020]. Removing the carcasses is important; if left in place, they quickly produce fly larvae which carry the disease and can spread it to other birds that eat the small worms.

The disease thrives in warm temperatures, and refuge managers don't expect it to disappear until autumn brings subfreezing nighttime lows.\n\nThe disaster comes after a dry spring and summer and highlights challenges in sustainably and equitably using the Klamath River's water. Fish, birds, and other wildlife depend on the resource. So do thousands of local farmers, who grow crops like potatoes, horseradish, hay, and barley.\n\nTo provide water for these users, the US Bureau of Reclamation releases flows from southern Oregon's Upper Klamath Lake, a natural waterway that serves as the basin's major holding pond. The agency also must retain enough water in the lake to support 2 species of endangered suckers. This arrangement, Bureau critics argue, hasn't helped the fish much, and it has many stakeholders feeling shortchanged. In the lower reaches of the watershed, salmon runs have dwindled in part for lack of water, creating dissent among tribal communities and fishing interests. Farmers often want more water, too. In late spring [2020], Klamath Basin growers staged a protest of the Bureau's plans, announced in April, to reduce agricultural allocations.\n\nBut, as in many river basins in the arid West, the Klamath's water has been overallocated to users, leaving insufficient flows for the basin's aquatic ecosystems. Climate change, which is worsening drought conditions and diminishing the mountain snowpack that feeds the Klamath's tributaries, is likely to aggravate the situation.\n\nAmid these challenges, birds are also having a tough time. The Klamath's water allocation system places the basin's refuges last in line to receive flows, which can magnify impacts in dry years like 2020. This summer, the shrinkage of the refuge's wetlands has forced flocks of passing birds to aggregate tightly in warm stagnant water --perfect conditions for a botulism outbreak.\n\nTo try and stave off disaster, the Bureau of Reclamation in August [2020] released an emergency delivery of 4000 acre-feet of water, following a 4600-acre-foot release in July [2020], according to Mary Lee Knecht, a public affairs officer with the agency. It wasn't enough, though, and as the crisis escalated in early September, the Bureau announced it would release another shot of 5400 acre-feet water for the refuge. Altogether, the releases were but a trifle in the grand scheme of Klamath's water equation. Farmers, for instance, are receiving 147 000 acre-feet this year [2020].\n\nAt the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Greg Austin, the manager of the Klamath Basin refuge complex, said in an email that he and his agency \"appreciate every drop of water that [the Bureau of] Reclamation can make available.\" The water, he explains, will help keep portions of the refuge wet for a few more weeks as they wait for freezing temperatures to halt the disease's life cycle.\n\nMeghan Hertel, Audubon California's director of land and water conservation, visited the plague-stricken refuge in late August [2020] when daytime temperatures peaked around 100 deg F [37.8 deg C]. \"It was almost totally dry out there,\" she says. \"There were a few waterholes crammed with birds.\"\n\nHertel and colleagues have been advocating for allowing more water onto important bird refuges for years, both here in the Klamath system and farther south, in the San Joaquin Valley, where refuges are chronically shortchanged the water they're supposed to receive. As droughts, heat waves, and a growing human population add extra strain to water-dependent ecosystems like the Klamath Basin's wetlands, Hertel worries that, unless water allocation policies change, crises like the one now affecting the Klamath refuge will recur with greater frequency and intensity.\n\n\"This die-off should be a wakeup call for all the local stakeholders to sit down and think about how we can get more water out to the refuges,\" she says. \"Putting water out on this landscape is not wasting water.\"\n\n[Byline: Alastair Bland]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_.

Its wings often go next. Finally, its neck goes limp and it drowns.\n\nThis is the sad scene that Caroline Brady, a biologist with the California Waterfowl Association, has observed often this summer [2020]. As wildfires burn across the state, temperatures hit record highs, and communities cope with the COVID-19 crisis, she is helping respond to a different disaster: the worst avian botulism outbreak that anyone can remember at the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex.\n\nThere, thousands of acres of wetland and marsh that should be rich and verdant havens for millions of migrating waterfowl and shorebirds have become a wasteland of dried-up mud ponds strewn with dead ducks, geese, and other victims of avian botulism. Caused by toxin-producing bacteria, the disease -- which is different from the botulism that can infect canned foods -- tends to affect wetlands lacking flowing water that is cool, clean, and aerated. Thanks to drought and limited water deliveries, that's exactly what's missing this summer from much of the refuge.\n\nTo make a bad situation worse, a wildfire storm stalled the botulism response effort. Because firefighting helicopters were scooping water from the refuge to dump on the nearby Caldwell fire, refuge staff were barred from entering even as the disease began to spread. \"The disease outbreak had 2 weeks to fester before anyone was allowed to go in at all,\" Brady explains.\n\nAvian botulism is a regular problem of the Klamath system, which comprises 6 refuges managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. A local wildlife care center handled 494 sick birds in 2018 and 233 last year [2019], according to January Bill, founder of the organization Bird Ally X, which runs the refuge's so-called \"Duck Hospital.\" But this summer, between mid-July and early September [2020], her facility had received more than 2750 birds of several dozen species, including mallard, green-winged teal, gadwall, northern pintail, and northern shoveler. \"So, this year is out of control,\" she says.\n\nBill and her team, working in the makeshift field hospital of PVC-framed tents and shallow swimming pools for the birds, have successfully rehabilitated at least 90 percent of their patients and returned them to the wild in botulism-free parts of the refuge. However, the death toll of both waterfowl and shorebirds that don't make it to the facility is soaring off the charts.

Field surveyors have collected about 20 000 dead birds, and they guess at least twice that many have perished.\n\n\"Back in the tule reeds, there are sometimes 10 dead birds all on top of each other,\" says Brady, who has personally collected several thousand birds since July [2020]. Removing the carcasses is important; if left in place, they quickly produce fly larvae which carry the disease and can spread it to other birds that eat the small worms. The disease thrives in warm temperatures, and refuge managers don't expect it to disappear until autumn brings subfreezing nighttime lows.\n\nThe disaster comes after a dry spring and summer and highlights challenges in sustainably and equitably using the Klamath River's water. Fish, birds, and other wildlife depend on the resource. So do thousands of local farmers, who grow crops like potatoes, horseradish, hay, and barley.\n\nTo provide water for these users, the US Bureau of Reclamation releases flows from southern Oregon's Upper Klamath Lake, a natural waterway that serves as the basin's major holding pond. The agency also must retain enough water in the lake to support 2 species of endangered suckers. This arrangement, Bureau critics argue, hasn't helped the fish much, and it has many stakeholders feeling shortchanged. In the lower reaches of the watershed, salmon runs have dwindled in part for lack of water, creating dissent among tribal communities and fishing interests. Farmers often want more water, too. In late spring [2020], Klamath Basin growers staged a protest of the Bureau's plans, announced in April, to reduce agricultural allocations.\n\nBut, as in many river basins in the arid West, the Klamath's water has been overallocated to users, leaving insufficient flows for the basin's aquatic ecosystems. Climate change, which is worsening drought conditions and diminishing the mountain snowpack that feeds the Klamath's tributaries, is likely to aggravate the situation.\n\nAmid these challenges, birds are also having a tough time. The Klamath's water allocation system places the basin's refuges last in line to receive flows, which can magnify impacts in dry years like 2020. This summer, the shrinkage of the refuge's wetlands has forced flocks of passing birds to aggregate tightly in warm stagnant water --perfect conditions for a botulism outbreak.\n\nTo try and stave off disaster, the Bureau of Reclamation in August [2020] released an emergency delivery of 4000 acre-feet of water, following a 4600-acre-foot release in July [2020], according to Mary Lee Knecht, a public affairs officer with the agency. It wasn't enough, though, and as the crisis escalated in early September, the Bureau announced it would release another shot of 5400 acre-feet water for the refuge. Altogether, the releases were but a trifle in the grand scheme of Klamath's water equation. Farmers, for instance, are receiving 147 000 acre-feet this year [2020].\n\nAt the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Greg Austin, the manager of the Klamath Basin refuge complex, said in an email that he and his agency \"appreciate every drop of water that [the Bureau of] Reclamation can make available.\" The water, he explains, will help keep portions of the refuge wet for a few more weeks as they wait for freezing temperatures to halt the disease's life cycle.\n\nMeghan Hertel, Audubon California's director of land and water conservation, visited the plague-stricken refuge in late August [2020] when daytime temperatures peaked around 100 deg F [37.8 deg C]. \"It was almost totally dry out there,\" she says. \"There were a few waterholes crammed with birds.\"\n\nHertel and colleagues have been advocating for allowing more water onto important bird refuges for years, both here in the Klamath system and farther south, in the San Joaquin Valley, where refuges are chronically shortchanged the water they're supposed to receive. As droughts, heat waves, and a growing human population add extra strain to water-dependent ecosystems like the Klamath Basin's wetlands, Hertel worries that, unless water allocation policies change, crises like the one now affecting the Klamath refuge will recur with greater frequency and intensity.\n\n\"This die-off should be a wakeup call for all the local stakeholders to sit down and think about how we can get more water out to the refuges,\" she says. \"Putting water out on this landscape is not wasting water.\"\n\n[Byline: Alastair Bland]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_.

Its wings often go next.

As wildfires burn across the state, temperatures hit record highs, and communities cope with the COVID-19 crisis, she is helping respond to a different disaster: the worst avian botulism outbreak that anyone can remember at the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex.\n\nThere, thousands of acres of wetland and marsh that should be rich and verdant havens for millions of migrating waterfowl and shorebirds have become a wasteland of dried-up mud ponds strewn with dead ducks, geese, and other victims of avian botulism. Caused by toxin-producing bacteria, the disease -- which is different from the botulism that can infect canned foods -- tends to affect wetlands lacking flowing water that is cool, clean, and aerated. Thanks to drought and limited water deliveries, that's exactly what's missing this summer from much of the refuge.\n\nTo make a bad situation worse, a wildfire storm stalled the botulism response effort.

A local wildlife care center handled 494 sick birds in 2018 and 233 last year [2019], according to January Bill, founder of the organization Bird Ally X, which runs the refuge's so-called \"Duck Hospital.\" But this summer, between mid-July and early September [2020], her facility had received more than 2750 birds of several dozen species, including mallard, green-winged teal, gadwall, northern pintail, and northern shoveler. \"So, this year is out of control,\" she says.\n\nBill and her team, working in the makeshift field hospital of PVC-framed tents and shallow swimming pools for the birds, have successfully rehabilitated at least 90 percent of their patients and returned them to the wild in botulism-free parts of the refuge. However, the death toll of both waterfowl and shorebirds that don't make it to the facility is soaring off the charts. Field surveyors have collected about 20 000 dead birds, and they guess at least twice that many have perished.\n\n\"Back in the tule reeds, there are sometimes 10 dead birds all on top of each other,\" says Brady, who has personally collected several thousand birds since July [2020]. Removing the carcasses is important; if left in place, they quickly produce fly larvae which carry the disease and can spread it to other birds that eat the small worms. The disease thrives in warm temperatures, and refuge managers don't expect it to disappear until autumn brings subfreezing nighttime lows.\n\nThe disaster comes after a dry spring and summer and highlights challenges in sustainably and equitably using the Klamath River's water. Fish, birds, and other wildlife depend on the resource. So do thousands of local farmers, who grow crops like potatoes, horseradish, hay, and barley.\n\nTo provide water for these users, the US Bureau of Reclamation releases flows from southern Oregon's Upper Klamath Lake, a natural waterway that serves as the basin's major holding pond. The agency also must retain enough water in the lake to support 2 species of endangered suckers. This arrangement, Bureau critics argue, hasn't helped the fish much, and it has many stakeholders feeling shortchanged. In the lower reaches of the watershed, salmon runs have dwindled in part for lack of water, creating dissent among tribal communities and fishing interests. Farmers often want more water, too. In late spring [2020], Klamath Basin growers staged a protest of the Bureau's plans, announced in April, to reduce agricultural allocations.\n\nBut, as in many river basins in the arid West, the Klamath's water has been overallocated to users, leaving insufficient flows for the basin's aquatic ecosystems. Climate change, which is worsening drought conditions and diminishing the mountain snowpack that feeds the Klamath's tributaries, is likely to aggravate the situation.\n\nAmid these challenges, birds are also having a tough time. The Klamath's water allocation system places the basin's refuges last in line to receive flows, which can magnify impacts in dry years like 2020. This summer, the shrinkage of the refuge's wetlands has forced flocks of passing birds to aggregate tightly in warm stagnant water --perfect conditions for a botulism outbreak.\n\nTo try and stave off disaster, the Bureau of Reclamation in August [2020] released an emergency delivery of 4000 acre-feet of water, following a 4600-acre-foot release in July [2020], according to Mary Lee Knecht, a public affairs officer with the agency. It wasn't enough, though, and as the crisis escalated in early September, the Bureau announced it would release another shot of 5400 acre-feet water for the refuge. Altogether, the releases were but a trifle in the grand scheme of Klamath's water equation. Farmers, for instance, are receiving 147 000 acre-feet this year [2020].\n\nAt the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Greg Austin, the manager of the Klamath Basin refuge complex, said in an email that he and his agency \"appreciate every drop of water that [the Bureau of] Reclamation can make available.\" The water, he explains, will help keep portions of the refuge wet for a few more weeks as they wait for freezing temperatures to halt the disease's life cycle.\n\nMeghan Hertel, Audubon California's director of land and water conservation, visited the plague-stricken refuge in late August [2020] when daytime temperatures peaked around 100 deg F [37.8 deg C]. \"It was almost totally dry out there,\" she says. \"There were a few waterholes crammed with birds.\"\n\nHertel and colleagues have been advocating for allowing more water onto important bird refuges for years, both here in the Klamath system and farther south, in the San Joaquin Valley, where refuges are chronically shortchanged the water they're supposed to receive. As droughts, heat waves, and a growing human population add extra strain to water-dependent ecosystems like the Klamath Basin's wetlands, Hertel worries that, unless water allocation policies change, crises like the one now affecting the Klamath refuge will recur with greater frequency and intensity.\n\n\"This die-off should be a wakeup call for all the local stakeholders to sit down and think about how we can get more water out to the refuges,\" she says. \"Putting water out on this landscape is not wasting water.\"\n\n[Byline: Alastair Bland]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_.

Its wings often go next. Finally, its neck goes limp and it drowns.\n\nThis is the sad scene that Caroline Brady, a biologist with the California Waterfowl Association, has observed often this summer [2020]. As wildfires burn across the state, temperatures hit record highs, and communities cope with the COVID-19 crisis, she is helping respond to a different disaster: the worst avian botulism outbreak that anyone can remember at the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex.\n\nThere, thousands of acres of wetland and marsh that should be rich and verdant havens for millions of migrating waterfowl and shorebirds have become a wasteland of dried-up mud ponds strewn with dead ducks, geese, and other victims of avian botulism. Caused by toxin-producing bacteria, the disease -- which is different from the botulism that can infect canned foods -- tends to affect wetlands lacking flowing water that is cool, clean, and aerated. Thanks to drought and limited water deliveries, that's exactly what's missing this summer from much of the refuge.\n\nTo make a bad situation worse, a wildfire storm stalled the botulism response effort. Because firefighting helicopters were scooping water from the refuge to dump on the nearby Caldwell fire, refuge staff were barred from entering even as the disease began to spread. \"The disease outbreak had 2 weeks to fester before anyone was allowed to go in at all,\" Brady explains.\n\nAvian botulism is a regular problem of the Klamath system, which comprises 6 refuges managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

Notes from the Field: Botulism type E after consumption of salt-cured fish -- New Jersey, 2018\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn 25 Oct 2018, at 2:15 a.m., a woman aged 30 years and her mother, aged 55 years, both of Egyptian descent, arrived at an emergency department in New Jersey in hypotensive shock after 16 hours of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The daughter also reported blurry vision and double vision (diplopia), shortness of breath, chest pain, and difficulty speaking. She appeared lethargic and had ophthalmoplegia and bilateral ptosis. Both women were admitted to the hospital. The mother improved after fluid resuscitation, but the daughter required vasopressor support in the intensive care unit. Although the mother did not have evidence of cranial nerve involvement on admission, during the next 24 hours, she developed dysphagia and autonomic dysfunction with syncope and orthostasis and was transferred to the intensive care unit as her symptoms progressively worsened similar to those of her daughter.\n\nTwo days before admission, both women had eaten fesikh, a traditional Egyptian fish dish of uneviscerated gray mullet that is fermented and salt-cured. Fesikh has been linked to foodborne botulism, including a large type E outbreak in Egypt in 1993 (1). The Egyptian Ministry of Health has since issued public health warnings regarding fesikh before Sham el-Nessim, the Egyptian holiday commemorating the beginning of spring, during which fesikh is commonly prepared and eaten. Foodborne botulism outbreaks associated with fesikh and similar uneviscerated salt-cured fish have also occurred in North America (2); 2 outbreaks occurred among persons of Egyptian descent in New Jersey in 1992 (3) and 2005 (4).\n\nBotulism, a paralytic illness caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), was suspected because of the reported exposure to fesikh along with symptoms of ophthalmoplegia, bilateral ptosis, dysarthria, and autonomic dysfunction. Per New Jersey Reporting Regulations (NJAC 8:57), these suspected illnesses were immediately reported to the New Jersey Department of Health. After consultation with CDC, heptavalent botulism antitoxin was released by CDC and administered to both patients within approximately 24 hours of arrival at the hospital. The daughter's symptoms improved, and she was weaned off vasopressors. Both patients survived following intensive care for 2 days and total hospitalization of 7 days each.\n\nCDC tested serum obtained before antitoxin administration. Serum from the daughter tested positive for BoNT type E by the BoNT Endopep-MS assay (5); the mother's serum tested negative. A leftover sample of the consumed fesikh also tested positive for BoNT type E and _Clostridium botulinum_ type E.\n\nInterviews conducted by the Communicable Disease Service at the New Jersey Department of Health revealed that 2 fresh mullets purchased by the patients' neighbor at a local Asian market were used to prepare the fesikh. The mother salt-cured and fermented the mullet, leaving the fish uneviscerated and wrapped in plastic in the kitchen for 20 days at ambient temperature. The mother confirmed that she previously used the same method of preparation in Egypt with no deviation in techniques or steps.\n\nThese cases illustrate the importance of early recognition and treatment of botulism. Botulism can be fatal, typically from respiratory failure, and treatment delays can result in increased mortality and worsened overall outcomes (6). These cases also highlight the role of uneviscerated, salt-cured fish dishes as potential vehicles for foodborne botulism. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous in marine environments, and traditional methods of home preparation for these dishes might support conditions that are favorable for toxin production (that is, anaerobic conditions) (2). Neither of these patients had previously heard of botulism. Risk communication via public awareness campaigns, as has been conducted by the Egyptian Ministry of Health to discourage fesikh consumption, might be indicated in the USA; engagement with Egyptian communities in the USA might provide insights into additional prevention strategies to decrease the risk for foodborne botulism from fesikh and other uneviscerated, salt-cured fish products.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The spores represent a public health hazard when conditions are suitable for vegetative\ncell growth and toxin production.\n\nThree outbreaks of botulism, causing 3 deaths and 11 illnesses, resulted from \"kapchunka\" in the USA between 1981 and 1987. Kapchunka, an ethnic food usually produced from whitefish, is also known as \"rybetz\", \"ribeyza,\" or \"rostov.\" Kapchunka is an uneviscerated, salt-cured, air-dried, whole fish, which may or may not be smoked. It is consumed without further preparation, such as cooking. The fish are salt-cured under minimum refrigeration conditions for a minimum of 25 days and then air-dried at ambient temperature for 3 to 7 days. Kapchunka may be smoked before packing and are commonly stored under refrigeration.\n\nIn 1991, 2 botulism outbreaks occurred. In one, \"faseikh\" [fesikh] was implicated in at least 91 illnesses and 18 deaths in Egypt. Faseikh is a traditional product made by fermenting uneviscerated fresh mullet for up to one day and then salt-curing it in barrels, which may be tightly sealed from one week to one year. An ethnic fish product called \"moloha\" caused a botulism outbreak involving 4 family members in New Jersey. Moloha is an uneviscerated, salt-cured fish product similar to \"faseikh.\" The preparation steps\nin the New Jersey incident were not identified since the source of the \"moloha\" could not be found.\n\nOther salt-cured products, such as \"bloaters,\" can also pose a public health hazard. Bloaters are prepared by salt-curing uneviscerated whole herring, which may or may not be smoked. Bloaters may be transformed into other products, such as fillets or bloater paste. In addition to the products noted above, whole fish that are dried, pickled, or fermented can also pose a public health hazard. The referenced episodes of botulism are representative of a well-documented history of life-threatening health hazards associated with uneviscerated, salt-cured fish.\n\nThe problems with these products are compounded by the difficulty in attaining sufficient levels of salt in all portions of an uneviscerated fish to inhibit the growth of _C. botulinum_. Consequently, any fish product that is salt-cured and then dried, smoked, pickled, or fermented can pose a public health hazard. Toxin may be present in these products even when there are no outward signs of microbiological spoilage or other clear indications to alert the consumer.\n\nControl of growth and toxin production from _C. botulinum_ in fishery products is based on spore destruction (such as retorting canned foods) or inhibition of vegetative cell growth (such as control of water activity, pH, or use of approved chemical inhibitors). The control measures must be applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the product to protect consumers from this potentially life-threatening toxin.\n\nControl of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally 3 to 5 inches in length (8-13 cm)). Typically, these products are prepared from small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish under 5 inches in length are processed, their smaller size helps to ensure complete permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of salt or drying to a uniformly low water activity, resulting in the attainment of conditions that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.\n\nThe FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or smoked to represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In addition, fillets, parts, or other products derived from uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the original product. Therefore, with the exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, the FDA considers uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\n\nThese products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBotulism - USA (06): caviar, risk, recall 20190924.6692113\nBotulism - USA (05): (MD) 20190610.6511664\nBotulism - USA (04): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20190521.6479177\nBotulism - USA (03): (NYC) home-canned peas 20190315.6367720\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) fermented whale flipper 20190206.6303507\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug related 20190103.6241364\n2018\n----\nBotulism - Americas: canned corn, risk, recall 20181213.6208236\nBotulism - USA (08): (CA) 2017, MALDI-TOF MS 20181102.6123995\nBotulism - USA (07): cheese dip, risk, recall 20180804.5946643\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180709.5895187\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) 20180323.5706323\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180214.5628631\n2017\n----\nBotulism - USA (13): (AK) 20170930.5349662\nBotulism - USA (12): (NY) nitrogen-infused coffee, risk, alert, recall 20170920.5329208\nBotulism - USA (11): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20170719.5189504\nBotulism - USA (10): (CA) nacho cheese, type A toxin, unrelated 2nd death 20170525.5060186\nBotulism - USA (09): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese conf., fatal 20170523.5056161\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) gas station food, RFI 20170508.5021002\nBotulism - USA (05): deer antler herbal tea, FDA recall 20170507.5018201\nBotulism - USA (04): (CA) deer antler tea 20170429.5003486\nBotulism - USA (03): (TX) wound, drug-related, 2005-2015 20170427.4999639\nBotulism - USA (02): (CA) satay, risk, recall 20170420.4982801\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, non-drug-related 20170402.4942916\n.................................................ll/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "1008-09-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-10-25 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1991-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Jersey", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Silver Spring", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cairo", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "Weber JT", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW JERSEY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6950449", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - Canada: (NB) bottled clams, risk, recall", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6950449", "date": "2019-11-13 11:48:39", "main_text": "BOTULISM - USA (07): (NEW JERSEY) FERMENTED, SALT CURED FISH\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 8 Nov 2019\nSource: CDC.

The control measures must be applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the product to protect consumers from this potentially life-threatening toxin.\n\nControl of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally 3 to 5 inches in length (8-13 cm)). Typically, these products are prepared from small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish under 5 inches in length are processed, their smaller size helps to ensure complete permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of salt or drying to a uniformly low water activity, resulting in the attainment of conditions that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.\n\nThe FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or smoked to represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In addition, fillets, parts, or other products derived from uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the original product. Therefore, with the exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, the FDA considers uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\n\nThese products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBotulism - USA (06): caviar, risk, recall 20190924.6692113\nBotulism - USA (05): (MD) 20190610.6511664\nBotulism - USA (04): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20190521.6479177\nBotulism - USA (03): (NYC) home-canned peas 20190315.6367720\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) fermented whale flipper 20190206.6303507\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug related 20190103.6241364\n2018\n----\nBotulism - Americas: canned corn, risk, recall 20181213.6208236\nBotulism - USA (08): (CA) 2017, MALDI-TOF MS 20181102.6123995\nBotulism - USA (07): cheese dip, risk, recall 20180804.5946643\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180709.5895187\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) 20180323.5706323\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180214.5628631\n2017\n----\nBotulism - USA (13): (AK) 20170930.5349662\nBotulism - USA (12): (NY) nitrogen-infused coffee, risk, alert, recall 20170920.5329208\nBotulism - USA (11): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20170719.5189504\nBotulism - USA (10): (CA) nacho cheese, type A toxin, unrelated 2nd death 20170525.5060186\nBotulism - USA (09): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese conf., fatal 20170523.5056161\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) gas station food, RFI 20170508.5021002\nBotulism - USA (05): deer antler herbal tea, FDA recall 20170507.5018201\nBotulism - USA (04): (CA) deer antler tea 20170429.5003486\nBotulism - USA (03): (TX) wound, drug-related, 2005-2015 20170427.4999639\nBotulism - USA (02): (CA) satay, risk, recall 20170420.4982801\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, non-drug-related 20170402.4942916\n.................................................ll/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "1008-09-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-10-25 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1991-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Jersey", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Silver Spring", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cairo", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "Weber JT", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW JERSEY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6874215", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - USA (02): (AK) home canned salmon", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6874215", "date": "2019-11-13 11:48:39", "main_text": "BOTULISM - USA (07): (NEW JERSEY) FERMENTED, SALT CURED FISH\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 8 Nov 2019\nSource: CDC.

Notes from the Field: Botulism type E after consumption of salt-cured fish -- New Jersey, 2018\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn 25 Oct 2018, at 2:15 a.m., a woman aged 30 years and her mother, aged 55 years, both of Egyptian descent, arrived at an emergency department in New Jersey in hypotensive shock after 16 hours of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The daughter also reported blurry vision and double vision (diplopia), shortness of breath, chest pain, and difficulty speaking. She appeared lethargic and had ophthalmoplegia and bilateral ptosis. Both women were admitted to the hospital. The mother improved after fluid resuscitation, but the daughter required vasopressor support in the intensive care unit. Although the mother did not have evidence of cranial nerve involvement on admission, during the next 24 hours, she developed dysphagia and autonomic dysfunction with syncope and orthostasis and was transferred to the intensive care unit as her symptoms progressively worsened similar to those of her daughter.\n\nTwo days before admission, both women had eaten fesikh, a traditional Egyptian fish dish of uneviscerated gray mullet that is fermented and salt-cured. Fesikh has been linked to foodborne botulism, including a large type E outbreak in Egypt in 1993 (1). The Egyptian Ministry of Health has since issued public health warnings regarding fesikh before Sham el-Nessim, the Egyptian holiday commemorating the beginning of spring, during which fesikh is commonly prepared and eaten. Foodborne botulism outbreaks associated with fesikh and similar uneviscerated salt-cured fish have also occurred in North America (2); 2 outbreaks occurred among persons of Egyptian descent in New Jersey in 1992 (3) and 2005 (4).\n\nBotulism, a paralytic illness caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), was suspected because of the reported exposure to fesikh along with symptoms of ophthalmoplegia, bilateral ptosis, dysarthria, and autonomic dysfunction. Per New Jersey Reporting Regulations (NJAC 8:57), these suspected illnesses were immediately reported to the New Jersey Department of Health. After consultation with CDC, heptavalent botulism antitoxin was released by CDC and administered to both patients within approximately 24 hours of arrival at the hospital. The daughter's symptoms improved, and she was weaned off vasopressors. Both patients survived following intensive care for 2 days and total hospitalization of 7 days each.\n\nCDC tested serum obtained before antitoxin administration. Serum from the daughter tested positive for BoNT type E by the BoNT Endopep-MS assay (5); the mother's serum tested negative. A leftover sample of the consumed fesikh also tested positive for BoNT type E and _Clostridium botulinum_ type E.\n\nInterviews conducted by the Communicable Disease Service at the New Jersey Department of Health revealed that 2 fresh mullets purchased by the patients' neighbor at a local Asian market were used to prepare the fesikh. The mother salt-cured and fermented the mullet, leaving the fish uneviscerated and wrapped in plastic in the kitchen for 20 days at ambient temperature. The mother confirmed that she previously used the same method of preparation in Egypt with no deviation in techniques or steps.\n\nThese cases illustrate the importance of early recognition and treatment of botulism. Botulism can be fatal, typically from respiratory failure, and treatment delays can result in increased mortality and worsened overall outcomes (6). These cases also highlight the role of uneviscerated, salt-cured fish dishes as potential vehicles for foodborne botulism. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous in marine environments, and traditional methods of home preparation for these dishes might support conditions that are favorable for toxin production (that is, anaerobic conditions) (2). Neither of these patients had previously heard of botulism. Risk communication via public awareness campaigns, as has been conducted by the Egyptian Ministry of Health to discourage fesikh consumption, might be indicated in the USA; engagement with Egyptian communities in the USA might provide insights into additional prevention strategies to decrease the risk for foodborne botulism from fesikh and other uneviscerated, salt-cured fish products.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The spores represent a public health hazard when conditions are suitable for vegetative\ncell growth and toxin production.\n\nThree outbreaks of botulism, causing 3 deaths and 11 illnesses, resulted from \"kapchunka\" in the USA between 1981 and 1987. Kapchunka, an ethnic food usually produced from whitefish, is also known as \"rybetz\", \"ribeyza,\" or \"rostov.\" Kapchunka is an uneviscerated, salt-cured, air-dried, whole fish, which may or may not be smoked. It is consumed without further preparation, such as cooking. The fish are salt-cured under minimum refrigeration conditions for a minimum of 25 days and then air-dried at ambient temperature for 3 to 7 days. Kapchunka may be smoked before packing and are commonly stored under refrigeration.\n\nIn 1991, 2 botulism outbreaks occurred. In one, \"faseikh\" [fesikh] was implicated in at least 91 illnesses and 18 deaths in Egypt. Faseikh is a traditional product made by fermenting uneviscerated fresh mullet for up to one day and then salt-curing it in barrels, which may be tightly sealed from one week to one year. An ethnic fish product called \"moloha\" caused a botulism outbreak involving 4 family members in New Jersey. Moloha is an uneviscerated, salt-cured fish product similar to \"faseikh.\" The preparation steps\nin the New Jersey incident were not identified since the source of the \"moloha\" could not be found.\n\nOther salt-cured products, such as \"bloaters,\" can also pose a public health hazard. Bloaters are prepared by salt-curing uneviscerated whole herring, which may or may not be smoked. Bloaters may be transformed into other products, such as fillets or bloater paste. In addition to the products noted above, whole fish that are dried, pickled, or fermented can also pose a public health hazard. The referenced episodes of botulism are representative of a well-documented history of life-threatening health hazards associated with uneviscerated, salt-cured fish.\n\nThe problems with these products are compounded by the difficulty in attaining sufficient levels of salt in all portions of an uneviscerated fish to inhibit the growth of _C. botulinum_. Consequently, any fish product that is salt-cured and then dried, smoked, pickled, or fermented can pose a public health hazard. Toxin may be present in these products even when there are no outward signs of microbiological spoilage or other clear indications to alert the consumer.\n\nControl of growth and toxin production from _C. botulinum_ in fishery products is based on spore destruction (such as retorting canned foods) or inhibition of vegetative cell growth (such as control of water activity, pH, or use of approved chemical inhibitors). The control measures must be applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the product to protect consumers from this potentially life-threatening toxin.\n\nControl of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally 3 to 5 inches in length (8-13 cm)). Typically, these products are prepared from small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish under 5 inches in length are processed, their smaller size helps to ensure complete permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of salt or drying to a uniformly low water activity, resulting in the attainment of conditions that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.\n\nThe FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or smoked to represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In addition, fillets, parts, or other products derived from uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the original product. Therefore, with the exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, the FDA considers uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\n\nThese products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBotulism - USA (06): caviar, risk, recall 20190924.6692113\nBotulism - USA (05): (MD) 20190610.6511664\nBotulism - USA (04): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20190521.6479177\nBotulism - USA (03): (NYC) home-canned peas 20190315.6367720\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) fermented whale flipper 20190206.6303507\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug related 20190103.6241364\n2018\n----\nBotulism - Americas: canned corn, risk, recall 20181213.6208236\nBotulism - USA (08): (CA) 2017, MALDI-TOF MS 20181102.6123995\nBotulism - USA (07): cheese dip, risk, recall 20180804.5946643\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180709.5895187\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) 20180323.5706323\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180214.5628631\n2017\n----\nBotulism - USA (13): (AK) 20170930.5349662\nBotulism - USA (12): (NY) nitrogen-infused coffee, risk, alert, recall 20170920.5329208\nBotulism - USA (11): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20170719.5189504\nBotulism - USA (10): (CA) nacho cheese, type A toxin, unrelated 2nd death 20170525.5060186\nBotulism - USA (09): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese conf., fatal 20170523.5056161\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) gas station food, RFI 20170508.5021002\nBotulism - USA (05): deer antler herbal tea, FDA recall 20170507.5018201\nBotulism - USA (04): (CA) deer antler tea 20170429.5003486\nBotulism - USA (03): (TX) wound, drug-related, 2005-2015 20170427.4999639\nBotulism - USA (02): (CA) satay, risk, recall 20170420.4982801\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, non-drug-related 20170402.4942916\n.................................................ll/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "1008-09-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-10-25 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1991-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Jersey", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Silver Spring", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cairo", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "Weber JT", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW JERSEY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6872265", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - USA: (TX) improperly stored cooked potatoes, fatal", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6872265", "date": "2019-11-13 11:48:39", "main_text": "BOTULISM - USA (07): (NEW JERSEY) FERMENTED, SALT CURED FISH\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 8 Nov 2019\nSource: CDC.

The spores represent a public health hazard when conditions are suitable for vegetative\ncell growth and toxin production.\n\nThree outbreaks of botulism, causing 3 deaths and 11 illnesses, resulted from \"kapchunka\" in the USA between 1981 and 1987. Kapchunka, an ethnic food usually produced from whitefish, is also known as \"rybetz\", \"ribeyza,\" or \"rostov.\" Kapchunka is an uneviscerated, salt-cured, air-dried, whole fish, which may or may not be smoked. It is consumed without further preparation, such as cooking. The fish are salt-cured under minimum refrigeration conditions for a minimum of 25 days and then air-dried at ambient temperature for 3 to 7 days. Kapchunka may be smoked before packing and are commonly stored under refrigeration.\n\nIn 1991, 2 botulism outbreaks occurred. In one, \"faseikh\" [fesikh] was implicated in at least 91 illnesses and 18 deaths in Egypt. Faseikh is a traditional product made by fermenting uneviscerated fresh mullet for up to one day and then salt-curing it in barrels, which may be tightly sealed from one week to one year. An ethnic fish product called \"moloha\" caused a botulism outbreak involving 4 family members in New Jersey. Moloha is an uneviscerated, salt-cured fish product similar to \"faseikh.\" The preparation steps\nin the New Jersey incident were not identified since the source of the \"moloha\" could not be found.\n\nOther salt-cured products, such as \"bloaters,\" can also pose a public health hazard. Bloaters are prepared by salt-curing uneviscerated whole herring, which may or may not be smoked. Bloaters may be transformed into other products, such as fillets or bloater paste. In addition to the products noted above, whole fish that are dried, pickled, or fermented can also pose a public health hazard. The referenced episodes of botulism are representative of a well-documented history of life-threatening health hazards associated with uneviscerated, salt-cured fish.\n\nThe problems with these products are compounded by the difficulty in attaining sufficient levels of salt in all portions of an uneviscerated fish to inhibit the growth of _C. botulinum_. Consequently, any fish product that is salt-cured and then dried, smoked, pickled, or fermented can pose a public health hazard. Toxin may be present in these products even when there are no outward signs of microbiological spoilage or other clear indications to alert the consumer.\n\nControl of growth and toxin production from _C. botulinum_ in fishery products is based on spore destruction (such as retorting canned foods) or inhibition of vegetative cell growth (such as control of water activity, pH, or use of approved chemical inhibitors). The control measures must be applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the product to protect consumers from this potentially life-threatening toxin.\n\nControl of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally 3 to 5 inches in length (8-13 cm)). Typically, these products are prepared from small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish under 5 inches in length are processed, their smaller size helps to ensure complete permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of salt or drying to a uniformly low water activity, resulting in the attainment of conditions that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.\n\nThe FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or smoked to represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In addition, fillets, parts, or other products derived from uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the original product. Therefore, with the exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, the FDA considers uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\n\nThese products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBotulism - USA (06): caviar, risk, recall 20190924.6692113\nBotulism - USA (05): (MD) 20190610.6511664\nBotulism - USA (04): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20190521.6479177\nBotulism - USA (03): (NYC) home-canned peas 20190315.6367720\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) fermented whale flipper 20190206.6303507\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug related 20190103.6241364\n2018\n----\nBotulism - Americas: canned corn, risk, recall 20181213.6208236\nBotulism - USA (08): (CA) 2017, MALDI-TOF MS 20181102.6123995\nBotulism - USA (07): cheese dip, risk, recall 20180804.5946643\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180709.5895187\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) 20180323.5706323\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180214.5628631\n2017\n----\nBotulism - USA (13): (AK) 20170930.5349662\nBotulism - USA (12): (NY) nitrogen-infused coffee, risk, alert, recall 20170920.5329208\nBotulism - USA (11): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20170719.5189504\nBotulism - USA (10): (CA) nacho cheese, type A toxin, unrelated 2nd death 20170525.5060186\nBotulism - USA (09): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese conf., fatal 20170523.5056161\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) gas station food, RFI 20170508.5021002\nBotulism - USA (05): deer antler herbal tea, FDA recall 20170507.5018201\nBotulism - USA (04): (CA) deer antler tea 20170429.5003486\nBotulism - USA (03): (TX) wound, drug-related, 2005-2015 20170427.4999639\nBotulism - USA (02): (CA) satay, risk, recall 20170420.4982801\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, non-drug-related 20170402.4942916\n.................................................ll/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "1008-09-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-10-25 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1991-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Jersey", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Silver Spring", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cairo", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "Weber JT", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW JERSEY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6824570", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Clostridial myonecrosis, wound botulism - USA: (CA) injection drug related", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6824570", "date": "2019-11-13 11:48:39", "main_text": "BOTULISM - USA (07): (NEW JERSEY) FERMENTED, SALT CURED FISH\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 8 Nov 2019\nSource: CDC.

Notes from the Field: Botulism type E after consumption of salt-cured fish -- New Jersey, 2018\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn 25 Oct 2018, at 2:15 a.m., a woman aged 30 years and her mother, aged 55 years, both of Egyptian descent, arrived at an emergency department in New Jersey in hypotensive shock after 16 hours of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The daughter also reported blurry vision and double vision (diplopia), shortness of breath, chest pain, and difficulty speaking. She appeared lethargic and had ophthalmoplegia and bilateral ptosis. Both women were admitted to the hospital. The mother improved after fluid resuscitation, but the daughter required vasopressor support in the intensive care unit. Although the mother did not have evidence of cranial nerve involvement on admission, during the next 24 hours, she developed dysphagia and autonomic dysfunction with syncope and orthostasis and was transferred to the intensive care unit as her symptoms progressively worsened similar to those of her daughter.\n\nTwo days before admission, both women had eaten fesikh, a traditional Egyptian fish dish of uneviscerated gray mullet that is fermented and salt-cured. Fesikh has been linked to foodborne botulism, including a large type E outbreak in Egypt in 1993 (1). The Egyptian Ministry of Health has since issued public health warnings regarding fesikh before Sham el-Nessim, the Egyptian holiday commemorating the beginning of spring, during which fesikh is commonly prepared and eaten. Foodborne botulism outbreaks associated with fesikh and similar uneviscerated salt-cured fish have also occurred in North America (2); 2 outbreaks occurred among persons of Egyptian descent in New Jersey in 1992 (3) and 2005 (4).\n\nBotulism, a paralytic illness caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), was suspected because of the reported exposure to fesikh along with symptoms of ophthalmoplegia, bilateral ptosis, dysarthria, and autonomic dysfunction. Per New Jersey Reporting Regulations (NJAC 8:57), these suspected illnesses were immediately reported to the New Jersey Department of Health. After consultation with CDC, heptavalent botulism antitoxin was released by CDC and administered to both patients within approximately 24 hours of arrival at the hospital. The daughter's symptoms improved, and she was weaned off vasopressors. Both patients survived following intensive care for 2 days and total hospitalization of 7 days each.\n\nCDC tested serum obtained before antitoxin administration. Serum from the daughter tested positive for BoNT type E by the BoNT Endopep-MS assay (5); the mother's serum tested negative. A leftover sample of the consumed fesikh also tested positive for BoNT type E and _Clostridium botulinum_ type E.\n\nInterviews conducted by the Communicable Disease Service at the New Jersey Department of Health revealed that 2 fresh mullets purchased by the patients' neighbor at a local Asian market were used to prepare the fesikh. The mother salt-cured and fermented the mullet, leaving the fish uneviscerated and wrapped in plastic in the kitchen for 20 days at ambient temperature. The mother confirmed that she previously used the same method of preparation in Egypt with no deviation in techniques or steps.\n\nThese cases illustrate the importance of early recognition and treatment of botulism. Botulism can be fatal, typically from respiratory failure, and treatment delays can result in increased mortality and worsened overall outcomes (6). These cases also highlight the role of uneviscerated, salt-cured fish dishes as potential vehicles for foodborne botulism. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous in marine environments, and traditional methods of home preparation for these dishes might support conditions that are favorable for toxin production (that is, anaerobic conditions) (2). Neither of these patients had previously heard of botulism. Risk communication via public awareness campaigns, as has been conducted by the Egyptian Ministry of Health to discourage fesikh consumption, might be indicated in the USA; engagement with Egyptian communities in the USA might provide insights into additional prevention strategies to decrease the risk for foodborne botulism from fesikh and other uneviscerated, salt-cured fish products.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Therefore, with the exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, the FDA considers uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\n\nThese products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBotulism - USA (06): caviar, risk, recall 20190924.6692113\nBotulism - USA (05): (MD) 20190610.6511664\nBotulism - USA (04): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20190521.6479177\nBotulism - USA (03): (NYC) home-canned peas 20190315.6367720\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) fermented whale flipper 20190206.6303507\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug related 20190103.6241364\n2018\n----\nBotulism - Americas: canned corn, risk, recall 20181213.6208236\nBotulism - USA (08): (CA) 2017, MALDI-TOF MS 20181102.6123995\nBotulism - USA (07): cheese dip, risk, recall 20180804.5946643\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180709.5895187\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) 20180323.5706323\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180214.5628631\n2017\n----\nBotulism - USA (13): (AK) 20170930.5349662\nBotulism - USA (12): (NY) nitrogen-infused coffee, risk, alert, recall 20170920.5329208\nBotulism - USA (11): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20170719.5189504\nBotulism - USA (10): (CA) nacho cheese, type A toxin, unrelated 2nd death 20170525.5060186\nBotulism - USA (09): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese conf., fatal 20170523.5056161\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) gas station food, RFI 20170508.5021002\nBotulism - USA (05): deer antler herbal tea, FDA recall 20170507.5018201\nBotulism - USA (04): (CA) deer antler tea 20170429.5003486\nBotulism - USA (03): (TX) wound, drug-related, 2005-2015 20170427.4999639\nBotulism - USA (02): (CA) satay, risk, recall 20170420.4982801\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, non-drug-related 20170402.4942916\n.................................................ll/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "1008-09-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-10-25 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1991-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Jersey", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Silver Spring", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cairo", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "Weber JT", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW JERSEY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6783339", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism, cosmetic use - Taiwan", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6783339", "date": "2019-11-13 11:48:39", "main_text": "BOTULISM - USA (07): (NEW JERSEY) FERMENTED, SALT CURED FISH\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 8 Nov 2019\nSource: CDC.

Notes from the Field: Botulism type E after consumption of salt-cured fish -- New Jersey, 2018\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn 25 Oct 2018, at 2:15 a.m., a woman aged 30 years and her mother, aged 55 years, both of Egyptian descent, arrived at an emergency department in New Jersey in hypotensive shock after 16 hours of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The daughter also reported blurry vision and double vision (diplopia), shortness of breath, chest pain, and difficulty speaking. She appeared lethargic and had ophthalmoplegia and bilateral ptosis. Both women were admitted to the hospital. The mother improved after fluid resuscitation, but the daughter required vasopressor support in the intensive care unit. Although the mother did not have evidence of cranial nerve involvement on admission, during the next 24 hours, she developed dysphagia and autonomic dysfunction with syncope and orthostasis and was transferred to the intensive care unit as her symptoms progressively worsened similar to those of her daughter.\n\nTwo days before admission, both women had eaten fesikh, a traditional Egyptian fish dish of uneviscerated gray mullet that is fermented and salt-cured. Fesikh has been linked to foodborne botulism, including a large type E outbreak in Egypt in 1993 (1). The Egyptian Ministry of Health has since issued public health warnings regarding fesikh before Sham el-Nessim, the Egyptian holiday commemorating the beginning of spring, during which fesikh is commonly prepared and eaten. Foodborne botulism outbreaks associated with fesikh and similar uneviscerated salt-cured fish have also occurred in North America (2); 2 outbreaks occurred among persons of Egyptian descent in New Jersey in 1992 (3) and 2005 (4).\n\nBotulism, a paralytic illness caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), was suspected because of the reported exposure to fesikh along with symptoms of ophthalmoplegia, bilateral ptosis, dysarthria, and autonomic dysfunction. Per New Jersey Reporting Regulations (NJAC 8:57), these suspected illnesses were immediately reported to the New Jersey Department of Health. After consultation with CDC, heptavalent botulism antitoxin was released by CDC and administered to both patients within approximately 24 hours of arrival at the hospital. The daughter's symptoms improved, and she was weaned off vasopressors. Both patients survived following intensive care for 2 days and total hospitalization of 7 days each.\n\nCDC tested serum obtained before antitoxin administration. Serum from the daughter tested positive for BoNT type E by the BoNT Endopep-MS assay (5); the mother's serum tested negative. A leftover sample of the consumed fesikh also tested positive for BoNT type E and _Clostridium botulinum_ type E.\n\nInterviews conducted by the Communicable Disease Service at the New Jersey Department of Health revealed that 2 fresh mullets purchased by the patients' neighbor at a local Asian market were used to prepare the fesikh. The mother salt-cured and fermented the mullet, leaving the fish uneviscerated and wrapped in plastic in the kitchen for 20 days at ambient temperature. The mother confirmed that she previously used the same method of preparation in Egypt with no deviation in techniques or steps.\n\nThese cases illustrate the importance of early recognition and treatment of botulism. Botulism can be fatal, typically from respiratory failure, and treatment delays can result in increased mortality and worsened overall outcomes (6). These cases also highlight the role of uneviscerated, salt-cured fish dishes as potential vehicles for foodborne botulism. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous in marine environments, and traditional methods of home preparation for these dishes might support conditions that are favorable for toxin production (that is, anaerobic conditions) (2). Neither of these patients had previously heard of botulism. Risk communication via public awareness campaigns, as has been conducted by the Egyptian Ministry of Health to discourage fesikh consumption, might be indicated in the USA; engagement with Egyptian communities in the USA might provide insights into additional prevention strategies to decrease the risk for foodborne botulism from fesikh and other uneviscerated, salt-cured fish products.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The spores represent a public health hazard when conditions are suitable for vegetative\ncell growth and toxin production.\n\nThree outbreaks of botulism, causing 3 deaths and 11 illnesses, resulted from \"kapchunka\" in the USA between 1981 and 1987. Kapchunka, an ethnic food usually produced from whitefish, is also known as \"rybetz\", \"ribeyza,\" or \"rostov.\" Kapchunka is an uneviscerated, salt-cured, air-dried, whole fish, which may or may not be smoked. It is consumed without further preparation, such as cooking. The fish are salt-cured under minimum refrigeration conditions for a minimum of 25 days and then air-dried at ambient temperature for 3 to 7 days. Kapchunka may be smoked before packing and are commonly stored under refrigeration.\n\nIn 1991, 2 botulism outbreaks occurred. In one, \"faseikh\" [fesikh] was implicated in at least 91 illnesses and 18 deaths in Egypt. Faseikh is a traditional product made by fermenting uneviscerated fresh mullet for up to one day and then salt-curing it in barrels, which may be tightly sealed from one week to one year. An ethnic fish product called \"moloha\" caused a botulism outbreak involving 4 family members in New Jersey. Moloha is an uneviscerated, salt-cured fish product similar to \"faseikh.\" The preparation steps\nin the New Jersey incident were not identified since the source of the \"moloha\" could not be found.\n\nOther salt-cured products, such as \"bloaters,\" can also pose a public health hazard. Bloaters are prepared by salt-curing uneviscerated whole herring, which may or may not be smoked. Bloaters may be transformed into other products, such as fillets or bloater paste. In addition to the products noted above, whole fish that are dried, pickled, or fermented can also pose a public health hazard. The referenced episodes of botulism are representative of a well-documented history of life-threatening health hazards associated with uneviscerated, salt-cured fish.\n\nThe problems with these products are compounded by the difficulty in attaining sufficient levels of salt in all portions of an uneviscerated fish to inhibit the growth of _C. botulinum_. Consequently, any fish product that is salt-cured and then dried, smoked, pickled, or fermented can pose a public health hazard. Toxin may be present in these products even when there are no outward signs of microbiological spoilage or other clear indications to alert the consumer.\n\nControl of growth and toxin production from _C. botulinum_ in fishery products is based on spore destruction (such as retorting canned foods) or inhibition of vegetative cell growth (such as control of water activity, pH, or use of approved chemical inhibitors). The control measures must be applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the product to protect consumers from this potentially life-threatening toxin.\n\nControl of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally 3 to 5 inches in length (8-13 cm)). Typically, these products are prepared from small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish under 5 inches in length are processed, their smaller size helps to ensure complete permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of salt or drying to a uniformly low water activity, resulting in the attainment of conditions that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.\n\nThe FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or smoked to represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In addition, fillets, parts, or other products derived from uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the original product. Therefore, with the exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, the FDA considers uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\n\nThese products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBotulism - USA (06): caviar, risk, recall 20190924.6692113\nBotulism - USA (05): (MD) 20190610.6511664\nBotulism - USA (04): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20190521.6479177\nBotulism - USA (03): (NYC) home-canned peas 20190315.6367720\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) fermented whale flipper 20190206.6303507\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug related 20190103.6241364\n2018\n----\nBotulism - Americas: canned corn, risk, recall 20181213.6208236\nBotulism - USA (08): (CA) 2017, MALDI-TOF MS 20181102.6123995\nBotulism - USA (07): cheese dip, risk, recall 20180804.5946643\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180709.5895187\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) 20180323.5706323\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180214.5628631\n2017\n----\nBotulism - USA (13): (AK) 20170930.5349662\nBotulism - USA (12): (NY) nitrogen-infused coffee, risk, alert, recall 20170920.5329208\nBotulism - USA (11): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20170719.5189504\nBotulism - USA (10): (CA) nacho cheese, type A toxin, unrelated 2nd death 20170525.5060186\nBotulism - USA (09): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese conf., fatal 20170523.5056161\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) gas station food, RFI 20170508.5021002\nBotulism - USA (05): deer antler herbal tea, FDA recall 20170507.5018201\nBotulism - USA (04): (CA) deer antler tea 20170429.5003486\nBotulism - USA (03): (TX) wound, drug-related, 2005-2015 20170427.4999639\nBotulism - USA (02): (CA) satay, risk, recall 20170420.4982801\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, non-drug-related 20170402.4942916\n.................................................ll/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "1008-09-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-10-25 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1991-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Jersey", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Silver Spring", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cairo", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "Weber JT", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW JERSEY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6782208", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - USA (08): (NM) wound, injection drug related", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6782208", "date": "2019-11-13 11:48:39", "main_text": "BOTULISM - USA (07): (NEW JERSEY) FERMENTED, SALT CURED FISH\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 8 Nov 2019\nSource: CDC.

The spores represent a public health hazard when conditions are suitable for vegetative\ncell growth and toxin production.\n\nThree outbreaks of botulism, causing 3 deaths and 11 illnesses, resulted from \"kapchunka\" in the USA between 1981 and 1987. Kapchunka, an ethnic food usually produced from whitefish, is also known as \"rybetz\", \"ribeyza,\" or \"rostov.\" Kapchunka is an uneviscerated, salt-cured, air-dried, whole fish, which may or may not be smoked. It is consumed without further preparation, such as cooking. The fish are salt-cured under minimum refrigeration conditions for a minimum of 25 days and then air-dried at ambient temperature for 3 to 7 days. Kapchunka may be smoked before packing and are commonly stored under refrigeration.\n\nIn 1991, 2 botulism outbreaks occurred. In one, \"faseikh\" [fesikh] was implicated in at least 91 illnesses and 18 deaths in Egypt. Faseikh is a traditional product made by fermenting uneviscerated fresh mullet for up to one day and then salt-curing it in barrels, which may be tightly sealed from one week to one year. An ethnic fish product called \"moloha\" caused a botulism outbreak involving 4 family members in New Jersey. Moloha is an uneviscerated, salt-cured fish product similar to \"faseikh.\" The preparation steps\nin the New Jersey incident were not identified since the source of the \"moloha\" could not be found.\n\nOther salt-cured products, such as \"bloaters,\" can also pose a public health hazard. Bloaters are prepared by salt-curing uneviscerated whole herring, which may or may not be smoked. Bloaters may be transformed into other products, such as fillets or bloater paste. In addition to the products noted above, whole fish that are dried, pickled, or fermented can also pose a public health hazard. The referenced episodes of botulism are representative of a well-documented history of life-threatening health hazards associated with uneviscerated, salt-cured fish.\n\nThe problems with these products are compounded by the difficulty in attaining sufficient levels of salt in all portions of an uneviscerated fish to inhibit the growth of _C. botulinum_. Consequently, any fish product that is salt-cured and then dried, smoked, pickled, or fermented can pose a public health hazard. Toxin may be present in these products even when there are no outward signs of microbiological spoilage or other clear indications to alert the consumer.\n\nControl of growth and toxin production from _C. botulinum_ in fishery products is based on spore destruction (such as retorting canned foods) or inhibition of vegetative cell growth (such as control of water activity, pH, or use of approved chemical inhibitors). The control measures must be applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the product to protect consumers from this potentially life-threatening toxin.\n\nControl of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally 3 to 5 inches in length (8-13 cm)). Typically, these products are prepared from small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish under 5 inches in length are processed, their smaller size helps to ensure complete permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of salt or drying to a uniformly low water activity, resulting in the attainment of conditions that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.\n\nThe FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or smoked to represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In addition, fillets, parts, or other products derived from uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the original product. Therefore, with the exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, the FDA considers uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\n\nThese products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBotulism - USA (06): caviar, risk, recall 20190924.6692113\nBotulism - USA (05): (MD) 20190610.6511664\nBotulism - USA (04): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20190521.6479177\nBotulism - USA (03): (NYC) home-canned peas 20190315.6367720\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) fermented whale flipper 20190206.6303507\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug related 20190103.6241364\n2018\n----\nBotulism - Americas: canned corn, risk, recall 20181213.6208236\nBotulism - USA (08): (CA) 2017, MALDI-TOF MS 20181102.6123995\nBotulism - USA (07): cheese dip, risk, recall 20180804.5946643\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180709.5895187\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) 20180323.5706323\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180214.5628631\n2017\n----\nBotulism - USA (13): (AK) 20170930.5349662\nBotulism - USA (12): (NY) nitrogen-infused coffee, risk, alert, recall 20170920.5329208\nBotulism - USA (11): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20170719.5189504\nBotulism - USA (10): (CA) nacho cheese, type A toxin, unrelated 2nd death 20170525.5060186\nBotulism - USA (09): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese conf., fatal 20170523.5056161\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) gas station food, RFI 20170508.5021002\nBotulism - USA (05): deer antler herbal tea, FDA recall 20170507.5018201\nBotulism - USA (04): (CA) deer antler tea 20170429.5003486\nBotulism - USA (03): (TX) wound, drug-related, 2005-2015 20170427.4999639\nBotulism - USA (02): (CA) satay, risk, recall 20170420.4982801\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, non-drug-related 20170402.4942916\n.................................................ll/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "1008-09-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-10-25 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1991-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Jersey", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Silver Spring", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cairo", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "Weber JT", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW JERSEY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6773367", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - USA (07): (NJ) fermented, salt cured fish", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6773367", "date": "2019-11-13 11:48:39", "main_text": "BOTULISM - USA (07): (NEW JERSEY) FERMENTED, SALT CURED FISH\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 8 Nov 2019\nSource: CDC.

Notes from the Field: Botulism type E after consumption of salt-cured fish -- New Jersey, 2018\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn 25 Oct 2018, at 2:15 a.m., a woman aged 30 years and her mother, aged 55 years, both of Egyptian descent, arrived at an emergency department in New Jersey in hypotensive shock after 16 hours of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The daughter also reported blurry vision and double vision (diplopia), shortness of breath, chest pain, and difficulty speaking. She appeared lethargic and had ophthalmoplegia and bilateral ptosis. Both women were admitted to the hospital. The mother improved after fluid resuscitation, but the daughter required vasopressor support in the intensive care unit. Although the mother did not have evidence of cranial nerve involvement on admission, during the next 24 hours, she developed dysphagia and autonomic dysfunction with syncope and orthostasis and was transferred to the intensive care unit as her symptoms progressively worsened similar to those of her daughter.\n\nTwo days before admission, both women had eaten fesikh, a traditional Egyptian fish dish of uneviscerated gray mullet that is fermented and salt-cured. Fesikh has been linked to foodborne botulism, including a large type E outbreak in Egypt in 1993 (1). The Egyptian Ministry of Health has since issued public health warnings regarding fesikh before Sham el-Nessim, the Egyptian holiday commemorating the beginning of spring, during which fesikh is commonly prepared and eaten. Foodborne botulism outbreaks associated with fesikh and similar uneviscerated salt-cured fish have also occurred in North America (2); 2 outbreaks occurred among persons of Egyptian descent in New Jersey in 1992 (3) and 2005 (4).\n\nBotulism, a paralytic illness caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), was suspected because of the reported exposure to fesikh along with symptoms of ophthalmoplegia, bilateral ptosis, dysarthria, and autonomic dysfunction. Per New Jersey Reporting Regulations (NJAC 8:57), these suspected illnesses were immediately reported to the New Jersey Department of Health. After consultation with CDC, heptavalent botulism antitoxin was released by CDC and administered to both patients within approximately 24 hours of arrival at the hospital. The daughter's symptoms improved, and she was weaned off vasopressors. Both patients survived following intensive care for 2 days and total hospitalization of 7 days each.\n\nCDC tested serum obtained before antitoxin administration. Serum from the daughter tested positive for BoNT type E by the BoNT Endopep-MS assay (5); the mother's serum tested negative. A leftover sample of the consumed fesikh also tested positive for BoNT type E and _Clostridium botulinum_ type E.\n\nInterviews conducted by the Communicable Disease Service at the New Jersey Department of Health revealed that 2 fresh mullets purchased by the patients' neighbor at a local Asian market were used to prepare the fesikh. The mother salt-cured and fermented the mullet, leaving the fish uneviscerated and wrapped in plastic in the kitchen for 20 days at ambient temperature. The mother confirmed that she previously used the same method of preparation in Egypt with no deviation in techniques or steps.\n\nThese cases illustrate the importance of early recognition and treatment of botulism. Botulism can be fatal, typically from respiratory failure, and treatment delays can result in increased mortality and worsened overall outcomes (6). These cases also highlight the role of uneviscerated, salt-cured fish dishes as potential vehicles for foodborne botulism. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous in marine environments, and traditional methods of home preparation for these dishes might support conditions that are favorable for toxin production (that is, anaerobic conditions) (2). Neither of these patients had previously heard of botulism. Risk communication via public awareness campaigns, as has been conducted by the Egyptian Ministry of Health to discourage fesikh consumption, might be indicated in the USA; engagement with Egyptian communities in the USA might provide insights into additional prevention strategies to decrease the risk for foodborne botulism from fesikh and other uneviscerated, salt-cured fish products.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Therefore, with the exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, the FDA considers uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\n\nThese products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBotulism - USA (06): caviar, risk, recall 20190924.6692113\nBotulism - USA (05): (MD) 20190610.6511664\nBotulism - USA (04): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20190521.6479177\nBotulism - USA (03): (NYC) home-canned peas 20190315.6367720\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) fermented whale flipper 20190206.6303507\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug related 20190103.6241364\n2018\n----\nBotulism - Americas: canned corn, risk, recall 20181213.6208236\nBotulism - USA (08): (CA) 2017, MALDI-TOF MS 20181102.6123995\nBotulism - USA (07): cheese dip, risk, recall 20180804.5946643\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180709.5895187\nBotulism - USA (02): (AK) 20180323.5706323\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, injection drug-related 20180214.5628631\n2017\n----\nBotulism - USA (13): (AK) 20170930.5349662\nBotulism - USA (12): (NY) nitrogen-infused coffee, risk, alert, recall 20170920.5329208\nBotulism - USA (11): (NM) wound, injection drug related 20170719.5189504\nBotulism - USA (10): (CA) nacho cheese, type A toxin, unrelated 2nd death 20170525.5060186\nBotulism - USA (09): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese conf., fatal 20170523.5056161\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) gas station food, RFI 20170508.5021002\nBotulism - USA (05): deer antler herbal tea, FDA recall 20170507.5018201\nBotulism - USA (04): (CA) deer antler tea 20170429.5003486\nBotulism - USA (03): (TX) wound, drug-related, 2005-2015 20170427.4999639\nBotulism - USA (02): (CA) satay, risk, recall 20170420.4982801\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, non-drug-related 20170402.4942916\n.................................................ll/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "1008-09-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-10-25 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1992-03-15 00:00:00", "1991-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Jersey", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Silver Spring", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cairo", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "Weber JT", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW JERSEY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6774695", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Botulism, avian - USA): (CA) gulls, type A"}, {"archive_id": "6696626", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Infant botulism - USA (04): (TX)"}, {"archive_id": "6692113", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - USA (06): caviar, risk, recall"}, {"archive_id": "6679903", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - France: outdated soup"}, {"archive_id": "6659715", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - Spain: canned tuna, alert, recall"}, {"archive_id": "6635749", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - Canada (03): salmon caviar, risk, recall"}, {"archive_id": "6618830", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Infant botulism - USA (03): (TX)"}, {"archive_id": "6571003", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Infant botulism - USA (02): (TX) more cases"}, {"archive_id": "6569674", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Infant botulism - USA: (TX)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6569674", "date": "2019-03-25 20:17:46", "main_text": "BOTULISM - CANADA (02): BREWED COFFEE, RISK, RECALL\n***************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 21 Mar 2019\nSource: Castanet [edited]\nhttps://www.castanet.net/edition/news-story-252136-1-.htm\n\n\nA botulism scare has forced the recall of a local [British Columbia] coffee company's product.

Both cases were hospitalized but have now been discharged following treatment.\n\nFoodborne botulism, caused by eating food that was improperly processed or held at improper temperatures, is rare but potentially fatal if not diagnosed rapidly and treated with antitoxin. _Clostridium botulinum_ is the bacterium that produces botulinum toxins.\n\nThe suspected source is a sandwich eaten at a snack bar in Francisco Alves, a municipality in the state of Parana. The children's symptoms began 24 Nov 2018 in the morning. They were treated at a hospital in Francisco Alves before being transferred to Umuarama, a city in Parana. They reacted well to the treatment and were discharged 27 Nov 2018.\n\nOfficials inspected the snack bar and suppliers of the raw materials used in the snacks and collected samples of the food, which were sent for analysis. Results from the laboratory reports are pending to determine botulism and which food was responsible for the contamination.\n\nAuthorities stopped operations at the venue where the children ate after finding issues with the sanitary license and improper storage of food. Another place, where cheese used in preparation of snacks was handled, was also banned due to hygiene problems and lack of a license and authorization for such activity.\n\nFood botulism occurs after ingestion of items contaminated with preformed botulinum toxin. The incubation period can range from 4 hours to 8 days, with an average of 12-36 hours. The higher the toxin concentration in the food ingested, the shorter the incubation period. Symptoms vary but include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, difficulty swallowing and breathing, paralysis, and blurred vision.\n\nAnother type is infant botulism, which occurs mostly in those under 6 months of age related to ingestion of bacterial spores, and the toxin is formed in situ. Four infants in Texas recently developed botulism poisoning after being given pacifiers containing or dipped in honey.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is a review of botulism in Brazil:\n\nRowlands RE, Ristori CA, Lopes GI, et al.: Botulism in Brazil, 2000-2008: epidemiology, clinical findings, and laboratorial diagnosis.

We describe the findings of a laboratorial investigation of 117 suspected cases of botulism reported to the surveillance system in Brazil from January 2000 to October 2008. Data on the number and type of samples analyzed, type of toxins identified, reporting of the number of botulism cases, and transmission sources are discussed. A total of 193 clinical samples and 81 food samples were analyzed for detection and identification of the botulism neurotoxin.

Data on the number and type of samples analyzed, type of toxins identified, reporting of the number of botulism cases, and transmission sources are discussed. A total of 193 clinical samples and 81 food samples were analyzed for detection and identification of the botulism neurotoxin. Among the clinical samples, 22 (11.4%) presented the toxin (9 type A, 5 type AB, and 8 with an unidentified type); in food samples, 8 (9.9%) were positive for the toxin (5 type A, 1 type AB, and 2 with an unidentified type). Of the 38 cases of suspected botulism in Brazil, 27 were confirmed by a mouse bioassay. Laboratorial botulism diagnosis is an important procedure to elucidate cases, especially food-borne botulism, to confirm clinical diagnosis and to identify toxins in food, helping sanitary control measures.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nParana, Brazil: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3985]\nSee Also\nBotulism - Brazil: (PE, SP) 20180208.5606256\n2012\n----\nBotulism - Brazil (02): (SP) sausage, pickled corn, alert, recall 20120824.1261258\nBotulism - Brazil: (PR) sausage, recall 20120305.1060430\n2011\n----\nBotulism - Brazil: (SC) sausage 20110407.1090\n2009\n----\nBotulism - Brazil (02): (SP) jilo, not eggplant 20091109.3879\nBotulism - Brazil: (SP) canned eggplant 20091108.3877\n2006\n----\nBotulism, fatal - Brazil (Ceara)(02) 20061230.3652\nBotulism, fatal - Brazil (Ceara) 20061227.3628\n.................................................sb/ll/tw/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-04-06 00:00:00", "2018-11-24 00:00:00", "2018-11-27 00:00:00", "2010-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2006-03-15 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Parana", "country": "Argentina"}, {"location": "Botulism - Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Sao Paulo", "country": "Brazil"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "Brazil"}, {"location": "Umuarama", "country": "Brazil"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6208236", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - Americas: canned corn, risk, recall", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6208236", "date": "2018-12-03 20:07:41", "main_text": "BOTULISM - BRAZIL (02): (PARANA) SANDWICH, CHILDREN\n****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 1 Dec 2018\nSource: Food Safety News [edited]\nhttps://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/12/foodborne-botulism-suspected-in-two-children/\n\n\nTwo girls, aged 4 and 6, have contracted botulism in the Brazilian state of Parana.

The Food Administration has been involved in the case since Sunday morning [17 Jun 2018]. It is normal for the Board of Patient Safety to involve the Food Administration in cases of suspected food.\n\nThe Danish Food Agency has taken samples of the leftover food that the individuals ate and they are now being analyzed. The result is expected in about 5 days. The information obtained suggests that the source of infection should be found in a food that only the poisoned patients have ate.\n\nManufactured foods are basically very safe in relation to botulism, as pH and salt content are controlled in production. Cases of botulism are very rare in Denmark.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The copyrighted website https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2018/06/22/Foodborne-botulism-outbreak-at-private-party-in-Denmark# reports that there are 6 cases and one possible case among 11 individuals who attended a private dinner in the town of Sonderborg on 15 Jun 2018. The suspected vehicle of the intoxication is not yet stated. ProMED would appreciate more information regarding this outbreak.\n\nThe paralytic intoxication botulism, or sausage poisoning as it was originally termed, is caused by one of the neurotoxins produced by (primarily) _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria in foods not properly prepared. It was first seriously studied following an outbreak in Wildbad, Germany in 1793. The outbreak involved 13 people, 6 of whom died, and was associated with consumption of a locally produced blood sausage. Following this outbreak, the number of reported cases of sausage poisoning rapidly increased, prompting a study of the disease by local health officer Justinius Kerner (1829). He described 230 cases, most of which were attributed to the consumption of sausage.

Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27 per cent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.\n\n\"In traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5).\n\n\"Early diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 per cent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 per cent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3).\"\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Beller M.

Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27 per cent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.\n\n\"In traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5).\n\n\"Early diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 per cent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 per cent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3).\"\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Beller M.

Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27 per cent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.\n\n\"In traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5).\n\n\"Early diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 per cent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 per cent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3).\"\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Beller M.

I rang the vet who came to do a post-mortem, and in that time another 2 had fallen.\n\n\"In just a few minutes, the floppy cow had died. It continued like that, and by Monday [4 Dec 2017], 38 were dead. I do not think anything can prepare you for it; it was absolutely horrific. Our cows are like pets to us, and to see them in such a state is heartbreaking.\"\n\nSome cows were injected with an anti-inflammatory and penicillin, but [the farmer] said it seemed to accelerate the disease.\n\nHe added: \"We tried to care for the cows by feeding them charcoal and even burnt toast to try to attempt to absorb the toxin, but with no success.\"\n\nOther cows which showed advanced signs were euthanised, with only one cow in the affected high-yielding herd, a Montbeliarde cross, remaining unscathed.\n\nDry cows and the low yielders, which were housed about 15ft [about 5 meters] away at the other side of the shed were not affected.\n\nTests on feed have all come back negative, but [the farm owner] said it was likely silage fed to cows had been contaminated with dead game or poultry birds, which are prolific carriers of the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, which causes botulism.\n\nIn total, [the farmer] who farms in partnership with his father, lost 47 high yielding milkers and 3 bulling heifers out of the 80-strong herd. He is now working with his vet to source a vaccine for his remaining cattle.\n\n[The farmer] said: \"Speaking to a lot of our friends and colleagues, this is extremely rare, but it could happen to anyone, and awareness is vital. My advice would be to vaccinate. I will be vaccinating all my cattle from now on.\"\n\n[Byline: Olivia Midgley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Following a marked increase in the reported incidence of suspected cattle botulism in England, Wales and Ireland since 2003, the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) in UK's Food Safety Agency, set in 2004 an ad-hoc Group on Botulism in Cattle. The group submitted its final report in 2006. One of their main recommendations involved the main source of the toxin, considered to be broiler litter, including carcasses of birds that have died during production. It was speculated that even small fragments of carcasses transferred onto pasture by scavenger animals, such as foxes, dogs or crows, can pose a risk to grazing cattle.\n\nOne of their points of discussion was the official status of the disease in cattle. They concluded: \"Reporting of botulism outbreaks in cattle is conducted on a voluntary basis. This may result in under-reporting of the disease. However, clinically affected animals are likely to be investigated, and, based on the low apparent risk to humans presented by toxin types C and D, which predominate in recent UK cattle outbreaks, statutory notification does not currently appear to be merited.\"\n\nThey further said that if litter has been spread on silage ground, it is advisable to raise the cutting blades so that the grass is cut less close to the ground. This will reduce the risk of decaying matter being included in the silage cut. Washings from poultry houses and yards should be collected in tanks rather than be allowed to flow onto adjacent land. Annexes 4 and 5 of the report present guidance to farmers on methods for the control of botulism in cattle. Vaccination is recommended, while indicating that it \"should not be used as a substitute for preventing exposure of cattle to broiler litter that may contain carcasses.\"\n\nAdditional observations, conclusions, recommendations and references are available in the full report, at https://acmsf.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/mnt/drupal_data/sources/files/multimedia/pdfs/botulismincattlereport1206.pdf.\n\nFor subscribers' convenience, we provide extracts from the \"Diagnostic tests\" (for animals) chapter in the \"Botulism\" review published by The Center for Food Security & Public Health at Iowa State University (CFSPH), updated June 2010 (for the entire review, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/botulism.pdf.):\n\n\"Botulism can be difficult to diagnose, as the toxin is not always found in clinical samples or the feed. Diagnosis is often a matter of excluding other diseases. A definitive diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the feed, serum/blood, stomach, crop or intestinal contents, vomitus, feces, or tissues. The toxin can usually be found in the blood or serum only in the early stages of the disease. Botulinum toxin is typically detected with a mouse bioassay. ELISAs may also be used, but they detect both active and inactivated (such as heat treated) toxins, and false positives are possible with this test. Botulinum toxins can be typed using neutralization tests in mice.\n\n\"_Clostridium botulinum_ organisms may also be isolated from the feed. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism may be cultured from the gastrointestinal contents, feces, wounds, or other tissues. Because healthy animals can have _C. botulinum_ spores in the gastrointestinal tract, finding them in this location should be interpreted with caution [_C. botulinum_ isolation techniques are described in detail in the original document].\n\n\"Biochemical tests and the detection of volatile metabolic products using gas-liquid chromatography are helpful in identification.

The group submitted its final report in 2006. One of their main recommendations involved the main source of the toxin, considered to be broiler litter, including carcasses of birds that have died during production. It was speculated that even small fragments of carcasses transferred onto pasture by scavenger animals, such as foxes, dogs or crows, can pose a risk to grazing cattle.\n\nOne of their points of discussion was the official status of the disease in cattle. They concluded: \"Reporting of botulism outbreaks in cattle is conducted on a voluntary basis. This may result in under-reporting of the disease. However, clinically affected animals are likely to be investigated, and, based on the low apparent risk to humans presented by toxin types C and D, which predominate in recent UK cattle outbreaks, statutory notification does not currently appear to be merited.\"\n\nThey further said that if litter has been spread on silage ground, it is advisable to raise the cutting blades so that the grass is cut less close to the ground. This will reduce the risk of decaying matter being included in the silage cut. Washings from poultry houses and yards should be collected in tanks rather than be allowed to flow onto adjacent land. Annexes 4 and 5 of the report present guidance to farmers on methods for the control of botulism in cattle. Vaccination is recommended, while indicating that it \"should not be used as a substitute for preventing exposure of cattle to broiler litter that may contain carcasses.\"\n\nAdditional observations, conclusions, recommendations and references are available in the full report, at https://acmsf.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/mnt/drupal_data/sources/files/multimedia/pdfs/botulismincattlereport1206.pdf.\n\nFor subscribers' convenience, we provide extracts from the \"Diagnostic tests\" (for animals) chapter in the \"Botulism\" review published by The Center for Food Security & Public Health at Iowa State University (CFSPH), updated June 2010 (for the entire review, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/botulism.pdf.):\n\n\"Botulism can be difficult to diagnose, as the toxin is not always found in clinical samples or the feed. Diagnosis is often a matter of excluding other diseases. A definitive diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the feed, serum/blood, stomach, crop or intestinal contents, vomitus, feces, or tissues. The toxin can usually be found in the blood or serum only in the early stages of the disease. Botulinum toxin is typically detected with a mouse bioassay. ELISAs may also be used, but they detect both active and inactivated (such as heat treated) toxins, and false positives are possible with this test. Botulinum toxins can be typed using neutralization tests in mice.\n\n\"_Clostridium botulinum_ organisms may also be isolated from the feed. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism may be cultured from the gastrointestinal contents, feces, wounds, or other tissues.

The group submitted its final report in 2006. One of their main recommendations involved the main source of the toxin, considered to be broiler litter, including carcasses of birds that have died during production. It was speculated that even small fragments of carcasses transferred onto pasture by scavenger animals, such as foxes, dogs or crows, can pose a risk to grazing cattle.\n\nOne of their points of discussion was the official status of the disease in cattle. They concluded: \"Reporting of botulism outbreaks in cattle is conducted on a voluntary basis. This may result in under-reporting of the disease.

This will reduce the risk of decaying matter being included in the silage cut. Washings from poultry houses and yards should be collected in tanks rather than be allowed to flow onto adjacent land.

Vaccination is recommended, while indicating that it \"should not be used as a substitute for preventing exposure of cattle to broiler litter that may contain carcasses.\"\n\nAdditional observations, conclusions, recommendations and references are available in the full report, at https://acmsf.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/mnt/drupal_data/sources/files/multimedia/pdfs/botulismincattlereport1206.pdf.\n\nFor subscribers' convenience, we provide extracts from the \"Diagnostic tests\" (for animals) chapter in the \"Botulism\" review published by The Center for Food Security & Public Health at Iowa State University (CFSPH), updated June 2010 (for the entire review, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/botulism.pdf.):\n\n\"Botulism can be difficult to diagnose, as the toxin is not always found in clinical samples or the feed. Diagnosis is often a matter of excluding other diseases. A definitive diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the feed, serum/blood, stomach, crop or intestinal contents, vomitus, feces, or tissues. The toxin can usually be found in the blood or serum only in the early stages of the disease. Botulinum toxin is typically detected with a mouse bioassay. ELISAs may also be used, but they detect both active and inactivated (such as heat treated) toxins, and false positives are possible with this test. Botulinum toxins can be typed using neutralization tests in mice.\n\n\"_Clostridium botulinum_ organisms may also be isolated from the feed. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism may be cultured from the gastrointestinal contents, feces, wounds, or other tissues. Because healthy animals can have _C. botulinum_ spores in the gastrointestinal tract, finding them in this location should be interpreted with caution [_C. botulinum_ isolation techniques are described in detail in the original document].\n\n\"Biochemical tests and the detection of volatile metabolic products using gas-liquid chromatography are helpful in identification. The metabolic patterns and other characteristics vary with the strain/group. Definitive identification is by demonstration of the toxin. Molecular techniques can be used for the genetic characterization of _C. botulinum_ and may be helpful in determining the source of an outbreak.\n\n\"Serology is not used routinely in diagnosis, but antibodies to botulinum toxin have been reported in some animals that recovered, including horses, cattle, and a dog.\"\n\nThe preliminary suspicion of botulism in cattle may be based upon the very typical symptomatology.

It continued like that, and by Monday [4 Dec 2017], 38 were dead. I do not think anything can prepare you for it; it was absolutely horrific. Our cows are like pets to us, and to see them in such a state is heartbreaking.\"\n\nSome cows were injected with an anti-inflammatory and penicillin, but [the farmer] said it seemed to accelerate the disease.\n\nHe added: \"We tried to care for the cows by feeding them charcoal and even burnt toast to try to attempt to absorb the toxin, but with no success.\"\n\nOther cows which showed advanced signs were euthanised, with only one cow in the affected high-yielding herd, a Montbeliarde cross, remaining unscathed.\n\nDry cows and the low yielders, which were housed about 15ft [about 5 meters] away at the other side of the shed were not affected.\n\nTests on feed have all come back negative, but [the farm owner] said it was likely silage fed to cows had been contaminated with dead game or poultry birds, which are prolific carriers of the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, which causes botulism.\n\nIn total, [the farmer] who farms in partnership with his father, lost 47 high yielding milkers and 3 bulling heifers out of the 80-strong herd. He is now working with his vet to source a vaccine for his remaining cattle.\n\n[The farmer] said: \"Speaking to a lot of our friends and colleagues, this is extremely rare, but it could happen to anyone, and awareness is vital. My advice would be to vaccinate. I will be vaccinating all my cattle from now on.\"\n\n[Byline: Olivia Midgley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Following a marked increase in the reported incidence of suspected cattle botulism in England, Wales and Ireland since 2003, the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) in UK's Food Safety Agency, set in 2004 an ad-hoc Group on Botulism in Cattle. The group submitted its final report in 2006. One of their main recommendations involved the main source of the toxin, considered to be broiler litter, including carcasses of birds that have died during production. It was speculated that even small fragments of carcasses transferred onto pasture by scavenger animals, such as foxes, dogs or crows, can pose a risk to grazing cattle.\n\nOne of their points of discussion was the official status of the disease in cattle. They concluded: \"Reporting of botulism outbreaks in cattle is conducted on a voluntary basis. This may result in under-reporting of the disease. However, clinically affected animals are likely to be investigated, and, based on the low apparent risk to humans presented by toxin types C and D, which predominate in recent UK cattle outbreaks, statutory notification does not currently appear to be merited.\"\n\nThey further said that if litter has been spread on silage ground, it is advisable to raise the cutting blades so that the grass is cut less close to the ground. This will reduce the risk of decaying matter being included in the silage cut. Washings from poultry houses and yards should be collected in tanks rather than be allowed to flow onto adjacent land. Annexes 4 and 5 of the report present guidance to farmers on methods for the control of botulism in cattle. Vaccination is recommended, while indicating that it \"should not be used as a substitute for preventing exposure of cattle to broiler litter that may contain carcasses.\"\n\nAdditional observations, conclusions, recommendations and references are available in the full report, at https://acmsf.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/mnt/drupal_data/sources/files/multimedia/pdfs/botulismincattlereport1206.pdf.\n\nFor subscribers' convenience, we provide extracts from the \"Diagnostic tests\" (for animals) chapter in the \"Botulism\" review published by The Center for Food Security & Public Health at Iowa State University (CFSPH), updated June 2010 (for the entire review, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/botulism.pdf.):\n\n\"Botulism can be difficult to diagnose, as the toxin is not always found in clinical samples or the feed. Diagnosis is often a matter of excluding other diseases. A definitive diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the feed, serum/blood, stomach, crop or intestinal contents, vomitus, feces, or tissues. The toxin can usually be found in the blood or serum only in the early stages of the disease. Botulinum toxin is typically detected with a mouse bioassay. ELISAs may also be used, but they detect both active and inactivated (such as heat treated) toxins, and false positives are possible with this test. Botulinum toxins can be typed using neutralization tests in mice.\n\n\"_Clostridium botulinum_ organisms may also be isolated from the feed. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism may be cultured from the gastrointestinal contents, feces, wounds, or other tissues. Because healthy animals can have _C. botulinum_ spores in the gastrointestinal tract, finding them in this location should be interpreted with caution [_C. botulinum_ isolation techniques are described in detail in the original document].\n\n\"Biochemical tests and the detection of volatile metabolic products using gas-liquid chromatography are helpful in identification. The metabolic patterns and other characteristics vary with the strain/group. Definitive identification is by demonstration of the toxin. Molecular techniques can be used for the genetic characterization of _C. botulinum_ and may be helpful in determining the source of an outbreak.\n\n\"Serology is not used routinely in diagnosis, but antibodies to botulinum toxin have been reported in some animals that recovered, including horses, cattle, and a dog.\"\n\nThe preliminary suspicion of botulism in cattle may be based upon the very typical symptomatology. However, laboratory confirmation is required to exclude other possible etiologies, such as ionophores [polyether compounds] intoxication.\n\nBotulism in animals is not notifiable in the UK, nor in most countries. Hence, the actual number of events is not available. The UK 2006 report, mentioned above, addressed (in table 1) 67 incidents, identified in cattle in England and Wales during the years 2003-2005. The authors advised farmers to report any suspicion immediately to their practitioners. Botulism is not included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nLancashire, England, United Kingdom: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/913]\nSee Also\n2014\n----\nBotulism, bovine - UK: (Wales) susp, RFI 20140523.2492126\n2006\n----\nBotulism, bovine - UK: precautionary guidelines 20061208.3463\nBotulism, bovine - UK (England) 20060925.2743\nBotulism, bovine - UK (Scotland) 20060717.1962\n2003\n----\nBotulism, bovine - Ireland: poultry litter origin 20030701.1623\n.................................................sb/arn/msp/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2003-03-15 00:00:00", "2004-03-15 00:00:00", "2006-03-15 00:00:00", "2010-06-15 00:00:00", "2006-03-15 00:00:00", "2006-03-15 00:00:00", "2003-03-15 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "England", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Cattle", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "Ireland", "country": "Ireland"}, {"location": "Scotland", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "Wales", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "Lancashire", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "United Kingdom", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5493333", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Botulism, equine - USA: (CA) recovery", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5493333", "date": "2017-08-18 11:38:07", "main_text": "INFANT BOTULISM - USA (04): COMMENT\n***********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 18 Aug 2017\nSource: GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network) [edited]\n\n\n[re: Infant botulism - USA]\n---------------------------\nRates of foodborne botulism in the United States have declined somewhat since the 1990s, while those of infant botulism continue to increase [1].

Botulism is believed to have killed an Inukjuak woman in her 50s on 8 Jul 2017 and affected the woman's daughter, who was treated in Montreal hospital and later released. Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis and in serious cases, death.\n\n\"We had a call from the health centre that morning, and the doctor on call had spoken to family members to understand what had happened,\" said Dr Marie Rochette, coordinator of infectious disease prevention at Nunavik's public health department.\n\nHealth care workers identified beluga meat, which was sent to Ottawa for testing and came back positive for _Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium that causes botulism. Officials are still waiting on the results of 2 other samples of beluga meat. The health centre in Inukjuak reported treating other patients with symptoms of botulism, although it remains unclear if those patients ate the same beluga meat and no other cases were confirmed.\n\nThe meat in question came from belugas hunted near Umiujaq at the end of June 2017, Rochette said, when temperatures along the Hudson Bay coast rose as high as 28 deg C [82.4 deg F]. \"Warm temperatures can be the cause of the [bacterial growth],\" Rochette said. Public health issued a warning to Inukjuamiut and anyone else who had beluga meat, fat, or oil from that harvest to throw out the products. The affected meat appeared to be limited to the whale's inside flesh, however; a number of people ate maqtaq [also called muktuk, it is a traditional Inuit/Eskimo meal of frozen whale skin and blubber - Mod.LL] and didn't fall ill, Rochette said.\n\nDespite the tragic death of the Inukjuak woman, cases of botulism remain rare in the region. Over the last decade, Nunavik has seen anywhere between zero and 3 cases of foodborne botulism a year, with no other recent deaths. \"But with warming temperatures, these are conditions for the bacteria to grow,\" Rochette said. \"That's why we are warning hunters to be very careful to put [harvested] meat on ice or in a cooler right away.\"\n\nSymptoms of botulism can include:\n- fatigue, weakness and dizziness;\n- blurred or double vision;\n- dryness in the mouth, throat and nose and difficulty in swallowing and speaking;\n- headache;\n- nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and, less commonly, diarrhea; and\n- paralysis that starts in the shoulders and arms and moves down the body.\n\nSymptoms of foodborne botulism generally begin 12 to 36 hours after consuming contaminated food, but onset can begin as soon as 6 hours after exposure or as long as 10 days later. Rochette urges any Nunavimmiut who experiences those symptoms to go to their local health centre immediately.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Rogers]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The exact number of potential botulism cases referred to is not stated.\n\nThe following publication summarizes 2 decades of botulism in Canada, a great majority occurring due to type E in the native population, associated with ingestion of food products from marine sources:\n\nLeclair D, Fung J, Isaac-Renton JL, et al. Foodborne botulism in Canada, 1985-2005. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013; 19(6): 961-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3713816/.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nDuring 1985-2005, a total of 91 laboratory-confirmed outbreaks of foodborne botulism occurred in Canada; these outbreaks involved 205 cases and 11 deaths. Of the outbreaks, 75 (86.2 percent) were caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ type E, followed by types A (7/8.1 percent) and B (5/5.7 percent). Approximately 85 percent of the outbreaks occurred in Alaska Native communities, particularly the Inuit of Nunavik in northern Quebec and the First Nations population of the Pacific coast of British Columbia. These populations were predominantly exposed to type E botulinum toxin through the consumption of traditionally prepared marine mammal and fish products. 2 botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods. A total of 3 affected pregnant women delivered healthy infants. Improvements in botulism case identification and early treatment have resulted in a reduction in the case-fatality rate in Canada.\n\nThe following was abstracted from a 2001 CDC report on foodborne botulism in the native American population in Alaska and underscores changes in the fermentation techniques which appear to have increased the risks of this intoxication (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5032a2.htm):\n\nThis report illustrates how the use of nontraditional fermentation methods is associated with foodborne botulism in Alaska. Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska Natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27 percent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.\n\nIn traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5). Although a plastic container was not used in this outbreak, the beaver tail and paw were fermented in a closed rice sack and stored in a warm area.\n\nEarly diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 percent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 percent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Beller M.

Approximately 27 percent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.\n\nIn traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5). Although a plastic container was not used in this outbreak, the beaver tail and paw were fermented in a closed rice sack and stored in a warm area.\n\nEarly diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 percent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 percent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Beller M.

Botulism is believed to have killed an Inukjuak woman in her 50s on 8 Jul 2017 and affected the woman's daughter, who was treated in Montreal hospital and later released. Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis and in serious cases, death.\n\n\"We had a call from the health centre that morning, and the doctor on call had spoken to family members to understand what had happened,\" said Dr Marie Rochette, coordinator of infectious disease prevention at Nunavik's public health department.\n\nHealth care workers identified beluga meat, which was sent to Ottawa for testing and came back positive for _Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium that causes botulism. Officials are still waiting on the results of 2 other samples of beluga meat. The health centre in Inukjuak reported treating other patients with symptoms of botulism, although it remains unclear if those patients ate the same beluga meat and no other cases were confirmed.\n\nThe meat in question came from belugas hunted near Umiujaq at the end of June 2017, Rochette said, when temperatures along the Hudson Bay coast rose as high as 28 deg C [82.4 deg F]. \"Warm temperatures can be the cause of the [bacterial growth],\" Rochette said. Public health issued a warning to Inukjuamiut and anyone else who had beluga meat, fat, or oil from that harvest to throw out the products. The affected meat appeared to be limited to the whale's inside flesh, however; a number of people ate maqtaq [also called muktuk, it is a traditional Inuit/Eskimo meal of frozen whale skin and blubber - Mod.LL] and didn't fall ill, Rochette said.\n\nDespite the tragic death of the Inukjuak woman, cases of botulism remain rare in the region. Over the last decade, Nunavik has seen anywhere between zero and 3 cases of foodborne botulism a year, with no other recent deaths. \"But with warming temperatures, these are conditions for the bacteria to grow,\" Rochette said. \"That's why we are warning hunters to be very careful to put [harvested] meat on ice or in a cooler right away.\"\n\nSymptoms of botulism can include:\n- fatigue, weakness and dizziness;\n- blurred or double vision;\n- dryness in the mouth, throat and nose and difficulty in swallowing and speaking;\n- headache;\n- nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and, less commonly, diarrhea; and\n- paralysis that starts in the shoulders and arms and moves down the body.\n\nSymptoms of foodborne botulism generally begin 12 to 36 hours after consuming contaminated food, but onset can begin as soon as 6 hours after exposure or as long as 10 days later. Rochette urges any Nunavimmiut who experiences those symptoms to go to their local health centre immediately.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Rogers]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The exact number of potential botulism cases referred to is not stated.\n\nThe following publication summarizes 2 decades of botulism in Canada, a great majority occurring due to type E in the native population, associated with ingestion of food products from marine sources:\n\nLeclair D, Fung J, Isaac-Renton JL, et al. Foodborne botulism in Canada, 1985-2005. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013; 19(6): 961-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3713816/.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nDuring 1985-2005, a total of 91 laboratory-confirmed outbreaks of foodborne botulism occurred in Canada; these outbreaks involved 205 cases and 11 deaths. Of the outbreaks, 75 (86.2 percent) were caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ type E, followed by types A (7/8.1 percent) and B (5/5.7 percent). Approximately 85 percent of the outbreaks occurred in Alaska Native communities, particularly the Inuit of Nunavik in northern Quebec and the First Nations population of the Pacific coast of British Columbia. These populations were predominantly exposed to type E botulinum toxin through the consumption of traditionally prepared marine mammal and fish products. 2 botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods. A total of 3 affected pregnant women delivered healthy infants. Improvements in botulism case identification and early treatment have resulted in a reduction in the case-fatality rate in Canada.\n\nThe following was abstracted from a 2001 CDC report on foodborne botulism in the native American population in Alaska and underscores changes in the fermentation techniques which appear to have increased the risks of this intoxication (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5032a2.htm):\n\nThis report illustrates how the use of nontraditional fermentation methods is associated with foodborne botulism in Alaska. Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska Natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2).

Botulism is believed to have killed an Inukjuak woman in her 50s on 8 Jul 2017 and affected the woman's daughter, who was treated in Montreal hospital and later released. Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis and in serious cases, death.\n\n\"We had a call from the health centre that morning, and the doctor on call had spoken to family members to understand what had happened,\" said Dr Marie Rochette, coordinator of infectious disease prevention at Nunavik's public health department.\n\nHealth care workers identified beluga meat, which was sent to Ottawa for testing and came back positive for _Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium that causes botulism. Officials are still waiting on the results of 2 other samples of beluga meat. The health centre in Inukjuak reported treating other patients with symptoms of botulism, although it remains unclear if those patients ate the same beluga meat and no other cases were confirmed.\n\nThe meat in question came from belugas hunted near Umiujaq at the end of June 2017, Rochette said, when temperatures along the Hudson Bay coast rose as high as 28 deg C [82.4 deg F]. \"Warm temperatures can be the cause of the [bacterial growth],\" Rochette said. Public health issued a warning to Inukjuamiut and anyone else who had beluga meat, fat, or oil from that harvest to throw out the products. The affected meat appeared to be limited to the whale's inside flesh, however; a number of people ate maqtaq [also called muktuk, it is a traditional Inuit/Eskimo meal of frozen whale skin and blubber - Mod.LL] and didn't fall ill, Rochette said.\n\nDespite the tragic death of the Inukjuak woman, cases of botulism remain rare in the region. Over the last decade, Nunavik has seen anywhere between zero and 3 cases of foodborne botulism a year, with no other recent deaths. \"But with warming temperatures, these are conditions for the bacteria to grow,\" Rochette said. \"That's why we are warning hunters to be very careful to put [harvested] meat on ice or in a cooler right away.\"\n\nSymptoms of botulism can include:\n- fatigue, weakness and dizziness;\n- blurred or double vision;\n- dryness in the mouth, throat and nose and difficulty in swallowing and speaking;\n- headache;\n- nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and, less commonly, diarrhea; and\n- paralysis that starts in the shoulders and arms and moves down the body.\n\nSymptoms of foodborne botulism generally begin 12 to 36 hours after consuming contaminated food, but onset can begin as soon as 6 hours after exposure or as long as 10 days later. Rochette urges any Nunavimmiut who experiences those symptoms to go to their local health centre immediately.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Rogers]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The exact number of potential botulism cases referred to is not stated.\n\nThe following publication summarizes 2 decades of botulism in Canada, a great majority occurring due to type E in the native population, associated with ingestion of food products from marine sources:\n\nLeclair D, Fung J, Isaac-Renton JL, et al. Foodborne botulism in Canada, 1985-2005. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013; 19(6): 961-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3713816/.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nDuring 1985-2005, a total of 91 laboratory-confirmed outbreaks of foodborne botulism occurred in Canada; these outbreaks involved 205 cases and 11 deaths. Of the outbreaks, 75 (86.2 percent) were caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ type E, followed by types A (7/8.1 percent) and B (5/5.7 percent). Approximately 85 percent of the outbreaks occurred in Alaska Native communities, particularly the Inuit of Nunavik in northern Quebec and the First Nations population of the Pacific coast of British Columbia. These populations were predominantly exposed to type E botulinum toxin through the consumption of traditionally prepared marine mammal and fish products. 2 botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods. A total of 3 affected pregnant women delivered healthy infants. Improvements in botulism case identification and early treatment have resulted in a reduction in the case-fatality rate in Canada.\n\nThe following was abstracted from a 2001 CDC report on foodborne botulism in the native American population in Alaska and underscores changes in the fermentation techniques which appear to have increased the risks of this intoxication (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5032a2.htm):\n\nThis report illustrates how the use of nontraditional fermentation methods is associated with foodborne botulism in Alaska. Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska Natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27 percent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.\n\nIn traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5). Although a plastic container was not used in this outbreak, the beaver tail and paw were fermented in a closed rice sack and stored in a warm area.\n\nEarly diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 percent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 percent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Beller M.

Botulism is believed to have killed an Inukjuak woman in her 50s on 8 Jul 2017 and affected the woman's daughter, who was treated in Montreal hospital and later released. Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis and in serious cases, death.\n\n\"We had a call from the health centre that morning, and the doctor on call had spoken to family members to understand what had happened,\" said Dr Marie Rochette, coordinator of infectious disease prevention at Nunavik's public health department.\n\nHealth care workers identified beluga meat, which was sent to Ottawa for testing and came back positive for _Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium that causes botulism. Officials are still waiting on the results of 2 other samples of beluga meat. The health centre in Inukjuak reported treating other patients with symptoms of botulism, although it remains unclear if those patients ate the same beluga meat and no other cases were confirmed.\n\nThe meat in question came from belugas hunted near Umiujaq at the end of June 2017, Rochette said, when temperatures along the Hudson Bay coast rose as high as 28 deg C [82.4 deg F]. \"Warm temperatures can be the cause of the [bacterial growth],\" Rochette said. Public health issued a warning to Inukjuamiut and anyone else who had beluga meat, fat, or oil from that harvest to throw out the products. The affected meat appeared to be limited to the whale's inside flesh, however; a number of people ate maqtaq [also called muktuk, it is a traditional Inuit/Eskimo meal of frozen whale skin and blubber - Mod.LL] and didn't fall ill, Rochette said.\n\nDespite the tragic death of the Inukjuak woman, cases of botulism remain rare in the region. Over the last decade, Nunavik has seen anywhere between zero and 3 cases of foodborne botulism a year, with no other recent deaths. \"But with warming temperatures, these are conditions for the bacteria to grow,\" Rochette said. \"That's why we are warning hunters to be very careful to put [harvested] meat on ice or in a cooler right away.\"\n\nSymptoms of botulism can include:\n- fatigue, weakness and dizziness;\n- blurred or double vision;\n- dryness in the mouth, throat and nose and difficulty in swallowing and speaking;\n- headache;\n- nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and, less commonly, diarrhea; and\n- paralysis that starts in the shoulders and arms and moves down the body.\n\nSymptoms of foodborne botulism generally begin 12 to 36 hours after consuming contaminated food, but onset can begin as soon as 6 hours after exposure or as long as 10 days later. Rochette urges any Nunavimmiut who experiences those symptoms to go to their local health centre immediately.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Rogers]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The exact number of potential botulism cases referred to is not stated.\n\nThe following publication summarizes 2 decades of botulism in Canada, a great majority occurring due to type E in the native population, associated with ingestion of food products from marine sources:\n\nLeclair D, Fung J, Isaac-Renton JL, et al. Foodborne botulism in Canada, 1985-2005. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013; 19(6): 961-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3713816/.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nDuring 1985-2005, a total of 91 laboratory-confirmed outbreaks of foodborne botulism occurred in Canada; these outbreaks involved 205 cases and 11 deaths. Of the outbreaks, 75 (86.2 percent) were caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ type E, followed by types A (7/8.1 percent) and B (5/5.7 percent). Approximately 85 percent of the outbreaks occurred in Alaska Native communities, particularly the Inuit of Nunavik in northern Quebec and the First Nations population of the Pacific coast of British Columbia. These populations were predominantly exposed to type E botulinum toxin through the consumption of traditionally prepared marine mammal and fish products. 2 botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods. A total of 3 affected pregnant women delivered healthy infants. Improvements in botulism case identification and early treatment have resulted in a reduction in the case-fatality rate in Canada.\n\nThe following was abstracted from a 2001 CDC report on foodborne botulism in the native American population in Alaska and underscores changes in the fermentation techniques which appear to have increased the risks of this intoxication (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5032a2.htm):\n\nThis report illustrates how the use of nontraditional fermentation methods is associated with foodborne botulism in Alaska. Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska Natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27 percent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.\n\nIn traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5). Although a plastic container was not used in this outbreak, the beaver tail and paw were fermented in a closed rice sack and stored in a warm area.\n\nEarly diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 percent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 percent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Beller M.

Within the last month, Napa County has had 1 death from botulism related to canned goods, according to county health officials. Since 1950, the USA has seen 3 instances of human botulism outbreaks due to dairy products. In all, 46 people were affected and 2 died. The most recent was in 1993 where a commercially canned cheese sauce was contaminated after it left the factory and sickened 8 people, killing one.\n\n\"We want to remind people to properly store canned goods they purchase and if they are canning themselves to follow recommended home canning and preserving procedures so you can ensure as best as possible the safety of your canned goods,\" said Cara Mae Wooledge, public health education specialist for Napa County Public Health. Wooledge reinforced that anyone experiencing symptoms of botulism poisoning, blurry or double vision, nausea or drooping eyelids, should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Before these incidents, there had only been 1 death from foodborne botulism in the state of California in the past 2 decades, according to CDC data.\n\nOn 28 Apr 2017, the Los Angeles County Public Health Department issued a warning to residents about a deer antler tea product after one confirmed and one suspected case of botulism. The tea was recalled.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health has said that an open 5-pound bag of Gehl's Jalapeno Cheese Sauce confiscated from the Valley Oak Food and Fuel station tested positive for the botulism toxin. Gehl Foods' CEO Eric Beringause released a statement saying that \"Gehl's facilities remain safe for food production and all of our food samples continue to test negative for any contaminants. There is no recall of Gehl's nacho cheese product.\"\n\nJohnson, along with his colleague Kathleen Glass have devoted their lives to studying how to prevent botulism from growing in cheese. Glass, the associate director of the Food Research Institute, received her doctorate in the topic and has co-authored numerous papers on the subject with Johnson. Both have spent decades working out the right combinations that prevent the bacterium, _Clostridium botulinum_, from surviving or growing in cheese.\n\nGehl's cheese is in liquid form and is not pasteurized, but undergoes an \"aseptic process,\" which kills bacteria. The cheese has a shelf life of 12 months, but must be kept above [140 deg F/60 deg C] after opening and the dispenser must remain plugged in. \"If the package is unopened, it is basically sterile. If it's refrigerated, (the bacteria) can't grow. If it's kept above 140 deg F, it can't grow,\" Glass said. \"This was just an alignment of the planets that must have recontaminated it and held it at the right temperature for a long time for it to grow... It's really the perfect storm.\"\n\nBotulism is found everywhere, but sickness from the toxin the bacterium produces is rare and mostly affects infants. Botulism among adults is even rarer. Foodborne botulism is rarer still. Due to the rarity, there is a chance that the descending paralysis is misdiagnosed for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a stroke, or other medical conditions that lead to muscle weakness.\n\nAlthough it is sometimes used in medicine to treat muscle spasms or in cosmetics to treat frown lines, the botulism neurotoxin is one of the most potent and lethal substances in the world. The substance, which can fatally paralyze victims, is so dangerous that it is listed as a Category A bioterrorism agent by the CDC. Iraq was said to have produced 19 180 liters of concentrated botulinum toxin in the 1990s, according to the UN Security Council. Less than one-millionth of a gram is enough to kill the average adult.\n\nThe type A strain of botulinum toxin found in the nacho cheese is the same type that is cultivated for biological weapons. There is no antidote for botulism intoxication, but early use of an antitoxin can lessen the effects of the paralysis. Although symptoms can take anywhere between 6 hours and 10 days to appear, Johnson stated that ideally, the antitoxin should be administered within hours of eating the food to prevent the onset of paralysis. The need for a rapid response is critical in treating any cases of botulism, which is why every case is treated as a public health emergency. After the initial hospitalization on 22 Apr 2017, health officials were able to identify the source 13 days later and prevent further sale of the nacho cheese product at the Valley Oak Food and Fuel.\n\nState health officials will not release which counties have reported cases of botulism, citing patient confidentiality. Sacramento and San Joaquin counties have confirmed cases in their counties and Napa County officials have confirmed one botulism case unrelated to the nacho cheese outbreak. Solano County health official Jayleen Richards would neither confirm nor deny any reported cases of botulism in the county.\n\n[Byline: Aaron Davis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This posting underscores the rarity of cheese-associated botulism as well as confirms that the serotype of the toxin was indeed type A, the type that tends to be the most severe in degree and length of illness. The antitoxin used cannot neutralize toxin already bound to neural toxin.\n\nThis posting also alludes to a 2nd death in California, a case of botulism related to home canning and not related to the nacho cheese-related cluster. It is not stated what home-canned food was involved or whether there were other non-fatal cases.\n\nBotulism toxin has its effect at the neuromuscular junction. Mechanistically, when a motor neuron action potential depolarizes the axon terminal, acetylcholine is released from the cytosol into the synaptic cleft. When botulinum toxin (BT) is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT high selectivity for cholinergic synapses.\n\nAfter internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18147.]\nSee Also\nBotulism - USA (09): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese conf, fatal 20170523.5056161\nBotulism - USA (08): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese 20170519.5047996\nBotulism - USA (07): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese 20170512.5031065\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) gas station food, RFI 20170508.5021002\nBotulism - USA (05): deer antler herbal tea, FDA recall 20170507.5018201\nBotulism - USA (04): (CA) deer antler tea 20170429.5003486\nBotulism - USA (03): (TX) wound, drug-related, 2005-2015 20170427.4999639\nBotulism - USA (02): (CA) satay, risk, recall 20170420.4982801\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, non-drug-related 20170402.4942916\n2016\n----\nBotulism - USA (11): (NM) wound, drug-related 20161004.4535918\nBotulism - USA (10): soups, risk, recall 20160911.4480731\nBotulism - USA (09): (NM) wound, drug-related 20160716.4350262\nBotulism - USA (08): vacuum packed fish, risk, recall 20160623.4302950\nBotulism - USA (07): (MS) prison brew 20160615.4288676\nBotulism - USA (06): (NY,CA) dried salted uneviscerated fish, risk, recall 20160426.4184418\nBotulism - USA (05): vegetable soup, risk, recall 20160421.4174551\nBotulism - USA (04): (WA) fatal, conf 20160302.4062476\nBotulism - USA (03): (OH,CA) jarred pesto, 2014 20160227.4052791\nBotulism - USA (02): (WA) fatal, RFI 20160221.4037933\nBotulism - USA: (MN) uneviscerated fish, recall 20160115.3935285\n.................................................ll/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-10 00:00:00", "1950-03-15 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Solano County", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "San Joaquin", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Walnut Grove", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Gehl", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Napa County", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "CALIFORNIA", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Sacramento", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Iraq", "country": "Iraq"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5178297", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - Canada (02): (QC) whale meat", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5178297", "date": "2017-05-25 10:04:04", "main_text": "BOTULISM - USA (10): (CALIFORNIA) NACHO CHEESE, TYPE A TOXIN, UNRELATED SECOND DEATH\n************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 24 May 2017 1:17 pm PDT\nSource: The Mercury News [edited]\nhttp://www.mercurynews.com/2017/05/24/second-botulism-death-unrelated-to-extremely-rare-nacho-cheese-botulism/\n\n\nThe country's foremost researchers on botulism in dairy products are calling the recent [botulism] outbreak at a gas station in Walnut Grove a \"perfect storm\" of circumstances that left one dead and 9 sickened.\n\n\"Botulism in cheese products, including processed cheese, is extremely rare,\" said Eric Johnson, professor in the department of bacteriology at the Botulinum Toxins Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin. \"Outbreaks of botulism in commercially processed cheese during the past 50 years is extremely rare and can be counted on the fingers of one hand.\"\n\nAlthough extremely rare, Northern California has seen 2 deaths from foodborne botulism in the last few months.

Within the last month, Napa County has had 1 death from botulism related to canned goods, according to county health officials. Since 1950, the USA has seen 3 instances of human botulism outbreaks due to dairy products. In all, 46 people were affected and 2 died. The most recent was in 1993 where a commercially canned cheese sauce was contaminated after it left the factory and sickened 8 people, killing one.\n\n\"We want to remind people to properly store canned goods they purchase and if they are canning themselves to follow recommended home canning and preserving procedures so you can ensure as best as possible the safety of your canned goods,\" said Cara Mae Wooledge, public health education specialist for Napa County Public Health. Wooledge reinforced that anyone experiencing symptoms of botulism poisoning, blurry or double vision, nausea or drooping eyelids, should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Before these incidents, there had only been 1 death from foodborne botulism in the state of California in the past 2 decades, according to CDC data.\n\nOn 28 Apr 2017, the Los Angeles County Public Health Department issued a warning to residents about a deer antler tea product after one confirmed and one suspected case of botulism. The tea was recalled.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health has said that an open 5-pound bag of Gehl's Jalapeno Cheese Sauce confiscated from the Valley Oak Food and Fuel station tested positive for the botulism toxin. Gehl Foods' CEO Eric Beringause released a statement saying that \"Gehl's facilities remain safe for food production and all of our food samples continue to test negative for any contaminants. There is no recall of Gehl's nacho cheese product.\"\n\nJohnson, along with his colleague Kathleen Glass have devoted their lives to studying how to prevent botulism from growing in cheese. Glass, the associate director of the Food Research Institute, received her doctorate in the topic and has co-authored numerous papers on the subject with Johnson. Both have spent decades working out the right combinations that prevent the bacterium, _Clostridium botulinum_, from surviving or growing in cheese.\n\nGehl's cheese is in liquid form and is not pasteurized, but undergoes an \"aseptic process,\" which kills bacteria. The cheese has a shelf life of 12 months, but must be kept above [140 deg F/60 deg C] after opening and the dispenser must remain plugged in. \"If the package is unopened, it is basically sterile. If it's refrigerated, (the bacteria) can't grow. If it's kept above 140 deg F, it can't grow,\" Glass said. \"This was just an alignment of the planets that must have recontaminated it and held it at the right temperature for a long time for it to grow... It's really the perfect storm.\"\n\nBotulism is found everywhere, but sickness from the toxin the bacterium produces is rare and mostly affects infants. Botulism among adults is even rarer. Foodborne botulism is rarer still. Due to the rarity, there is a chance that the descending paralysis is misdiagnosed for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a stroke, or other medical conditions that lead to muscle weakness.\n\nAlthough it is sometimes used in medicine to treat muscle spasms or in cosmetics to treat frown lines, the botulism neurotoxin is one of the most potent and lethal substances in the world. The substance, which can fatally paralyze victims, is so dangerous that it is listed as a Category A bioterrorism agent by the CDC. Iraq was said to have produced 19 180 liters of concentrated botulinum toxin in the 1990s, according to the UN Security Council. Less than one-millionth of a gram is enough to kill the average adult.\n\nThe type A strain of botulinum toxin found in the nacho cheese is the same type that is cultivated for biological weapons. There is no antidote for botulism intoxication, but early use of an antitoxin can lessen the effects of the paralysis. Although symptoms can take anywhere between 6 hours and 10 days to appear, Johnson stated that ideally, the antitoxin should be administered within hours of eating the food to prevent the onset of paralysis. The need for a rapid response is critical in treating any cases of botulism, which is why every case is treated as a public health emergency. After the initial hospitalization on 22 Apr 2017, health officials were able to identify the source 13 days later and prevent further sale of the nacho cheese product at the Valley Oak Food and Fuel.\n\nState health officials will not release which counties have reported cases of botulism, citing patient confidentiality. Sacramento and San Joaquin counties have confirmed cases in their counties and Napa County officials have confirmed one botulism case unrelated to the nacho cheese outbreak. Solano County health official Jayleen Richards would neither confirm nor deny any reported cases of botulism in the county.\n\n[Byline: Aaron Davis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This posting underscores the rarity of cheese-associated botulism as well as confirms that the serotype of the toxin was indeed type A, the type that tends to be the most severe in degree and length of illness. The antitoxin used cannot neutralize toxin already bound to neural toxin.\n\nThis posting also alludes to a 2nd death in California, a case of botulism related to home canning and not related to the nacho cheese-related cluster. It is not stated what home-canned food was involved or whether there were other non-fatal cases.\n\nBotulism toxin has its effect at the neuromuscular junction. Mechanistically, when a motor neuron action potential depolarizes the axon terminal, acetylcholine is released from the cytosol into the synaptic cleft. When botulinum toxin (BT) is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT high selectivity for cholinergic synapses.\n\nAfter internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex.

Within the last month, Napa County has had 1 death from botulism related to canned goods, according to county health officials. Since 1950, the USA has seen 3 instances of human botulism outbreaks due to dairy products. In all, 46 people were affected and 2 died. The most recent was in 1993 where a commercially canned cheese sauce was contaminated after it left the factory and sickened 8 people, killing one.\n\n\"We want to remind people to properly store canned goods they purchase and if they are canning themselves to follow recommended home canning and preserving procedures so you can ensure as best as possible the safety of your canned goods,\" said Cara Mae Wooledge, public health education specialist for Napa County Public Health. Wooledge reinforced that anyone experiencing symptoms of botulism poisoning, blurry or double vision, nausea or drooping eyelids, should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Before these incidents, there had only been 1 death from foodborne botulism in the state of California in the past 2 decades, according to CDC data.\n\nOn 28 Apr 2017, the Los Angeles County Public Health Department issued a warning to residents about a deer antler tea product after one confirmed and one suspected case of botulism. The tea was recalled.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health has said that an open 5-pound bag of Gehl's Jalapeno Cheese Sauce confiscated from the Valley Oak Food and Fuel station tested positive for the botulism toxin. Gehl Foods' CEO Eric Beringause released a statement saying that \"Gehl's facilities remain safe for food production and all of our food samples continue to test negative for any contaminants. There is no recall of Gehl's nacho cheese product.\"\n\nJohnson, along with his colleague Kathleen Glass have devoted their lives to studying how to prevent botulism from growing in cheese. Glass, the associate director of the Food Research Institute, received her doctorate in the topic and has co-authored numerous papers on the subject with Johnson. Both have spent decades working out the right combinations that prevent the bacterium, _Clostridium botulinum_, from surviving or growing in cheese.\n\nGehl's cheese is in liquid form and is not pasteurized, but undergoes an \"aseptic process,\" which kills bacteria. The cheese has a shelf life of 12 months, but must be kept above [140 deg F/60 deg C] after opening and the dispenser must remain plugged in. \"If the package is unopened, it is basically sterile. If it's refrigerated, (the bacteria) can't grow. If it's kept above 140 deg F, it can't grow,\" Glass said. \"This was just an alignment of the planets that must have recontaminated it and held it at the right temperature for a long time for it to grow... It's really the perfect storm.\"\n\nBotulism is found everywhere, but sickness from the toxin the bacterium produces is rare and mostly affects infants. Botulism among adults is even rarer. Foodborne botulism is rarer still. Due to the rarity, there is a chance that the descending paralysis is misdiagnosed for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a stroke, or other medical conditions that lead to muscle weakness.\n\nAlthough it is sometimes used in medicine to treat muscle spasms or in cosmetics to treat frown lines, the botulism neurotoxin is one of the most potent and lethal substances in the world. The substance, which can fatally paralyze victims, is so dangerous that it is listed as a Category A bioterrorism agent by the CDC. Iraq was said to have produced 19 180 liters of concentrated botulinum toxin in the 1990s, according to the UN Security Council. Less than one-millionth of a gram is enough to kill the average adult.\n\nThe type A strain of botulinum toxin found in the nacho cheese is the same type that is cultivated for biological weapons. There is no antidote for botulism intoxication, but early use of an antitoxin can lessen the effects of the paralysis. Although symptoms can take anywhere between 6 hours and 10 days to appear, Johnson stated that ideally, the antitoxin should be administered within hours of eating the food to prevent the onset of paralysis. The need for a rapid response is critical in treating any cases of botulism, which is why every case is treated as a public health emergency. After the initial hospitalization on 22 Apr 2017, health officials were able to identify the source 13 days later and prevent further sale of the nacho cheese product at the Valley Oak Food and Fuel.\n\nState health officials will not release which counties have reported cases of botulism, citing patient confidentiality. Sacramento and San Joaquin counties have confirmed cases in their counties and Napa County officials have confirmed one botulism case unrelated to the nacho cheese outbreak. Solano County health official Jayleen Richards would neither confirm nor deny any reported cases of botulism in the county.\n\n[Byline: Aaron Davis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This posting underscores the rarity of cheese-associated botulism as well as confirms that the serotype of the toxin was indeed type A, the type that tends to be the most severe in degree and length of illness. The antitoxin used cannot neutralize toxin already bound to neural toxin.\n\nThis posting also alludes to a 2nd death in California, a case of botulism related to home canning and not related to the nacho cheese-related cluster. It is not stated what home-canned food was involved or whether there were other non-fatal cases.\n\nBotulism toxin has its effect at the neuromuscular junction. Mechanistically, when a motor neuron action potential depolarizes the axon terminal, acetylcholine is released from the cytosol into the synaptic cleft. When botulinum toxin (BT) is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT high selectivity for cholinergic synapses.\n\nAfter internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex.

Within the last month, Napa County has had 1 death from botulism related to canned goods, according to county health officials. Since 1950, the USA has seen 3 instances of human botulism outbreaks due to dairy products. In all, 46 people were affected and 2 died. The most recent was in 1993 where a commercially canned cheese sauce was contaminated after it left the factory and sickened 8 people, killing one.\n\n\"We want to remind people to properly store canned goods they purchase and if they are canning themselves to follow recommended home canning and preserving procedures so you can ensure as best as possible the safety of your canned goods,\" said Cara Mae Wooledge, public health education specialist for Napa County Public Health. Wooledge reinforced that anyone experiencing symptoms of botulism poisoning, blurry or double vision, nausea or drooping eyelids, should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Before these incidents, there had only been 1 death from foodborne botulism in the state of California in the past 2 decades, according to CDC data.\n\nOn 28 Apr 2017, the Los Angeles County Public Health Department issued a warning to residents about a deer antler tea product after one confirmed and one suspected case of botulism. The tea was recalled.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health has said that an open 5-pound bag of Gehl's Jalapeno Cheese Sauce confiscated from the Valley Oak Food and Fuel station tested positive for the botulism toxin. Gehl Foods' CEO Eric Beringause released a statement saying that \"Gehl's facilities remain safe for food production and all of our food samples continue to test negative for any contaminants. There is no recall of Gehl's nacho cheese product.\"\n\nJohnson, along with his colleague Kathleen Glass have devoted their lives to studying how to prevent botulism from growing in cheese. Glass, the associate director of the Food Research Institute, received her doctorate in the topic and has co-authored numerous papers on the subject with Johnson. Both have spent decades working out the right combinations that prevent the bacterium, _Clostridium botulinum_, from surviving or growing in cheese.\n\nGehl's cheese is in liquid form and is not pasteurized, but undergoes an \"aseptic process,\" which kills bacteria. The cheese has a shelf life of 12 months, but must be kept above [140 deg F/60 deg C] after opening and the dispenser must remain plugged in. \"If the package is unopened, it is basically sterile. If it's refrigerated, (the bacteria) can't grow. If it's kept above 140 deg F, it can't grow,\" Glass said. \"This was just an alignment of the planets that must have recontaminated it and held it at the right temperature for a long time for it to grow... It's really the perfect storm.\"\n\nBotulism is found everywhere, but sickness from the toxin the bacterium produces is rare and mostly affects infants. Botulism among adults is even rarer. Foodborne botulism is rarer still. Due to the rarity, there is a chance that the descending paralysis is misdiagnosed for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a stroke, or other medical conditions that lead to muscle weakness.\n\nAlthough it is sometimes used in medicine to treat muscle spasms or in cosmetics to treat frown lines, the botulism neurotoxin is one of the most potent and lethal substances in the world. The substance, which can fatally paralyze victims, is so dangerous that it is listed as a Category A bioterrorism agent by the CDC. Iraq was said to have produced 19 180 liters of concentrated botulinum toxin in the 1990s, according to the UN Security Council. Less than one-millionth of a gram is enough to kill the average adult.\n\nThe type A strain of botulinum toxin found in the nacho cheese is the same type that is cultivated for biological weapons. There is no antidote for botulism intoxication, but early use of an antitoxin can lessen the effects of the paralysis. Although symptoms can take anywhere between 6 hours and 10 days to appear, Johnson stated that ideally, the antitoxin should be administered within hours of eating the food to prevent the onset of paralysis. The need for a rapid response is critical in treating any cases of botulism, which is why every case is treated as a public health emergency. After the initial hospitalization on 22 Apr 2017, health officials were able to identify the source 13 days later and prevent further sale of the nacho cheese product at the Valley Oak Food and Fuel.\n\nState health officials will not release which counties have reported cases of botulism, citing patient confidentiality. Sacramento and San Joaquin counties have confirmed cases in their counties and Napa County officials have confirmed one botulism case unrelated to the nacho cheese outbreak. Solano County health official Jayleen Richards would neither confirm nor deny any reported cases of botulism in the county.\n\n[Byline: Aaron Davis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This posting underscores the rarity of cheese-associated botulism as well as confirms that the serotype of the toxin was indeed type A, the type that tends to be the most severe in degree and length of illness. The antitoxin used cannot neutralize toxin already bound to neural toxin.\n\nThis posting also alludes to a 2nd death in California, a case of botulism related to home canning and not related to the nacho cheese-related cluster. It is not stated what home-canned food was involved or whether there were other non-fatal cases.\n\nBotulism toxin has its effect at the neuromuscular junction. Mechanistically, when a motor neuron action potential depolarizes the axon terminal, acetylcholine is released from the cytosol into the synaptic cleft.

BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18147.]\nSee Also\nBotulism - USA (09): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese conf, fatal 20170523.5056161\nBotulism - USA (08): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese 20170519.5047996\nBotulism - USA (07): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese 20170512.5031065\nBotulism - USA (06): (CA) gas station food, RFI 20170508.5021002\nBotulism - USA (05): deer antler herbal tea, FDA recall 20170507.5018201\nBotulism - USA (04): (CA) deer antler tea 20170429.5003486\nBotulism - USA (03): (TX) wound, drug-related, 2005-2015 20170427.4999639\nBotulism - USA (02): (CA) satay, risk, recall 20170420.4982801\nBotulism - USA: (CA) wound, non-drug-related 20170402.4942916\n2016\n----\nBotulism - USA (11): (NM) wound, drug-related 20161004.4535918\nBotulism - USA (10): soups, risk, recall 20160911.4480731\nBotulism - USA (09): (NM) wound, drug-related 20160716.4350262\nBotulism - USA (08): vacuum packed fish, risk, recall 20160623.4302950\nBotulism - USA (07): (MS) prison brew 20160615.4288676\nBotulism - USA (06): (NY,CA) dried salted uneviscerated fish, risk, recall 20160426.4184418\nBotulism - USA (05): vegetable soup, risk, recall 20160421.4174551\nBotulism - USA (04): (WA) fatal, conf 20160302.4062476\nBotulism - USA (03): (OH,CA) jarred pesto, 2014 20160227.4052791\nBotulism - USA (02): (WA) fatal, RFI 20160221.4037933\nBotulism - USA: (MN) uneviscerated fish, recall 20160115.3935285\n.................................................ll/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-10 00:00:00", "1950-03-15 00:00:00", "1993-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Solano County", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "San Joaquin", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Walnut Grove", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Gehl", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Napa County", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "CALIFORNIA", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Sacramento", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Iraq", "country": "Iraq"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5056161", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - USA (09): (CA) gas station food, nacho cheese conf, fatal", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5056161", "date": "2017-04-27 15:48:07", "main_text": "BOTULISM - USA (03): (TEXAS) WOUND, DRUG-RELATED, 2005-2015\n***********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 26 Apr 2017\nSource: MedPage Today [edited]\nhttps://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/aan/64832\n\n\nWound botulism tied to subcutaneous injection of \"black tar\" heroin -- 1st reported 20 years ago -- appears to be problem that won't go away, with another case series published. A total of 15 cases of the condition, all of which were serious enough to require mechanical ventilation, were seen from 2005 to 2015 at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso in Texas, according to Ihtesham Qureshi, MBBS, and colleagues.\n\nThe report also included a tip for other clinicians who might encounter the condition, which could occur anywhere that so-called \"skin popping\" is a popular way to inject heroin. Qureshi's group, reporting in a poster presented at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) annual meeting [2017], found that nearly half of their patients had shown a normal pupillary light reflex -- thus indicating that this response \"should not be used as a finding to exclude botulism.\" They also noted that early recognition of the syndrome is key to starting effective treatment. All 15 patients survived and 13 were discharged to home.\n\nThe study was reported at AAN because botulism presents as a neuromuscular disorder, with visual abnormalities, limb weakness, and difficulty swallowing as common symptoms. Although most cases of botulism occur from eating contaminated food, about 25 to 30 percent begin as subdermal infections when _Clostridium botulinum_ spores are introduced under the skin. Formerly it was seen mainly in victims of traumatic crush injury, but in the past few decades it has become increasingly associated with injection drug use, either from contamination of needles or of the injected substance.\n\nWound botulism has been a particular problem with black tar heroin, which is so named because it comes in sticky, dark chunks -- according to Qureshi's group, that is because the pure heroin is mixed with ground paper bits soaked in black shoe polish and dirt. For that reason, it can be problematic to inject intravenously, leading to alternate methods of administration including \"skin popping\", a slang term for shallow intradermal or intramuscular injection. [I am not familiar with this unique explanation of the derivation of how black tar heroin is produced, see below - Mod. LL].\n\nThe first cases of wound botulism associated with injection drug use were reported in 1982. In the mid-1990s, several reports appeared tying wound botulism to injection of black tar heroin. More recently, in 2011, public health investigators in California published a 17-patient case series that specifically implicated skin popping.\n\nAll of the 15 cases seen in the El Paso center involved respiratory failure. Other common symptoms included those listed above, but each of those were lacking in some patients. Beyond the neuromuscular symptoms, though, they all showed skin abscesses that tipped the treating clinicians to a possible injection-drug complication. Qureshi's group noted that black tar heroin use is especially common in southern border areas (the substance being imported mostly from Mexico), thus raising suspicion for wound botulism in cases of skin abscess combined with serious neuromuscular complaints.\n\n[Byline: John Gever]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Black tar heroin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin): \"is heroin acetate. Other forms of heroin require additional steps of purification post acetylation. With black tar the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency however is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in Homebake Heroin in Australia and New Zealand the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass. Black tar as a type holds a variable admixture morphine derivatives--predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine) which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid.\n\n\"Black tar heroin is often produced in Latin America, and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose.\n\n\"People who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis than that inject powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden, which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible. Researchers at UC-San Francisco have found that the rapidity with which black tar heroin destroys veins, along with its gummier consistency, may put people who inject it at a lower risk of HIV infection because they may be forced to inject subcutaneously (rather than into veins), and needles must be thoroughly rinsed free of 'black tar' between injections if new sterilized ones are not available.\n\n\"The presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di- acetyl morphine potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine. At least 1 study has drawn attention to lower rates of HIV infection amongst drug injectors in which black tar heroin is the major form of street-available heroin, suggesting that this may be due to the need to heat black tar heroin to dissolve it (which also inactivates any HIV present in the solution).\n\n\"However, black tar heroin injectors can be at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections, in particular necrotizing soft tissue infection. The practice of \"skin-popping\" or subcutaneous injection predisposes to necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis from _Clostridium perfringens_, while deep intramuscular injection predisposes to necrotizing myositis.

A total of 15 cases of the condition, all of which were serious enough to require mechanical ventilation, were seen from 2005 to 2015 at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso in Texas, according to Ihtesham Qureshi, MBBS, and colleagues.\n\nThe report also included a tip for other clinicians who might encounter the condition, which could occur anywhere that so-called \"skin popping\" is a popular way to inject heroin. Qureshi's group, reporting in a poster presented at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) annual meeting [2017], found that nearly half of their patients had shown a normal pupillary light reflex -- thus indicating that this response \"should not be used as a finding to exclude botulism.\" They also noted that early recognition of the syndrome is key to starting effective treatment. All 15 patients survived and 13 were discharged to home.\n\nThe study was reported at AAN because botulism presents as a neuromuscular disorder, with visual abnormalities, limb weakness, and difficulty swallowing as common symptoms. Although most cases of botulism occur from eating contaminated food, about 25 to 30 percent begin as subdermal infections when _Clostridium botulinum_ spores are introduced under the skin. Formerly it was seen mainly in victims of traumatic crush injury, but in the past few decades it has become increasingly associated with injection drug use, either from contamination of needles or of the injected substance.\n\nWound botulism has been a particular problem with black tar heroin, which is so named because it comes in sticky, dark chunks -- according to Qureshi's group, that is because the pure heroin is mixed with ground paper bits soaked in black shoe polish and dirt. For that reason, it can be problematic to inject intravenously, leading to alternate methods of administration including \"skin popping\", a slang term for shallow intradermal or intramuscular injection. [I am not familiar with this unique explanation of the derivation of how black tar heroin is produced, see below - Mod. LL].\n\nThe first cases of wound botulism associated with injection drug use were reported in 1982. In the mid-1990s, several reports appeared tying wound botulism to injection of black tar heroin. More recently, in 2011, public health investigators in California published a 17-patient case series that specifically implicated skin popping.\n\nAll of the 15 cases seen in the El Paso center involved respiratory failure. Other common symptoms included those listed above, but each of those were lacking in some patients. Beyond the neuromuscular symptoms, though, they all showed skin abscesses that tipped the treating clinicians to a possible injection-drug complication. Qureshi's group noted that black tar heroin use is especially common in southern border areas (the substance being imported mostly from Mexico), thus raising suspicion for wound botulism in cases of skin abscess combined with serious neuromuscular complaints.\n\n[Byline: John Gever]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Black tar heroin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin): \"is heroin acetate.

All 15 patients survived and 13 were discharged to home.\n\nThe study was reported at AAN because botulism presents as a neuromuscular disorder, with visual abnormalities, limb weakness, and difficulty swallowing as common symptoms. Although most cases of botulism occur from eating contaminated food, about 25 to 30 percent begin as subdermal infections when _Clostridium botulinum_ spores are introduced under the skin.

For that reason, it can be problematic to inject intravenously, leading to alternate methods of administration including \"skin popping\", a slang term for shallow intradermal or intramuscular injection.

Other common symptoms included those listed above, but each of those were lacking in some patients.

The source of the infections has been linked to homemade canned marinade.\n\nLess than a day after consuming the marinade, the victims presented with symptoms of botulism. They were taken to the hospital, where they are being treated. One is in serious condition, according to the report.\n\nFood borne botulism is a severe intoxication caused by eating the pre-formed toxin present in contaminated food. It occurs when the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_ is allowed to grow and produce toxin in food that is later eaten without sufficient heating or cooking to inactivate the toxin. Botulinum toxin is one of the most potent neurotoxins known.\n\nTypically, in a few hours to several days after you eat the contaminated food, you will start to show the classic symptoms; blurred vision, dry mouth, and difficulty in swallowing. Gastrointestinal symptoms may or may not occur. If untreated, the paralysis always descends through the body starting at the shoulders and working its way down. The most serious complication of botulism is respiratory failure, where it is fatal in up to 10% of people. It may take months before recovery is complete.\n\nIf the disease is caught early enough, it can be treated with antitoxin.

Foodborne botulism in Canada, 1985-2005. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013; 19(6): 961-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3713816/\n\nAbstract\n--------\nDuring 1985-2005, a total of 91 laboratory-confirmed outbreaks of foodborne botulism occurred in Canada; these outbreaks involved 205 cases and 11 deaths. Of the outbreaks, 75 (86.2 per cent) were caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ type E, followed by types A (7, 8.1 per cent) and B (5, 5.7 per cent). Approximately 85 per cent of the outbreaks occurred in Alaska Native communities, particularly the Inuit of Nunavik in northern Quebec and the First Nations population of the Pacific coast of British Columbia. These populations were predominantly exposed to type E botulinum toxin through the consumption of traditionally prepared marine mammal and fish products. 2 botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods. 3 affected pregnant women delivered healthy infants. Improvements in botulism case identification and early treatment have resulted in a reduction in the case-fatality rate in Canada.\n\nThe following was abstracted from a 2001 CDC report on foodborne botulism in the native American population in Alaska and underscores changes in the fermentation techniques which appear to have increased the risks of this intoxication\n(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5032a2.htm):\n\nThis report illustrates how the use of nontraditional fermentation methods is associated with foodborne botulism in Alaska. Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska Natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27 per cent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.\n\nIn traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5). Although a plastic container was not used in this outbreak, the beaver tail and paw were fermented in a closed rice sack and stored in a warm area.\n\nEarly diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 per cent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 per cent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Beller M.

Foodborne botulism in Canada, 1985-2005. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013; 19(6): 961-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3713816/\n\nAbstract\n--------\nDuring 1985-2005, a total of 91 laboratory-confirmed outbreaks of foodborne botulism occurred in Canada; these outbreaks involved 205 cases and 11 deaths. Of the outbreaks, 75 (86.2 per cent) were caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ type E, followed by types A (7, 8.1 per cent) and B (5, 5.7 per cent). Approximately 85 per cent of the outbreaks occurred in Alaska Native communities, particularly the Inuit of Nunavik in northern Quebec and the First Nations population of the Pacific coast of British Columbia. These populations were predominantly exposed to type E botulinum toxin through the consumption of traditionally prepared marine mammal and fish products. 2 botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods. 3 affected pregnant women delivered healthy infants. Improvements in botulism case identification and early treatment have resulted in a reduction in the case-fatality rate in Canada.\n\nThe following was abstracted from a 2001 CDC report on foodborne botulism in the native American population in Alaska and underscores changes in the fermentation techniques which appear to have increased the risks of this intoxication\n(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5032a2.htm):\n\nThis report illustrates how the use of nontraditional fermentation methods is associated with foodborne botulism in Alaska. Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska Natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27 per cent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.\n\nIn traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5). Although a plastic container was not used in this outbreak, the beaver tail and paw were fermented in a closed rice sack and stored in a warm area.\n\nEarly diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 per cent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 per cent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Beller M.

Foodborne botulism in Canada, 1985-2005. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013; 19(6): 961-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3713816/\n\nAbstract\n--------\nDuring 1985-2005, a total of 91 laboratory-confirmed outbreaks of foodborne botulism occurred in Canada; these outbreaks involved 205 cases and 11 deaths. Of the outbreaks, 75 (86.2 per cent) were caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ type E, followed by types A (7, 8.1 per cent) and B (5, 5.7 per cent). Approximately 85 per cent of the outbreaks occurred in Alaska Native communities, particularly the Inuit of Nunavik in northern Quebec and the First Nations population of the Pacific coast of British Columbia. These populations were predominantly exposed to type E botulinum toxin through the consumption of traditionally prepared marine mammal and fish products. 2 botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods. 3 affected pregnant women delivered healthy infants. Improvements in botulism case identification and early treatment have resulted in a reduction in the case-fatality rate in Canada.\n\nThe following was abstracted from a 2001 CDC report on foodborne botulism in the native American population in Alaska and underscores changes in the fermentation techniques which appear to have increased the risks of this intoxication\n(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5032a2.htm):\n\nThis report illustrates how the use of nontraditional fermentation methods is associated with foodborne botulism in Alaska. Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska Natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27 per cent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.\n\nIn traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5). Although a plastic container was not used in this outbreak, the beaver tail and paw were fermented in a closed rice sack and stored in a warm area.\n\nEarly diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 per cent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 per cent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Beller M.

Type E botulism is the type frequently associated with fish products (1).\n\nClassically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in\nwhich _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).\n\nTypes A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (2).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Tomalley corresponds to the hepatopancreas in other arthropods. It is considered a delicacy, and may be eaten alone but is often added to sauces for flavour and as a thickening agent. The term lobster paste or lobster pate can also be used to indicate a mixture of tomalley and lobster roe. Lobster bisque, lobster stock, and lobster consomme are made using lobster bodies (heads), often including the lobster liver.\n\nThe tomalley in general can be consumed in moderation (as with the livers of other animals). It can, however, contain high levels of PCBs which can give a number of negative health effects in large concentrations. It may also contain toxins that are associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (saxitoxin and gonyautoxin). Those toxins do not leach out when the lobster is cooked in boiling water. The toxins responsible for most shellfish poisonings are water-insoluble, heat- and acid-stable, and thus are not diminished by cooking. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/268.]\nSee Also\nBotulism - Canada (04): (ON) canned salmon, risk, recall 20140622.2556754\nBotulism - Canada (03): smoked fish, risk, recall 20140604.2518390\nBotulism - Canada (02): rice-abalone porridge, risk, recall 20140405.2384021\nBotulism - Canada: (AB) jarred bacon spread, risk, recall 20140205.2257139\n2013\n----\nBotulism - Canada (04): (ON) bottled relish, risk, recall 20131106.2042043\nBotulism, paralytic shellfish poisoning - Canada: (BC) alert 20131018.2008893\nBotulism - Canada (03): jarred lobster meat, risk, recall 20130411.1638646\nBotulism - Canada (02): (ON, QC) gefilte fish 20130331.1611463\nBotulism - Canada: jarred clams, risk, recall 20130325.1602821\n2012\n----\nBotulism - Canada (03): (ON) pumpkin butter, risk, recall 20121121.1418843\nBotulism - Canada (02):(ON) salted fish, expanded recall 20120423.1111009\nBotulism - Canada:(ON), salted fish, alert, recall 20120420.1108660\n2011\n----\nBotulism, smoked trout - Canada: (ON) risk, recall 20111128.3475\nBotulism, olives - Canada: (QC) risk, recall 20111127.3464\nBotulism, uneviscerated fish - USA (02): risk, recall, ex Canada 20111124.3439\nBotulism, fish products - Canada: risk, recall 20111030.3229\nBotulism, uneviscerated fish - USA: risk, recall, ex Canada 20111014.3078\nBotulism - Canada (02): (BC) alert, expanded recall 20110317.0846\nBotulism - Canada: (BC) watermelon jelly, alert, recall 20110310.0776\n.................................................ll/mj/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2014-09-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "QC", "country": "Canada"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3084244", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - UK (02): (Scotland) wound, drug-related", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3084244", "date": "2014-09-29 13:59:53", "main_text": "BOTULISM - CANADA (05): (QUEBEC) TOMALLEY SPREAD, RISK, RECALL\n**************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 26 Sep 2014\nSource: Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) [edited]\nhttp://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/complete-listing/2014-09-26/eng/1411775566923/1411775567532?print=1#recall-photos\n\n\nRecall date: 26 Sep 2014\nReason for recall: Microbiological -- _Clostridium botulinum_\nHazard classification: class 1\nCompany/Firm: Fruits de Mer Madeleine Inc.\nDistribution: Quebec\nExtent of the distribution: retail\n\nFruits de Mer Madeleine Inc. is recalling Madeleine brand Tomalley Spread from the marketplace because it may permit the growth of _Clostridium botulinum_.

He was diagnosed with botulism, a potentially deadly condition, and getting the treatment wasn't easy. \"All you want is your baby to be back to normal,\" said the baby's mother.\n\nBut the 3-month-old was lethargic, losing muscle tone, and getting worse. And on 2 Jul 2014, he ended up in intensive care at St. Barnabas Medical Center [Essex County, New Jersey]. \"His cry was weak, he wouldn't eat, he was miserable,\" the mother said. The baby had no fever, normal blood work, and wanted to eat but couldn't.\n\nChief of Infectious Disease Dr. Uzma Hassan says those are clues that led her to diagnosis of botulism. \"Botulism is a very serious illness. Botulism toxin is the most potent neurotoxin known to man,\" said Dr. Uzma Hassan, of St. Barnabas Medical Center. The toxin paralyzes muscles, leaving babies unable to eat or breathe. There is a treatment, baby-BIG (botulism immune globulin), but you can only get it from the California Department of Public Health and it costs USD 45 000.\n\nFor that antitoxin to work, it has to be given within a few days. But the test to confirm the diagnosis can take up to a week. That means doctors have to act fast and make a decision before it's too late. \"He needed to get this as soon as possible. He was deteriorating and he was deteriorating really quickly,\" the mother said. After the treatment, the baby immediately started to get better. Soon after, the test results came back confirming that he had botulism. The condition affects about 100 babies a year.\n\nDr. Hassan says construction and dust may play a role. \"It may be that the soil turning around could have triggered a release of spores in the environment,\" Dr. Hassan said. Botulism spores are also found in honey. That's the reason new parents are told to never give their baby honey.\n\n[Byline: Dr. Sapna Parikh]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144):\n\n\"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism - Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.\n\nBotulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing.\"\n\nAs was done in the case above, botulism immune globulin (BIG) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.\n\nReferences:\n1.

He was diagnosed with botulism, a potentially deadly condition, and getting the treatment wasn't easy. \"All you want is your baby to be back to normal,\" said the baby's mother.\n\nBut the 3-month-old was lethargic, losing muscle tone, and getting worse. And on 2 Jul 2014, he ended up in intensive care at St. Barnabas Medical Center [Essex County, New Jersey]. \"His cry was weak, he wouldn't eat, he was miserable,\" the mother said. The baby had no fever, normal blood work, and wanted to eat but couldn't.\n\nChief of Infectious Disease Dr. Uzma Hassan says those are clues that led her to diagnosis of botulism. \"Botulism is a very serious illness. Botulism toxin is the most potent neurotoxin known to man,\" said Dr. Uzma Hassan, of St. Barnabas Medical Center. The toxin paralyzes muscles, leaving babies unable to eat or breathe. There is a treatment, baby-BIG (botulism immune globulin), but you can only get it from the California Department of Public Health and it costs USD 45 000.\n\nFor that antitoxin to work, it has to be given within a few days. But the test to confirm the diagnosis can take up to a week. That means doctors have to act fast and make a decision before it's too late. \"He needed to get this as soon as possible. He was deteriorating and he was deteriorating really quickly,\" the mother said. After the treatment, the baby immediately started to get better. Soon after, the test results came back confirming that he had botulism. The condition affects about 100 babies a year.\n\nDr. Hassan says construction and dust may play a role. \"It may be that the soil turning around could have triggered a release of spores in the environment,\" Dr. Hassan said. Botulism spores are also found in honey. That's the reason new parents are told to never give their baby honey.\n\n[Byline: Dr. Sapna Parikh]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144):\n\n\"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism - Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.\n\nBotulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness.

He was diagnosed with botulism, a potentially deadly condition, and getting the treatment wasn't easy. \"All you want is your baby to be back to normal,\" said the baby's mother.\n\nBut the 3-month-old was lethargic, losing muscle tone, and getting worse. And on 2 Jul 2014, he ended up in intensive care at St. Barnabas Medical Center [Essex County, New Jersey]. \"His cry was weak, he wouldn't eat, he was miserable,\" the mother said. The baby had no fever, normal blood work, and wanted to eat but couldn't.\n\nChief of Infectious Disease Dr. Uzma Hassan says those are clues that led her to diagnosis of botulism. \"Botulism is a very serious illness. Botulism toxin is the most potent neurotoxin known to man,\" said Dr. Uzma Hassan, of St. Barnabas Medical Center. The toxin paralyzes muscles, leaving babies unable to eat or breathe. There is a treatment, baby-BIG (botulism immune globulin), but you can only get it from the California Department of Public Health and it costs USD 45 000.\n\nFor that antitoxin to work, it has to be given within a few days. But the test to confirm the diagnosis can take up to a week. That means doctors have to act fast and make a decision before it's too late. \"He needed to get this as soon as possible. He was deteriorating and he was deteriorating really quickly,\" the mother said. After the treatment, the baby immediately started to get better. Soon after, the test results came back confirming that he had botulism. The condition affects about 100 babies a year.\n\nDr. Hassan says construction and dust may play a role. \"It may be that the soil turning around could have triggered a release of spores in the environment,\" Dr. Hassan said. Botulism spores are also found in honey. That's the reason new parents are told to never give their baby honey.\n\n[Byline: Dr. Sapna Parikh]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144):\n\n\"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism - Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.\n\nBotulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing.\"\n\nAs was done in the case above, botulism immune globulin (BIG) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The birds began dying more than 2 weeks ago, residents in the area said. Brian Crichlow of the Department of Agriculture said a post-mortem exam on one of the birds revealed botulism. The bird was also tested for avian flu, with negative results. Mr Crichlow said botulism is not spread by direct contact with affected chickens, but there is a \"low potential for spreading to humans and other animals through consumption of dead chickens\" contaminated with the botulism toxin.\n\nBotulism is a micro-organism that occurs naturally in the soil and in decaying flesh. Since chickens are scavengers, they likely ate a dead animal and got sick, said Mr. Crichlow.\n\nThe Department of Environmental Health was expected to begin removing the birds from the site, near the Bodden Town Mission House, on Wednesday afternoon [16 Apr 2014], according to the department's director, Roydell Carter. \"We are aware of the situation. We were notified by the Department of Agriculture about it. We went on site today [Wed 16 Apr 2014] and we will be assisting them in getting the birds removed and disinfecting the area,\" he said. \"We're putting together the resources we need -- there are so many [dead chickens] all over the place ... We will go in and help. There could probably be public health implications as well [if the carcasses are not removed]. We don't want all these dead birds lying around ... where other animals might feed on their carcasses,\" he added.\n\nOn Wednesday [16 Apr 2014], many of the dead chickens could be seen around the Mission House and Harry McCoy Park, and under the home of an elderly couple nearby. Mr Crichlow advised that if the dead or dying birds are not removed and disposed of properly, other chickens will feed on the carcasses and the maggots from the dead chickens, leading to more chickens contracting botulism. Botulism is also known as \"limberneck,\" he said, reflecting the neck paralysis typically seen in affected birds. [The son] of the couple under whose home many of the decaying carcasses were seen, said he had picked up as many as he could, but those under the house would have to stay there until he had help removing them.\n\n\"The chickens just get crippled, lie down and die,\" said [the man], who often fed the chickens. For the past 2 weeks, the chickens have been \"dropping off like flies,\" he said.\n\nThe feral chickens roam the neighborhood and are considered pests by many in the area. Mr Crichlow said there had been no reports of domestic flocks of chickens owned by local farmers being affected by botulism. However, he said the department had seen similar episodes before of local wild chickens dying, adding that botulism is common in feral chickens in Cayman and elsewhere. Over the past 2 years, his department has responded to deaths of feral chickens in George Town, West Bay and Bodden Town districts, he said.\n\nKaren Rosenthal, a St. Matthews Veterinary School veterinarian who studies birds, said, \"It is not so easy for people to get botulism the same way chickens do. But you would never eat the eggs or meat from a chicken with botulism,\" she said. \"What we should worry about is if the people are using the same water source as the dead birds.\"\n\nKiran Kumar, medical officer of health at the public health department, said botulism from dead chickens does not spread to human beings through the air, and there is also no evidence of it spreading to humans by consumption of chickens with botulism.

The birds began dying more than 2 weeks ago, residents in the area said. Brian Crichlow of the Department of Agriculture said a post-mortem exam on one of the birds revealed botulism. The bird was also tested for avian flu, with negative results. Mr Crichlow said botulism is not spread by direct contact with affected chickens, but there is a \"low potential for spreading to humans and other animals through consumption of dead chickens\" contaminated with the botulism toxin.\n\nBotulism is a micro-organism that occurs naturally in the soil and in decaying flesh. Since chickens are scavengers, they likely ate a dead animal and got sick, said Mr. Crichlow.\n\nThe Department of Environmental Health was expected to begin removing the birds from the site, near the Bodden Town Mission House, on Wednesday afternoon [16 Apr 2014], according to the department's director, Roydell Carter. \"We are aware of the situation. We were notified by the Department of Agriculture about it. We went on site today [Wed 16 Apr 2014] and we will be assisting them in getting the birds removed and disinfecting the area,\" he said. \"We're putting together the resources we need -- there are so many [dead chickens] all over the place ... We will go in and help. There could probably be public health implications as well [if the carcasses are not removed]. We don't want all these dead birds lying around ... where other animals might feed on their carcasses,\" he added.\n\nOn Wednesday [16 Apr 2014], many of the dead chickens could be seen around the Mission House and Harry McCoy Park, and under the home of an elderly couple nearby. Mr Crichlow advised that if the dead or dying birds are not removed and disposed of properly, other chickens will feed on the carcasses and the maggots from the dead chickens, leading to more chickens contracting botulism. Botulism is also known as \"limberneck,\" he said, reflecting the neck paralysis typically seen in affected birds. [The son] of the couple under whose home many of the decaying carcasses were seen, said he had picked up as many as he could, but those under the house would have to stay there until he had help removing them.\n\n\"The chickens just get crippled, lie down and die,\" said [the man], who often fed the chickens. For the past 2 weeks, the chickens have been \"dropping off like flies,\" he said.\n\nThe feral chickens roam the neighborhood and are considered pests by many in the area. Mr Crichlow said there had been no reports of domestic flocks of chickens owned by local farmers being affected by botulism. However, he said the department had seen similar episodes before of local wild chickens dying, adding that botulism is common in feral chickens in Cayman and elsewhere. Over the past 2 years, his department has responded to deaths of feral chickens in George Town, West Bay and Bodden Town districts, he said.\n\nKaren Rosenthal, a St. Matthews Veterinary School veterinarian who studies birds, said, \"It is not so easy for people to get botulism the same way chickens do.

The 1st case took place in March 2013 in General Alvear, when the man died, and the 2nd was in October 2013 when a woman died after a month of confinement in the Spanish Hospital.

They are closely related to chinchillas, and look similar to rabbits, apart from their longer tails. Pictures of viscachas can be seen at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscacha.\n\nEscabeche (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escabeche) is a typical Mediterranean cuisine which refers to a dish of either poached or fried fish (escabeche of chicken, rabbit or pork is common in Spain) marinated in an acidic mixture before serving, and to the marinade itself. The dish is common in Spain and Latin America, and popular in Catalonia, Portugal, Provence and the Philippines. Influences of the dish appear as far as Asia-Pacific with adjustments to local food staples. It is usually served cold after marinating in a refrigerator overnight or longer. The acid in the marinade is usually vinegar, but can also include citrus juice. Escabeche is a popular presentation of canned or potted preserved fish, such as tuna, bonito or sardines. In the New World, versions of the basic marinade are often used with foods other than fish and meats -- for example, cassava or green bananas and chicken gizzards (Puerto Rico), jalapeno peppers (Mexico), etc. The origin of the word escabeche is Persian, and was brought to Spain by the Arabs during the Moorish conquests. The word derives from al-sikbaj, the name of a popular meat dish cooked in a sweet and sour sauce, usually vinegar and honey or date molasses.\n\nGiven this background information regarding the source of the meat and how escabeche is prepared, it is certainly possible that either the source of presumed botulism was not the meat dish or the preparation was not escabeche as the vinegar in the marinade should provide enough of an acidic environment to prevent germination of botulinum spores.\n\nThese cases may well be botulism as clusters of individuals with muscular weakness which can produce respiratory paralysis and begin with eye muscle weakness almost always represent botulism. The initial combination of gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea with fever are probably not due to botulism altogether. As stated by Sobel (references removed): \"In foodborne botulism, particularly types B and E, gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea and vomiting may precede neurological symptoms. It is unknown if these are caused by direct action of botulinum toxin, other products of _C. botulinum_, or some other contaminant of spoiled food. These symptoms have never been reported in wound botulism nor have corresponding signs been observed in primate experiments in which pure toxin was administered intragastrically or intravenously\" (1). The diarrhea and fever are not linked to botulism and also may represent other agents in the food.\n\nReference:\n1. Sobel J: Botulism.

The dish is common in Spain and Latin America, and popular in Catalonia, Portugal, Provence and the Philippines. Influences of the dish appear as far as Asia-Pacific with adjustments to local food staples. It is usually served cold after marinating in a refrigerator overnight or longer. The acid in the marinade is usually vinegar, but can also include citrus juice. Escabeche is a popular presentation of canned or potted preserved fish, such as tuna, bonito or sardines.

Mod.AS, summ., edited]\nhttp://www.hachaklait.org.il/showarticle.asp?recid=3305&catid=0\n\n\nBotulism in cattle\n------------------\nSince 29 Sep 2013, hundreds of clinical cases suspected to be botulism have been reported from 21 cattle farms in 17 (named) locations throughout Israel, distributed in Hazafon (North) and Hadarom (South) provinces. About 100 of the affected cattle have reportedly died or been euthanised. The disease affected mainly young animals, predominantly fattening calves. The source of intoxication/infection has been suspected to be poultry manure fed to the cattle. In several of the affected farms, a common source for the poultry manure was found, namely a company which specializes in the treatment and supply of poultry litter to the cattle industry. Farmers have been advised to discontinue at present deriving poultry litter for cattle feeding from the said source; investigations into the matter by the producer/distributor and by the State Veterinary Services have been initiated.\n\nThe farming industry and veterinary practitioners, countrywide, have been updated in detail about the events. Farmers have been encouraged to check the vaccination history of their stock with the recommended vaccine (against _Clostridium botulinum_ C and D) and to fill any gaps, following manufacturer's instructions.\n\nMaterials sampled from affected cattle are under investigation in the Kimron Veterinary Institute [KVI].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The preliminary suspicion of botulism, likely to be accurately suggested based on the typical symptomatology, is yet to be laboratory confirmed. According to a flowchart of botulism testing in the KVI, attached to the report above, it may take more than 7 days to confirm (or otherwise) _C. botulinum_/toxins in the tested material.\n\nOne of the etiologies for consideration when poultry litter is suspected as the cause of neuromuscular signs and death in cattle are ionophores; this may happen if the litter derived from poultry was recently treated with a ionophore [substance able to transport particular ions across a lipid membrane in a cell] coccidiostat [a chemical agent added to animal feed (as for poultry) that serves to retard the growth and reproduction of pathogenic coccidia so that disease is minimized and the host develops immunity], such as maduromycin. Cattle are highly susceptible to residues of this drug.\n\nBotulism in cattle, caused by recycled poultry litter, has been recorded from various industrialised countries in recent years.\n\nIn the UK, an ad hoc group of the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) looked into the matter following an increase in the incidence of bovine botulism associated primarily with exposure of livestock to poultry (broiler) litter. Their report (2006) is found at http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/botulismincattlereport1206.pdf.\n\nThe Group assessed the risk to the public from food produced by herds affected by botulism and concluded that for disease associated with toxin types C and D, \"there should be no requirement to restrict sales of meat or milk from clinically healthy cattle from farms where there have been clinically suspected cases of botulism in cattle. In addition, there should be no requirement to restrict the slaughter of healthy cattle from herds where cases of confirmed or suspected botulism have occurred.\" (see ProMED-mail post 20120829.1271101).\n\nIsrael has witnessed several outbreaks of botulism in domestic ruminants throughout the years. In 1978, a major outbreak of botulism type D caused the deaths and emergency slaughter of more than 1000 animals, most of them dairy cattle. Spores of _C. botulinum_ type D spread to many farms from 2 central animal feed plants by recycled, non-sterilized poultry manure that included remains of avian cadavers. Subsequently, annual botulism vaccinations of cattle and of other vulnerable animals with a vaccine, including toxoids of _C. botulinum_ types C and D adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide gel, have been introduced and are routinely voluntarily applied in most parts of the country. Sporadic cases involving unvaccinated animals (mainly young cows) have been reported to occur every year.\n\nThe feeding of milking cows, sheep, and goats with poultry manure has been officially banned since 1996, while feeding of all animals is prohibited during 15 days prior to slaughter.\n\nBotulism in animals is not reportable in Israel, or OIE-listed. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1z-1.]\nSee Also\n2012\n----\nBotulism, bovine - Israel (03): (HZ) raw milk, type D, safety 20120829.1271101\nBotulism, bovine - Israel (02): (HZ) raw milk, type D 20120823.1259805\nBotulism, bovine - Israel: (HZ) raw milk, RFI 20120815.1245834\n2002\n----\nBotulism, cattle - Israel 20020618.4531\n.................................................arn/mj/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2013-09-29 00:00:00", "2006-03-15 00:00:00", "1978-03-15 00:00:00", "1996-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2002-03-15 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Israel", "country": "Israel"}, {"location": "Hazafon", "country": "Israel"}, {"location": "Hadarom", "country": "Israel"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2044021", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism, wound - Norway", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2044021", "date": "2013-10-07 10:06:51", "main_text": "BOTULISM, BOVINE - ISRAEL: SUSPECTED, WIDE-SCALE, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 6 Oct 2013\nSource: Hachaklait Clinical Veterinary Services, Head Veterinarian's weekly report no 40 [in Hebrew, by subscription, trans.

About 100 of the affected cattle have reportedly died or been euthanised. The disease affected mainly young animals, predominantly fattening calves. The source of intoxication/infection has been suspected to be poultry manure fed to the cattle. In several of the affected farms, a common source for the poultry manure was found, namely a company which specializes in the treatment and supply of poultry litter to the cattle industry. Farmers have been advised to discontinue at present deriving poultry litter for cattle feeding from the said source; investigations into the matter by the producer/distributor and by the State Veterinary Services have been initiated.\n\nThe farming industry and veterinary practitioners, countrywide, have been updated in detail about the events. Farmers have been encouraged to check the vaccination history of their stock with the recommended vaccine (against _Clostridium botulinum_ C and D) and to fill any gaps, following manufacturer's instructions.\n\nMaterials sampled from affected cattle are under investigation in the Kimron Veterinary Institute [KVI].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The preliminary suspicion of botulism, likely to be accurately suggested based on the typical symptomatology, is yet to be laboratory confirmed. According to a flowchart of botulism testing in the KVI, attached to the report above, it may take more than 7 days to confirm (or otherwise) _C. botulinum_/toxins in the tested material.\n\nOne of the etiologies for consideration when poultry litter is suspected as the cause of neuromuscular signs and death in cattle are ionophores; this may happen if the litter derived from poultry was recently treated with a ionophore [substance able to transport particular ions across a lipid membrane in a cell] coccidiostat [a chemical agent added to animal feed (as for poultry) that serves to retard the growth and reproduction of pathogenic coccidia so that disease is minimized and the host develops immunity], such as maduromycin. Cattle are highly susceptible to residues of this drug.\n\nBotulism in cattle, caused by recycled poultry litter, has been recorded from various industrialised countries in recent years.\n\nIn the UK, an ad hoc group of the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) looked into the matter following an increase in the incidence of bovine botulism associated primarily with exposure of livestock to poultry (broiler) litter. Their report (2006) is found at http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/botulismincattlereport1206.pdf.\n\nThe Group assessed the risk to the public from food produced by herds affected by botulism and concluded that for disease associated with toxin types C and D, \"there should be no requirement to restrict sales of meat or milk from clinically healthy cattle from farms where there have been clinically suspected cases of botulism in cattle. In addition, there should be no requirement to restrict the slaughter of healthy cattle from herds where cases of confirmed or suspected botulism have occurred.\" (see ProMED-mail post 20120829.1271101).\n\nIsrael has witnessed several outbreaks of botulism in domestic ruminants throughout the years.

Fonterra said that on Wednesday [31 Jul 2013] tests indicated the potential presence of a strain of Clostridium (_Clostridium botulinum_) in a whey concentrate sample, which can produce a potent neurotoxin that causes botulism.\n\nThe company said that it today [3 Aug 2013] had advised 8 of its customers of a \"quality issue\" involving 3 batches of a particular type of whey protein concentrate (WPC80) produced at a single New Zealand manufacturing site in May 2012. As a result, these customers are urgently investigating whether any of the affected product is in their supply chains. If need be, they will initiate consumer product recalls.\n\nThere have been no reports of any illness linked to consumption of the affected whey protein, Fonterra said in a statement. Dairy products such as fresh milk, yoghurt, cheese, spreads and UHT milk products are not affected, it said. Fonterra had initially identified a potential quality issue in March 2013, when a product tested positive for _Clostridium_. There are hundreds of different strains of _Clostridium_, the majority of which are harmless, the company said.\n\nProduct samples were put through intensive testing over the following months. On Wed 31 Jul 2013, tests indicated the potential presence of a strain (_Clostridium botulinum_) in a sample, which can cause botulism.\n\nThe particular whey protein concentrate concerned is used by Fonterra's customers in a range of products including infant formula, growing up milk powder and sports drinks, said Gary Romano, Managing Director, NZ Milk Products. \"For this reason, we immediately contacted our customers and the appropriate authorities so that any potentially affected product could be removed from the marketplace. We are working with our customers and will provide more information and updates as they become available,\" Mr Romano said.\n\nFonterra told a news conference today [3 Aug 2013] that investigations had isolated the cause of the contamination. A piece of pipe was not sterilized properly and was used during production of 3 batches. The piece of equipment was subsequently cleaned and further product tested was clear.\n\nThe organism is present in soils, and small amounts of dust accumulated in the pipe and triggered the contamination, the company said.

Fonterra said that on Wednesday [31 Jul 2013] tests indicated the potential presence of a strain of Clostridium (_Clostridium botulinum_) in a whey concentrate sample, which can produce a potent neurotoxin that causes botulism.\n\nThe company said that it today [3 Aug 2013] had advised 8 of its customers of a \"quality issue\" involving 3 batches of a particular type of whey protein concentrate (WPC80) produced at a single New Zealand manufacturing site in May 2012. As a result, these customers are urgently investigating whether any of the affected product is in their supply chains. If need be, they will initiate consumer product recalls.\n\nThere have been no reports of any illness linked to consumption of the affected whey protein, Fonterra said in a statement. Dairy products such as fresh milk, yoghurt, cheese, spreads and UHT milk products are not affected, it said. Fonterra had initially identified a potential quality issue in March 2013, when a product tested positive for _Clostridium_. There are hundreds of different strains of _Clostridium_, the majority of which are harmless, the company said.\n\nProduct samples were put through intensive testing over the following months. On Wed 31 Jul 2013, tests indicated the potential presence of a strain (_Clostridium botulinum_) in a sample, which can cause botulism.\n\nThe particular whey protein concentrate concerned is used by Fonterra's customers in a range of products including infant formula, growing up milk powder and sports drinks, said Gary Romano, Managing Director, NZ Milk Products. \"For this reason, we immediately contacted our customers and the appropriate authorities so that any potentially affected product could be removed from the marketplace. We are working with our customers and will provide more information and updates as they become available,\" Mr Romano said.\n\nFonterra told a news conference today [3 Aug 2013] that investigations had isolated the cause of the contamination. A piece of pipe was not sterilized properly and was used during production of 3 batches. The piece of equipment was subsequently cleaned and further product tested was clear.\n\nThe organism is present in soils, and small amounts of dust accumulated in the pipe and triggered the contamination, the company said. Any consumer product recalls that may need to take place will be initiated by the respective food companies.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated with the food products.

Although Harmony Chai has received no complaints of illness related to the consumption of the recalled product, there is a potential hazard that can occur when tea beverages are inadequately processed. These batches have the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause life-threatening illness or death. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled. Illness due to foodborne botulism is extremely rare. According to Washington State Department of Health, during the last 10 years, Communicable Disease Epidemiology (CDE) has received 0-2 reports of foodborne botulism each year.\n\nAll lots of the following products have been recalled:\n- concentrated Black Spiced Chai bottled in 22 oz (650 mL) amber glass UPC 0510501311 and 64 oz (1892.7 mL) amber glass jugs UPC 0510501301\n- decaffeinated Rooibos Chai bottled in 22 oz (624.25 mL) amber glass UPC 9450402431 and 64 oz (1892.7 mL) amber glass jugs UPC 0510501301\n\nConcentrated Black Spiced Chai and Decaffeinated Rooibos Chai were distributed through farmers markets, grocery stores, and cafes in Western Washington. Areas of distribution include the San Juan, Skagit, Snohomish, and King Counties.\n\nIt was discovered through Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) testing of routine samples that the tea was not properly processed. Harmony Chai and WSDA are working together to determine the cause of this problem.

Although Harmony Chai has received no complaints of illness related to the consumption of the recalled product, there is a potential hazard that can occur when tea beverages are inadequately processed. These batches have the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause life-threatening illness or death. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled. Illness due to foodborne botulism is extremely rare. According to Washington State Department of Health, during the last 10 years, Communicable Disease Epidemiology (CDE) has received 0-2 reports of foodborne botulism each year.\n\nAll lots of the following products have been recalled:\n- concentrated Black Spiced Chai bottled in 22 oz (650 mL) amber glass UPC 0510501311 and 64 oz (1892.7 mL) amber glass jugs UPC 0510501301\n- decaffeinated Rooibos Chai bottled in 22 oz (624.25 mL) amber glass UPC 9450402431 and 64 oz (1892.7 mL) amber glass jugs UPC 0510501301\n\nConcentrated Black Spiced Chai and Decaffeinated Rooibos Chai were distributed through farmers markets, grocery stores, and cafes in Western Washington. Areas of distribution include the San Juan, Skagit, Snohomish, and King Counties.\n\nIt was discovered through Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) testing of routine samples that the tea was not properly processed. Harmony Chai and WSDA are working together to determine the cause of this problem. Harmony Chai has not had any reported illnesses to date but consumers who have purchased Harmony Chai Concentrated Black Spiced Chai or Decaffeinated Rooibos Chai recently are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products.

However, this initial diagnosis must be confirmed by the mouse-protection or ELISA test to separate avian botulism from algal poisoning, castorbean poisoning, and other toxic processes that cause similar signs of disease.\" (...) \"The most widely used test for avian botulism is the mouse-protection test, although an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for type C toxin has been developed recently\".\n\nA map of the affected area can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/5mhm. - Mod.PMB]\nSee Also\nBotulism, avian, fish - Australia (02): (NS) 20130127.1517277\nBotulism, avian, fish - Australia: (QL) 20130124.1512183\n2012\n----\nBotulism, avian - USA (09): (MI) aquatic birds, susp. 20121024.1360129\nBotulism, avian - USA (08): (WI, OR) aquatic birds 20120925.1309132\nBotulism, avian - USA (07): (MI) aquatic birds 20120912.1290085\nBotulism, avian - USA (06): (MD) aquatic birds 20120829.1271009\nBotulism, avian - USA (05): (WY) pheasants 20120824.1262052\nBotulism, avian - USA (04): (CA) waterfowl, susp. 20120802.1225667\nBotulism, avian - USA (03): (OH) waterfowl, susp 20120706.1192230\nBotulism, avian - USA (02): (HI) 20120624.1178706\nBotulism, avian - USA: (CA) 20120430.1117985\nBotulism, avian - New Zealand: (CB) susp 20120213.1040575\n2011\n----\nBotulism, avian - USA: (CO) 20110914.2797\n2010\n----\nBotulism, avian - USA (05): (FL) susp. 20100817.2848\nUndiagnosed die-off, avian - USA (08): (CA) botulism susp. 20110923.2878\n.................................................sb/pmb/mj/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "botulism"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-12-15 00:00:00", "2021-01-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2010-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Nowra", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "WY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "New Zealand"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1531916", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Botulism - Armenia: home canned vegetable", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1531916", "date": "2012-12-15 15:28:14", "main_text": "BOTULISM - USA: (RHODE ISLAND) (16): MULTIPLE JARRED FOODS, RISK, RECALL\n************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 14 Dec 2012\nSource: Providence (RI) Journal [edited]\nhttp://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2012/12/farmstead-foods-recalls-cheeses-meats-jarred-vegetables-on-botulism-or-list.html\n\n\nA local artisan food shop is voluntarily recalling some of its products after an inspection by the Rhode Island Department of Health, but the company said it hasn't changed its production methods since it passed inspection in 2010.\n\nThe health department, on Fri 15 Dec 2012, advised consumers not to eat certain cheeses, meats and jarred vegetables produced by Farmstead Inc. and sold at a shop at 186 Wayland Ave., Providence, Rhode Island, and through <www.farmsteadinc.com>.\n\nHealth inspectors initiated an investigation after receiving a tip, the Health Department said, and no one has reported an illness associated with Farmstead foods.

The ill individuals shared beets that had not been canned properly. The beets had been placed into jars, heated in a boiling water bath, and then stored at room temperature. The lack of oxygen, low-acid environment, and room temperature creates ideal conditions for _Clostridium botulinum_ spores to germinate and produce the toxin. While boiling water bath temperatures will kill many foodborne pathogens, _C. botulinum_ spores are tough and require higher heat to be inactivated.

The ill individuals shared beets that had not been canned properly. The beets had been placed into jars, heated in a boiling water bath, and then stored at room temperature. The lack of oxygen, low-acid environment, and room temperature creates ideal conditions for _Clostridium botulinum_ spores to germinate and produce the toxin. While boiling water bath temperatures will kill many foodborne pathogens, _C. botulinum_ spores are tough and require higher heat to be inactivated. The only way to do this in a home kitchen is through the use of a pressure canner.\n\n- Low acid foods (pH greater than 4.6) like beets cannot be safely canned using a boiling water bath unless acidi\ufb01ed according to a tested recipe.\n- _Clostridium botulinum_ occur in soil and foods that come from the soil.

Any person, child or\nadult, with these symptoms should seek urgent medical advice.\nAntitoxins have proved very effective in treating the condition.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED awaits more information regarding the source of the botulinum\ntoxin in these 2 linked cases.

The\nFDA has specific guidelines on canned foods and the sealing process\nand the tuna recalled did not meet those standards.\n\nThese products were distributed in 10 states including Wisconsin,\nNebraska, Utah, Pennsylvania, New York, Maine, Colorado, Indiana,\nCalifornia and Oregon. The distribution dates were in February and\nMay [2010]. The 12 ounce Chicken of the Sea solid white tuna packed\nin water has a upc code of 4800000262, \"Best By Date 2/10/2014\" and\nproduct code 7OA1E ASWAB, 7OA2E ASWAB, 7OA3E ASWAB, 7OA4E ASWAB,\n7OA5E ASWAB, 7OAEE ASWAB, or 7OAFE ASWAB. The best by dates and\nproduct code numbers are imprinted on the bottom of the cans. No\nother Chicken of the Sea products are affected by this recall.\n\nThere have been no reports of sickness identified with the\nconsumption of this product.\n\nCanned food with loose seals can spoil quickly and has the potential\nto cause sickness.

A 2nd case is\nsuspected. Both individuals, a man and a woman, are hospitalized and\non ventilators.\n\nThe individuals became ill in December 2009, said Marianne Patnode,\ncommunicable disease services coordinator for the Yakima Health\nDistrict. An educational outreach campaign has been underway to warn\nintravenous drug users that they are at risk from a contaminated\nsupply of heroin.\n\nPatnode said Yakima sees sporadic cases of botulism among intravenous\ndrug users who cut their heroin with a substance, often dirt or honey,\nthat contains the spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.\n\nWhile the 1st case was confirmed the 3rd week of December 2009, the\n2nd person's illness was too far along to be diagnosed. That is, the\npatient didn't have enough free toxin to be tested, but Patnode said\nclinically, physicians know the individual was poisoned with botulism.\nSymptoms include blurred vision and difficulty breathing. The illness\ncan progress to paralysis. Individuals have to be ventilated for\nseveral weeks and then weaned from the ventilators.\n\nYakima County's last significant outbreak of wound botulism was in\n2003, when there were 5 cases.\n\n[Byline: Leah Beth Ward]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a\nwound, germinate and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of the\nwound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs).\nThose IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or\nintramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.\n\nBlack tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound\nbotulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a\ngummy black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly\nin Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally\ninjected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The\nlocal area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess-forming.\n\nThe tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents\n(\"cutting\" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of the\n_Clostridium botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the\ndevelopment of wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin,\ncleaning the injection paraphernalia or sharing needles.\n\nClinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending,\nflaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the\nseverity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early\nin the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results\nof microbiological testing.\n\nIn cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical\ndebridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse\nafter antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl\npenicillin and metronidazole.\n\nToxin type A (one of 7 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of\nboth foodborne and wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by\ntoxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis\nand a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\nAll toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the\npresynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine\ntransmission across the neuromuscular junction.\n\nYakima County, Washington, as noted, has been the location for\nprevious clusters of cases (2; see ProMED postings \"Botulism, wound,\ndrug-related - USA (WA)\" 20060329.0953 and \"Botulism, wound,\ndrug-related - USA (WA)\" 20070603.1795).\n\n1.

A 2nd case is\nsuspected. Both individuals, a man and a woman, are hospitalized and\non ventilators.\n\nThe individuals became ill in December 2009, said Marianne Patnode,\ncommunicable disease services coordinator for the Yakima Health\nDistrict. An educational outreach campaign has been underway to warn\nintravenous drug users that they are at risk from a contaminated\nsupply of heroin.\n\nPatnode said Yakima sees sporadic cases of botulism among intravenous\ndrug users who cut their heroin with a substance, often dirt or honey,\nthat contains the spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.\n\nWhile the 1st case was confirmed the 3rd week of December 2009, the\n2nd person's illness was too far along to be diagnosed. That is, the\npatient didn't have enough free toxin to be tested, but Patnode said\nclinically, physicians know the individual was poisoned with botulism.\nSymptoms include blurred vision and difficulty breathing. The illness\ncan progress to paralysis. Individuals have to be ventilated for\nseveral weeks and then weaned from the ventilators.\n\nYakima County's last significant outbreak of wound botulism was in\n2003, when there were 5 cases.\n\n[Byline: Leah Beth Ward]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a\nwound, germinate and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of the\nwound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs).\nThose IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or\nintramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.\n\nBlack tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound\nbotulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a\ngummy black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly\nin Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally\ninjected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The\nlocal area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess-forming.\n\nThe tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents\n(\"cutting\" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of the\n_Clostridium botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the\ndevelopment of wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin,\ncleaning the injection paraphernalia or sharing needles.\n\nClinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending,\nflaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the\nseverity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early\nin the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results\nof microbiological testing.\n\nIn cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical\ndebridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse\nafter antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl\npenicillin and metronidazole.\n\nToxin type A (one of 7 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of\nboth foodborne and wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by\ntoxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis\nand a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\nAll toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the\npresynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine\ntransmission across the neuromuscular junction.\n\nYakima County, Washington, as noted, has been the location for\nprevious clusters of cases (2; see ProMED postings \"Botulism, wound,\ndrug-related - USA (WA)\" 20060329.0953 and \"Botulism, wound,\ndrug-related - USA (WA)\" 20070603.1795).\n\n1.

A 2nd case is\nsuspected. Both individuals, a man and a woman, are hospitalized and\non ventilators.\n\nThe individuals became ill in December 2009, said Marianne Patnode,\ncommunicable disease services coordinator for the Yakima Health\nDistrict. An educational outreach campaign has been underway to warn\nintravenous drug users that they are at risk from a contaminated\nsupply of heroin.\n\nPatnode said Yakima sees sporadic cases of botulism among intravenous\ndrug users who cut their heroin with a substance, often dirt or honey,\nthat contains the spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.\n\nWhile the 1st case was confirmed the 3rd week of December 2009, the\n2nd person's illness was too far along to be diagnosed. That is, the\npatient didn't have enough free toxin to be tested, but Patnode said\nclinically, physicians know the individual was poisoned with botulism.\nSymptoms include blurred vision and difficulty breathing. The illness\ncan progress to paralysis. Individuals have to be ventilated for\nseveral weeks and then weaned from the ventilators.\n\nYakima County's last significant outbreak of wound botulism was in\n2003, when there were 5 cases.\n\n[Byline: Leah Beth Ward]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a\nwound, germinate and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of the\nwound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs).\nThose IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or\nintramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.\n\nBlack tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound\nbotulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a\ngummy black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly\nin Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally\ninjected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The\nlocal area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess-forming.\n\nThe tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents\n(\"cutting\" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of the\n_Clostridium botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the\ndevelopment of wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin,\ncleaning the injection paraphernalia or sharing needles.\n\nClinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending,\nflaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the\nseverity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early\nin the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results\nof microbiological testing.\n\nIn cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical\ndebridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse\nafter antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl\npenicillin and metronidazole.\n\nToxin type A (one of 7 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of\nboth foodborne and wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by\ntoxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis\nand a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\nAll toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the\npresynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine\ntransmission across the neuromuscular junction.\n\nYakima County, Washington, as noted, has been the location for\nprevious clusters of cases (2; see ProMED postings \"Botulism, wound,\ndrug-related - USA (WA)\" 20060329.0953 and \"Botulism, wound,\ndrug-related - USA (WA)\" 20070603.1795).\n\n1.

A 2nd case is\nsuspected. Both individuals, a man and a woman, are hospitalized and\non ventilators.\n\nThe individuals became ill in December 2009, said Marianne Patnode,\ncommunicable disease services coordinator for the Yakima Health\nDistrict. An educational outreach campaign has been underway to warn\nintravenous drug users that they are at risk from a contaminated\nsupply of heroin.\n\nPatnode said Yakima sees sporadic cases of botulism among intravenous\ndrug users who cut their heroin with a substance, often dirt or honey,\nthat contains the spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.\n\nWhile the 1st case was confirmed the 3rd week of December 2009, the\n2nd person's illness was too far along to be diagnosed. That is, the\npatient didn't have enough free toxin to be tested, but Patnode said\nclinically, physicians know the individual was poisoned with botulism.\nSymptoms include blurred vision and difficulty breathing. The illness\ncan progress to paralysis. Individuals have to be ventilated for\nseveral weeks and then weaned from the ventilators.\n\nYakima County's last significant outbreak of wound botulism was in\n2003, when there were 5 cases.\n\n[Byline: Leah Beth Ward]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a\nwound, germinate and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of the\nwound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs).\nThose IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or\nintramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.\n\nBlack tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound\nbotulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a\ngummy black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly\nin Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally\ninjected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The\nlocal area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess-forming.\n\nThe tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents\n(\"cutting\" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of the\n_Clostridium botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the\ndevelopment of wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin,\ncleaning the injection paraphernalia or sharing needles.\n\nClinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending,\nflaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the\nseverity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early\nin the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results\nof microbiological testing.\n\nIn cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical\ndebridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse\nafter antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl\npenicillin and metronidazole.\n\nToxin type A (one of 7 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of\nboth foodborne and wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by\ntoxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis\nand a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\nAll toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the\npresynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine\ntransmission across the neuromuscular junction.\n\nYakima County, Washington, as noted, has been the location for\nprevious clusters of cases (2; see ProMED postings \"Botulism, wound,\ndrug-related - USA (WA)\" 20060329.0953 and \"Botulism, wound,\ndrug-related - USA (WA)\" 20070603.1795).\n\n1.

These\nconditions will have encouraged the bacteria to \"flower.\"\n\nIt was initially thought that a virus had been transmitted to the\nresident fowl by a wild duck. But that has been ruled out following\ntests at the Regional Veterinary Laboratory at Model Farm Road. Avian\ninfluenza, more commonly known as the dreaded bird flu, was also\nquickly ruled out, leaving _Clostridium botulinum_ as the likely\nculprit.\n\nMr Dooge said it was vital that all carcasses were removed from the\nwater and the central island as quickly as possible to prevent the\nlethal disease from attacking more wildlife. He predicted more fowl\nwould die before the situation was brought under control. \"It is vital\nwe continue to remove all dead and dying birds. If maggots get onto a\ncarcass they will concentrate the toxins and make them easier to\nspread,\" he said.\n\nAs there is no laboratory in Ireland equipped to confirm cases of\nbotulism -- commonly known as a potentially lethal strain of food\npoisoning -- samples will have to be sent to Scotland and it is\nexpected it will take days before the results are known. \"We need\nconfirmation of this. We need a scientific explanation,\" Mr Dooge said.\n\nHe has also called in the aquatic services section at University\nCollege Cork to analyse the water quality at the 9-acre lake near\nTogher. \"It fits the pattern of _Clostridium botulinum_ as both ducks\nand fish are susceptible to it. We want to get on top of this as soon\nas possible. It is a dreadful situation,\" Mr Dooge said.\n\nThe chief veterinary officer has also held discussions on the problem\nwith the coarse angling club, which stocks the lake. The Lough is one\nof the premier carp fisheries in Ireland. About 2000 carp are in the\nlake and it attracts thousands of coarse anglers every year, providing\na welcome financial boost to the local economy.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nNick Honhold\n4/5 Grandville\nEdinburgh\n<nick.honhold@gmail.com>\n\n[We are grateful to Dr Honhold for forwarding the above newswire,\nfurther to our RFI of Tue 7 Jul 2009.\n\nBotulism in waterfowl is generally caused by one of 2 toxin types.\nType E toxin is found primarily in decaying fish and causes\nintoxication in those feeding on them.

These\nconditions will have encouraged the bacteria to \"flower.\"\n\nIt was initially thought that a virus had been transmitted to the\nresident fowl by a wild duck. But that has been ruled out following\ntests at the Regional Veterinary Laboratory at Model Farm Road. Avian\ninfluenza, more commonly known as the dreaded bird flu, was also\nquickly ruled out, leaving _Clostridium botulinum_ as the likely\nculprit.\n\nMr Dooge said it was vital that all carcasses were removed from the\nwater and the central island as quickly as possible to prevent the\nlethal disease from attacking more wildlife. He predicted more fowl\nwould die before the situation was brought under control. \"It is vital\nwe continue to remove all dead and dying birds. If maggots get onto a\ncarcass they will concentrate the toxins and make them easier to\nspread,\" he said.\n\nAs there is no laboratory in Ireland equipped to confirm cases of\nbotulism -- commonly known as a potentially lethal strain of food\npoisoning -- samples will have to be sent to Scotland and it is\nexpected it will take days before the results are known. \"We need\nconfirmation of this. We need a scientific explanation,\" Mr Dooge said.\n\nHe has also called in the aquatic services section at University\nCollege Cork to analyse the water quality at the 9-acre lake near\nTogher. \"It fits the pattern of _Clostridium botulinum_ as both ducks\nand fish are susceptible to it. We want to get on top of this as soon\nas possible. It is a dreadful situation,\" Mr Dooge said.\n\nThe chief veterinary officer has also held discussions on the problem\nwith the coarse angling club, which stocks the lake. The Lough is one\nof the premier carp fisheries in Ireland. About 2000 carp are in the\nlake and it attracts thousands of coarse anglers every year, providing\na welcome financial boost to the local economy.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nNick Honhold\n4/5 Grandville\nEdinburgh\n<nick.honhold@gmail.com>\n\n[We are grateful to Dr Honhold for forwarding the above newswire,\nfurther to our RFI of Tue 7 Jul 2009.\n\nBotulism in waterfowl is generally caused by one of 2 toxin types.\nType E toxin is found primarily in decaying fish and causes\nintoxication in those feeding on them.

These\nconditions will have encouraged the bacteria to \"flower.\"\n\nIt was initially thought that a virus had been transmitted to the\nresident fowl by a wild duck. But that has been ruled out following\ntests at the Regional Veterinary Laboratory at Model Farm Road. Avian\ninfluenza, more commonly known as the dreaded bird flu, was also\nquickly ruled out, leaving _Clostridium botulinum_ as the likely\nculprit.\n\nMr Dooge said it was vital that all carcasses were removed from the\nwater and the central island as quickly as possible to prevent the\nlethal disease from attacking more wildlife. He predicted more fowl\nwould die before the situation was brought under control. \"It is vital\nwe continue to remove all dead and dying birds. If maggots get onto a\ncarcass they will concentrate the toxins and make them easier to\nspread,\" he said.\n\nAs there is no laboratory in Ireland equipped to confirm cases of\nbotulism -- commonly known as a potentially lethal strain of food\npoisoning -- samples will have to be sent to Scotland and it is\nexpected it will take days before the results are known. \"We need\nconfirmation of this. We need a scientific explanation,\" Mr Dooge said.\n\nHe has also called in the aquatic services section at University\nCollege Cork to analyse the water quality at the 9-acre lake near\nTogher. \"It fits the pattern of _Clostridium botulinum_ as both ducks\nand fish are susceptible to it. We want to get on top of this as soon\nas possible. It is a dreadful situation,\" Mr Dooge said.\n\nThe chief veterinary officer has also held discussions on the problem\nwith the coarse angling club, which stocks the lake. The Lough is one\nof the premier carp fisheries in Ireland. About 2000 carp are in the\nlake and it attracts thousands of coarse anglers every year, providing\na welcome financial boost to the local economy.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nNick Honhold\n4/5 Grandville\nEdinburgh\n<nick.honhold@gmail.com>\n\n[We are grateful to Dr Honhold for forwarding the above newswire,\nfurther to our RFI of Tue 7 Jul 2009.\n\nBotulism in waterfowl is generally caused by one of 2 toxin types.\nType E toxin is found primarily in decaying fish and causes\nintoxication in those feeding on them. It may also cause intoxication\nin humans.\n\nType C toxin, on the other hand, is not related to fish.

The cases,\nall in the Long Beach-South Bay area, have led authorities to suspect\nthat the local heroin supply may be contaminated with [spores of the]\ntoxin-producing bacteria.\n\nMost of the heroin sold in California comes from Mexico and is sold\nas a viscous dark-colored liquid, instead of the refined, white\npowder variety from Asia.\n\nDr Jonathan Fielding, Los Angeles County's public health director,\nsaid anyone with symptoms of botulism needs to go to an emergency room.\n\nThere are about 30 cases of wound botulism nationwide every year.\n\n[Byline: Rong-Gong Lin II]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a\nwound, germinate and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of\nthe wound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs).\nThose IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or\nintramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.\n\nClinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending,\nflaccid paralysis.

All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic\nsystem at the presynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking\nacetylcholine transmission across the neuromuscular junction. - Mod.LL\n\nThe state of California can be seen on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail\ninteractive map of the USA at\n<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?g=5368381&v=35.367,-118.201,6>.\nLong Beach and South Bay are located in Los Angeles County, southern\nCalifornia. - CopyEd.MJ]\nSee Also\n2007\n----\nBotulism, wound, drug-related - USA (WA) 20070603.1795\n2006\n----\nBotulism, wound, drug-related - USA (WA) 20060329.0953\n2005\n----\nBotulism, wound, drug-related - Germany (NRW) 20051219.3636\n2004\n----\nBotulism, wound, drug-related - USA (CA) 20041219.3345\nBotulism, wound, drug-related - UK (England, Wales) 20040923.2627\n2002\n----\nBotulism, wound drug-related - UK 20021116.5821\nBotulism, wound drug-related - UK not Ireland 20021101.5684\nBotulism, wound, drug-related - UK, Ireland 20021031.5675\nBotulism, wound, drug-associated (02) 20020305.3690\nBotulism, wound, drug-related 20020303.3670\nBotulism, Wound, Drug-related - USA (California) 20020228.3655\nBotulism, wound, drug-related - UK: alert 20020223.3614\n2001\n----\nBotulism, wound, drug-related - UK (Scotland) 20011005.2414\nUnexplained deaths, drug addicts - UK: report 20011003.2398\n2000\n----\nUnexplained deaths, drug addicts - UK (07) 20000820.1388\nUnexplained deaths, drug addicts - UK: diagnosis 20000615.0977\nUnexplained deaths, drug addicts - UK 20000608.0922\nBotulism, wound, drug-related - Worldwide: background 20000521.0802\nBotulism, wound, drug-related - UK (England) 20000518.0777\nUnexplained deaths, drug addicts - Ireland & Scotland 20000531.0874\nUnexplained deaths, drug addicts - Ireland (Dublin) 20000525.0825\nUnexplained deaths, human - UK (Scotland) (09) 20000522.0807\nUnexplained deaths, human - UK (Scotland) 20000511.0717\n...................................ll/mj/dk\n\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Botulism survivors may feel\nfatigued and short of breath for years to come.\n\n\"The processing is what is generally not done correctly,\" Zmuda said\nof food that is preserved at home. \"There is a heat step at the end\nof canning that is often forgotten.\" Zmuda said although the toxins\nin the food can be destroyed through heating, the spores are\nheat-stable, that is, cooking it will not kill the spores.\" [See\nModerator's Comments - Mod.LL]\n\nLiz Smith of the Ohio State University Wyandot County Extension said\nthere are 2 different ways to can: By pressure cooker and boiling\nwater method. \"It can be a very complicated process,\" Smith said. \"If\nyou don't have the proper temperature or amount of time, the can will\nnot seal correctly. If you use the boiling method, and don't boil the\nproper length of time, again, it will not seal correctly.\" Smith\nadded that people who can at home need to make sure the gauge on\ntheir old pressure cookers is properly adjusted and in good working order.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Susan Baekeland\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most USA botulism postings relate to the alert that a particular\ncommercially prepared food was not adequately made which would\nincrease a risk of intoxication with _C. botulinum toxin_. In most of\nthese, no clear evidence of botulism is found in the food product.\nWhen botulism does occur related to food, it is most likely to be\nhome-prepared as here. It should be noted that in typical food-borne\nbotulism, the toxin is preformed in the food when ingested rather\nthan disease being produced with ingestion of spores or bacilli as\nimplied in the posting. Infant botulism (and its very rare adult\nequivalent, adult intestinal toxemia botulism) are caused by\ningestion of spores which germinate and toxin is formed _in situ_.\n\nAdditionally, it is also not true that the canning process is\nineffective in killing the spores. The toxin can be destroyed by\nheating contaminated food to 85 degrees C (185 degrees F) for at\nleast 5 minutes. Spores are inactivated by heating to 121 degrees C\n(250 degrees F) under 15-20 lb/square inch pressure for at least 20\nminutes (1).\n\n1. Sobel J: Botulism.

However, state inspectors on Wednesday\n[30 Jan 2008] at the Olivier Olive Oil Products Inc. plant found that\nacid levels in the jars of dip were too low to kill such bacteria. In\nan insufficiently acidic environment, the bacteria can grow in sealed\njars, producing one of the most potent and deadly toxins known.\n\n\"This is all a precaution,\" Kennelly said. \"We have no evidence of\ntoxin production.\"\n\nThe company immediately ordered a voluntary recall of 10 000 jars,\nabout a year's production of the olive oil dip, which contains garlic\nand basil as well as Parmesan and Asiago cheeses. The products were\nsold through Olivier stores in St. Helena and Truckee, and are\ndistributed nationwide through Williams-Sonoma.\n\nAffected lots are numbered OPA 34171, OPA 23471, OAP 17271, OAP\n17671, OAP 36061, OAP 36161, and OPA 33961. Consumers who find a jar\nwith one of those lot numbers are encouraged to call the state hot\nline at (800) 495-3232.\n\n[Byline: Sabin Russell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts\nsuch recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases\nassociated with the food. Most of the food recalls are related to\ndefective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily\ndo, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_.\n\nInfused oils have previously been implicated in botulism outbreaks in\nthe USA and worldwide (1-4). An acidification step in the preparation\nof herb-infused oil may be necessary to prevent the potential\nproduction of botulism toxins.\n\nAs a result of previous outbreaks in BC (Canada) and in New York\n(USA) the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Code requires 2\nbarriers in the destruction of spores and in the prevention of toxin\nproduction in a commercial product of this type (reduced oxygen\npackaging): 1) destruction of the spores by heat (thermal processing)\n2) inhibition of toxin production by altering the food through\nacidification, controlling aw (water activity), the use of salt and\npreservatives, or refrigeration. Also, it is because some single\nbarriers can result in a product unacceptable to consumers that\nmultiple barriers are used. The common 2nd barrier in infused oil of\nthis kind is acidification via phosphoric or citric acid, for\nexample. The pH of the final product should be 4.6 or less.\n\nReferences:\n1.

However, state inspectors on Wednesday\n[30 Jan 2008] at the Olivier Olive Oil Products Inc. plant found that\nacid levels in the jars of dip were too low to kill such bacteria. In\nan insufficiently acidic environment, the bacteria can grow in sealed\njars, producing one of the most potent and deadly toxins known.\n\n\"This is all a precaution,\" Kennelly said. \"We have no evidence of\ntoxin production.\"\n\nThe company immediately ordered a voluntary recall of 10 000 jars,\nabout a year's production of the olive oil dip, which contains garlic\nand basil as well as Parmesan and Asiago cheeses. The products were\nsold through Olivier stores in St. Helena and Truckee, and are\ndistributed nationwide through Williams-Sonoma.\n\nAffected lots are numbered OPA 34171, OPA 23471, OAP 17271, OAP\n17671, OAP 36061, OAP 36161, and OPA 33961.

Most of the food recalls are related to\ndefective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily\ndo, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_.\n\nInfused oils have previously been implicated in botulism outbreaks in\nthe USA and worldwide (1-4). An acidification step in the preparation\nof herb-infused oil may be necessary to prevent the potential\nproduction of botulism toxins.\n\nAs a result of previous outbreaks in BC (Canada) and in New York\n(USA) the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Code requires 2\nbarriers in the destruction of spores and in the prevention of toxin\nproduction in a commercial product of this type (reduced oxygen\npackaging): 1) destruction of the spores by heat (thermal processing)\n2) inhibition of toxin production by altering the food through\nacidification, controlling aw (water activity), the use of salt and\npreservatives, or refrigeration. Also, it is because some single\nbarriers can result in a product unacceptable to consumers that\nmultiple barriers are used.

However, state inspectors on Wednesday\n[30 Jan 2008] at the Olivier Olive Oil Products Inc. plant found that\nacid levels in the jars of dip were too low to kill such bacteria. In\nan insufficiently acidic environment, the bacteria can grow in sealed\njars, producing one of the most potent and deadly toxins known.\n\n\"This is all a precaution,\" Kennelly said. \"We have no evidence of\ntoxin production.\"\n\nThe company immediately ordered a voluntary recall of 10 000 jars,\nabout a year's production of the olive oil dip, which contains garlic\nand basil as well as Parmesan and Asiago cheeses.

An acidification step in the preparation\nof herb-infused oil may be necessary to prevent the potential\nproduction of botulism toxins.\n\nAs a result of previous outbreaks in BC (Canada) and in New York\n(USA) the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Code requires 2\nbarriers in the destruction of spores and in the prevention of toxin\nproduction in a commercial product of this type (reduced oxygen\npackaging): 1) destruction of the spores by heat (thermal processing)\n2) inhibition of toxin production by altering the food through\nacidification, controlling aw (water activity), the use of salt and\npreservatives, or refrigeration.

A relative\nsaid that medical authorities told the family of the 57-year-old\nfemale physician that her death may be related to botulism poisoning.\nThe doctor's younger brother said the family is still awaiting\nlaboratory results to confirm that the death was caused by botulism.\nThey expect those results Thu 15 Nov 2007, he said.\n\nThe brother said the state health department approached the family\nlast week about the doctor's illness. The doctor's husband is also\nill and was still hospitalized, he said, and added that he doesn't\nknow whether that illness is also related to botulism.\n\nThe relative's comments come a day after the Virginia Department of\nHealth said it is investigating 2 reported cases of possible\nfood-borne botulism in the Alleghany-Roanoke City Health District,\nwhich includes Roanoke County, where the couple lives.\n\nOn Tue 13 Nov 2007, the health department would not specify when and\nwhere the cases originated or whether either one was fatal. They said\nthe 2 cases are related to home-canned food and are isolated\nincidents confined to a single household.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED would appreciate more information regarding all 4 cases,\nwhether botulism is indeed proven, and what the toxin type(s) are. It\nwould seem unusual to have a number of suspected or proven cases over\na short period of time.\n\nThe city and county of Roanoke are located in the central part of\nVirginia just west of the Blue Ridge Mountains and can be found on a\nmap at:\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke,_Virginia>.\n- Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nBotulism risk, canned green beans - N.

The citations refer to botulism that developed in a group of 8\n\"backyard\" cats that were feed meat from a dead pelican that was\nthought to have been accidentally electrocuted by a high-tension wire.\nIn this discussion part of the paper, the authors (including Dr.\nShlosberg) state (with citation numbers changed to be consecutive and\nreformatted) that:\n\"The occurrence of botulism in carnivores is very rare. Several\nreports of type C botulism in dogs (1), including one following\ncarrion consumption (2), and lions (3) have been published. To the\nbest of our knowledge, however, there are no reports of natural\nbotulism in cats, although these animals have been used as\nexperimental models (4). Interestingly, the cats were found to be\nmuch more susceptible to parenteral exposure to botulism toxin than\nto oral exposure (5). Attempts to elucidate the mechanism upon which\nthis difference in susceptibility is based using toxin neutralization\nby natural antibodies, tissues, and digestive enzymes were unsuccessful (5).\n1.

As yet, no deaths have been registered in 2007.\nRospotrebnadzor stressed that the vehicles for transmission of the\ndisease, as a rule, are canned mushrooms and vegetables and smoked\nfish prepared in domestic conditions.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[According to the latest information, botulinum toxin type A has been\nfound in the blood of the patients.\n<http://www.dontr.ru/Environ/WebObjects/dontr.woa/wa/Main?textid=23626>\n(in Russian).\nBotulinum toxin type E, usually associated with marine sources,\nprevails in the region. More than 20 cases of botulism, including 5\nfatalities were reported in the Rostov region in 2006. Most\nfrequently, lethal outcomes were connected with late access to\nmedical care (2-3 days after onset). Cases of the disease related to\nthe consumption of dried and smoked fish are prevalent in the\nsouthern areas of the region located in a steppe zone in the mouth of\nthe river Don and on the coast of the Taganrog Gulf of the Azov sea.\nBotulism associated with the consumption of canned mushrooms more\noften is reported in the northern forest-steppe areas. The disease\nlinked to the consumption of home-canned vegetables occurs everywhere.\nThe Rostov-on-Don Region is located in the southern part of the\nEast-European plateau and partly in the North Caucasian region.

They\nwent into the ICU that same day, and the mother followed them the\nnext day, spending almost 22 days unconscious and on a respirator.\nShe still suffers from weakness.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[What is interesting in this case is that only some members of the\nfamily became ill. If all members of the family consumed the same\ndish, then it would seem likely that all should be affected. As only\nsome members were affected, we are left to wonder about the\ndifference. Was the food left over and not refrigerated promptly, or\nnot heated thoroughly, so that the toxin was allowed to form? Did the\naffected members consume more of the product?\n_Clostridium botulinum_ is an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming\nrod bacterium that produces a potent neurotoxin. The spores are\nheat-resistant and can survive in foods that are incorrectly or\nminimally processed. Seven types (A, B, C, D, E, F & G) of botulism\nare recognized based on the antigenic specificity of the toxin\nproduced by each strain. Types A, B, E and F cause human botulism.\nTypes C and D cause most cases of botulism in animals. Animals most\ncommonly affected are wildfowl and poultry, cattle, horses and some\nspecies of fish. Although type G has been isolated from soil in\nArgentina, no outbreaks involving it have been recognized.\nFoodborne botulism (as distinct from wound botulism and infant\nbotulism) is a severe type of food poisoning caused by the ingestion\nof foods containing the potent neurotoxin formed during growth of the\norganism. The toxin is heat labile and can be destroyed if heated at\n80 C for 10 minutes or longer. The incidence of the disease is low,\nbut the disease is of considerable concern because of its high\nmortality rate if not treated immediately and properly. Most of the\n10 to 30 outbreaks that are reported annually in the USA are\nassociated with inadequately processed, home-canned foods, but\noccasionally commercially produced foods have been involved in\noutbreaks. Sausages, meat products, canned vegetables and seafood\nproducts have been the most frequent vehicles for human botulism.\nThe organism and its spores are widely distributed in nature. They\noccur in both cultivated and forest soils, bottom sediments of\nstreams, lakes, and coastal waters, in the intestinal tracts of fish\nand mammals, and in the gills and viscera of crabs and other shellfish.\nThere are 4 types of botulism recognized: foodborne, infant, wound,\nand a form of botulism whose classification is as yet undetermined.\nCertain foods have been reported as sources of spores in cases of\ninfant botulism and the undetermined category; wound botulism is not\nrelated to foods.\nFoodborne botulism is the name of the disease (actually a foodborne\nintoxication) caused by the consumption of foods containing the\nneurotoxin produced by _C. botulinum_.\nThe undetermined category of botulism involves adult cases in which a\nspecific food or wound source cannot be identified. It has been\nsuggested that some cases of botulism assigned to this category might\nresult from intestinal colonization in adults, with in vivo\nproduction of toxin. Reports in the medical literature suggest the\nexistence of a form of botulism similar to infant botulism, but\noccurring in adults. In these cases, the patients had surgical\nalterations of the gastrointestinal tract and/or antibiotic therapy.\nIt is proposed that these procedures may have altered the normal gut\nflora and allowed _C. botulinum_ to colonize the intestinal tract.\nThe infective dose: a very small amount (a few nanograms) of toxin\ncan cause illness.\nOnset of symptoms in foodborne botulism is usually 18 to 36 hours\nafter ingestion of the food containing the toxin, although cases have\nvaried from 4 hours to 8 days. Early signs of intoxication consist of\nmarked lassitude, weakness and vertigo, usually followed by double\nvision and progressive difficulty in speaking and swallowing.\nDifficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal\ndistention, and constipation may also be common symptoms.\nThe types of foods involved in botulism vary according to food\npreservation and eating habits in different regions. Any food that is\nconducive to outgrowth and toxin production that when processed\nallows spore survival, and is not subsequently heated before\nconsumption, can be associated with botulism. Almost any type of food\nthat is not very acidic (pH above 4.6) can support growth and toxin\nproduction by _C. botulinum_. Botulinal toxin has been demonstrated\nin a considerable variety of foods, such as canned corn, peppers,\ngreen beans, soups, beets, asparagus, mushrooms, ripe olives,\nspinach, tuna fish, chicken and chicken livers and liver pate, and\nluncheon meats, ham, sausage, stuffed eggplant, lobster, and smoked\nand salted fish.\nThe incidence of the disease is low, but the mortality rate is high\nif not treated immediately and properly. Some cases of botulism may\ngo undiagnosed because symptoms are transient or mild, or\nmisdiagnosed as Guillain-Barre syndrome.\nBotulinum toxin causes flaccid paralysis by blocking motor nerve\nterminals at the myoneural [nerve-muscle] junction. The flaccid\nparalysis progresses symmetrically downward, usually starting with\nthe eyes and face, to the throat, chest and extremities. When the\ndiaphragm and chest muscles become fully involved, respiration is\ninhibited and death from asphyxia results. Recommended treatment for\nfoodborne botulism includes early administration of botulinal\nantitoxin and intensive supportive care (including mechanical\nbreathing assistance).\nAll people are believed to be susceptible to the foodborne intoxication.\nAlthough botulism can be diagnosed by clinical symptoms alone,\ndifferentiation from other diseases may be difficult. The most direct\nand effective way to confirm the clinical diagnosis of botulism is to\ndemonstrate the presence of toxin in the serum or feces of the\npatient or in the food which the patient consumed. Determination of\nthe source of an outbreak is based on detection and identification of\ntoxin in the food involved. The most widely accepted method is the\ninjection of extracts of the food into passively immunized mice\n(mouse neutralization test). The test takes 48 hours. This analysis\nis followed by culturing all suspect food in an enrichment medium for\nthe detection and isolation of the causative organism. This test takes 7 days.\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from\n<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap2.html>. - Mod.TG]\nSee Also\nBotulism, canned food - Kazakhstan (Almaty) 20061223.3589\nBotulism, salted fish - Russia (Buryatiya) 20061215.3527\nBotulism, barbecue - Austria (northern) 20061214.3521\nBotulism, bovine - UK: precautionary guidelines 20061208.3463\nBotulism, canned uneviscerated fish - USA: recall 20061206.3439\nBotulism, olives - Canada (ON) ex Italy: recall 20061205.3430\nBotulism - Russia (Rostov) 20061108.3206\nBotulism, avian - USA (NY) 20061103.3161\nBotulism, crab cakes - Canada: recall 20061103.3155\nBotulism, canned crab - Canada: recall 20061031.3113\nBotulism, carrot juice - North America (USA, Canada)(03) 20061021.3026\n.......................................................tg/msp/jw\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Any food that is\nconducive to outgrowth and toxin production that when processed\nallows spore survival, and is not subsequently heated before\nconsumption, can be associated with botulism. Almost any type of food\nthat is not very acidic (pH above 4.6) can support growth and toxin\nproduction by _C. botulinum_. Botulinal toxin has been demonstrated\nin a considerable variety of foods, such as canned corn, peppers,\ngreen beans, soups, beets, asparagus, mushrooms, ripe olives,\nspinach, tuna fish, chicken and chicken livers and liver pate, and\nluncheon meats, ham, sausage, stuffed eggplant, lobster, and smoked\nand salted fish.\nThe incidence of the disease is low, but the mortality rate is high\nif not treated immediately and properly. Some cases of botulism may\ngo undiagnosed because symptoms are transient or mild, or\nmisdiagnosed as Guillain-Barre syndrome.\nBotulinum toxin causes flaccid paralysis by blocking motor nerve\nterminals at the myoneural [nerve-muscle] junction. The flaccid\nparalysis progresses symmetrically downward, usually starting with\nthe eyes and face, to the throat, chest and extremities. When the\ndiaphragm and chest muscles become fully involved, respiration is\ninhibited and death from asphyxia results. Recommended treatment for\nfoodborne botulism includes early administration of botulinal\nantitoxin and intensive supportive care (including mechanical\nbreathing assistance).\nAll people are believed to be susceptible to the foodborne intoxication.\nAlthough botulism can be diagnosed by clinical symptoms alone,\ndifferentiation from other diseases may be difficult. The most direct\nand effective way to confirm the clinical diagnosis of botulism is to\ndemonstrate the presence of toxin in the serum or feces of the\npatient or in the food which the patient consumed. Determination of\nthe source of an outbreak is based on detection and identification of\ntoxin in the food involved.

The spores are\nheat-resistant and can survive in foods that are incorrectly or\nminimally processed. Seven types (A, B, C, D, E, F & G) of botulism\nare recognized based on the antigenic specificity of the toxin\nproduced by each strain. Types A, B, E and F cause human botulism.\nTypes C and D cause most cases of botulism in animals. Animals most\ncommonly affected are wildfowl and poultry, cattle, horses and some\nspecies of fish.

The toxin is heat labile and can be destroyed if heated at\n80 C for 10 minutes or longer. The incidence of the disease is low,\nbut the disease is of considerable concern because of its high\nmortality rate if not treated immediately and properly. Most of the\n10 to 30 outbreaks that are reported annually in the USA are\nassociated with inadequately processed, home-canned foods, but\noccasionally commercially produced foods have been involved in\noutbreaks.

They\noccur in both cultivated and forest soils, bottom sediments of\nstreams, lakes, and coastal waters, in the intestinal tracts of fish\nand mammals, and in the gills and viscera of crabs and other shellfish.\nThere are 4 types of botulism recognized: foodborne, infant, wound,\nand a form of botulism whose classification is as yet undetermined.\nCertain foods have been reported as sources of spores in cases of\ninfant botulism and the undetermined category; wound botulism is not\nrelated to foods.\nFoodborne botulism is the name of the disease (actually a foodborne\nintoxication) caused by the consumption of foods containing the\nneurotoxin produced by _C. botulinum_.\nThe undetermined category of botulism involves adult cases in which a\nspecific food or wound source cannot be identified. It has been\nsuggested that some cases of botulism assigned to this category might\nresult from intestinal colonization in adults, with in vivo\nproduction of toxin. Reports in the medical literature suggest the\nexistence of a form of botulism similar to infant botulism, but\noccurring in adults. In these cases, the patients had surgical\nalterations of the gastrointestinal tract and/or antibiotic therapy.\nIt is proposed that these procedures may have altered the normal gut\nflora and allowed _C. botulinum_ to colonize the intestinal tract.\nThe infective dose: a very small amount (a few nanograms) of toxin\ncan cause illness.\nOnset of symptoms in foodborne botulism is usually 18 to 36 hours\nafter ingestion of the food containing the toxin, although cases have\nvaried from 4 hours to 8 days. Early signs of intoxication consist of\nmarked lassitude, weakness and vertigo, usually followed by double\nvision and progressive difficulty in speaking and swallowing.\nDifficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal\ndistention, and constipation may also be common symptoms.\nThe types of foods involved in botulism vary according to food\npreservation and eating habits in different regions. Any food that is\nconducive to outgrowth and toxin production that when processed\nallows spore survival, and is not subsequently heated before\nconsumption, can be associated with botulism. Almost any type of food\nthat is not very acidic (pH above 4.6) can support growth and toxin\nproduction by _C. botulinum_. Botulinal toxin has been demonstrated\nin a considerable variety of foods, such as canned corn, peppers,\ngreen beans, soups, beets, asparagus, mushrooms, ripe olives,\nspinach, tuna fish, chicken and chicken livers and liver pate, and\nluncheon meats, ham, sausage, stuffed eggplant, lobster, and smoked\nand salted fish.\nThe incidence of the disease is low, but the mortality rate is high\nif not treated immediately and properly. Some cases of botulism may\ngo undiagnosed because symptoms are transient or mild, or\nmisdiagnosed as Guillain-Barre syndrome.\nBotulinum toxin causes flaccid paralysis by blocking motor nerve\nterminals at the myoneural [nerve-muscle] junction. The flaccid\nparalysis progresses symmetrically downward, usually starting with\nthe eyes and face, to the throat, chest and extremities. When the\ndiaphragm and chest muscles become fully involved, respiration is\ninhibited and death from asphyxia results. Recommended treatment for\nfoodborne botulism includes early administration of botulinal\nantitoxin and intensive supportive care (including mechanical\nbreathing assistance).\nAll people are believed to be susceptible to the foodborne intoxication.\nAlthough botulism can be diagnosed by clinical symptoms alone,\ndifferentiation from other diseases may be difficult. The most direct\nand effective way to confirm the clinical diagnosis of botulism is to\ndemonstrate the presence of toxin in the serum or feces of the\npatient or in the food which the patient consumed. Determination of\nthe source of an outbreak is based on detection and identification of\ntoxin in the food involved. The most widely accepted method is the\ninjection of extracts of the food into passively immunized mice\n(mouse neutralization test). The test takes 48 hours. This analysis\nis followed by culturing all suspect food in an enrichment medium for\nthe detection and isolation of the causative organism.

Although type G has been isolated from soil in\nArgentina, no outbreaks involving it have been recognized.\nFoodborne botulism (as distinct from wound botulism and infant\nbotulism) is a severe type of food poisoning caused by the ingestion\nof foods containing the potent neurotoxin formed during growth of the\norganism. The toxin is heat labile and can be destroyed if heated at\n80 C for 10 minutes or longer. The incidence of the disease is low,\nbut the disease is of considerable concern because of its high\nmortality rate if not treated immediately and properly. Most of the\n10 to 30 outbreaks that are reported annually in the USA are\nassociated with inadequately processed, home-canned foods, but\noccasionally commercially produced foods have been involved in\noutbreaks. Sausages, meat products, canned vegetables and seafood\nproducts have been the most frequent vehicles for human botulism.\nThe organism and its spores are widely distributed in nature. They\noccur in both cultivated and forest soils, bottom sediments of\nstreams, lakes, and coastal waters, in the intestinal tracts of fish\nand mammals, and in the gills and viscera of crabs and other shellfish.\nThere are 4 types of botulism recognized: foodborne, infant, wound,\nand a form of botulism whose classification is as yet undetermined.\nCertain foods have been reported as sources of spores in cases of\ninfant botulism and the undetermined category; wound botulism is not\nrelated to foods.\nFoodborne botulism is the name of the disease (actually a foodborne\nintoxication) caused by the consumption of foods containing the\nneurotoxin produced by _C. botulinum_.\nThe undetermined category of botulism involves adult cases in which a\nspecific food or wound source cannot be identified. It has been\nsuggested that some cases of botulism assigned to this category might\nresult from intestinal colonization in adults, with in vivo\nproduction of toxin. Reports in the medical literature suggest the\nexistence of a form of botulism similar to infant botulism, but\noccurring in adults. In these cases, the patients had surgical\nalterations of the gastrointestinal tract and/or antibiotic therapy.\nIt is proposed that these procedures may have altered the normal gut\nflora and allowed _C. botulinum_ to colonize the intestinal tract.\nThe infective dose: a very small amount (a few nanograms) of toxin\ncan cause illness.\nOnset of symptoms in foodborne botulism is usually 18 to 36 hours\nafter ingestion of the food containing the toxin, although cases have\nvaried from 4 hours to 8 days. Early signs of intoxication consist of\nmarked lassitude, weakness and vertigo, usually followed by double\nvision and progressive difficulty in speaking and swallowing.\nDifficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal\ndistention, and constipation may also be common symptoms.\nThe types of foods involved in botulism vary according to food\npreservation and eating habits in different regions. Any food that is\nconducive to outgrowth and toxin production that when processed\nallows spore survival, and is not subsequently heated before\nconsumption, can be associated with botulism. Almost any type of food\nthat is not very acidic (pH above 4.6) can support growth and toxin\nproduction by _C. botulinum_. Botulinal toxin has been demonstrated\nin a considerable variety of foods, such as canned corn, peppers,\ngreen beans, soups, beets, asparagus, mushrooms, ripe olives,\nspinach, tuna fish, chicken and chicken livers and liver pate, and\nluncheon meats, ham, sausage, stuffed eggplant, lobster, and smoked\nand salted fish.\nThe incidence of the disease is low, but the mortality rate is high\nif not treated immediately and properly. Some cases of botulism may\ngo undiagnosed because symptoms are transient or mild, or\nmisdiagnosed as Guillain-Barre syndrome.\nBotulinum toxin causes flaccid paralysis by blocking motor nerve\nterminals at the myoneural [nerve-muscle] junction. The flaccid\nparalysis progresses symmetrically downward, usually starting with\nthe eyes and face, to the throat, chest and extremities. When the\ndiaphragm and chest muscles become fully involved, respiration is\ninhibited and death from asphyxia results. Recommended treatment for\nfoodborne botulism includes early administration of botulinal\nantitoxin and intensive supportive care (including mechanical\nbreathing assistance).\nAll people are believed to be susceptible to the foodborne intoxication.\nAlthough botulism can be diagnosed by clinical symptoms alone,\ndifferentiation from other diseases may be difficult. The most direct\nand effective way to confirm the clinical diagnosis of botulism is to\ndemonstrate the presence of toxin in the serum or feces of the\npatient or in the food which the patient consumed. Determination of\nthe source of an outbreak is based on detection and identification of\ntoxin in the food involved. The most widely accepted method is the\ninjection of extracts of the food into passively immunized mice\n(mouse neutralization test). The test takes 48 hours. This analysis\nis followed by culturing all suspect food in an enrichment medium for\nthe detection and isolation of the causative organism. This test takes 7 days.\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from\n<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap2.html>. - Mod.TG]\nSee Also\nBotulism, canned food - Kazakhstan (Almaty) 20061223.3589\nBotulism, salted fish - Russia (Buryatiya) 20061215.3527\nBotulism, barbecue - Austria (northern) 20061214.3521\nBotulism, bovine - UK: precautionary guidelines 20061208.3463\nBotulism, canned uneviscerated fish - USA: recall 20061206.3439\nBotulism, olives - Canada (ON) ex Italy: recall 20061205.3430\nBotulism - Russia (Rostov) 20061108.3206\nBotulism, avian - USA (NY) 20061103.3161\nBotulism, crab cakes - Canada: recall 20061103.3155\nBotulism, canned crab - Canada: recall 20061031.3113\nBotulism, carrot juice - North America (USA, Canada)(03) 20061021.3026\n.......................................................tg/msp/jw\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The necropsies, which are complete\npostmortem examinations, also indicate that type E is the cause, she said.\nCaused by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, type E is a type of\nfood poisoning that typically affects fish-eating birds such as\nloons. But the state is warning that the bird-killing toxin could\nalso harm humans who eat sick birds.\nThe bodies of the loons, gulls and grebes were first discovered on 21\nOct 2006 between Wayne County's Sodus Bay and Deer Creek Marsh in\nOswego County. The DEC's Wildlife Pathology Unit is inspecting and\ntesting the birds.\nAvian botulism is a major cause of death in migratory birds,\naccording to New York Sea Grant. Type E botulism outbreaks have been\nseen on the Great Lakes as far back as the mid-1960s on Lake\nMichigan. But type E did not appear on Lake Ontario until 2002. And\nthis year has proven to be the most fatal to Lake Ontario wildlife,\nwith hundreds of birds dying in July from botulism along the coast of\nJefferson County on the eastern shore of Lake Ontario, according to the DEC.\nBotulism killed an estimated 5000 birds on Lake Erie in 2000, and the\nlake has seen bird deaths annually since then.\nThe state Health Department said in a statement it does not know of\nany human cases of botulism related to the loon deaths.\nThe spores for type E botulism are naturally found in soil and\naquatic sediment, as well as the intestinal tracts of healthy\nanimals, according to Sea Grant. Birds get sick by eating fish\ncontaminated with type E botulism.\nScientists still aren't sure why botulism flares up and dies down, or\nwhy recent outbreaks have been particularly calamitous, said Rod\nGetchell, a professor in Cornell University's aquatic animal health program.\nBut one hypothesis is that the recent introduction of invasive\nspecies such as gobies and zebra mussels might be changing the\necology of the lake's bottom, he said, allowing the type E spores to germinate.\n[Byline: Matthew Daneman]\n--\nBrent Barrett\n<salbrent@sbcglobal.net>\n[Botulism in avians is not usually type E, so this is an interesting case.\nThough avian botulism is seen more often in other regions, it will\noccur where the conditions are favorable.\nThe sporulating anaerobic gram-positive bacillus _C. botulinum_\nelaborates 7 types of antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which\naffect humans: type A, B, E, or rarely type F. Toxins types A and B\nare highly poisonous proteins resistant to digestion by GI enzymes.\nApproximately 50 percent of foodborne outbreaks in the USA are caused\nby type A toxin, followed by types B and E.\nType C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl and other birds\nliving in an aquatic environment and causes tremendous losses, most\nnotably in waterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America,\nit has been reported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and\nAustralia. In the Great Lakes region, it was first identified in 1936\nin ducks on Green Bay of Lake Michigan and in 1941 in Monroe County\nmarshes along Lake Erie. Type C is most often associated with\nlimberneck paralysis in birds.\nType E botulism is connected with consumption of fish and occurs\nmainly in gulls and loons, and to a lesser extent in mergansers, mute\nswans, grebes, and shorebirds. It now appears that any birds or\nmammals susceptible to botulinum toxin run a risk of becoming\npoisoned if they scavenge dead fish. Evidence for this includes the\nidentification of type E toxin in a bald eagle, wood ducks, and\nmuskrats with fish remaining in their digestive tracts.\n_C. botulinum_ spores are relatively heat-resistant, though high\ntemperatures and/or exposure to moist heat will kill the spores.\nToxins, on the other hand, are readily destroyed by heat and by\ncooking food. Toxin production (especially type E) can occur at\ntemperatures as low as 3 degrees C (37.4 degrees F), i.e., inside a\nrefrigerator, and does not require strict anaerobic conditions.\nHuman illness from Type E is most often associated with improperly\nsmoked fish.

Anaerobic conditions, low acidity (pH\ngreater than 4.6), low salt and sugar concentrations, and temperatures\ngreater than 39 F (greater than 4 C) promote germination of _C. botulinum_\nspores and botulinum toxin production. Carrot juice has low acidity, with a\nnatural pH of approximately 6.0; therefore, in the absence of another\ninhibitor, refrigeration at temperatures less than 40 F (less than 4 C) is\nnecessary to prevent germination of _C. botulinum_ spores and production of\nbotulinum toxin. Inhibiting _C. botulinum_ growth in other ways, such as\nthrough acidification, can retard its growth in juice that is not properly\nrefrigerated.\n\n\"Acidification has been used as a solution to previous foodborne botulism\noutbreaks.

Carrot juice has low acidity, with a\nnatural pH of approximately 6.0; therefore, in the absence of another\ninhibitor, refrigeration at temperatures less than 40 F (less than 4 C) is\nnecessary to prevent germination of _C. botulinum_ spores and production of\nbotulinum toxin.

It is enough to boil food\nfor 10-15 minutes to destroy the botulinum toxin; boiling denatures\nthe proteins, as well as the toxin. - Mod.NP]\n[Botulism is most often caused by the pre-formed toxin produced by\nthe bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Animals are most often exposed\nto the organism through oral ingestion or through wound contamination.\nClassically, botulism is a food-borne disease caused by the ingestion\nof preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in\nwhich _C. botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant\nbotulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).\nBotulism is a potentially fatal toxemia caused by ingestion of the\ntoxin of _C. botulinum_. There are 8 recognized types and subtypes of\nthe organisms.\nThe sporulating anaerobic gram-positive bacillus _C. botulinum_\nelaborates 7 types of antigenetically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of\nwhich affect humans: type A, B, E, or rarely type F. Toxin types A\nand B are highly poisonous proteins resistant to digestion by\ngastro-intestinal enzymes.\nTypes A, B, and E of human botulism are the most common. Although\neach type has a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report\nthat type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental\nstatus and more autonomic dysfunction (2).\nThe method of diagnosis of botulism is not stated here nor is the\nmethod of testing for the food products discussed, assuming that the\npreserved food was not consumed in its entirety.\nIndividual cases of paralysis can be confused with other diseases,\nbut a cluster of such cases is certainly likely to be botulism. Type\nE botulism is the type frequently associated with fish products (1).\n1.

The next day she developed muscular\nweakness of her upper and lower limbs, and was admitted to hospital.\nShe developed difficulty in breathing and required mechanical\nventilation in an intensive care unit for a week.\nThe patient is now recovering, but still has some difficulties in\nswallowing, and is not yet able to walk. The patient did not receive\nbotulinum antitoxin, since the symptoms had already begun to resolve\nupon diagnosis. The patient's husband also had diarrhea on 29 Jun\n2006 and later had some difficulties in swallowing, but no other\nneurological symptoms were observed. He was admitted to hospital for\none night (1-2 Jul 2006) because of diarrhea.\nSerum samples from the female patient taken on 30 Jun and 1 Jul 2006\nwere positive for botulinum neurotoxin by mouse bioassay, and the\nneutralization test suggested that the patient's illness was caused\nby botulinum toxin type E. Gastric fluid and serum samples taken on 4\nJul 2006 did not yield neurotoxin or _Clostridium botulinum_. No\nspecimens were available from the husband, as botulism was not\ndiagnosed during his hospital stay, and he was not called back to\nhospital for specimens.\nAn interview with the husband revealed that the couple had eaten\nsmoked vacuum-packed whitefish on 28 Jun 2006. The wife had eaten\nmost of the fish, and the husband ate only a small portion. The\nwhitefish had been imported from Canada, but smoked and packed in\nFinland. There was no leftover fish for microbiological examination.\nFlush samples were taken from the fish's plastic packaging, but they\nwere negative for _C. botulinum_ by PCR (1) and culture.\nThe suspected fish product was recalled by the manufacturer, and\nproduction of the product was suspended. The national and local food\ncontrol authorities inspected the production plant and the\ndistribution center. The entire manufacturing process and storage\ntemperatures throughout the cold chain, including the retail outlet,\nwere investigated. The inspections did not reveal any factors that\ncould have created an increased risk of botulinum neurotoxin\nproduction. Microbiological analysis of 10 vacuum-packed fish made\nfrom the same raw fish batch that was used to make the product eaten\nby the patient, and from fish from earlier and later batches, were\nall negative for _C. botulinum_.\nThe investigators have therefore hypothesized that there may have\nbeen storage temperature abuse at a later stage, such as in the\nretail outlet or the home. After inspection of the facility and\nmicrobiological examination of fish samples, production of the\nproduct has started again.\n_C. botulinum_ type E is naturally highly prevalent in aquatic\nenvironments and fish (2,3), leading to a high risk of contamination.\nThe hot-smoking processes are usually too low to eliminate botulinum\nspores (4). Growth and toxin production from spores in vacuum-packed\nsmoked fish products with anaerobic atmosphere and limited\npreservative factors is likely during extended storage at\ntemperatures above 3 degrees C. Therefore the most important factors\ncontrolling _C. botulinum_ growth and toxin production are efficient\nheat treatments, restricted shelf life and continuous storage below 3\ndegrees C.\nHuman botulism is a very rare disease; the most recent case to be\nreported in Finland before the one mentioned here occurred in 1999\n(5). A similar outbreak that affected 2 people in Germany in 1997 is\ndescribed in the literature (1). However, it is of utmost importance\nthat physicians remain aware of the disease as a possible diagnosis.\nBotulism should be considered whenever a patient develops\nneurological symptoms that include blurred vision, difficulties in\nswallowing or speech and symptoms of descending flaccid paralysis.\nThis should be followed by appropriate epidemiological and laboratory\nanalyses to confirm the diagnosis and to improve the epidemiological\nunderstanding of the disease (6).\n1.

The next day she developed muscular\nweakness of her upper and lower limbs, and was admitted to hospital.\nShe developed difficulty in breathing and required mechanical\nventilation in an intensive care unit for a week.\nThe patient is now recovering, but still has some difficulties in\nswallowing, and is not yet able to walk. The patient did not receive\nbotulinum antitoxin, since the symptoms had already begun to resolve\nupon diagnosis. The patient's husband also had diarrhea on 29 Jun\n2006 and later had some difficulties in swallowing, but no other\nneurological symptoms were observed. He was admitted to hospital for\none night (1-2 Jul 2006) because of diarrhea.\nSerum samples from the female patient taken on 30 Jun and 1 Jul 2006\nwere positive for botulinum neurotoxin by mouse bioassay, and the\nneutralization test suggested that the patient's illness was caused\nby botulinum toxin type E. Gastric fluid and serum samples taken on 4\nJul 2006 did not yield neurotoxin or _Clostridium botulinum_. No\nspecimens were available from the husband, as botulism was not\ndiagnosed during his hospital stay, and he was not called back to\nhospital for specimens.\nAn interview with the husband revealed that the couple had eaten\nsmoked vacuum-packed whitefish on 28 Jun 2006. The wife had eaten\nmost of the fish, and the husband ate only a small portion. The\nwhitefish had been imported from Canada, but smoked and packed in\nFinland. There was no leftover fish for microbiological examination.\nFlush samples were taken from the fish's plastic packaging, but they\nwere negative for _C. botulinum_ by PCR (1) and culture.\nThe suspected fish product was recalled by the manufacturer, and\nproduction of the product was suspended. The national and local food\ncontrol authorities inspected the production plant and the\ndistribution center. The entire manufacturing process and storage\ntemperatures throughout the cold chain, including the retail outlet,\nwere investigated. The inspections did not reveal any factors that\ncould have created an increased risk of botulinum neurotoxin\nproduction. Microbiological analysis of 10 vacuum-packed fish made\nfrom the same raw fish batch that was used to make the product eaten\nby the patient, and from fish from earlier and later batches, were\nall negative for _C. botulinum_.\nThe investigators have therefore hypothesized that there may have\nbeen storage temperature abuse at a later stage, such as in the\nretail outlet or the home. After inspection of the facility and\nmicrobiological examination of fish samples, production of the\nproduct has started again.\n_C. botulinum_ type E is naturally highly prevalent in aquatic\nenvironments and fish (2,3), leading to a high risk of contamination.\nThe hot-smoking processes are usually too low to eliminate botulinum\nspores (4). Growth and toxin production from spores in vacuum-packed\nsmoked fish products with anaerobic atmosphere and limited\npreservative factors is likely during extended storage at\ntemperatures above 3 degrees C. Therefore the most important factors\ncontrolling _C. botulinum_ growth and toxin production are efficient\nheat treatments, restricted shelf life and continuous storage below 3\ndegrees C.\nHuman botulism is a very rare disease; the most recent case to be\nreported in Finland before the one mentioned here occurred in 1999\n(5). A similar outbreak that affected 2 people in Germany in 1997 is\ndescribed in the literature (1). However, it is of utmost importance\nthat physicians remain aware of the disease as a possible diagnosis.\nBotulism should be considered whenever a patient develops\nneurological symptoms that include blurred vision, difficulties in\nswallowing or speech and symptoms of descending flaccid paralysis.\nThis should be followed by appropriate epidemiological and laboratory\nanalyses to confirm the diagnosis and to improve the epidemiological\nunderstanding of the disease (6).\n1.

No\nspecimens were available from the husband, as botulism was not\ndiagnosed during his hospital stay, and he was not called back to\nhospital for specimens.\nAn interview with the husband revealed that the couple had eaten\nsmoked vacuum-packed whitefish on 28 Jun 2006. The wife had eaten\nmost of the fish, and the husband ate only a small portion. The\nwhitefish had been imported from Canada, but smoked and packed in\nFinland. There was no leftover fish for microbiological examination.\nFlush samples were taken from the fish's plastic packaging, but they\nwere negative for _C. botulinum_ by PCR (1) and culture.\nThe suspected fish product was recalled by the manufacturer, and\nproduction of the product was suspended. The national and local food\ncontrol authorities inspected the production plant and the\ndistribution center. The entire manufacturing process and storage\ntemperatures throughout the cold chain, including the retail outlet,\nwere investigated. The inspections did not reveal any factors that\ncould have created an increased risk of botulinum neurotoxin\nproduction. Microbiological analysis of 10 vacuum-packed fish made\nfrom the same raw fish batch that was used to make the product eaten\nby the patient, and from fish from earlier and later batches, were\nall negative for _C. botulinum_.\nThe investigators have therefore hypothesized that there may have\nbeen storage temperature abuse at a later stage, such as in the\nretail outlet or the home. After inspection of the facility and\nmicrobiological examination of fish samples, production of the\nproduct has started again.\n_C. botulinum_ type E is naturally highly prevalent in aquatic\nenvironments and fish (2,3), leading to a high risk of contamination.\nThe hot-smoking processes are usually too low to eliminate botulinum\nspores (4). Growth and toxin production from spores in vacuum-packed\nsmoked fish products with anaerobic atmosphere and limited\npreservative factors is likely during extended storage at\ntemperatures above 3 degrees C. Therefore the most important factors\ncontrolling _C. botulinum_ growth and toxin production are efficient\nheat treatments, restricted shelf life and continuous storage below 3\ndegrees C.\nHuman botulism is a very rare disease; the most recent case to be\nreported in Finland before the one mentioned here occurred in 1999\n(5). A similar outbreak that affected 2 people in Germany in 1997 is\ndescribed in the literature (1). However, it is of utmost importance\nthat physicians remain aware of the disease as a possible diagnosis.\nBotulism should be considered whenever a patient develops\nneurological symptoms that include blurred vision, difficulties in\nswallowing or speech and symptoms of descending flaccid paralysis.\nThis should be followed by appropriate epidemiological and laboratory\nanalyses to confirm the diagnosis and to improve the epidemiological\nunderstanding of the disease (6).\n1.

The next day she developed muscular\nweakness of her upper and lower limbs, and was admitted to hospital.\nShe developed difficulty in breathing and required mechanical\nventilation in an intensive care unit for a week.\nThe patient is now recovering, but still has some difficulties in\nswallowing, and is not yet able to walk. The patient did not receive\nbotulinum antitoxin, since the symptoms had already begun to resolve\nupon diagnosis. The patient's husband also had diarrhea on 29 Jun\n2006 and later had some difficulties in swallowing, but no other\nneurological symptoms were observed. He was admitted to hospital for\none night (1-2 Jul 2006) because of diarrhea.\nSerum samples from the female patient taken on 30 Jun and 1 Jul 2006\nwere positive for botulinum neurotoxin by mouse bioassay, and the\nneutralization test suggested that the patient's illness was caused\nby botulinum toxin type E. Gastric fluid and serum samples taken on 4\nJul 2006 did not yield neurotoxin or _Clostridium botulinum_. No\nspecimens were available from the husband, as botulism was not\ndiagnosed during his hospital stay, and he was not called back to\nhospital for specimens.\nAn interview with the husband revealed that the couple had eaten\nsmoked vacuum-packed whitefish on 28 Jun 2006. The wife had eaten\nmost of the fish, and the husband ate only a small portion. The\nwhitefish had been imported from Canada, but smoked and packed in\nFinland. There was no leftover fish for microbiological examination.\nFlush samples were taken from the fish's plastic packaging, but they\nwere negative for _C. botulinum_ by PCR (1) and culture.\nThe suspected fish product was recalled by the manufacturer, and\nproduction of the product was suspended. The national and local food\ncontrol authorities inspected the production plant and the\ndistribution center. The entire manufacturing process and storage\ntemperatures throughout the cold chain, including the retail outlet,\nwere investigated. The inspections did not reveal any factors that\ncould have created an increased risk of botulinum neurotoxin\nproduction. Microbiological analysis of 10 vacuum-packed fish made\nfrom the same raw fish batch that was used to make the product eaten\nby the patient, and from fish from earlier and later batches, were\nall negative for _C. botulinum_.\nThe investigators have therefore hypothesized that there may have\nbeen storage temperature abuse at a later stage, such as in the\nretail outlet or the home. After inspection of the facility and\nmicrobiological examination of fish samples, production of the\nproduct has started again.\n_C. botulinum_ type E is naturally highly prevalent in aquatic\nenvironments and fish (2,3), leading to a high risk of contamination.\nThe hot-smoking processes are usually too low to eliminate botulinum\nspores (4). Growth and toxin production from spores in vacuum-packed\nsmoked fish products with anaerobic atmosphere and limited\npreservative factors is likely during extended storage at\ntemperatures above 3 degrees C. Therefore the most important factors\ncontrolling _C. botulinum_ growth and toxin production are efficient\nheat treatments, restricted shelf life and continuous storage below 3\ndegrees C.\nHuman botulism is a very rare disease; the most recent case to be\nreported in Finland before the one mentioned here occurred in 1999\n(5). A similar outbreak that affected 2 people in Germany in 1997 is\ndescribed in the literature (1). However, it is of utmost importance\nthat physicians remain aware of the disease as a possible diagnosis.\nBotulism should be considered whenever a patient develops\nneurological symptoms that include blurred vision, difficulties in\nswallowing or speech and symptoms of descending flaccid paralysis.\nThis should be followed by appropriate epidemiological and laboratory\nanalyses to confirm the diagnosis and to improve the epidemiological\nunderstanding of the disease (6).\n1.

The basins, which\nare 3 feet deep, are located behind Lilliston Ford and Luther Acres, a\nsenior housing complex.\nThe birds' deaths last week prompted concerns and a DEP investigation.\nKaskey said conditions in the shallow basins were perfect for fostering\nincreased levels of the bacteria, noting that botulism naturally occurs in\nbodies of water. Those conditions included stagnant water, where oxygen\nlevels are low. A contributing factor was that the water was warmer, and\ncolder water holds oxygen better. The large number of birds also added to\nlow oxygen levels with their feces. And runoff into the basin likely\nincluded fertilizers, which added nutrients.\nThe nutrients created an algae bloom that traditionally creates oxygen. But\nas the bloom died, it further depleted the oxygen in the water.This caused\nthe fish to die, with Kaskey noting that even carp, considered a sturdy\nfish, were rising to the surface and gasping for air.\nKaskey said botulism thrives in dead fish. \"The next step is maggots in the\nfish, which are then concentrating botulism in their bodies. And the\nwaterfowl are eating the maggots and dying from it,\" he said. In order to\nstem the avian deaths, Kaskey said the city has been diligent about\nremoving dead fish and bird carcasses.\nWhile pesticides were considered culprits, an analysis of the birds' brains\nproved otherwise, Kaskey said. \"Ultimately, this should fade away,\" Kaskey\nsaid. \"In the long term, one could install a fountain in the basins to keep\nwater moving and keep oxygen at normal levels.\"\nKaskey noted that a similar situation in Millville was remedied that way.\nAlso, residents around the pond should strictly follow directions on\nfertilizers to make sure they are not overdoing it. Excess fertilizer will\nend up in the basins, contributing more nutrients. Lastly, feeding the\ngeese and ducks should be curbed. Fewer birds attracted to the basins would\nmean lower amounts of feces.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Avian botulism is seen most often in regions other than NJ. However, it\nwill occur where the conditions are favorable.\nThe sporulating anaerobic gram-positive bacillus _C. botulinum_ elaborates\n7 types of antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which affect humans:\ntype A, B, E, or rarely type F. Toxins types A and B are highly poisonous\nproteins resistant to digestion by GI enzymes. Approximately 50 percent of\nfoodborne outbreaks in the USA are caused by type A toxin, followed by\ntypes B and E.\nType C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl and other birds living in\nan aquatic environment and causes tremendous losses, most notably in\nwaterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America, it has been\nreported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and Australia. In the\nGreat Lakes region, it was first identified in 1936 in ducks on Green Bay\nof Lake Michigan and in 1941 in Monroe County marshes along Lake Erie. Type\nC is most often associated with limberneck paralysis in birds.\nType E botulism is connected with consumption of fish and occurs mainly in\ngulls and loons, and to a lesser extent in mergansers, mute swans, grebes,\nand shorebirds. It now appears that any birds or mammals susceptible to\nbotulinum toxin run a risk of becoming poisoned if they scavenge dead fish.\nEvidence for this includes the identification of type E toxin in a bald\neagle, wood ducks, and muskrats with fish remaining in their digestive tracts.\n_C. botulinum_ spores are relatively heat-resistant, though high\ntemperatures and/or exposure to moist heat will kill the spores.\nToxins, on the other hand, are readily destroyed by heat and by cooking\nfood. Toxin production (especially type E) can occur at temperatures as low\nas 3 degrees C (37.4 degrees F), i.e., inside a refrigerator, and does not\nrequire strict anaerobic conditions.\nHuman illness from Type E is most often associated with improperly smoked\nfish.

The basins, which\nare 3 feet deep, are located behind Lilliston Ford and Luther Acres, a\nsenior housing complex.\nThe birds' deaths last week prompted concerns and a DEP investigation.\nKaskey said conditions in the shallow basins were perfect for fostering\nincreased levels of the bacteria, noting that botulism naturally occurs in\nbodies of water. Those conditions included stagnant water, where oxygen\nlevels are low. A contributing factor was that the water was warmer, and\ncolder water holds oxygen better. The large number of birds also added to\nlow oxygen levels with their feces.

And the\nwaterfowl are eating the maggots and dying from it,\" he said. In order to\nstem the avian deaths, Kaskey said the city has been diligent about\nremoving dead fish and bird carcasses.\nWhile pesticides were considered culprits, an analysis of the birds' brains\nproved otherwise, Kaskey said. \"Ultimately, this should fade away,\" Kaskey\nsaid. \"In the long term, one could install a fountain in the basins to keep\nwater moving and keep oxygen at normal levels.\"\nKaskey noted that a similar situation in Millville was remedied that way.\nAlso, residents around the pond should strictly follow directions on\nfertilizers to make sure they are not overdoing it.

However, it\nwill occur where the conditions are favorable.\nThe sporulating anaerobic gram-positive bacillus _C. botulinum_ elaborates\n7 types of antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which affect humans:\ntype A, B, E, or rarely type F. Toxins types A and B are highly poisonous\nproteins resistant to digestion by GI enzymes. Approximately 50 percent of\nfoodborne outbreaks in the USA are caused by type A toxin, followed by\ntypes B and E.\nType C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl and other birds living in\nan aquatic environment and causes tremendous losses, most notably in\nwaterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America, it has been\nreported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and Australia. In the\nGreat Lakes region, it was first identified in 1936 in ducks on Green Bay\nof Lake Michigan and in 1941 in Monroe County marshes along Lake Erie. Type\nC is most often associated with limberneck paralysis in birds.\nType E botulism is connected with consumption of fish and occurs mainly in\ngulls and loons, and to a lesser extent in mergansers, mute swans, grebes,\nand shorebirds. It now appears that any birds or mammals susceptible to\nbotulinum toxin run a risk of becoming poisoned if they scavenge dead fish.\nEvidence for this includes the identification of type E toxin in a bald\neagle, wood ducks, and muskrats with fish remaining in their digestive tracts.\n_C. botulinum_ spores are relatively heat-resistant, though high\ntemperatures and/or exposure to moist heat will kill the spores.\nToxins, on the other hand, are readily destroyed by heat and by cooking\nfood. Toxin production (especially type E) can occur at temperatures as low\nas 3 degrees C (37.4 degrees F), i.e., inside a refrigerator, and does not\nrequire strict anaerobic conditions.\nHuman illness from Type E is most often associated with improperly smoked\nfish.

Those conditions included stagnant water, where oxygen\nlevels are low. A contributing factor was that the water was warmer, and\ncolder water holds oxygen better. The large number of birds also added to\nlow oxygen levels with their feces. And runoff into the basin likely\nincluded fertilizers, which added nutrients.\nThe nutrients created an algae bloom that traditionally creates oxygen. But\nas the bloom died, it further depleted the oxygen in the water.This caused\nthe fish to die, with Kaskey noting that even carp, considered a sturdy\nfish, were rising to the surface and gasping for air.\nKaskey said botulism thrives in dead fish. \"The next step is maggots in the\nfish, which are then concentrating botulism in their bodies. And the\nwaterfowl are eating the maggots and dying from it,\" he said. In order to\nstem the avian deaths, Kaskey said the city has been diligent about\nremoving dead fish and bird carcasses.\nWhile pesticides were considered culprits, an analysis of the birds' brains\nproved otherwise, Kaskey said. \"Ultimately, this should fade away,\" Kaskey\nsaid. \"In the long term, one could install a fountain in the basins to keep\nwater moving and keep oxygen at normal levels.\"\nKaskey noted that a similar situation in Millville was remedied that way.\nAlso, residents around the pond should strictly follow directions on\nfertilizers to make sure they are not overdoing it. Excess fertilizer will\nend up in the basins, contributing more nutrients. Lastly, feeding the\ngeese and ducks should be curbed.

However, it\nwill occur where the conditions are favorable.\nThe sporulating anaerobic gram-positive bacillus _C. botulinum_ elaborates\n7 types of antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which affect humans:\ntype A, B, E, or rarely type F. Toxins types A and B are highly poisonous\nproteins resistant to digestion by GI enzymes. Approximately 50 percent of\nfoodborne outbreaks in the USA are caused by type A toxin, followed by\ntypes B and E.\nType C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl and other birds living in\nan aquatic environment and causes tremendous losses, most notably in\nwaterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America, it has been\nreported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and Australia. In the\nGreat Lakes region, it was first identified in 1936 in ducks on Green Bay\nof Lake Michigan and in 1941 in Monroe County marshes along Lake Erie. Type\nC is most often associated with limberneck paralysis in birds.\nType E botulism is connected with consumption of fish and occurs mainly in\ngulls and loons, and to a lesser extent in mergansers, mute swans, grebes,\nand shorebirds. It now appears that any birds or mammals susceptible to\nbotulinum toxin run a risk of becoming poisoned if they scavenge dead fish.\nEvidence for this includes the identification of type E toxin in a bald\neagle, wood ducks, and muskrats with fish remaining in their digestive tracts.\n_C. botulinum_ spores are relatively heat-resistant, though high\ntemperatures and/or exposure to moist heat will kill the spores.\nToxins, on the other hand, are readily destroyed by heat and by cooking\nfood. Toxin production (especially type E) can occur at temperatures as low\nas 3 degrees C (37.4 degrees F), i.e., inside a refrigerator, and does not\nrequire strict anaerobic conditions.\nHuman illness from Type E is most often associated with improperly smoked\nfish.

This brings the total\nnumber of clinically diagnosed cases of wound botulism in IDUs reported in\nthe United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to 13 in 2002 (2, 3). The recent\ncases may be caused by a batch of drugs contaminated with the anaerobic\nbacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Reports of wound botulism in IDUs are a\nrelatively new phenomenon with no clinically diagnosed cases in the UK and\nRepublic of Ireland up to the end of 1999. There were, however, 6 reports\nin 2000 and 4 in 2001 (4 and references therein, 5 and references therein).\nCases of wound botulism in Europe, although rare, continue to be reported.\nIn recent years reports of suspected botulism in IDUs have come from Norway\n(6) and Switzerland (7).\nWound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a wound,\ngerminate, and produce botulinum toxin in vivo. The symptoms of botulism\nare caused by the toxin, which blocks the release of acetycholine at the\nneuromuscular junction resulting in a descending flaccid paralysis.\nPatients with botulism may present with blurred vision, drooping eyelids,\nslurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness.\nThere is usually no fever, no loss of sensation and no loss of awareness.\nIf untreated, paralysis may progress to the arms, legs, trunk and\nrespiratory muscles. If onset is very rapid, there may be no symptoms\nbefore sudden respiratory paralysis occurs. Clinicians should suspect\nbotulism in any patient with an afebrile, descending, flaccid paralysis.\nBotulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms if\nadministered early in the course of the disease. _C. botulinum_ is\nsensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole. In cases of wound\ninfection, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement should reduce the\norganism load and therefore toxin production, but circulating toxin can\nonly be neutralised by the early administration of antitoxin. Where there\nis a definite clinical suspicion of botulism, treatment with antitoxin\nshould not be delayed pending microbiological testing.\nIDUs are susceptible to wound botulism when anaerobic conditions exist at\ninjection sites. Injecting drug users should be advised to smoke heroin\nrather than inject and to avoid injecting into muscle or under the skin\n(skin popping). The injection of substances that increase tissue damage may\nfacilitate the growth of anaerobic bacteria and therefore IDUs should try\nto use as little citric acid as possible to dissolve heroin, and should\navoid the injection of mixtures of heroin and cocaine. They should also be\nadvised to seek urgent medical attention if they develop swelling, redness,\nor pain at injecting sites.\nInvestigators (see email addresses below) at the PHLS in England and Wales\nwould be interested to hear of any recent cases of botulism in IDUs in\nother European countries.\nReferences :\n1.CDSC.

Association with drug injection was first reported in 1982 in New\nYork City (1). In 1995 there were 19 cases reported in California\nassociated with contaminated black tar heroin (2). In 1998 there was an\noutbreak of 5 cases reported in Switzerland, all associated with illicit\ninjection drug use.\nIn October 2001 ProMED reported a case of wound botulism in Scotland, and\nquestioned whether the heightened surveillance for unusual illness in IDUs,\nas an aftermath of the outbreak of _C. novyi_ associated with contaminated\nheroin might have led to isolated case reports. In this article there is\nmention of 13 cases since the beginning of the year, suggesting the\npossibility of a contaminated batch of heroin on the market in the UK,\nsomewhat reminiscent of the outbreak in California in 1995 (2). One wonders\nif other countries have been seeing a similar increase in wound botulism in\nrecent months.\n1. CDC. Wound Botulism Associated with Parenteral Cocaine Abuse -- New\nYork City.

This brings the total\nnumber of clinically diagnosed cases of wound botulism in IDUs reported in\nthe United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to 13 in 2002 (2, 3). The recent\ncases may be caused by a batch of drugs contaminated with the anaerobic\nbacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Reports of wound botulism in IDUs are a\nrelatively new phenomenon with no clinically diagnosed cases in the UK and\nRepublic of Ireland up to the end of 1999. There were, however, 6 reports\nin 2000 and 4 in 2001 (4 and references therein, 5 and references therein).\nCases of wound botulism in Europe, although rare, continue to be reported.\nIn recent years reports of suspected botulism in IDUs have come from Norway\n(6) and Switzerland (7).\nWound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a wound,\ngerminate, and produce botulinum toxin in vivo. The symptoms of botulism\nare caused by the toxin, which blocks the release of acetycholine at the\nneuromuscular junction resulting in a descending flaccid paralysis.\nPatients with botulism may present with blurred vision, drooping eyelids,\nslurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness.\nThere is usually no fever, no loss of sensation and no loss of awareness.\nIf untreated, paralysis may progress to the arms, legs, trunk and\nrespiratory muscles. If onset is very rapid, there may be no symptoms\nbefore sudden respiratory paralysis occurs. Clinicians should suspect\nbotulism in any patient with an afebrile, descending, flaccid paralysis.\nBotulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms if\nadministered early in the course of the disease. _C. botulinum_ is\nsensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole. In cases of wound\ninfection, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement should reduce the\norganism load and therefore toxin production, but circulating toxin can\nonly be neutralised by the early administration of antitoxin. Where there\nis a definite clinical suspicion of botulism, treatment with antitoxin\nshould not be delayed pending microbiological testing.\nIDUs are susceptible to wound botulism when anaerobic conditions exist at\ninjection sites. Injecting drug users should be advised to smoke heroin\nrather than inject and to avoid injecting into muscle or under the skin\n(skin popping). The injection of substances that increase tissue damage may\nfacilitate the growth of anaerobic bacteria and therefore IDUs should try\nto use as little citric acid as possible to dissolve heroin, and should\navoid the injection of mixtures of heroin and cocaine. They should also be\nadvised to seek urgent medical attention if they develop swelling, redness,\nor pain at injecting sites.\nInvestigators (see email addresses below) at the PHLS in England and Wales\nwould be interested to hear of any recent cases of botulism in IDUs in\nother European countries.\nReferences :\n1.CDSC.

Association with drug injection was first reported in 1982 in New\nYork City (1). In 1995 there were 19 cases reported in California\nassociated with contaminated black tar heroin (2). In 1998 there was an\noutbreak of 5 cases reported in Switzerland, all associated with illicit\ninjection drug use.\nIn October 2001 ProMED reported a case of wound botulism in Scotland, and\nquestioned whether the heightened surveillance for unusual illness in IDUs,\nas an aftermath of the outbreak of _C. novyi_ associated with contaminated\nheroin might have led to isolated case reports. In this article there is\nmention of 13 cases since the beginning of the year, suggesting the\npossibility of a contaminated batch of heroin on the market in the UK,\nsomewhat reminiscent of the outbreak in California in 1995 (2).

This brings the total\nnumber of clinically diagnosed cases of wound botulism in IDUs reported in\nthe United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to 13 in 2002 (2, 3). The recent\ncases may be caused by a batch of drugs contaminated with the anaerobic\nbacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Reports of wound botulism in IDUs are a\nrelatively new phenomenon with no clinically diagnosed cases in the UK and\nRepublic of Ireland up to the end of 1999. There were, however, 6 reports\nin 2000 and 4 in 2001 (4 and references therein, 5 and references therein).\nCases of wound botulism in Europe, although rare, continue to be reported.\nIn recent years reports of suspected botulism in IDUs have come from Norway\n(6) and Switzerland (7).\nWound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a wound,\ngerminate, and produce botulinum toxin in vivo. The symptoms of botulism\nare caused by the toxin, which blocks the release of acetycholine at the\nneuromuscular junction resulting in a descending flaccid paralysis.\nPatients with botulism may present with blurred vision, drooping eyelids,\nslurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness.\nThere is usually no fever, no loss of sensation and no loss of awareness.\nIf untreated, paralysis may progress to the arms, legs, trunk and\nrespiratory muscles. If onset is very rapid, there may be no symptoms\nbefore sudden respiratory paralysis occurs. Clinicians should suspect\nbotulism in any patient with an afebrile, descending, flaccid paralysis.\nBotulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms if\nadministered early in the course of the disease. _C. botulinum_ is\nsensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole. In cases of wound\ninfection, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement should reduce the\norganism load and therefore toxin production, but circulating toxin can\nonly be neutralised by the early administration of antitoxin. Where there\nis a definite clinical suspicion of botulism, treatment with antitoxin\nshould not be delayed pending microbiological testing.\nIDUs are susceptible to wound botulism when anaerobic conditions exist at\ninjection sites. Injecting drug users should be advised to smoke heroin\nrather than inject and to avoid injecting into muscle or under the skin\n(skin popping). The injection of substances that increase tissue damage may\nfacilitate the growth of anaerobic bacteria and therefore IDUs should try\nto use as little citric acid as possible to dissolve heroin, and should\navoid the injection of mixtures of heroin and cocaine. They should also be\nadvised to seek urgent medical attention if they develop swelling, redness,\nor pain at injecting sites.\nInvestigators (see email addresses below) at the PHLS in England and Wales\nwould be interested to hear of any recent cases of botulism in IDUs in\nother European countries.\nReferences :\n1.CDSC.

The symptoms of botulism\nare caused by the toxin, which blocks the release of acetycholine at the\nneuromuscular junction resulting in a descending flaccid paralysis.\nPatients with botulism may present with blurred vision, drooping eyelids,\nslurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness.\nThere is usually no fever, no loss of sensation and no loss of awareness.\nIf untreated, paralysis may progress to the arms, legs, trunk and\nrespiratory muscles. If onset is very rapid, there may be no symptoms\nbefore sudden respiratory paralysis occurs. Clinicians should suspect\nbotulism in any patient with an afebrile, descending, flaccid paralysis.\nBotulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms if\nadministered early in the course of the disease. _C. botulinum_ is\nsensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole. In cases of wound\ninfection, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement should reduce the\norganism load and therefore toxin production, but circulating toxin can\nonly be neutralised by the early administration of antitoxin. Where there\nis a definite clinical suspicion of botulism, treatment with antitoxin\nshould not be delayed pending microbiological testing.\nIDUs are susceptible to wound botulism when anaerobic conditions exist at\ninjection sites. Injecting drug users should be advised to smoke heroin\nrather than inject and to avoid injecting into muscle or under the skin\n(skin popping). The injection of substances that increase tissue damage may\nfacilitate the growth of anaerobic bacteria and therefore IDUs should try\nto use as little citric acid as possible to dissolve heroin, and should\navoid the injection of mixtures of heroin and cocaine. They should also be\nadvised to seek urgent medical attention if they develop swelling, redness,\nor pain at injecting sites.\nInvestigators (see email addresses below) at the PHLS in England and Wales\nwould be interested to hear of any recent cases of botulism in IDUs in\nother European countries.\nReferences :\n1.CDSC.

This brings the total\nnumber of clinically diagnosed cases of wound botulism in IDUs reported in\nthe United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to 13 in 2002 (2, 3). The recent\ncases may be caused by a batch of drugs contaminated with the anaerobic\nbacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Reports of wound botulism in IDUs are a\nrelatively new phenomenon with no clinically diagnosed cases in the UK and\nRepublic of Ireland up to the end of 1999.

In this article there is\nmention of 13 cases since the beginning of the year, suggesting the\npossibility of a contaminated batch of heroin on the market in the UK,\nsomewhat reminiscent of the outbreak in California in 1995 (2). One wonders\nif other countries have been seeing a similar increase in wound botulism in\nrecent months.\n1. CDC. Wound Botulism Associated with Parenteral Cocaine Abuse -- New\nYork City.

When the\ndeaths stop, the Veterinary Services will allow the moshavim [collective\nfarms] involved to resume sale of their milk even though the disease is not\nknown to pass to milk.\nThe deaths of the cows caused significant financial harm to the\nLachish-area moshavim, but insurance companies should reimburse the farmers\nfor the dead cows. Each cow is worth 4500 to 5000 NIS [900 to 1000 US\ndollars]. The Israel Dairy Board, Nir said, will also compensate them, at\nleast for the milk that was destroyed.\n[Byline: Judy Siegel-Itzkovich]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Major outbreaks of Botulism types C and D have been described in various\ncountries during recent years. In January 1990, during an outbreak in 2\nbeef feedlots on the Darling Downs in Queensland, Australia, 5500 head of\ncattle from a total population of approximately 30 000 head were reported\nto have died of Botulism type D (see reference 19980428.0813). During an\noutbreak in a dairy farm in California in April 1998, more than 400 head\nwere reported to have died; type C was involved. Outbreaks have been\nreported in various other countries.\nIsrael has witnessed several such outbreaks throughout the years. In 1978,\na major outbreak of botulism type D caused the deaths and emergency\nslaughter of more than 1000 animals, most of them dairy cattle. Spores of\n_Cl. botulinum_ type D spread to many farms from 2 central animal feed\nplants by recycled, non-sterilized poultry manure that included remains of\navian cadavers. Subsequently, annual botulism vaccinations of cattle and of\nother vulnerable animals with a vaccine, including toxoids of _Cl.\nbotulinum_ types C and D adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide gel, have been\nintroduced and are routinely applied in most parts of the country. Sporadic\ncases involving unvaccinated animals (mainly young cows) have been reported\nto occur every year.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol3no2/shimshon.htm>\nSince 1996, the feeding of milking cows, sheep, and goats with poultry\nmanure was officially banned, while feeding of all animals was prohibited\nduring 15 days prior to slaughter.\nThe above press information on the current outbreak is rather limited;\nclarifications from the professionals involved on the suspected source of\ncontamination, detection of toxin and/or bacteria in feed and in the\ndiseased animals, as well as detailed epidemiological and clinical data\nwill be useful. Of particular interest would be confirmation (or otherwise)\nof the vaccine allegedly used: its manufacture, testing, and vaccination\nregime.\nThe veterinary and public-health authorities involved are to be commended\nfor the early diagnosis and their timely extra safety measure in\nwithdrawing the milk from the food chain (despite the fact that botulinum\ntype D is generally regarded as non-pathogenic to humans).\n\nAdditional, recently summarized data on Botulism in cattle may be found in\ncomments to reference 20020315.3750. - Mod.

Joe Ramos, a field representative\nwith Western United Dairymen, said the association is sending a statewide\nmailer to all Grade A dairies informing them about the Hibmas' situation.\nWestern United Dairymen is collecting the names of people interested in\ndonating animals to the dairy. People wishing to donate money are asked to\nmake checks payable to the Hibma Dairy Trust Fund, and send the checks to\nWestern United Dairymen, 1315 K St., Modesto, California, USA 95354.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n.......................tg/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

How it came to be inside the\nhay, we don't know,\" he said.\nWhen several hundred cows died from botulism at the Genasci Brothers Dairy\nin Modesto last year, the source was tracked to a cat carcass that had been\nmixed in with the hay.\n\"We have had no such luck in this case,\" Breitmeyer said. \"All the things\nwe've tested have come back negative for the botulism toxin.\"\nHe said it is likely all the suspect feed was consumed before state\nscientists arrived at the dairy. Some rodent and bird bones were found in\nthe hay, but Breitmeyer said that is not unusual in large bales.\nBreitmeyer said there has been some speculation that big, tightly packed\nbales of hay can provide an environment for botulism, even without the\npresence of an animal carcass.\n\"But we must be careful not to jump to some assumption,\" Breitmeyer said.\n\"I think we really need to get some research, and one of our goals is to\ntake a hard look at this.\"\nOrganizers are now trying to help make sure the dairy can start accepting\nsome donations of animals, Hidalgo said. Joe Ramos, a field representative\nwith Western United Dairymen, said the association is sending a statewide\nmailer to all Grade A dairies informing them about the Hibmas' situation.\nWestern United Dairymen is collecting the names of people interested in\ndonating animals to the dairy. People wishing to donate money are asked to\nmake checks payable to the Hibma Dairy Trust Fund, and send the checks to\nWestern United Dairymen, 1315 K St., Modesto, California, USA 95354.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n.......................tg/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The peyote was found to contain type\nB botulinum toxin by an assay at CDC, Atlanta.\nOne case was hospitalized and required parenteral nutrition for 14 days.\nAll recovered in 4-12 weeks. None were treated with antibotulinum toxin,\nsince that is reserved for people whose condition deteriorates seriously.\nThe peyote tea was made from cactus buttons ground with alkali and stored\nunder water in a closed jar for 2 months in the refrigerator. This is not\nthe traditional way of preparation, and it allowed spores of _Clostridium\nbotulinum_, which were on the cactus (since they are found in the\nenvironment) to germinate and produce the toxin.\n[Authored by: H. Hashimoto, V.J.Clyde & K.L.Parko\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[Foodborne botulism, generally caused by type E botulinum toxin, occurs\nwith an unusually high incidence among native populations in northern\nCanada and Alaska as well. This problem has been recognized for decades,\nand is often associated with inappropriate modifications of traditional\nfermentation/preservation practices applied to seal, whale, or other meats.\nReference: Shaffer, N. et al., West.

Stool collected 1/18/96 from the\nbrother is negative for toxin but is culture positive for Clostridium\nbotulinium. Stool has not be collected from the sister.\nBoth patients have a history of consuming home-canned asparagus. The\nsister was given 12 jars of asparagus by a relative. She gave 1 jar\nto her brother. The brother consumed one spear the evening of\n1/9/96, the asparagus tasted bad, the jar contents were discarded.\nThe sister tasted asparagus from another jar on the evening of\n1/10/96, this asparagus also tasted bad. Contents of her 11 jars\nwere discarded. The jars were not washed after the contents were\ndiscarded. A pooled washing of these 11 jars was culture\npositive for Clostridium botulinium. Botulinal toxin was also\ndetected in this washing. The relative who canned the asparagus\nresides in Washington state. Home-canned asparagus in her possession\nalso have been positive for botulinal toxin. All remaining jars\n(35) of asparagus have been destroyed.\nBoth patients are recovering.
