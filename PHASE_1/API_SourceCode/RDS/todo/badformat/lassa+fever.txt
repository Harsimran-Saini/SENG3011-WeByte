These were reported from 4 states (Ondo, Edo, Taraba, and Plateau) (Table 3).\n- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 25, 2020, 216 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 20.8%, which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2019 (22.5%).\n- In total for 2020, 27 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 129 local government areas (Figure 2 and 3).\n- Of all confirmed cases, 72% are from Ondo (33%), Edo (32%), and Ebonyi (7%) states.\n- The predominant age-group affected is 21-30 years (range: less than 1 to 78 years; median age: 33 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1.2 (Figure 4).\n- The number of suspected cases has significantly increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2019.\n- No new healthcare worker was affected in the reporting week 26.\n- Lassa fever outbreak emergency phase declared over on 28 Apr 2020 based on composite indicators national threshold.\n- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG), continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.\n\n[The following are available at the source URL above:]\nFigure [graph] 1.

States with confirmed cases have activated state- level EOCs.\n- National Rapid Response Teams have been deployed from NCDC to support response activities in 10 states.\n- Surge staff (doctors, nurses, laboratorians, and hygienist) deployed to ISTH and FMC Owo\n- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected states\n- The 5 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.\n- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment, and IPC commodities.\n- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies.\n- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment\n\nNotes on this report\nData source\nInformation for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre.\n\nCase definitions\n- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents, b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms OR any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.\n- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation)\n- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing\n- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever\n\nCalculations\n- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 4 new confirmed and 67 new suspected cases in week 26 (22-28 Jun 2020) indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing but declining considerably. The decline is doubtless responsible for the declaration of the end of the emergency phase of the disease on 28 Apr 2020. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases may have occurred in week 7. There are now 218 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 26).\n\nThe report above confirms that Ondo, Ebonyi, and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, and local government areas remain at 129 with at least one case. Nigeria is into the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March 2020) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this is the case again this year (2020).\n\nTransmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.\n\nImages of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:\n_Mastomys natalensis_: https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis;\n_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (20): Nigeria 20200623.7503129\nLassa fever - West Africa (19): Nigeria 20200531.7412415\nLassa fever - West Africa (17): Nigeria 20200426.7270654\nLassa fever - West Africa (16): Nigeria 20200412.7216572\nLassa fever - West Africa (15): Nigeria 20200403.7177542\nLassa fever - West Africa (14): Nigeria 20200315.7091639\nLassa fever - West Africa (13): Nigeria 20200305.7054665\nLassa fever - West Africa (12): Nigeria 20200301.7037605\nLassa fever - West Africa (11): Nigeria 20200221.7010079\nLassa fever - West Africa (10): Nigeria 20200213.6987321\nLassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria 20200207.6963296\nLassa fever - West Africa (08): Nigeria (ON) 20200130.6935837\nLassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria 20200129.6930926\nLassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria 20200124.6913950\nLassa fever - West Africa (05): Nigeria 20200123.6910668\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria 20200120.6900944\nLassa fever - West Africa (02): Nigeria 20200107.6876305\nLassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria 20200101.6865640\n.................................................ty/tw/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-21 00:00:00", "1040-04-16 00:00:00", "2022-02-27 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Ebonyi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "weekly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "8140171", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8140171", "date": "2020-07-04 20:54:35", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (21): NIGERIA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 28 Jun 2020\nSource: Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) [edited]\nhttps://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/sitreps/?cat=5&name=An%20update%20of%20Lassa%20fever%20outbreak%20in%20Nigeria\n\n\nLassa fever [LF] situation report -- epidemiological week 26 (22-28 Jun 2020)\n------------------------------\n\nKey points\n------------\nCurrent week (26) (22-28 Jun 2020) / Cumulative weeks 1-26 / Cumulative 2019 weeks 1-26\nSuspected cases: 67 / 5201 / 2882\nConfirmed cases: 4 / 1040 / 603\nProbable cases: 0 / 14 / 17\nDeaths: 2 / 218 / 136\nCase fatality rate (CFR [%]): 50.0 / 21.0 / 22.6\nNumber of states affected: 2 / 27 / 22\nLocal government areas (LGAs) affected: 3 / 129 / 83\n\nHighlights\n- In week 26, the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 5 in week 25, 2020, to 4 cases.

The decline is doubtless responsible for the declaration of the end of the emergency phase of the disease on 28 Apr 2020. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases may have occurred in week 7. There are now 218 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 26).\n\nThe report above confirms that Ondo, Ebonyi, and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, and local government areas remain at 129 with at least one case. Nigeria is into the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March 2020) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this is the case again this year (2020).\n\nTransmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.\n\nImages of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:\n_Mastomys natalensis_: https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis;\n_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (20): Nigeria 20200623.7503129\nLassa fever - West Africa (19): Nigeria 20200531.7412415\nLassa fever - West Africa (17): Nigeria 20200426.7270654\nLassa fever - West Africa (16): Nigeria 20200412.7216572\nLassa fever - West Africa (15): Nigeria 20200403.7177542\nLassa fever - West Africa (14): Nigeria 20200315.7091639\nLassa fever - West Africa (13): Nigeria 20200305.7054665\nLassa fever - West Africa (12): Nigeria 20200301.7037605\nLassa fever - West Africa (11): Nigeria 20200221.7010079\nLassa fever - West Africa (10): Nigeria 20200213.6987321\nLassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria 20200207.6963296\nLassa fever - West Africa (08): Nigeria (ON) 20200130.6935837\nLassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria 20200129.6930926\nLassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria 20200124.6913950\nLassa fever - West Africa (05): Nigeria 20200123.6910668\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria 20200120.6900944\nLassa fever - West Africa (02): Nigeria 20200107.6876305\nLassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria 20200101.6865640\n.................................................ty/tw/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-21 00:00:00", "1040-04-16 00:00:00", "2022-02-27 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Ebonyi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "weekly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "8064129", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8064129", "date": "2020-07-04 20:54:35", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (21): NIGERIA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 28 Jun 2020\nSource: Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) [edited]\nhttps://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/sitreps/?cat=5&name=An%20update%20of%20Lassa%20fever%20outbreak%20in%20Nigeria\n\n\nLassa fever [LF] situation report -- epidemiological week 26 (22-28 Jun 2020)\n------------------------------\n\nKey points\n------------\nCurrent week (26) (22-28 Jun 2020) / Cumulative weeks 1-26 / Cumulative 2019 weeks 1-26\nSuspected cases: 67 / 5201 / 2882\nConfirmed cases: 4 / 1040 / 603\nProbable cases: 0 / 14 / 17\nDeaths: 2 / 218 / 136\nCase fatality rate (CFR [%]): 50.0 / 21.0 / 22.6\nNumber of states affected: 2 / 27 / 22\nLocal government areas (LGAs) affected: 3 / 129 / 83\n\nHighlights\n- In week 26, the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 5 in week 25, 2020, to 4 cases.

It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.\n\nImages of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:\n_Mastomys natalensis_: https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis;\n_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (20): Nigeria 20200623.7503129\nLassa fever - West Africa (19): Nigeria 20200531.7412415\nLassa fever - West Africa (17): Nigeria 20200426.7270654\nLassa fever - West Africa (16): Nigeria 20200412.7216572\nLassa fever - West Africa (15): Nigeria 20200403.7177542\nLassa fever - West Africa (14): Nigeria 20200315.7091639\nLassa fever - West Africa (13): Nigeria 20200305.7054665\nLassa fever - West Africa (12): Nigeria 20200301.7037605\nLassa fever - West Africa (11): Nigeria 20200221.7010079\nLassa fever - West Africa (10): Nigeria 20200213.6987321\nLassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria 20200207.6963296\nLassa fever - West Africa (08): Nigeria (ON) 20200130.6935837\nLassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria 20200129.6930926\nLassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria 20200124.6913950\nLassa fever - West Africa (05): Nigeria 20200123.6910668\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria 20200120.6900944\nLassa fever - West Africa (02): Nigeria 20200107.6876305\nLassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria 20200101.6865640\n.................................................ty/tw/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-21 00:00:00", "1040-04-16 00:00:00", "2022-02-27 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Ebonyi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "weekly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7945683", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (23): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7945683", "date": "2020-07-04 20:54:35", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (21): NIGERIA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 28 Jun 2020\nSource: Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) [edited]\nhttps://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/sitreps/?cat=5&name=An%20update%20of%20Lassa%20fever%20outbreak%20in%20Nigeria\n\n\nLassa fever [LF] situation report -- epidemiological week 26 (22-28 Jun 2020)\n------------------------------\n\nKey points\n------------\nCurrent week (26) (22-28 Jun 2020) / Cumulative weeks 1-26 / Cumulative 2019 weeks 1-26\nSuspected cases: 67 / 5201 / 2882\nConfirmed cases: 4 / 1040 / 603\nProbable cases: 0 / 14 / 17\nDeaths: 2 / 218 / 136\nCase fatality rate (CFR [%]): 50.0 / 21.0 / 22.6\nNumber of states affected: 2 / 27 / 22\nLocal government areas (LGAs) affected: 3 / 129 / 83\n\nHighlights\n- In week 26, the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 5 in week 25, 2020, to 4 cases.

States with confirmed cases have activated state- level EOCs.\n- National Rapid Response Teams have been deployed from NCDC to support response activities in 10 states.\n- Surge staff (doctors, nurses, laboratorians, and hygienist) deployed to ISTH and FMC Owo\n- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected states\n- The 5 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.\n- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment, and IPC commodities.\n- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies.\n- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment\n\nNotes on this report\nData source\nInformation for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre.\n\nCase definitions\n- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents, b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms OR any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.\n- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation)\n- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing\n- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever\n\nCalculations\n- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 4 new confirmed and 67 new suspected cases in week 26 (22-28 Jun 2020) indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing but declining considerably. The decline is doubtless responsible for the declaration of the end of the emergency phase of the disease on 28 Apr 2020. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases may have occurred in week 7. There are now 218 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 26).\n\nThe report above confirms that Ondo, Ebonyi, and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, and local government areas remain at 129 with at least one case. Nigeria is into the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March 2020) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this is the case again this year (2020).\n\nTransmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.\n\nImages of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:\n_Mastomys natalensis_: https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis;\n_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (20): Nigeria 20200623.7503129\nLassa fever - West Africa (19): Nigeria 20200531.7412415\nLassa fever - West Africa (17): Nigeria 20200426.7270654\nLassa fever - West Africa (16): Nigeria 20200412.7216572\nLassa fever - West Africa (15): Nigeria 20200403.7177542\nLassa fever - West Africa (14): Nigeria 20200315.7091639\nLassa fever - West Africa (13): Nigeria 20200305.7054665\nLassa fever - West Africa (12): Nigeria 20200301.7037605\nLassa fever - West Africa (11): Nigeria 20200221.7010079\nLassa fever - West Africa (10): Nigeria 20200213.6987321\nLassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria 20200207.6963296\nLassa fever - West Africa (08): Nigeria (ON) 20200130.6935837\nLassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria 20200129.6930926\nLassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria 20200124.6913950\nLassa fever - West Africa (05): Nigeria 20200123.6910668\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria 20200120.6900944\nLassa fever - West Africa (02): Nigeria 20200107.6876305\nLassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria 20200101.6865640\n.................................................ty/tw/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-21 00:00:00", "1040-04-16 00:00:00", "2022-02-27 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-26 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Ebonyi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "weekly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7540787", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (21): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7540787", "date": "2020-07-04 20:54:35", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (21): NIGERIA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 28 Jun 2020\nSource: Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) [edited]\nhttps://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/sitreps/?cat=5&name=An%20update%20of%20Lassa%20fever%20outbreak%20in%20Nigeria\n\n\nLassa fever [LF] situation report -- epidemiological week 26 (22-28 Jun 2020)\n------------------------------\n\nKey points\n------------\nCurrent week (26) (22-28 Jun 2020) / Cumulative weeks 1-26 / Cumulative 2019 weeks 1-26\nSuspected cases: 67 / 5201 / 2882\nConfirmed cases: 4 / 1040 / 603\nProbable cases: 0 / 14 / 17\nDeaths: 2 / 218 / 136\nCase fatality rate (CFR [%]): 50.0 / 21.0 / 22.6\nNumber of states affected: 2 / 27 / 22\nLocal government areas (LGAs) affected: 3 / 129 / 83\n\nHighlights\n- In week 26, the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 5 in week 25, 2020, to 4 cases.

States with confirmed cases have activated state- level EOCs.\n- National Rapid Response Teams have been deployed from NCDC to support response activities in 10 states.\n- Surge staff (doctors, nurses, laboratorians, and hygienist) deployed to ISTH and FMC Owo\n- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected states\n- The 5 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.\n- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment, and IPC commodities.\n- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies.\n- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment\n\nNotes on this report\nData source\nInformation for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre.\n\nCase definitions\n- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents, b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms OR any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.\n- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation)\n- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing\n- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever\n\nCalculations\n- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 4 new confirmed and 67 new suspected cases in week 26 (22-28 Jun 2020) indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing but declining considerably. The decline is doubtless responsible for the declaration of the end of the emergency phase of the disease on 28 Apr 2020. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases may have occurred in week 7. There are now 218 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 26).\n\nThe report above confirms that Ondo, Ebonyi, and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, and local government areas remain at 129 with at least one case. Nigeria is into the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March 2020) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this is the case again this year (2020).\n\nTransmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

Of the states with confirmed cases, 8 of them have activated state-level EOCs.\n- National rapid response teams have been deployed from NCDC to support response activities in 9 states.\n- Surge staff (doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians, hygienists) deployed to Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital [ISTH; in Edo State] and Federal Medical Center [FMC] Owo [in Ondo State]\n- State public health emergency operations centre activated in affected states\n- The 5 molecular laboratories for Lassa fever testing in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time\n- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment, and IPC [infection prevention and control] commodities\n- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies\n\nNotes on this report\n--------------------\nData source\n-----------\nInformation for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever EOC.\n\nCase definitions\n----------------\n- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and has either a) history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents, or b) history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms, OR any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.\n- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation).\n- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing.\n- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.\n- Healthcare worker (HCW) infections may not necessarily be of nosocomial origin; proposed study to differentiate nosocomial healthcare worker infection from community infection.\n\nCalculations\n------------\n- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promedmail@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 85 new confirmed and 421 new suspected cases in week 9 (24 Feb-1 Mar 2020) indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing at a relatively high level, although declining somewhat. The graph in Figure 6 indicates a peak of cases may have occurred in week 7. It will be interesting to see if the decline in cases continues going forward. There are now 132 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). There is one new infected healthcare worker during the current week (week 9).\n\nThe report above confirms that Ondo and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, but local government areas increased to 118 with at least one case.

It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.\n\nImages of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:\n_Mastomys natalensis_: https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis\n_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (12): Nigeria 20200301.7037605\nLassa fever - West Africa (11): Nigeria 20200221.7010079\nLassa fever - West Africa (10): Nigeria 20200213.6987321\nLassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria 20200207.6963296\nLassa fever - West Africa (08): Nigeria (ON) 20200130.6935837\nLassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria 20200129.6930926\nLassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria 20200124.6913950\nLassa fever - West Africa (05): Nigeria 20200123.6910668\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria 20200120.6900944\nLassa fever - West Africa (02): Nigeria 20200107.6876305\nLassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria 20200101.6865640\n.................................................ty/tw/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-09 00:00:00", "2020-01-09 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Taraba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo State", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ebonyi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "weekly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kogi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Plateau", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Benue", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bauchi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7037605", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (12): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7037605", "date": "2020-01-23 17:28:33", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (05): NIGERIA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Official update\n[2] Ondo state\n\n******\n[1] Official update\nDate: Sun 19 Jan 2020\nSource: Nigeria Center for Disease Control Lassa fever situation report [edited]\nhttps://www.ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/sitreps/?cat=5&name=An%20update%20of%20Lassa%20fever%20outbreak%20in%20Nigeria\n\n\nEpi week 3, 13-19 Jan 2020\n\nKey points\n\nTable 1: Summary of current week indicators [for week 3]\nSuspected cases (negative): 159 (78)\nConfirmed cases: 81\nDeaths: 10\nCase fatality rate (CFR): 12.3%\nNumber of states affected: 6\nLGAs affected: 17\n\nTable 2: Cumulative data compared to previous year (week 1 - current week) [for 2019 and 2020]\nSuspected cases (negative)\n- 2019: 379 (237)\n- 2020: 398 (235)\nConfirmed cases\n- 2019: 141\n- 2020: 163\nDeaths for confirmed cases\n- 2019: 33\n- 2020: 24\nCFR%\n- 2019: 23.4%\n- 2020: 14.7%\n\nHighlights\n\n- In week 3, the number of new confirmed cases has increased from 64 cases in week 1, 2020, to 81.

The state chief epidemiologist, Dr Steven Fagbemi, disclosed this on Tuesday [21 Jan 2020] at the governor's office in the Government House in Akure, the state capital.\n\nDr Fagbemi made the disclosure while briefing Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu as well as the local government chairmen from Ondo North and Central senatorial districts of the state.

He added that 47 patients on admission were responding to treatment, while 21 others had already been treated and discharged.\n\nThe outbreak is said to have affected Owo, Akoko South-West, Akure South, and Ondo West LGAs of the state.\n\nAlso confirming the outbreak, the commissioner for health, Dr Wahab Adegbenro, noted that the disease has been occurring in the state for some years, especially during the dry season. He therefore advised Nigerians to visit hospitals when they noticed symptoms of fever.\n\nEarlier, Governor Akeredolu advised the local government chairmen in the state to deploy cleaners to markets and public places to prevent the outbreak of diseases.

The state chief epidemiologist, Dr Steven Fagbemi, disclosed this on Tuesday [21 Jan 2020] at the governor's office in the Government House in Akure, the state capital.\n\nDr Fagbemi made the disclosure while briefing Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu as well as the local government chairmen from Ondo North and Central senatorial districts of the state. He also revealed that 84 cases have been reported so far in the state since 1 Jan 2020.\n\nAccording to the epidemiologist, 16 of the patients have passed on, as their cases had reached the advanced stage before they were taken to the hospital. He added that 47 patients on admission were responding to treatment, while 21 others had already been treated and discharged.\n\nThe outbreak is said to have affected Owo, Akoko South-West, Akure South, and Ondo West LGAs of the state.\n\nAlso confirming the outbreak, the commissioner for health, Dr Wahab Adegbenro, noted that the disease has been occurring in the state for some years, especially during the dry season. He therefore advised Nigerians to visit hospitals when they noticed symptoms of fever.\n\nEarlier, Governor Akeredolu advised the local government chairmen in the state to deploy cleaners to markets and public places to prevent the outbreak of diseases. He also called on residents to maintain a high level of hygiene to curtail further spread of the Lassa virus in the state.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 81 new confirmed and 159 suspected cases in week 3 of 2020 indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing to accelerate. The 1st report above confirms that Ondo state has the majority of cases, tied with Edo state. Nigeria is now entering the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2020).\n\nTransmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

Nigeria is still within the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (1 Jan-17 Mar 2019) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2019). There are 129 confirmed deaths, with a 5-case increase from the previous reporting period. Fortunately, there are no new healthcare workers infected during this reporting period, and the total number of infected healthcare workers remains at 18. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 21 states and the number of affected LGAs remaining at 82.\n\nTransmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

The statement that contained the declaration was co-signed by the NCDC's director general, Chikwe Ihekweazu, and Clement Peter, the officer-in-charge of the World Health Organization, Nigeria, (WHO), Premium Times reports.\n\nThe NCDC's boss said that due to an impressive response, the Lassa fever case count has notably dropped, such that the disease in the country has fallen below emergency levels. He said: \"This year [2019], there was also a decline in case fatality rate of Lassa fever, from 27% in 2018 to 22% in 2019.\" However, Ihekweazu said that the deadly disease is not yet over in the country, as there might be few cases of patients with the fever, adding that the agency will work with a multi-sectoral Lassa fever Technical Working Group for co-ordination of efforts. He said: \"Given that Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria, it is likely that the country will continue to record cases of Lassa fever. \"The group's focus is to continue monitoring cases, as well as improve disease prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, and response activities across all levels in Nigeria.\n\n\"However, we have several research strategies to improve our knowledge of the disease. We are also working with states and partners to establish more long-term strategies, such as improved risk communication, infection prevention and control, regular environmental sanitation, enhanced capacity of health workers, and improvement of treatment centres, among others.\"\n\nOn his part, Peter said: \"WHO remains committed to working with the government of Nigeria and other partners to sustain and improve Nigeria's capacity to detect, prepare for, and respond to Lassa fever outbreaks, including implementing a Lassa fever research plan and other control strategies.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the emergency phase of this year's (2019's) outbreak has been declared over, new cases continue to occur. As the above comment indicated, there has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 over the past 3 years. Although Nigeria is reaching the end of the usual transmission period of January-June, cases can be expected to occur sporadically for the remainder of this year (2019). Avoidance of contact with reservoir rodents and their excrement will be essential to reduce cases of Lassa fever. Continuing public education will be required to accomplish this goal. That constitutes a daunting effort, considering the wide geographic area in which the virus is endemic. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (26): Nigeria 20190521.6478581\nLassa fever - West Africa (25): Nigeria 20190503.6453789\nLassa fever - West Africa (24): Nigeria 20190429.6447612\nLassa fever - West Africa (23): Nigeria 20190420.6432321\nLassa fever - West Africa (22): Nigeria 20190415.6422570\nLassa fever - West Africa (21): Nigeria 20190407.6408268\nLassa fever - West Africa (20): Nigeria 20190331.6395835\nLassa fever - West Africa (19): Nigeria 20190324.6383813\nLassa fever - West Africa (18): Nigeria 20190318.6374495\nLassa fever - West Africa (17): Nigeria 20190309.6359113\nLassa fever - West Africa (16): Nigeria 20190304.6348673\nLassa fever - West Africa (15): Nigeria (ON) 20190301.6342760\nLassa fever - West Africa (15): Nigeria (ON) 20190301.6342760\nLassa fever - West Africa (14): Nigeria (PL) 20190222.6331712\nLassa fever - West Africa (13): Nigeria 20190222.6330382\nLassa fever - West Africa (12): Nigeria (EB) 20190219.6325960\nLassa fever - West Africa (11): Nigeria 20190218.6322390\nLassa fever - West Africa (10): Nigeria 20190211.6307740\nLassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria (ON) 20190204.6294229\nLassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria 20190201.6290606\nLassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria 20190131.6288130\nLassa fever - West Africa (05): Nigeria 20190124.6274305\nLassa fever - West Africa (04): Nigeria (PL, KW ex Benin) 20190117.6264610\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria 20190111.6253867\nLassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria 20190107.6246303\n.................................................sb/sh/ty/tw/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2019-05-16 00:00:00", "2019-05-16 00:00:00", "2019-05-16 00:00:00", "2504-03-16 00:00:00", "1914-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "7446-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-05-19 00:00:00", "2019-05-19 00:00:00", "2019-01-20 00:00:00", "2019-05-19 00:00:00", "2019-05-19 00:00:00", "2504-03-16 00:00:00", "2426-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-06-12 00:00:00", "2019-05-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-05-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2019-05-31 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Centre", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Jalingo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taraba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nasarawa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kaduna", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gombe", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ebonyi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Adamawa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kwara", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Plateau", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "weekly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Benue", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WEST AFRICA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6692075", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (33): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6692075", "date": "2019-06-02 06:21:55", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (27): NIGERIA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this posting:\n[1] Nigeria CDC update\n[2] Emergency declared over\n\n******\n[1] Nigeria CDC update\nDate: Sun 19 May 2019\nSource: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) situation report [edited]\nhttps://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/sitreps/?cat=5&name=An%20update%20of%20Lassa%20fever%20outbreak%20in%20Nigeria\n\n\nHighlights\n- In the reporting week 20 (13-19 May 2019) 6 new confirmed cases were reported from 3 states: Edo (2), Ebonyi (2), and Ondo (2) states, with one new death from Edo state;\n- From 1 Jan-19 May 2019, a total of 2504 suspected cases have been reported from 21 states.

Nigeria is still within the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (1 Jan-17 Mar 2019) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2019). There are 129 confirmed deaths, with a 5-case increase from the previous reporting period. Fortunately, there are no new healthcare workers infected during this reporting period, and the total number of infected healthcare workers remains at 18. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 21 states and the number of affected LGAs remaining at 82.\n\nTransmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

Of these, 578 (7.8%) are currently being followed up, 6800 (91.3%) have completed 21 days follow-up, while 8 (0.1%) were lost to follow-up. A total of 119 (1.6%) symptomatic contacts have been identified, of which 60 (0.8%) have tested positive;\n- Multi-sectoral one health national rapid response teams (NCDC, NFELTP, and Federal Ministry of Environment) deployed to Kebbi state; and\n- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.\n\nFigure 1 [map].

The statement that contained the declaration was co-signed by the NCDC's director general, Chikwe Ihekweazu, and Clement Peter, the officer-in-charge of the World Health Organization, Nigeria, (WHO), Premium Times reports.\n\nThe NCDC's boss said that due to an impressive response, the Lassa fever case count has notably dropped, such that the disease in the country has fallen below emergency levels. He said: \"This year [2019], there was also a decline in case fatality rate of Lassa fever, from 27% in 2018 to 22% in 2019.\" However, Ihekweazu said that the deadly disease is not yet over in the country, as there might be few cases of patients with the fever, adding that the agency will work with a multi-sectoral Lassa fever Technical Working Group for co-ordination of efforts. He said: \"Given that Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria, it is likely that the country will continue to record cases of Lassa fever. \"The group's focus is to continue monitoring cases, as well as improve disease prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, and response activities across all levels in Nigeria.\n\n\"However, we have several research strategies to improve our knowledge of the disease. We are also working with states and partners to establish more long-term strategies, such as improved risk communication, infection prevention and control, regular environmental sanitation, enhanced capacity of health workers, and improvement of treatment centres, among others.\"\n\nOn his part, Peter said: \"WHO remains committed to working with the government of Nigeria and other partners to sustain and improve Nigeria's capacity to detect, prepare for, and respond to Lassa fever outbreaks, including implementing a Lassa fever research plan and other control strategies.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the emergency phase of this year's (2019's) outbreak has been declared over, new cases continue to occur.

A total of 12 cases have been reported among healthcare workers in 7 states - Edo (4), Ondo (3), Ebonyi (1), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1) and Benue (1) including one death in Enugu.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases reported across Nigeria remains high. In week 6, 2019 (week ending 10 Feb 2019), 37 new confirmed cases including 10 deaths (case fatality ratio 27%) were reported from 9 states across Nigeria. The majority of cases were reported from Ondo (12) and Edo (10) states. The number of confirmed cases reported in week 6, 2019, represents a slight decrease compared to week 5 when 68 confirmed cases were reported (Figure 1).\n\nOf the 3746 contacts identified since January 2019, 2658 are still under follow-up while 1045 have completed 21 days of follow-up. As many as 60 contacts became symptomatic, of which 39 tested positive.\n\nA total 91 case-patients are currently in admission at treatment centers across the country. The case-patients are being treated with standard supportive care.\n\nFigure 1: Number of confirmed and probable Lassa fever cases in Nigeria reported by the week of illness onset from 1 Jan through 10 Feb 2019\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\n- On 22 Jan 2019, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) declared the outbreak an emergency.\n- Multi-sectoral One Health national rapid response teams have been deployed to Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Plateau, and Bauchi to support field investigation and response activities.\n- Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all states following alert communication and a press release from NCDC.\n- Treatment of Lassa fever cases is also ongoing at designated treatment centres across the country.\n- Risk communication and community engagement activities continue in the states. National awareness was improved through the recently concluded international Lassa fever conference which took place from 16 -17 Jan 2019.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nLassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.\n\nAlthough Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June, the current increase in new confirmed cases and deaths should be monitored closely and addressed appropriately. Cases in neigbouring Benin and Togo potentially originating from Nigeria have been reported in previous years and therefore neighbouring countries should be monitored accordingly.\n\nWith 12 confirmed cases so far among healthcare workers, there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of the disease amidst reports of inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) supplied in some health facilities and complacency on the part of health workers towards maintaining IPC measures.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. WHO continues to advice all countries in the Lassa fever belt on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate as well as strengthen cross-border collaboration.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the currently available information.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[The WHO recommended community engagement is a challenge, given the broad geographical area in which cases are occurring. A proactive public education effort is required to encourage use of containers that prevent rodent access to food materials and blocking of entry points of the rodents into houses.\n\nInterestingly, although the WHO does not recommend travel restrictions, on 7 Feb 2019 the USA CDC has recommended taking precautions in its updated travel advisory for Nigeria due to the recent Lassa fever cases, stating, \"Travelers to Nigeria should avoid contact with rats, especially rat urine and feces, and take precautions to keep their accommodations clean and free of rodents. If you need to clean up after rodents, take the proper steps to avoid getting sick. Travelers should also wash hands often, and avoid contact with people who are sick. Travelers who develop fever or other serious symptoms of Lassa fever during or after their trip should see a doctor right away. They should tell the doctor where they traveled in Nigeria and whether they had contact with a rodent or sick person.\" (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/lassa-fever-nigeria). - Mod.TY\n]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (10): Nigeria 20190211.6307740\nLassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria (ON) 20190204.6294229\nLassa fever - West Africa (08): Guinea (MM) 20190203.6292809\nLassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria 20190201.6290606\nLassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria 20190131.6288130\nLassa fever - West Africa (05): Nigeria 20190124.6274305\nLassa fever - West Africa (04): Nigeria (PL, KW ex Benin) 20190117.6264610\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria 20190111.6253867\nLassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria 20190107.6246303\n.................................................sb/dk/ty/ao/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever", "haemorrhagic fever"], "syndromes": ["haemorrhagic fever"], "event_date": ["2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2004-02-10 20:19:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "3746-03-16 00:00:00", "2658-03-16 00:00:00", "1045-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-02-15 00:00:00", "2019-02-10 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-01-16 00:00:00", "2019-02-10 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-02-14 00:00:00", "2019-02-10 00:00:00", "2019-01-16 00:00:00", "2658-03-16 00:00:00", "1045-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-02-10 00:00:00", "2019-01-22 00:00:00", "2019-02-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Centre", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rivers States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taraba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nasarawa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kaduna", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Guinea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gombe", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ebonyi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Adamawa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kwara", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Plateau", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "weekly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Benue", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WEST AFRICA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6359113", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (17): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6359113", "date": "2019-02-18 14:27:09", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (11): NIGERIA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Nigeria CDC\n[2] WHO\n\n******\n[1] Nigeria CDC\nDate: Sat 10 Feb 2019\nSource: Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) [edited]\nhttps://ncdc.gov.ng/themes/common/files/sitreps/b94e459c79a59ca9d667a55539cda5db.pdf\n\n\nHighlights\n----------\n- In the reporting week 6 (4-10 Feb 2019) 37 new confirmed cases were reported from Edo (10), Ondo (12), Ebonyi (4), Plateau (4), Taraba (3), Benue (1), Gombe (1), Rivers (1) and Kebbi (1) states with 10 new deaths in Edo (2), Ondo (2), Ebonyi (4) and Plateau (2).\n- From 1 Jan - 10 Feb 2019, a total of 947 suspected cases have been reported from 20 states and FCT.

There are 69 confirmed deaths, up from 51 in the previous reporting period. Unfortunately, 3 new healthcare workers, one each in Benue, Bauchi and Rivers States, were infected during this reporting period. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, occurring in 20 states (up from 19 in a previous reporting period) and 54 LGAs (up from 51 in the previous reporting period).\n\nTransmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

A total of 12 cases have been reported among healthcare workers in 7 states - Edo (4), Ondo (3), Ebonyi (1), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1) and Benue (1) including one death in Enugu.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases reported across Nigeria remains high. In week 6, 2019 (week ending 10 Feb 2019), 37 new confirmed cases including 10 deaths (case fatality ratio 27%) were reported from 9 states across Nigeria. The majority of cases were reported from Ondo (12) and Edo (10) states. The number of confirmed cases reported in week 6, 2019, represents a slight decrease compared to week 5 when 68 confirmed cases were reported (Figure 1).\n\nOf the 3746 contacts identified since January 2019, 2658 are still under follow-up while 1045 have completed 21 days of follow-up. As many as 60 contacts became symptomatic, of which 39 tested positive.\n\nA total 91 case-patients are currently in admission at treatment centers across the country. The case-patients are being treated with standard supportive care.\n\nFigure 1: Number of confirmed and probable Lassa fever cases in Nigeria reported by the week of illness onset from 1 Jan through 10 Feb 2019\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\n- On 22 Jan 2019, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) declared the outbreak an emergency.\n- Multi-sectoral One Health national rapid response teams have been deployed to Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Plateau, and Bauchi to support field investigation and response activities.\n- Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all states following alert communication and a press release from NCDC.\n- Treatment of Lassa fever cases is also ongoing at designated treatment centres across the country.\n- Risk communication and community engagement activities continue in the states. National awareness was improved through the recently concluded international Lassa fever conference which took place from 16 -17 Jan 2019.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nLassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.\n\nAlthough Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June, the current increase in new confirmed cases and deaths should be monitored closely and addressed appropriately. Cases in neigbouring Benin and Togo potentially originating from Nigeria have been reported in previous years and therefore neighbouring countries should be monitored accordingly.\n\nWith 12 confirmed cases so far among healthcare workers, there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of the disease amidst reports of inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) supplied in some health facilities and complacency on the part of health workers towards maintaining IPC measures.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. WHO continues to advice all countries in the Lassa fever belt on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate as well as strengthen cross-border collaboration.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the currently available information.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[The WHO recommended community engagement is a challenge, given the broad geographical area in which cases are occurring.

There are 69 confirmed deaths, up from 51 in the previous reporting period. Unfortunately, 3 new healthcare workers, one each in Benue, Bauchi and Rivers States, were infected during this reporting period. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, occurring in 20 states (up from 19 in a previous reporting period) and 54 LGAs (up from 51 in the previous reporting period).\n\nTransmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

A total of 12 cases have been reported among healthcare workers in 7 states - Edo (4), Ondo (3), Ebonyi (1), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1) and Benue (1) including one death in Enugu.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases reported across Nigeria remains high. In week 6, 2019 (week ending 10 Feb 2019), 37 new confirmed cases including 10 deaths (case fatality ratio 27%) were reported from 9 states across Nigeria. The majority of cases were reported from Ondo (12) and Edo (10) states. The number of confirmed cases reported in week 6, 2019, represents a slight decrease compared to week 5 when 68 confirmed cases were reported (Figure 1).\n\nOf the 3746 contacts identified since January 2019, 2658 are still under follow-up while 1045 have completed 21 days of follow-up. As many as 60 contacts became symptomatic, of which 39 tested positive.\n\nA total 91 case-patients are currently in admission at treatment centers across the country. The case-patients are being treated with standard supportive care.\n\nFigure 1: Number of confirmed and probable Lassa fever cases in Nigeria reported by the week of illness onset from 1 Jan through 10 Feb 2019\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\n- On 22 Jan 2019, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) declared the outbreak an emergency.\n- Multi-sectoral One Health national rapid response teams have been deployed to Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Plateau, and Bauchi to support field investigation and response activities.\n- Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all states following alert communication and a press release from NCDC.\n- Treatment of Lassa fever cases is also ongoing at designated treatment centres across the country.\n- Risk communication and community engagement activities continue in the states. National awareness was improved through the recently concluded international Lassa fever conference which took place from 16 -17 Jan 2019.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nLassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.\n\nAlthough Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June, the current increase in new confirmed cases and deaths should be monitored closely and addressed appropriately. Cases in neigbouring Benin and Togo potentially originating from Nigeria have been reported in previous years and therefore neighbouring countries should be monitored accordingly.\n\nWith 12 confirmed cases so far among healthcare workers, there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of the disease amidst reports of inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) supplied in some health facilities and complacency on the part of health workers towards maintaining IPC measures.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. WHO continues to advice all countries in the Lassa fever belt on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate as well as strengthen cross-border collaboration.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the currently available information.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[The WHO recommended community engagement is a challenge, given the broad geographical area in which cases are occurring. A proactive public education effort is required to encourage use of containers that prevent rodent access to food materials and blocking of entry points of the rodents into houses.\n\nInterestingly, although the WHO does not recommend travel restrictions, on 7 Feb 2019 the USA CDC has recommended taking precautions in its updated travel advisory for Nigeria due to the recent Lassa fever cases, stating, \"Travelers to Nigeria should avoid contact with rats, especially rat urine and feces, and take precautions to keep their accommodations clean and free of rodents. If you need to clean up after rodents, take the proper steps to avoid getting sick. Travelers should also wash hands often, and avoid contact with people who are sick. Travelers who develop fever or other serious symptoms of Lassa fever during or after their trip should see a doctor right away.

There are 69 confirmed deaths, up from 51 in the previous reporting period. Unfortunately, 3 new healthcare workers, one each in Benue, Bauchi and Rivers States, were infected during this reporting period. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, occurring in 20 states (up from 19 in a previous reporting period) and 54 LGAs (up from 51 in the previous reporting period).\n\nTransmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

A total of 12 cases have been reported among healthcare workers in 7 states - Edo (4), Ondo (3), Ebonyi (1), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1) and Benue (1) including one death in Enugu.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases reported across Nigeria remains high. In week 6, 2019 (week ending 10 Feb 2019), 37 new confirmed cases including 10 deaths (case fatality ratio 27%) were reported from 9 states across Nigeria. The majority of cases were reported from Ondo (12) and Edo (10) states. The number of confirmed cases reported in week 6, 2019, represents a slight decrease compared to week 5 when 68 confirmed cases were reported (Figure 1).\n\nOf the 3746 contacts identified since January 2019, 2658 are still under follow-up while 1045 have completed 21 days of follow-up. As many as 60 contacts became symptomatic, of which 39 tested positive.\n\nA total 91 case-patients are currently in admission at treatment centers across the country. The case-patients are being treated with standard supportive care.\n\nFigure 1: Number of confirmed and probable Lassa fever cases in Nigeria reported by the week of illness onset from 1 Jan through 10 Feb 2019\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\n- On 22 Jan 2019, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) declared the outbreak an emergency.\n- Multi-sectoral One Health national rapid response teams have been deployed to Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Plateau, and Bauchi to support field investigation and response activities.\n- Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all states following alert communication and a press release from NCDC.\n- Treatment of Lassa fever cases is also ongoing at designated treatment centres across the country.\n- Risk communication and community engagement activities continue in the states. National awareness was improved through the recently concluded international Lassa fever conference which took place from 16 -17 Jan 2019.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nLassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.\n\nAlthough Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June, the current increase in new confirmed cases and deaths should be monitored closely and addressed appropriately. Cases in neigbouring Benin and Togo potentially originating from Nigeria have been reported in previous years and therefore neighbouring countries should be monitored accordingly.\n\nWith 12 confirmed cases so far among healthcare workers, there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of the disease amidst reports of inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) supplied in some health facilities and complacency on the part of health workers towards maintaining IPC measures.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. WHO continues to advice all countries in the Lassa fever belt on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate as well as strengthen cross-border collaboration.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the currently available information.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[The WHO recommended community engagement is a challenge, given the broad geographical area in which cases are occurring. A proactive public education effort is required to encourage use of containers that prevent rodent access to food materials and blocking of entry points of the rodents into houses.\n\nInterestingly, although the WHO does not recommend travel restrictions, on 7 Feb 2019 the USA CDC has recommended taking precautions in its updated travel advisory for Nigeria due to the recent Lassa fever cases, stating, \"Travelers to Nigeria should avoid contact with rats, especially rat urine and feces, and take precautions to keep their accommodations clean and free of rodents. If you need to clean up after rodents, take the proper steps to avoid getting sick. Travelers should also wash hands often, and avoid contact with people who are sick. Travelers who develop fever or other serious symptoms of Lassa fever during or after their trip should see a doctor right away.

They should tell the doctor where they traveled in Nigeria and whether they had contact with a rodent or sick person.\" (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/lassa-fever-nigeria). - Mod.TY\n]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (10): Nigeria 20190211.6307740\nLassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria (ON) 20190204.6294229\nLassa fever - West Africa (08): Guinea (MM) 20190203.6292809\nLassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria 20190201.6290606\nLassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria 20190131.6288130\nLassa fever - West Africa (05): Nigeria 20190124.6274305\nLassa fever - West Africa (04): Nigeria (PL, KW ex Benin) 20190117.6264610\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria 20190111.6253867\nLassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria 20190107.6246303\n.................................................sb/dk/ty/ao/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever", "haemorrhagic fever"], "syndromes": ["haemorrhagic fever"], "event_date": ["2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2004-02-10 20:19:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "3746-03-16 00:00:00", "2658-03-16 00:00:00", "1045-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-02-15 00:00:00", "2019-02-10 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-01-16 00:00:00", "2019-02-10 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-02-14 00:00:00", "2019-02-10 00:00:00", "2019-01-16 00:00:00", "2658-03-16 00:00:00", "1045-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-02-10 00:00:00", "2019-01-22 00:00:00", "2019-02-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Centre", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rivers States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taraba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nasarawa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kaduna", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Guinea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gombe", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ebonyi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Adamawa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kwara", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Plateau", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "weekly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Benue", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WEST AFRICA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6307740", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (10): Nigeria"}, {"archive_id": "6294229", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria: (ON)"}, {"archive_id": "6292809", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (08): Guinea (MM)"}, {"archive_id": "6290606", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria"}, {"archive_id": "6288130", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria"}, {"archive_id": "6274305", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (05): Nigeria"}, {"archive_id": "6264610", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (04): Nigeria (PL, KW ex Benin)"}, {"archive_id": "6253867", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria"}, {"archive_id": "6248252", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (02): Togo (KA)"}, {"archive_id": "6246303", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria"}, {"archive_id": "6225335", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (50): Benin (LI)"}, {"archive_id": "6212688", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (49): Nigeria"}, {"archive_id": "6211773", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa Fever - West Africa (48): Benin (BO) ex Nigeria"}, {"archive_id": "6198090", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (47): Nigeria"}, {"archive_id": "6162269", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa Fever - West Africa (46): Nigeria"}, {"archive_id": "6143083", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (45): Nigeria"}, {"archive_id": "6125232", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (44): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6125232", "date": "2018-07-11 14:37:30", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (37): LIBERIA, WHO\n********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 6 Jul 2018, 5:00 PM\nSource: WHO Weekly Bulletin on Outbreaks and Other Emergencies [edited]\nhttp://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/273028/OEW27-300606072018.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y\n\n\nEvent Description\n-----------------\nLiberia has continued to experience sporadic cases of Lassa fever since the beginning of 2018. In week 25 (week ending 26 Jun 2018), 2 new confirmed Lassa fever cases were reported in Nimba County, the only county with active transmission currently. Nimba County has reported 5 confirmed Lassa fever cases since [12 May 2018]. In the latest event (the 2 confirmed cases in week 25), the 1st case-patient, a 59-year- old male from Gbehlay Geh district, fell ill on [4 Jun 2018] and was treated with antimalarials and antibiotics at a local clinic. On [20 Jun 2018], the case-patient presented to a public hospital with fever and other constitutional symptoms, and had bleeding from a venepuncture site. On [21 Jun 2018], a blood specimen was collected and sent to the National Public Health Reference Laboratory (NPHRL). The test result released on [26 Jun 2018] was positive for Lassa fever virus infection. The 2nd case-patient, a 41-year-old female, is the wife of the first case-patient (described above). She developed illness on [17 Jun 2018] and was admitted to the same hospital on [20 June 2018] with fever and other constitutional symptoms. Being a known contact, a blood specimen was collected on [21 Jun 2018] and the test result released on [26 Jun 2018] was positive for Lassa fever. The 2 case-patients are admitted under barrier nursing and ribavirin treatment initiated. A total of 26 contacts, including 13 health workers, have been line listed and are being followed up.\n\nBetween [1 Jan 2018] and [27 Jun 2018], a total of 130 suspected Lassa fever cases, including 33 deaths, were reported. Of these, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed, 103 were discarded (after testing negative), and 7 cases were not tested due to inadequate specimens. Of the 20 confirmed cases, 14 have died, giving a case fatality rate of 70 percent. Females make up 60 percent (12) of the confirmed cases. The age range for the confirmed cases is 1 to 65 years old, with a median of 32.5 years. The confirmed cases are from 5 counties, namely (Nimba (9), Bong (4), Montserrado (3), Margibi (2), and Grand Bassa (2).\n\nPublic Health Actions\n---------------------\n- The Ministry of Health and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) are coordinating response activities to the Lassa fever outbreak, with support from WHO, CDC and other partners. The national epidemic preparedness and response committee (NEPRC), under the leadership of NPHIL, have been meeting weekly to review the Lassa fever outbreak situation and provide technical support to sub-national level, with technical support from WHO, and US-CDC; 15 WHO field offices are providing technical and operational support to the response.\n- Active surveillance, including case search, case investigation and contact tracing are ongoing in the affected districts. A specimen transport system using couriers is available at designated points across the country to transport specimens to the NPHRL for testing.\n- The Ganta United Methodist Hospital has been designated as a treatment centre, and equipped with ribavirin and other medical supplies for case management. Orientation of healthcare workers on case management protocol is ongoing.\n- Healthcare workers in the country are being trained on Lassa fever case management and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures by NPHIL and MOH, with support from WHO.\n- Health workers' exposure risk assessment is planned to be conducted in the clinic or hospital where the confirmed cases sought care.\n- Community engagement activities are ongoing in the affected communities, including home visits and providing information on environmental cleanliness.\n\nSituation Interpretation\n------------------------\nSporadic Lassa fever cases continue to occur in certain parts of Liberia where the disease is known to be endemic. Bong, Grand Bassa, Margibi, and Nimba are among the counties that report cases annually. In 2017, a total of 30 confirmed cases were reported from 7 counties. The reason for these sporadic cases is known: the constant interaction of rats (the vector for Lassa fever virus) and people in unsanitary conditions. The national authorities and partners need to prioritize measures mitigating this exposure risk factor by improving vector and environmental management components of the response. This goes along with effective social mobilization and community engagement strategies, targeting vector control and environmental management in the communities. There is also a need to enhance capacity at the subnational levels for early case detection, case investigation, appropriate case management and its associated IPC [infection prevention and control] measures aimed at averting infection among health workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of Lassa fever cases in Liberia continues to slowly increase. Between 1 Jan 2018 and 27 Jun 2018, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed, up from 18 cases on 1 Jun 2018. Apparently, all these Lassa fever virus infections were acquired by contact with infected rodents or their excretions. Lassa fever virus can be acquired from infected rodents or patients in the hospital but in the above report, there is no mention of Lassa fever virus nosocomial transmission. Transmission can occur in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. The hospitals attending the patients mentioned above do have barrier measures in place.\n\nAs mentioned in previous posts, Lassa fever virus transmission to humans occur when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _M. erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in these cases. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households employing the preventive measures listed above. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.\n\nImages of the _Mastomys natalensis_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis and of _M. erythroleucus_ and _Hylomycus pamfi_ at: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/.\n- Mod.TY\n\nMaps of Liberia can be accessed at: http://www.theworldmap.net/country/big/liberia/ and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (33): Liberia 20180615.5858754\nLassa fever - West Africa (30): Liberia 20180604.5836574\nLassa fever - West Africa (28): Liberia 20180520.5806477\nLassa fever - West Africa (27): Liberia (MG) 20180510.5791763\nLassa fever - West Africa (23): Liberia, WHO 20180417.5753003\nLassa fever - West Africa (17): Liberia (MO, NI) 20180310.5678669\n2017\n----\nLassa fever - West Africa (04): Liberia 20170209.4827934\n2016\n----\nLassa fever - West Africa (29): Nigeria, Liberia 20160520.4233773\nLassa fever - West Africa (23): Sweden (VG) ex Liberia, additional information 20160406.4141321\n2015\n----\nLassa fever - USA: (NJ) ex Liberia 20150526.3386913\n2014\n----\nLassa fever - Nigeria, Liberia 20140328.2363217\n2013\n---\nLassa fever - Liberia: (BG) fatal cases 20130911.1937742\n2007\n----\nLassa fever - Liberia (03) 20070430.1406\nLassa fever - Liberia (02): confirmed 20070413.1235\nLassa Fever - Liberia: RFI 20070410.1210\n2006\n----\nLassa fever - Liberia (02) 20061001.2812\nLassa fever - Liberia: RFI 20060929.2783\n2004\n----\nLassa fever, imported - USA (NJ) ex Liberia (02) 20040930.2700\n.................................................ml/ty/ao/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever", "malaria"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2037-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-06-26 00:00:00", "2018-05-12 00:00:00", "2018-06-20 00:00:00", "2018-06-26 00:00:00", "2018-06-17 00:00:00", "2018-06-20 00:00:00", "2018-06-21 00:00:00", "2018-06-26 00:00:00", "2018-06-27 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-06-27 00:00:00", "2018-06-01 00:00:00", "2033-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2007-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Nimba County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Liberia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WEST AFRICA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6119637", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (43): Nigeria (ON)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6119637", "date": "2018-07-11 14:37:30", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (37): LIBERIA, WHO\n********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 6 Jul 2018, 5:00 PM\nSource: WHO Weekly Bulletin on Outbreaks and Other Emergencies [edited]\nhttp://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/273028/OEW27-300606072018.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y\n\n\nEvent Description\n-----------------\nLiberia has continued to experience sporadic cases of Lassa fever since the beginning of 2018.

In week 25 (week ending 26 Jun 2018), 2 new confirmed Lassa fever cases were reported in Nimba County, the only county with active transmission currently. Nimba County has reported 5 confirmed Lassa fever cases since [12 May 2018]. In the latest event (the 2 confirmed cases in week 25), the 1st case-patient, a 59-year- old male from Gbehlay Geh district, fell ill on [4 Jun 2018] and was treated with antimalarials and antibiotics at a local clinic. On [20 Jun 2018], the case-patient presented to a public hospital with fever and other constitutional symptoms, and had bleeding from a venepuncture site. On [21 Jun 2018], a blood specimen was collected and sent to the National Public Health Reference Laboratory (NPHRL). The test result released on [26 Jun 2018] was positive for Lassa fever virus infection. The 2nd case-patient, a 41-year-old female, is the wife of the first case-patient (described above). She developed illness on [17 Jun 2018] and was admitted to the same hospital on [20 June 2018] with fever and other constitutional symptoms. Being a known contact, a blood specimen was collected on [21 Jun 2018] and the test result released on [26 Jun 2018] was positive for Lassa fever. The 2 case-patients are admitted under barrier nursing and ribavirin treatment initiated. A total of 26 contacts, including 13 health workers, have been line listed and are being followed up.\n\nBetween [1 Jan 2018] and [27 Jun 2018], a total of 130 suspected Lassa fever cases, including 33 deaths, were reported. Of these, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed, 103 were discarded (after testing negative), and 7 cases were not tested due to inadequate specimens. Of the 20 confirmed cases, 14 have died, giving a case fatality rate of 70 percent. Females make up 60 percent (12) of the confirmed cases. The age range for the confirmed cases is 1 to 65 years old, with a median of 32.5 years. The confirmed cases are from 5 counties, namely (Nimba (9), Bong (4), Montserrado (3), Margibi (2), and Grand Bassa (2).\n\nPublic Health Actions\n---------------------\n- The Ministry of Health and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) are coordinating response activities to the Lassa fever outbreak, with support from WHO, CDC and other partners. The national epidemic preparedness and response committee (NEPRC), under the leadership of NPHIL, have been meeting weekly to review the Lassa fever outbreak situation and provide technical support to sub-national level, with technical support from WHO, and US-CDC; 15 WHO field offices are providing technical and operational support to the response.\n- Active surveillance, including case search, case investigation and contact tracing are ongoing in the affected districts. A specimen transport system using couriers is available at designated points across the country to transport specimens to the NPHRL for testing.\n- The Ganta United Methodist Hospital has been designated as a treatment centre, and equipped with ribavirin and other medical supplies for case management. Orientation of healthcare workers on case management protocol is ongoing.\n- Healthcare workers in the country are being trained on Lassa fever case management and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures by NPHIL and MOH, with support from WHO.\n- Health workers' exposure risk assessment is planned to be conducted in the clinic or hospital where the confirmed cases sought care.\n- Community engagement activities are ongoing in the affected communities, including home visits and providing information on environmental cleanliness.\n\nSituation Interpretation\n------------------------\nSporadic Lassa fever cases continue to occur in certain parts of Liberia where the disease is known to be endemic. Bong, Grand Bassa, Margibi, and Nimba are among the counties that report cases annually. In 2017, a total of 30 confirmed cases were reported from 7 counties. The reason for these sporadic cases is known: the constant interaction of rats (the vector for Lassa fever virus) and people in unsanitary conditions. The national authorities and partners need to prioritize measures mitigating this exposure risk factor by improving vector and environmental management components of the response. This goes along with effective social mobilization and community engagement strategies, targeting vector control and environmental management in the communities. There is also a need to enhance capacity at the subnational levels for early case detection, case investigation, appropriate case management and its associated IPC [infection prevention and control] measures aimed at averting infection among health workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of Lassa fever cases in Liberia continues to slowly increase.

Being a known contact, a blood specimen was collected on [21 Jun 2018] and the test result released on [26 Jun 2018] was positive for Lassa fever. The 2 case-patients are admitted under barrier nursing and ribavirin treatment initiated. A total of 26 contacts, including 13 health workers, have been line listed and are being followed up.\n\nBetween [1 Jan 2018] and [27 Jun 2018], a total of 130 suspected Lassa fever cases, including 33 deaths, were reported. Of these, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed, 103 were discarded (after testing negative), and 7 cases were not tested due to inadequate specimens. Of the 20 confirmed cases, 14 have died, giving a case fatality rate of 70 percent. Females make up 60 percent (12) of the confirmed cases. The age range for the confirmed cases is 1 to 65 years old, with a median of 32.5 years. The confirmed cases are from 5 counties, namely (Nimba (9), Bong (4), Montserrado (3), Margibi (2), and Grand Bassa (2).\n\nPublic Health Actions\n---------------------\n- The Ministry of Health and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) are coordinating response activities to the Lassa fever outbreak, with support from WHO, CDC and other partners. The national epidemic preparedness and response committee (NEPRC), under the leadership of NPHIL, have been meeting weekly to review the Lassa fever outbreak situation and provide technical support to sub-national level, with technical support from WHO, and US-CDC; 15 WHO field offices are providing technical and operational support to the response.\n- Active surveillance, including case search, case investigation and contact tracing are ongoing in the affected districts. A specimen transport system using couriers is available at designated points across the country to transport specimens to the NPHRL for testing.\n- The Ganta United Methodist Hospital has been designated as a treatment centre, and equipped with ribavirin and other medical supplies for case management. Orientation of healthcare workers on case management protocol is ongoing.\n- Healthcare workers in the country are being trained on Lassa fever case management and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures by NPHIL and MOH, with support from WHO.\n- Health workers' exposure risk assessment is planned to be conducted in the clinic or hospital where the confirmed cases sought care.\n- Community engagement activities are ongoing in the affected communities, including home visits and providing information on environmental cleanliness.\n\nSituation Interpretation\n------------------------\nSporadic Lassa fever cases continue to occur in certain parts of Liberia where the disease is known to be endemic. Bong, Grand Bassa, Margibi, and Nimba are among the counties that report cases annually. In 2017, a total of 30 confirmed cases were reported from 7 counties. The reason for these sporadic cases is known: the constant interaction of rats (the vector for Lassa fever virus) and people in unsanitary conditions. The national authorities and partners need to prioritize measures mitigating this exposure risk factor by improving vector and environmental management components of the response. This goes along with effective social mobilization and community engagement strategies, targeting vector control and environmental management in the communities. There is also a need to enhance capacity at the subnational levels for early case detection, case investigation, appropriate case management and its associated IPC [infection prevention and control] measures aimed at averting infection among health workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of Lassa fever cases in Liberia continues to slowly increase.

In week 25 (week ending 26 Jun 2018), 2 new confirmed Lassa fever cases were reported in Nimba County, the only county with active transmission currently. Nimba County has reported 5 confirmed Lassa fever cases since [12 May 2018]. In the latest event (the 2 confirmed cases in week 25), the 1st case-patient, a 59-year- old male from Gbehlay Geh district, fell ill on [4 Jun 2018] and was treated with antimalarials and antibiotics at a local clinic. On [20 Jun 2018], the case-patient presented to a public hospital with fever and other constitutional symptoms, and had bleeding from a venepuncture site. On [21 Jun 2018], a blood specimen was collected and sent to the National Public Health Reference Laboratory (NPHRL). The test result released on [26 Jun 2018] was positive for Lassa fever virus infection. The 2nd case-patient, a 41-year-old female, is the wife of the first case-patient (described above). She developed illness on [17 Jun 2018] and was admitted to the same hospital on [20 June 2018] with fever and other constitutional symptoms. Being a known contact, a blood specimen was collected on [21 Jun 2018] and the test result released on [26 Jun 2018] was positive for Lassa fever. The 2 case-patients are admitted under barrier nursing and ribavirin treatment initiated. A total of 26 contacts, including 13 health workers, have been line listed and are being followed up.\n\nBetween [1 Jan 2018] and [27 Jun 2018], a total of 130 suspected Lassa fever cases, including 33 deaths, were reported. Of these, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed, 103 were discarded (after testing negative), and 7 cases were not tested due to inadequate specimens. Of the 20 confirmed cases, 14 have died, giving a case fatality rate of 70 percent. Females make up 60 percent (12) of the confirmed cases. The age range for the confirmed cases is 1 to 65 years old, with a median of 32.5 years. The confirmed cases are from 5 counties, namely (Nimba (9), Bong (4), Montserrado (3), Margibi (2), and Grand Bassa (2).\n\nPublic Health Actions\n---------------------\n- The Ministry of Health and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) are coordinating response activities to the Lassa fever outbreak, with support from WHO, CDC and other partners. The national epidemic preparedness and response committee (NEPRC), under the leadership of NPHIL, have been meeting weekly to review the Lassa fever outbreak situation and provide technical support to sub-national level, with technical support from WHO, and US-CDC; 15 WHO field offices are providing technical and operational support to the response.\n- Active surveillance, including case search, case investigation and contact tracing are ongoing in the affected districts. A specimen transport system using couriers is available at designated points across the country to transport specimens to the NPHRL for testing.\n- The Ganta United Methodist Hospital has been designated as a treatment centre, and equipped with ribavirin and other medical supplies for case management. Orientation of healthcare workers on case management protocol is ongoing.\n- Healthcare workers in the country are being trained on Lassa fever case management and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures by NPHIL and MOH, with support from WHO.\n- Health workers' exposure risk assessment is planned to be conducted in the clinic or hospital where the confirmed cases sought care.\n- Community engagement activities are ongoing in the affected communities, including home visits and providing information on environmental cleanliness.\n\nSituation Interpretation\n------------------------\nSporadic Lassa fever cases continue to occur in certain parts of Liberia where the disease is known to be endemic. Bong, Grand Bassa, Margibi, and Nimba are among the counties that report cases annually. In 2017, a total of 30 confirmed cases were reported from 7 counties. The reason for these sporadic cases is known: the constant interaction of rats (the vector for Lassa fever virus) and people in unsanitary conditions. The national authorities and partners need to prioritize measures mitigating this exposure risk factor by improving vector and environmental management components of the response. This goes along with effective social mobilization and community engagement strategies, targeting vector control and environmental management in the communities. There is also a need to enhance capacity at the subnational levels for early case detection, case investigation, appropriate case management and its associated IPC [infection prevention and control] measures aimed at averting infection among health workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of Lassa fever cases in Liberia continues to slowly increase. Between 1 Jan 2018 and 27 Jun 2018, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed, up from 18 cases on 1 Jun 2018. Apparently, all these Lassa fever virus infections were acquired by contact with infected rodents or their excretions. Lassa fever virus can be acquired from infected rodents or patients in the hospital but in the above report, there is no mention of Lassa fever virus nosocomial transmission. Transmission can occur in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. The hospitals attending the patients mentioned above do have barrier measures in place.\n\nAs mentioned in previous posts, Lassa fever virus transmission to humans occur when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _M. erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in these cases. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households employing the preventive measures listed above.

The graphs of the epidemic curves, continue to indicate that the peak number of cases nationally has passed. No new cases have occurred over the past week. The follow-up of thousands of contacts with so few uncontacted is remarkable. As noted in previous comments, providing adequate surveillance and timely treatment over such a large geographic area is challenging. Fortunately, there is international help participating in treatment and surveillance. No additional health care people have been confirmed as infected during this week, but a suspected case in a laboratory worker is reported below.\n\nThe maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time.

According to a family source, the woman, who died at about 6 a.m on Monday morning was rushed to a private hospital in Minna when she started vomiting and stooling blood and emitting blood from her nostrils.\n\nA source told The Nation that the hospital, after testing her, referred her to the Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida Specialist Hospital, but the parents refused taking her to the hospital and took her home, where she died.\n\n\"What made us suspicious,\" the source said, \"was when some officials from the Ministry of Health came to the house, the hospital must have told them. When they came, R was already dead, so they had for the people who were going to bury her some protective surgical suits to put on, and they sprayed the body, the car that carried her to the hospital, and all 4 in the house. This was after testing her.\"\n\nThe source said that for about a week, the deceased, who had 6 children, had been complaining of sore throat and body pains, \"but she got worse yesterday. She was taken to the General Hospital Minna, but there was no doctor on the grounds to attend to her; that was why she was taken to the private hospital. However, after admitting her, one of the doctors tested her and said she had been referred to IBB Hospital.\"\n\nWhen The Nation visited the private hospital, one of the doctors who spoke anonymously confirmed that a woman was brought to the hospital with suspected Lassa fever symptoms, and, because they could not handle her, the hospital referred her to the IBB Specialist Hospital.\n\nHe also confirmed that the management called the state Ministry of Health to inform them of their suspicions. \"The lady did not die in our hospital. When we noticed we could not handle her case, we referred her to IBB Specialist Hospital. So, whether they went or not, we do not know. I am just hearing that she died from you.\"\n\nHowever, efforts to reach the Niger State Ministry of Health failed. Although our reporter met with the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Makunsidi, he denied knowledge of any case as such, saying he had not been informed. He, however, promised to make enquiries and get back to the reporter. At the time of filing this report, he had not called, and his number was not going through.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Interestingly, Niger state is not mentioned above in the list of affected states this year [2018].\n\nObviously, the transmission of Lassa fever virus has not ended for the year in Nigeria.

According to a family source, the woman, who died at about 6 a.m on Monday morning was rushed to a private hospital in Minna when she started vomiting and stooling blood and emitting blood from her nostrils.\n\nA source told The Nation that the hospital, after testing her, referred her to the Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida Specialist Hospital, but the parents refused taking her to the hospital and took her home, where she died.\n\n\"What made us suspicious,\" the source said, \"was when some officials from the Ministry of Health came to the house, the hospital must have told them. When they came, R was already dead, so they had for the people who were going to bury her some protective surgical suits to put on, and they sprayed the body, the car that carried her to the hospital, and all 4 in the house. This was after testing her.\"\n\nThe source said that for about a week, the deceased, who had 6 children, had been complaining of sore throat and body pains, \"but she got worse yesterday. She was taken to the General Hospital Minna, but there was no doctor on the grounds to attend to her; that was why she was taken to the private hospital. However, after admitting her, one of the doctors tested her and said she had been referred to IBB Hospital.\"\n\nWhen The Nation visited the private hospital, one of the doctors who spoke anonymously confirmed that a woman was brought to the hospital with suspected Lassa fever symptoms, and, because they could not handle her, the hospital referred her to the IBB Specialist Hospital.\n\nHe also confirmed that the management called the state Ministry of Health to inform them of their suspicions. \"The lady did not die in our hospital. When we noticed we could not handle her case, we referred her to IBB Specialist Hospital. So, whether they went or not, we do not know. I am just hearing that she died from you.\"\n\nHowever, efforts to reach the Niger State Ministry of Health failed. Although our reporter met with the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Makunsidi, he denied knowledge of any case as such, saying he had not been informed. He, however, promised to make enquiries and get back to the reporter. At the time of filing this report, he had not called, and his number was not going through.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Interestingly, Niger state is not mentioned above in the list of affected states this year [2018].\n\nObviously, the transmission of Lassa fever virus has not ended for the year in Nigeria. Although test results for this case are not available, the symptoms she displayed are certainly compatible with those of Lassa fever. The hospitals that she was taken to apparently were not equipped to handle Lassa fever cases and were wise to not admit her.

Clinical and laboratory predictors of Lassa fever outcome in a dedicated treatment facility in Nigeria: a retrospective, observational cohort study.\nLancet Infect Dis. 2018. pii: S1473-3099(18)30121-X. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30121-X]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary\n-------\nBackground\nLassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic disease endemic to west Africa. No large-scale studies exist from Nigeria, where the Lassa virus (LASV) is most diverse. LASV diversity, coupled with host genetic and environmental factors, might cause differences in disease pathophysiology. Small-scale studies in Nigeria suggest that acute kidney injury is an important clinical feature and might be a determinant of survival. We aimed to establish the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mortality in Nigerian patients with Lassa fever, and hypothesised that LASV was the direct cause of intrinsic renal damage for a subset of the patients with Lassa fever.\n\nMethods\nWe did a retrospective, observational cohort study of consecutive patients in Nigeria with Lassa fever, who tested positive for LASV with RT-PCR, and were treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. We did univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, including logistic regression, of all demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables available at presentation to identify the factors associated with patient mortality.\n\nFindings\nOf 291 patients treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital between 3 Jan 2011, and 11 Dec 2015, 284 (98 percent) had known outcomes (died or survived) and 7 (2 percent) were discharged against medical advice. Overall case-fatality rate was 24 percent (68 of 284 patients), with a 1.4 times increase in mortality risk for each 10 years of age (p=0\u00b700017), reaching 39 percent (22 of 57) for patients older than 50 years. Of 284 patients, 81 (28 percent) had acute kidney injury and 104 (37 percent) had CNS manifestations and thus both were considered important complications of acute Lassa fever in Nigeria. Acute kidney injury was strongly associated with poor outcome (case-fatality rate of 60 percent [49 of 81 patients]; ratio [OR] 15, p less than 0.00001). Compared with patients without acute kidney injury, those with acute kidney injury had higher incidence of proteinuria (32 [82 percent] of 39 patients) and haematuria (29 [76 percent] of 38) and higher mean serum potassium (4.63 [SD 1.04] mmol/L) and lower blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (8.6 for patients without clinical history of fluid loss), suggesting intrinsic renal damage. Normalisation of creatinine concentration was associated with recovery.

No large-scale studies exist from Nigeria, where the Lassa virus (LASV) is most diverse. LASV diversity, coupled with host genetic and environmental factors, might cause differences in disease pathophysiology. Small-scale studies in Nigeria suggest that acute kidney injury is an important clinical feature and might be a determinant of survival. We aimed to establish the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mortality in Nigerian patients with Lassa fever, and hypothesised that LASV was the direct cause of intrinsic renal damage for a subset of the patients with Lassa fever.\n\nMethods\nWe did a retrospective, observational cohort study of consecutive patients in Nigeria with Lassa fever, who tested positive for LASV with RT-PCR, and were treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. We did univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, including logistic regression, of all demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables available at presentation to identify the factors associated with patient mortality.\n\nFindings\nOf 291 patients treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital between 3 Jan 2011, and 11 Dec 2015, 284 (98 percent) had known outcomes (died or survived) and 7 (2 percent) were discharged against medical advice. Overall case-fatality rate was 24 percent (68 of 284 patients), with a 1.4 times increase in mortality risk for each 10 years of age (p=0\u00b700017), reaching 39 percent (22 of 57) for patients older than 50 years. Of 284 patients, 81 (28 percent) had acute kidney injury and 104 (37 percent) had CNS manifestations and thus both were considered important complications of acute Lassa fever in Nigeria. Acute kidney injury was strongly associated with poor outcome (case-fatality rate of 60 percent [49 of 81 patients]; ratio [OR] 15, p less than 0.00001). Compared with patients without acute kidney injury, those with acute kidney injury had higher incidence of proteinuria (32 [82 percent] of 39 patients) and haematuria (29 [76 percent] of 38) and higher mean serum potassium (4.63 [SD 1.04] mmol/L) and lower blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (8.6 for patients without clinical history of fluid loss), suggesting intrinsic renal damage. Normalisation of creatinine concentration was associated with recovery. Elevated serum creatinine (OR 1.3; p=0\u00b7046), aspartate aminotransferase (OR 1.5; p=0.075), and potassium (OR 3.6; p=0.0024) were independent predictors of death.\n\nInterpretation\nOur study presents detailed clinical and laboratory data for Nigerian patients with Lassa fever and provides strong evidence for intrinsic renal dysfunction in acute Lassa fever.

No large-scale studies exist from Nigeria, where the Lassa virus (LASV) is most diverse. LASV diversity, coupled with host genetic and environmental factors, might cause differences in disease pathophysiology. Small-scale studies in Nigeria suggest that acute kidney injury is an important clinical feature and might be a determinant of survival. We aimed to establish the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mortality in Nigerian patients with Lassa fever, and hypothesised that LASV was the direct cause of intrinsic renal damage for a subset of the patients with Lassa fever.\n\nMethods\nWe did a retrospective, observational cohort study of consecutive patients in Nigeria with Lassa fever, who tested positive for LASV with RT-PCR, and were treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. We did univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, including logistic regression, of all demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables available at presentation to identify the factors associated with patient mortality.\n\nFindings\nOf 291 patients treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital between 3 Jan 2011, and 11 Dec 2015, 284 (98 percent) had known outcomes (died or survived) and 7 (2 percent) were discharged against medical advice. Overall case-fatality rate was 24 percent (68 of 284 patients), with a 1.4 times increase in mortality risk for each 10 years of age (p=0\u00b700017), reaching 39 percent (22 of 57) for patients older than 50 years. Of 284 patients, 81 (28 percent) had acute kidney injury and 104 (37 percent) had CNS manifestations and thus both were considered important complications of acute Lassa fever in Nigeria. Acute kidney injury was strongly associated with poor outcome (case-fatality rate of 60 percent [49 of 81 patients]; ratio [OR] 15, p less than 0.00001). Compared with patients without acute kidney injury, those with acute kidney injury had higher incidence of proteinuria (32 [82 percent] of 39 patients) and haematuria (29 [76 percent] of 38) and higher mean serum potassium (4.63 [SD 1.04] mmol/L) and lower blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (8.6 for patients without clinical history of fluid loss), suggesting intrinsic renal damage. Normalisation of creatinine concentration was associated with recovery. Elevated serum creatinine (OR 1.3; p=0\u00b7046), aspartate aminotransferase (OR 1.5; p=0.075), and potassium (OR 3.6; p=0.0024) were independent predictors of death.\n\nInterpretation\nOur study presents detailed clinical and laboratory data for Nigerian patients with Lassa fever and provides strong evidence for intrinsic renal dysfunction in acute Lassa fever.

No large-scale studies exist from Nigeria, where the Lassa virus (LASV) is most diverse. LASV diversity, coupled with host genetic and environmental factors, might cause differences in disease pathophysiology. Small-scale studies in Nigeria suggest that acute kidney injury is an important clinical feature and might be a determinant of survival. We aimed to establish the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mortality in Nigerian patients with Lassa fever, and hypothesised that LASV was the direct cause of intrinsic renal damage for a subset of the patients with Lassa fever.\n\nMethods\nWe did a retrospective, observational cohort study of consecutive patients in Nigeria with Lassa fever, who tested positive for LASV with RT-PCR, and were treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. We did univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, including logistic regression, of all demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables available at presentation to identify the factors associated with patient mortality.\n\nFindings\nOf 291 patients treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital between 3 Jan 2011, and 11 Dec 2015, 284 (98 percent) had known outcomes (died or survived) and 7 (2 percent) were discharged against medical advice. Overall case-fatality rate was 24 percent (68 of 284 patients), with a 1.4 times increase in mortality risk for each 10 years of age (p=0\u00b700017), reaching 39 percent (22 of 57) for patients older than 50 years. Of 284 patients, 81 (28 percent) had acute kidney injury and 104 (37 percent) had CNS manifestations and thus both were considered important complications of acute Lassa fever in Nigeria. Acute kidney injury was strongly associated with poor outcome (case-fatality rate of 60 percent [49 of 81 patients]; ratio [OR] 15, p less than 0.00001). Compared with patients without acute kidney injury, those with acute kidney injury had higher incidence of proteinuria (32 [82 percent] of 39 patients) and haematuria (29 [76 percent] of 38) and higher mean serum potassium (4.63 [SD 1.04] mmol/L) and lower blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (8.6 for patients without clinical history of fluid loss), suggesting intrinsic renal damage. Normalisation of creatinine concentration was associated with recovery. Elevated serum creatinine (OR 1.3; p=0\u00b7046), aspartate aminotransferase (OR 1.5; p=0.075), and potassium (OR 3.6; p=0.0024) were independent predictors of death.\n\nInterpretation\nOur study presents detailed clinical and laboratory data for Nigerian patients with Lassa fever and provides strong evidence for intrinsic renal dysfunction in acute Lassa fever.

Of these, 400 were confirmed positive, 9 are probable, 1273 are negative (not a case), and 24 are awaiting laboratory results (pending)\n- Since the onset of the 2018 outbreak, there have been 142 deaths: 97 in positive-confirmed cases, 9 in probable cases, and 36 in negative cases. Case fatality rate in confirmed cases is 24.3 percent -- Table 1.\n- 20 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 57 local government areas [LGA] (Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Anambra, Benue, Kogi, Imo, Plateau, Lagos, Taraba, Delta, Osun, Rivers, FCT, Gombe, Ekiti, Kaduna, and Abia); 8 states have exited the active phase of the outbreak while 12 states remain active -- Table 1/Figure 1.\n- In the reporting week 14 [2-8 Apr 2018], 2 new healthcare workers were affected with one death. Since the onset of the outbreak, 25 health care workers have been affected in 8 states: Ebonyi (15), Nasarawa (1), Kogi (2), Benue (1), Ondo (2), Edo (3), and Abia (1), with 5 deaths in Ebonyi (3) Kogi (1), and Abia (1).\n- 81 percent of all confirmed cases are from Edo (42 percent), Ondo (23 percent), and Ebonyi (16 percent) states.\n- 30 cases are currently under treatment in treatment centres across nine states -- Edo (9), Ebonyi (6), Bauchi (7), Ondo (5), Plateau (1), Osun (1), and Kogi (1).\n- A total of 4274 contacts have been identified from 20 states.

However, the Lassa fever period can be expected to continue for another 2-3 months, into June 2018. New cases have occurred over the past few days in several states. Providing adequate surveillance and timely treatment over such a large geographic area is challenging. Fortunately, there is international help participating in treatment and surveillance. Unfortunately, a female physician in Abia state became ill and was diagnosed with the disease after attending to an 11-month old baby who later died. The baby was, however, not confirmed to have been infected with Lassa fever before his death (https://www.thecable.ng/lassa-fever-kills-doctor-abia-month-starting-work).\n\nThe maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time.

Clinical and laboratory predictors of Lassa fever outcome in a dedicated treatment facility in Nigeria: a retrospective, observational cohort study.\nLancet Infect Dis. 2018. pii: S1473-3099(18)30121-X. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30121-X]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary\n-------\nBackground\nLassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic disease endemic to west Africa. No large-scale studies exist from Nigeria, where the Lassa virus (LASV) is most diverse. LASV diversity, coupled with host genetic and environmental factors, might cause differences in disease pathophysiology. Small-scale studies in Nigeria suggest that acute kidney injury is an important clinical feature and might be a determinant of survival. We aimed to establish the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mortality in Nigerian patients with Lassa fever, and hypothesised that LASV was the direct cause of intrinsic renal damage for a subset of the patients with Lassa fever.\n\nMethods\nWe did a retrospective, observational cohort study of consecutive patients in Nigeria with Lassa fever, who tested positive for LASV with RT-PCR, and were treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. We did univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, including logistic regression, of all demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables available at presentation to identify the factors associated with patient mortality.\n\nFindings\nOf 291 patients treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital between 3 Jan 2011, and 11 Dec 2015, 284 (98 percent) had known outcomes (died or survived) and 7 (2 percent) were discharged against medical advice. Overall case-fatality rate was 24 percent (68 of 284 patients), with a 1.4 times increase in mortality risk for each 10 years of age (p=0\u00b700017), reaching 39 percent (22 of 57) for patients older than 50 years. Of 284 patients, 81 (28 percent) had acute kidney injury and 104 (37 percent) had CNS manifestations and thus both were considered important complications of acute Lassa fever in Nigeria. Acute kidney injury was strongly associated with poor outcome (case-fatality rate of 60 percent [49 of 81 patients]; ratio [OR] 15, p less than 0.00001). Compared with patients without acute kidney injury, those with acute kidney injury had higher incidence of proteinuria (32 [82 percent] of 39 patients) and haematuria (29 [76 percent] of 38) and higher mean serum potassium (4.63 [SD 1.04] mmol/L) and lower blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (8.6 for patients without clinical history of fluid loss), suggesting intrinsic renal damage. Normalisation of creatinine concentration was associated with recovery. Elevated serum creatinine (OR 1.3; p=0\u00b7046), aspartate aminotransferase (OR 1.5; p=0.075), and potassium (OR 3.6; p=0.0024) were independent predictors of death.\n\nInterpretation\nOur study presents detailed clinical and laboratory data for Nigerian patients with Lassa fever and provides strong evidence for intrinsic renal dysfunction in acute Lassa fever. Early recognition and treatment of acute kidney injury might significantly reduce mortality.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This study indicates that Lassa fever likely induces acute renal dysfunction in a significant portion of patients and is an indicator of progression to mortality.

Case Fatality Rate in confirmed and probable cases is 21 percent.\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, a member of the arenavirus family of viruses. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa.\n\nPerson-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in the hospital environment in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential.\n\nThe symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis.\n\nThere is no vaccine currently available for Lassa fever.\n\nThe Lassa virus was 1st described in 1969 in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Cases of Lassa fever continue to occur in a wide geographic area in Nigeria. As reported recently, WHO teams and personnel from the Ministry of Health began engaging with communities at risk of infection. The villages and towns are scattered over a large geographic area in 17 states. Getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.\n\nAs noted in the previous posts, cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6-month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year [2018] up through June 2018, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, Ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients, and is most effective if the patients is treated early in the course of infection.\n\nImages of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Edo state cases\nDate: Thu 22 Feb 2018\nSource: New Telegraph [edited]\nhttps://newtelegraphonline.com/2018/02/edo-records-521-suspected-cases-lassa-fever/\n\n\nDirector of Disease Control, Edo State, Dr. Osamuwonyi Irowa, has said that the state recorded 521 suspected cases of Lassa fever this month [February 2018].\n\nIrowa disclosed this at the inauguration of the Emergency Operation Centre on Lassa fever in Benin yesterday [Wed 21 Feb 2018].\n\nHe said 124 cases had been confirmed out of the 521 suspected cases recorded in 13 local government areas.\n\nThe director, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), also said 15 deaths were recorded with 509 cases under surveillance, while 10 suspected cases had developed symptoms.\n\nInaugurating the centre, the Deputy Governor, Mr. Phillip Shaibu, said that the Lassa fever response mechanism was aimed at ensuring a coordinated control of the epidemic.

It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa.\n\nPerson-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in the hospital environment in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential.\n\nThe symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis.\n\nThere is no vaccine currently available for Lassa fever.\n\nThe Lassa virus was 1st described in 1969 in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Cases of Lassa fever continue to occur in a wide geographic area in Nigeria. As reported recently, WHO teams and personnel from the Ministry of Health began engaging with communities at risk of infection. The villages and towns are scattered over a large geographic area in 17 states. Getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.\n\nAs noted in the previous posts, cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6-month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year [2018] up through June 2018, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, Ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients, and is most effective if the patients is treated early in the course of infection.\n\nImages of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Edo state cases\nDate: Thu 22 Feb 2018\nSource: New Telegraph [edited]\nhttps://newtelegraphonline.com/2018/02/edo-records-521-suspected-cases-lassa-fever/\n\n\nDirector of Disease Control, Edo State, Dr. Osamuwonyi Irowa, has said that the state recorded 521 suspected cases of Lassa fever this month [February 2018].\n\nIrowa disclosed this at the inauguration of the Emergency Operation Centre on Lassa fever in Benin yesterday [Wed 21 Feb 2018].\n\nHe said 124 cases had been confirmed out of the 521 suspected cases recorded in 13 local government areas.\n\nThe director, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), also said 15 deaths were recorded with 509 cases under surveillance, while 10 suspected cases had developed symptoms.\n\nInaugurating the centre, the Deputy Governor, Mr. Phillip Shaibu, said that the Lassa fever response mechanism was aimed at ensuring a coordinated control of the epidemic.

Case Fatality Rate in confirmed and probable cases is 21 percent.\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, a member of the arenavirus family of viruses. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa.\n\nPerson-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in the hospital environment in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential.\n\nThe symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis.\n\nThere is no vaccine currently available for Lassa fever.\n\nThe Lassa virus was 1st described in 1969 in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Cases of Lassa fever continue to occur in a wide geographic area in Nigeria. As reported recently, WHO teams and personnel from the Ministry of Health began engaging with communities at risk of infection. The villages and towns are scattered over a large geographic area in 17 states. Getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.\n\nAs noted in the previous posts, cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6-month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year [2018] up through June 2018, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, Ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients, and is most effective if the patients is treated early in the course of infection.\n\nImages of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Edo state cases\nDate: Thu 22 Feb 2018\nSource: New Telegraph [edited]\nhttps://newtelegraphonline.com/2018/02/edo-records-521-suspected-cases-lassa-fever/\n\n\nDirector of Disease Control, Edo State, Dr. Osamuwonyi Irowa, has said that the state recorded 521 suspected cases of Lassa fever this month [February 2018].\n\nIrowa disclosed this at the inauguration of the Emergency Operation Centre on Lassa fever in Benin yesterday [Wed 21 Feb 2018].\n\nHe said 124 cases had been confirmed out of the 521 suspected cases recorded in 13 local government areas.\n\nThe director, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), also said 15 deaths were recorded with 509 cases under surveillance, while 10 suspected cases had developed symptoms.\n\nInaugurating the centre, the Deputy Governor, Mr. Phillip Shaibu, said that the Lassa fever response mechanism was aimed at ensuring a coordinated control of the epidemic.

Case Fatality Rate in confirmed and probable cases is 21 percent.\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, a member of the arenavirus family of viruses. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa.\n\nPerson-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in the hospital environment in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential.\n\nThe symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis.\n\nThere is no vaccine currently available for Lassa fever.\n\nThe Lassa virus was 1st described in 1969 in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Cases of Lassa fever continue to occur in a wide geographic area in Nigeria. As reported recently, WHO teams and personnel from the Ministry of Health began engaging with communities at risk of infection. The villages and towns are scattered over a large geographic area in 17 states. Getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.\n\nAs noted in the previous posts, cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6-month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year [2018] up through June 2018, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, Ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients, and is most effective if the patients is treated early in the course of infection.\n\nImages of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Edo state cases\nDate: Thu 22 Feb 2018\nSource: New Telegraph [edited]\nhttps://newtelegraphonline.com/2018/02/edo-records-521-suspected-cases-lassa-fever/\n\n\nDirector of Disease Control, Edo State, Dr. Osamuwonyi Irowa, has said that the state recorded 521 suspected cases of Lassa fever this month [February 2018].\n\nIrowa disclosed this at the inauguration of the Emergency Operation Centre on Lassa fever in Benin yesterday [Wed 21 Feb 2018].\n\nHe said 124 cases had been confirmed out of the 521 suspected cases recorded in 13 local government areas.\n\nThe director, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), also said 15 deaths were recorded with 509 cases under surveillance, while 10 suspected cases had developed symptoms.\n\nInaugurating the centre, the Deputy Governor, Mr. Phillip Shaibu, said that the Lassa fever response mechanism was aimed at ensuring a coordinated control of the epidemic.

Early in the course of Lassa fever, patients present with a general febrile disease with symptoms common to a variety of infections, including malaria, making it more difficult for healthcare workers to know when personal protective equipment should be used.\n\nThe Nigeria NCDC and its EOC (Emergency Operations Centre) are actively dealing with the state health care personnel in the affected states currently.\n\nImages of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (04): Nigeria 20180125.5585380\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Benin (AK) ex Nigeria, WHO 20180124.5581805\nLassa fever - West Africa (02): Nigeria, Benin (AK) ex Nigeria 20180124.5576379\nLassa fever - West Africa: Nigeria 20180115.5561615\n.................................................sb/ml/ty/mj/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever", "malaria"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "2018-01-29 00:00:00", "2018-01-31 00:00:00", "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "2001-01-28 20:18:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-06-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "lassa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Jalingo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "bali", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo State", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taraba State", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WEST AFRICA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5585380", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (04): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5585380", "date": "2017-09-04 11:59:35", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (33): NIGERIA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 25 Aug 2017\nSource: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Weekly Epidemiological Report 7(32) [edited]\nhttp://www.ncdc.gov.ng/reports/weekly\n\n\n2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak after action review meeting, 21-22 Aug 2017\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLassa fever experts from all over Nigeria and beyond gathered in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja for 2 days to review the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak and propose preparedness plans for subsequent outbreaks. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) together with the World Health Organisation and supporting partners, hosted the Lassa fever outbreak after action review meeting on the 21 and 22 Aug 2017. Participants were drawn from the states affected by the outbreak this year [2017], Lassa fever treatment facilities, diagnostic laboratories, NCDC surveillance, laboratory, and health emergency response teams, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, and other key stakeholders. Technical support was provided by WHO Africa Regional Office (AFRO) and the National Lassa fever Steering Committee.\n\nThe event was declared open on the 1st day by the Honourable Minister of State for Heath, Dr Osagie Enahire, who applauded the NCDC for its efforts towards stemming the tides of Lassa fever in Nigeria and charged all present to find a lasting solution to the menace of the disease in the country. The chairperson of the National Steering Committee, Prof Oyewale Tomori gave an overview of Lassa fever outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1969 with a critical review of control efforts taken in the past which have not yielded needed results. He decried the unsustainable efforts that have plagued the surveillance system in Nigeria and called on every stakeholder to realign their activities to achieve a common goal of a strengthened surveillance system, which can be used as a strong tool in the fight against Lassa fever. He urged participants present to focus on finding practical solutions towards elimination of the disease.\n\nA national report of the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak was presented. As at epi-week 33 (14-20 Aug 2017), a total of 764 suspected cases have been reported across 19 states (Ogun, Taraba, Rivers, Nasarawa, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Plateau, Kaduna, Gombe, Cross-River, Borno, Kano, Kogi, Enugu, Anambra, Lagos, and Kwara). 247 of these cases were confirmed and 14 classified as probable cases. A total of 83 deaths have been recorded, with 69 of them in confirmed cases. Case fatality rate is 33.6 percent in confirmed and probable cases and 15.1 percent in all cases (confirmed, probable, and suspected). The response activities carried out by the NCDC, including the development of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever [VHF] guidelines, deployment of rapid response teams, provision of ribavirin and other medical supplies to states and several others, were also discussed.\n\nRobust discussions were held by the participants following various presentations made, which all focused on preparedness and response to Lassa fever outbreak. The 2-day meeting provided an opportunity to reflect on the events which led to the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak in each state and also to conduct out a detailed review of the response activities carried out by the affected States and the NCDC. In addition, gaps in preparedness, response and surveillance activities were highlighted and pragmatic steps to be taken to bridge these gaps were proposed.\n\nWorking groups were created in line with the 6 thematic areas under the incident management system (IMS) for Lassa fever -- coordination/case management/infection prevention and control, laboratory, logistics, surveillance/data management and risk communication. Focus group discussions were held within these working groups during which best practises and challenges in the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak were highlighted. Practical recommendations were made by every group in their individual thematic areas and in cross-cutting areas. Each state was enjoined to follow up with these recommendations, as it applies to their particular needs and circumstances and to also incorporate them in their state-specific Lassa fever preparedness work plan.\n\nThe NCDC affirmed its resolve to continue to ensure that the disease burden caused by Lassa fever, and indeed all epidemic-prone diseases in Nigeria is reduced. The steps taken at this meeting will serve as added incentives towards establishing a finish line for the scourge of Lassa fever. All stakeholders and the general public are called upon to work with the governments in the various States towards a collaborative plan for the control and elimination of Lassa fever.\n\n--\n1. Lassa fever\nPlease note that the data reflect the routine reports, that is, all suspected cases including the laboratory positive and negative cases\n1.1. 19 suspected cases of Lassa fever with 4 laboratory confirmed and 2 deaths (CFR, 10.53 percent) were reported from 7 LGAs [local government areas] (9 states; Edo - 8, Kwara - 5, Ogun - 1, Ondo - 1, Oyo - 1, Plateau - 1, and Yobe - 2) in week 32 [week ending 13 Aug 2017], 2017 compared with 5 suspected cases and 2 deaths (CFR, 40 percent) reported from 5 LGAs (4 states) at the same period in 2016.\n1.2.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) together with the World Health Organisation and supporting partners, hosted the Lassa fever outbreak after action review meeting on the 21 and 22 Aug 2017. Participants were drawn from the states affected by the outbreak this year [2017], Lassa fever treatment facilities, diagnostic laboratories, NCDC surveillance, laboratory, and health emergency response teams, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, and other key stakeholders. Technical support was provided by WHO Africa Regional Office (AFRO) and the National Lassa fever Steering Committee.\n\nThe event was declared open on the 1st day by the Honourable Minister of State for Heath, Dr Osagie Enahire, who applauded the NCDC for its efforts towards stemming the tides of Lassa fever in Nigeria and charged all present to find a lasting solution to the menace of the disease in the country. The chairperson of the National Steering Committee, Prof Oyewale Tomori gave an overview of Lassa fever outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1969 with a critical review of control efforts taken in the past which have not yielded needed results. He decried the unsustainable efforts that have plagued the surveillance system in Nigeria and called on every stakeholder to realign their activities to achieve a common goal of a strengthened surveillance system, which can be used as a strong tool in the fight against Lassa fever. He urged participants present to focus on finding practical solutions towards elimination of the disease.\n\nA national report of the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak was presented. As at epi-week 33 (14-20 Aug 2017), a total of 764 suspected cases have been reported across 19 states (Ogun, Taraba, Rivers, Nasarawa, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Plateau, Kaduna, Gombe, Cross-River, Borno, Kano, Kogi, Enugu, Anambra, Lagos, and Kwara). 247 of these cases were confirmed and 14 classified as probable cases. A total of 83 deaths have been recorded, with 69 of them in confirmed cases. Case fatality rate is 33.6 percent in confirmed and probable cases and 15.1 percent in all cases (confirmed, probable, and suspected). The response activities carried out by the NCDC, including the development of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever [VHF] guidelines, deployment of rapid response teams, provision of ribavirin and other medical supplies to states and several others, were also discussed.\n\nRobust discussions were held by the participants following various presentations made, which all focused on preparedness and response to Lassa fever outbreak. The 2-day meeting provided an opportunity to reflect on the events which led to the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak in each state and also to conduct out a detailed review of the response activities carried out by the affected States and the NCDC. In addition, gaps in preparedness, response and surveillance activities were highlighted and pragmatic steps to be taken to bridge these gaps were proposed.\n\nWorking groups were created in line with the 6 thematic areas under the incident management system (IMS) for Lassa fever -- coordination/case management/infection prevention and control, laboratory, logistics, surveillance/data management and risk communication. Focus group discussions were held within these working groups during which best practises and challenges in the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak were highlighted. Practical recommendations were made by every group in their individual thematic areas and in cross-cutting areas. Each state was enjoined to follow up with these recommendations, as it applies to their particular needs and circumstances and to also incorporate them in their state-specific Lassa fever preparedness work plan.\n\nThe NCDC affirmed its resolve to continue to ensure that the disease burden caused by Lassa fever, and indeed all epidemic-prone diseases in Nigeria is reduced. The steps taken at this meeting will serve as added incentives towards establishing a finish line for the scourge of Lassa fever. All stakeholders and the general public are called upon to work with the governments in the various States towards a collaborative plan for the control and elimination of Lassa fever.\n\n--\n1. Lassa fever\nPlease note that the data reflect the routine reports, that is, all suspected cases including the laboratory positive and negative cases\n1.1. 19 suspected cases of Lassa fever with 4 laboratory confirmed and 2 deaths (CFR, 10.53 percent) were reported from 7 LGAs [local government areas] (9 states; Edo - 8, Kwara - 5, Ogun - 1, Ondo - 1, Oyo - 1, Plateau - 1, and Yobe - 2) in week 32 [week ending 13 Aug 2017], 2017 compared with 5 suspected cases and 2 deaths (CFR, 40 percent) reported from 5 LGAs (4 states) at the same period in 2016.\n1.2.

Technical support was provided by WHO Africa Regional Office (AFRO) and the National Lassa fever Steering Committee.\n\nThe event was declared open on the 1st day by the Honourable Minister of State for Heath, Dr Osagie Enahire, who applauded the NCDC for its efforts towards stemming the tides of Lassa fever in Nigeria and charged all present to find a lasting solution to the menace of the disease in the country. The chairperson of the National Steering Committee, Prof Oyewale Tomori gave an overview of Lassa fever outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1969 with a critical review of control efforts taken in the past which have not yielded needed results. He decried the unsustainable efforts that have plagued the surveillance system in Nigeria and called on every stakeholder to realign their activities to achieve a common goal of a strengthened surveillance system, which can be used as a strong tool in the fight against Lassa fever. He urged participants present to focus on finding practical solutions towards elimination of the disease.\n\nA national report of the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak was presented. As at epi-week 33 (14-20 Aug 2017), a total of 764 suspected cases have been reported across 19 states (Ogun, Taraba, Rivers, Nasarawa, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Plateau, Kaduna, Gombe, Cross-River, Borno, Kano, Kogi, Enugu, Anambra, Lagos, and Kwara). 247 of these cases were confirmed and 14 classified as probable cases. A total of 83 deaths have been recorded, with 69 of them in confirmed cases. Case fatality rate is 33.6 percent in confirmed and probable cases and 15.1 percent in all cases (confirmed, probable, and suspected). The response activities carried out by the NCDC, including the development of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever [VHF] guidelines, deployment of rapid response teams, provision of ribavirin and other medical supplies to states and several others, were also discussed.\n\nRobust discussions were held by the participants following various presentations made, which all focused on preparedness and response to Lassa fever outbreak. The 2-day meeting provided an opportunity to reflect on the events which led to the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak in each state and also to conduct out a detailed review of the response activities carried out by the affected States and the NCDC. In addition, gaps in preparedness, response and surveillance activities were highlighted and pragmatic steps to be taken to bridge these gaps were proposed.\n\nWorking groups were created in line with the 6 thematic areas under the incident management system (IMS) for Lassa fever -- coordination/case management/infection prevention and control, laboratory, logistics, surveillance/data management and risk communication. Focus group discussions were held within these working groups during which best practises and challenges in the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak were highlighted. Practical recommendations were made by every group in their individual thematic areas and in cross-cutting areas. Each state was enjoined to follow up with these recommendations, as it applies to their particular needs and circumstances and to also incorporate them in their state-specific Lassa fever preparedness work plan.\n\nThe NCDC affirmed its resolve to continue to ensure that the disease burden caused by Lassa fever, and indeed all epidemic-prone diseases in Nigeria is reduced. The steps taken at this meeting will serve as added incentives towards establishing a finish line for the scourge of Lassa fever. All stakeholders and the general public are called upon to work with the governments in the various States towards a collaborative plan for the control and elimination of Lassa fever.\n\n--\n1. Lassa fever\nPlease note that the data reflect the routine reports, that is, all suspected cases including the laboratory positive and negative cases\n1.1. 19 suspected cases of Lassa fever with 4 laboratory confirmed and 2 deaths (CFR, 10.53 percent) were reported from 7 LGAs [local government areas] (9 states; Edo - 8, Kwara - 5, Ogun - 1, Ondo - 1, Oyo - 1, Plateau - 1, and Yobe - 2) in week 32 [week ending 13 Aug 2017], 2017 compared with 5 suspected cases and 2 deaths (CFR, 40 percent) reported from 5 LGAs (4 states) at the same period in 2016.\n1.2.

Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nImages of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.\n\nMaps of Nigeria can be accessed at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (32): Nigeria 20170819.5262007\nLassa fever - West Africa (30): Nigeria 20170809.5239391\nLassa fever - West Africa (29): Nigeria 20170805.5229598\nLassa fever - West Africa (28): Nigeria 20170727.5208474\nLassa fever - West Africa (27): Nigeria 20170714.5173313\nLassa fever - West Africa (26): Nigeria 20170710.5162466\nLassa fever - West Africa (25): Nigeria 20170629.5140763\nLassa fever - West Africa (24): Nigeria 20170626.5130588\nLassa fever - West Africa (23): Nigeria (ON) 20170622.5124247\nLassa fever - West Africa (22): Nigeria (AN) 20170620.5118831\nLassa fever - West Africa (21): Nigeria 20170617.5112720\nLassa fever - West Africa (20): Nigeria 20170607.5088880\nLassa fever - West Africa (19): Nigeria 20170604.5082193\nLassa fever - West Africa (18): Nigeria 20170530.5070103\nLassa fever - West Africa (17): Nigeria 20170513.5033800\nLassa fever - West Africa (16): Nigeria (BA) 20170412.4967018\nLassa fever - West Africa (15): Nigeria (KO) 20170404.4947996\nLassa fever - West Africa (14): Nigeria 20170402.4943005\nLassa fever - West Africa (13): update 20170328.4931422\nLassa fever - West Africa (12): Nigeria 20170327.4929174\nLassa fever - West Africa (11): Nigeria 20170319.4911462\nLassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria (BO) 20170302.4875164\nLassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria (BA) 20170225.4864837\nLassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria 20170225.4862689\nLassa fever - West Africa (05): Nigeria (NA) 20170215.4842179\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria (RI) 20170122.4782917\nLassa fever - West Africa (02): Nigeria (NA) 20170118.4773375\nLassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria (OG) 20170101.4735363\n.................................................ty/mj/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever", "plague", "haemorrhagic fever"], "syndromes": ["haemorrhagic fever"], "event_date": ["2033-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "1969-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2001-01-05 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2007-09-30 00:00:00", "2017-08-04 00:00:00", "2032-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-30 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "2021-03-28 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Lagos", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "image", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taraba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nasarawa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Borno", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ebonyi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "RI", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Plateau", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bauchi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WEST AFRICA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5459997", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (36): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5459997", "date": "2017-09-04 11:59:35", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (33): NIGERIA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 25 Aug 2017\nSource: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Weekly Epidemiological Report 7(32) [edited]\nhttp://www.ncdc.gov.ng/reports/weekly\n\n\n2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak after action review meeting, 21-22 Aug 2017\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLassa fever experts from all over Nigeria and beyond gathered in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja for 2 days to review the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak and propose preparedness plans for subsequent outbreaks.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) together with the World Health Organisation and supporting partners, hosted the Lassa fever outbreak after action review meeting on the 21 and 22 Aug 2017. Participants were drawn from the states affected by the outbreak this year [2017], Lassa fever treatment facilities, diagnostic laboratories, NCDC surveillance, laboratory, and health emergency response teams, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, and other key stakeholders. Technical support was provided by WHO Africa Regional Office (AFRO) and the National Lassa fever Steering Committee.\n\nThe event was declared open on the 1st day by the Honourable Minister of State for Heath, Dr Osagie Enahire, who applauded the NCDC for its efforts towards stemming the tides of Lassa fever in Nigeria and charged all present to find a lasting solution to the menace of the disease in the country. The chairperson of the National Steering Committee, Prof Oyewale Tomori gave an overview of Lassa fever outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1969 with a critical review of control efforts taken in the past which have not yielded needed results. He decried the unsustainable efforts that have plagued the surveillance system in Nigeria and called on every stakeholder to realign their activities to achieve a common goal of a strengthened surveillance system, which can be used as a strong tool in the fight against Lassa fever. He urged participants present to focus on finding practical solutions towards elimination of the disease.\n\nA national report of the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak was presented. As at epi-week 33 (14-20 Aug 2017), a total of 764 suspected cases have been reported across 19 states (Ogun, Taraba, Rivers, Nasarawa, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Plateau, Kaduna, Gombe, Cross-River, Borno, Kano, Kogi, Enugu, Anambra, Lagos, and Kwara). 247 of these cases were confirmed and 14 classified as probable cases. A total of 83 deaths have been recorded, with 69 of them in confirmed cases. Case fatality rate is 33.6 percent in confirmed and probable cases and 15.1 percent in all cases (confirmed, probable, and suspected). The response activities carried out by the NCDC, including the development of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever [VHF] guidelines, deployment of rapid response teams, provision of ribavirin and other medical supplies to states and several others, were also discussed.\n\nRobust discussions were held by the participants following various presentations made, which all focused on preparedness and response to Lassa fever outbreak. The 2-day meeting provided an opportunity to reflect on the events which led to the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak in each state and also to conduct out a detailed review of the response activities carried out by the affected States and the NCDC. In addition, gaps in preparedness, response and surveillance activities were highlighted and pragmatic steps to be taken to bridge these gaps were proposed.\n\nWorking groups were created in line with the 6 thematic areas under the incident management system (IMS) for Lassa fever -- coordination/case management/infection prevention and control, laboratory, logistics, surveillance/data management and risk communication. Focus group discussions were held within these working groups during which best practises and challenges in the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak were highlighted. Practical recommendations were made by every group in their individual thematic areas and in cross-cutting areas. Each state was enjoined to follow up with these recommendations, as it applies to their particular needs and circumstances and to also incorporate them in their state-specific Lassa fever preparedness work plan.\n\nThe NCDC affirmed its resolve to continue to ensure that the disease burden caused by Lassa fever, and indeed all epidemic-prone diseases in Nigeria is reduced. The steps taken at this meeting will serve as added incentives towards establishing a finish line for the scourge of Lassa fever. All stakeholders and the general public are called upon to work with the governments in the various States towards a collaborative plan for the control and elimination of Lassa fever.\n\n--\n1. Lassa fever\nPlease note that the data reflect the routine reports, that is, all suspected cases including the laboratory positive and negative cases\n1.1. 19 suspected cases of Lassa fever with 4 laboratory confirmed and 2 deaths (CFR, 10.53 percent) were reported from 7 LGAs [local government areas] (9 states; Edo - 8, Kwara - 5, Ogun - 1, Ondo - 1, Oyo - 1, Plateau - 1, and Yobe - 2) in week 32 [week ending 13 Aug 2017], 2017 compared with 5 suspected cases and 2 deaths (CFR, 40 percent) reported from 5 LGAs (4 states) at the same period in 2016.\n1.2. Laboratory results of the 19 suspected cases were 4 positives for Lassa fever (Edo - 2, Ogun - 1, and Ondo - 1) while 9 were negative for Lassa fever and other VHFs (Edo - 6, Oyo - 1, Plateau - 1, and Yobe -2) while 5 pending (Kwara - 5).\n1.3. Between weeks 1 and 32 ([1 Jan-13 Aug 2017], 393 suspected Lassa fever cases with 97 laboratory confirmed cases and 58 deaths (CFR, 14.80 percent) from 74 LGAs (25 states) were reported compared with 787 suspected cases with 75 laboratory confirmed cases and 90 deaths (CFR, 11.44 percent) from 128 LGAs (27 states) during the same period in 2016 (Figure 1 --[available at the source URL above]).\n1.4. Between weeks 1 and 52 2016, 921 suspected Lassa fever cases with 109 laboratory confirmed cases and 119 deaths (CFR, 12.92 percent) from 144 LGAs (28 states and FCT) were reported compared with 430 suspected cases with 25 laboratory confirmed cases and 40 deaths (CFR, 9.30 percent) from 37 LGAs (14 states and FCT) during the same period in 2015 (Figure 2).\n1.5.

He decried the unsustainable efforts that have plagued the surveillance system in Nigeria and called on every stakeholder to realign their activities to achieve a common goal of a strengthened surveillance system, which can be used as a strong tool in the fight against Lassa fever. He urged participants present to focus on finding practical solutions towards elimination of the disease.\n\nA national report of the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak was presented. As at epi-week 33 (14-20 Aug 2017), a total of 764 suspected cases have been reported across 19 states (Ogun, Taraba, Rivers, Nasarawa, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Plateau, Kaduna, Gombe, Cross-River, Borno, Kano, Kogi, Enugu, Anambra, Lagos, and Kwara). 247 of these cases were confirmed and 14 classified as probable cases. A total of 83 deaths have been recorded, with 69 of them in confirmed cases. Case fatality rate is 33.6 percent in confirmed and probable cases and 15.1 percent in all cases (confirmed, probable, and suspected). The response activities carried out by the NCDC, including the development of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever [VHF] guidelines, deployment of rapid response teams, provision of ribavirin and other medical supplies to states and several others, were also discussed.\n\nRobust discussions were held by the participants following various presentations made, which all focused on preparedness and response to Lassa fever outbreak. The 2-day meeting provided an opportunity to reflect on the events which led to the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak in each state and also to conduct out a detailed review of the response activities carried out by the affected States and the NCDC. In addition, gaps in preparedness, response and surveillance activities were highlighted and pragmatic steps to be taken to bridge these gaps were proposed.\n\nWorking groups were created in line with the 6 thematic areas under the incident management system (IMS) for Lassa fever -- coordination/case management/infection prevention and control, laboratory, logistics, surveillance/data management and risk communication. Focus group discussions were held within these working groups during which best practises and challenges in the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak were highlighted. Practical recommendations were made by every group in their individual thematic areas and in cross-cutting areas. Each state was enjoined to follow up with these recommendations, as it applies to their particular needs and circumstances and to also incorporate them in their state-specific Lassa fever preparedness work plan.\n\nThe NCDC affirmed its resolve to continue to ensure that the disease burden caused by Lassa fever, and indeed all epidemic-prone diseases in Nigeria is reduced. The steps taken at this meeting will serve as added incentives towards establishing a finish line for the scourge of Lassa fever. All stakeholders and the general public are called upon to work with the governments in the various States towards a collaborative plan for the control and elimination of Lassa fever.\n\n--\n1.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) together with the World Health Organisation and supporting partners, hosted the Lassa fever outbreak after action review meeting on the 21 and 22 Aug 2017. Participants were drawn from the states affected by the outbreak this year [2017], Lassa fever treatment facilities, diagnostic laboratories, NCDC surveillance, laboratory, and health emergency response teams, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, and other key stakeholders. Technical support was provided by WHO Africa Regional Office (AFRO) and the National Lassa fever Steering Committee.\n\nThe event was declared open on the 1st day by the Honourable Minister of State for Heath, Dr Osagie Enahire, who applauded the NCDC for its efforts towards stemming the tides of Lassa fever in Nigeria and charged all present to find a lasting solution to the menace of the disease in the country.

Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nImages of _Mastomys_ mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.\n\nOnce again, Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi is thanked for sending in the above Epidemiological Report.\n\nMaps of Nigeria can be accessed at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62.]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (24): Nigeria 20170626.5130588\nLassa fever - West Africa (23): Nigeria (ON) 20170622.5124247\nLassa fever - West Africa (22): Nigeria (AN) 20170620.5118831\nLassa fever - West Africa (21): Nigeria 20170617.5112720\nLassa fever - West Africa (20): Nigeria 20170607.5088880\nLassa fever - West Africa (19): Nigeria 20170604.5082193\nLassa fever - West Africa (18): Nigeria 20170530.5070103\nLassa fever - West Africa (17): Nigeria 20170513.5033800\nLassa fever - West Africa (16): Nigeria (BA) 20170412.4967018\nLassa fever - West Africa (15): Nigeria (KO) 20170404.4947996\nLassa fever - West Africa (14): Nigeria 20170402.4943005\nLassa fever - West Africa (13): update 20170328.4931422\nLassa fever - West Africa (12): Nigeria 20170327.4929174\nLassa fever - West Africa (11): Nigeria 20170319.4911462\nLassa fever - West Africa (10): Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso 20170312.4896305\nLassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria (BO) 20170302.4875164\nLassa fever - West Africa (08): Benin 20170301.4872702\nLassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria (BA) 20170225.4864837\nLassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria 20170225.4862689\nLassa fever - West Africa (05): Nigeria (NA) 20170215.4842179\nLassa fever - West Africa (04): Liberia 20170209.4827934\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria (RI) 20170122.4782917\nLassa fever - West Africa (02): Nigeria (NA) 20170118.4773375\nLassa fever - West Africa (01): Nigeria (OG) 20170101.4735363\n.................................................ty/ec/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["lassa fever", "haemorrhagic fever"], "syndromes": ["haemorrhagic fever"], "event_date": ["2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2001-01-05 00:00:00", "2017-06-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Taraba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nasarawa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Liberia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo State", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "RI", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Borno States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5239391", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (30): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5239391", "date": "2017-06-29 19:49:07", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (25): NIGERIA\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 23 Jun 2017\nSource: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control [NCDC] Weekly Epidemiological Report 7(23) [edited]\nhttp://www.ncdc.gov.ng/reports/weekly\n\n\n1.

Between weeks 1 and 52 2016, 921 suspected Lassa fever cases with 109 laboratory confirmed cases and 119 deaths (CFR, 12.92 percent) from 144 LGAs (28 States and FCT) were reported compared with 430 suspected cases with 25 laboratory confirmed cases and 40 deaths (CFR, 9.30 percent) from 37 LGAs (14 States and FCT) during the same period in 2015 (Figure 2).\n1.5. Investigation and active case search ongoing in affected States with coordination of response activities by the NCDC with support from partners.\n1.5.1. National Lassa Fever Working Group meeting and weekly National Surveillance and Outbreak Response meeting on-going at NCDC to keep abreast of the current Lassa fever situation in the country.\n1.5.2. Response materials for VHFs prepositioned across the country by NCDC at the beginning of the dry season\n1.5.3. New VHF guidelines have been developed by the NCDC (Interim National Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers Preparedness guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures for Lassa fever management)\n1.5.4. Ongoing reclassification of reported Lassa fever cases\n1.5.5. Ongoing review of the variables for case-based surveillance for VHF\n1.5.6. VHF case-based forms completed by affected States are being entered into the new VHF management system. This system allows for the creation of a VHF database for the country.\n1.5.7. NCDC team sent to Edo State to support Lassa fever data harmonization and updating of VHF case-based management database\n1.5.8. Confirmed cases are being treated at identified treatment/isolation centers across the States with Ribavirin and necessary supportive management also instituted\n1.5.9. Onsite support was earlier provided to Ogun, Nasarawa, Taraba, Ondo and Borno States by the NCDC and partners\n1.5.10. Offsite support provided by NCDC/partners in all affected States\n1.5.11. States are enjoined to intensify surveillance and promote Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) measures in health facilities.\n\nTable of cases as of 16 Jun 2017\nCases during week 23: 3 cases, deaths 0\nCumulative weeks 1- 23: 301, deaths 49\n\n[Cases by state not given in thei Epidemiological Report]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nOlutayo Olajide Babalobi\nLecturer and Consultant Epizootiologist\n(One Health, Participatory Epizootiology and Veterinary ICT Research Group)\nDepartment of Veterinary Public Health and Preventive Medicine\nFaculty of Veterinary Medicine\nUniversity of Ibadan\nIbadan, Nigeria\n<tayobabalobi@gmail.com>\n\n[During week 23, there were just 3 new suspected cases.

The majority of Lassa fever virus infections (approx. 80 percent); symptoms are mild and are undiagnosed. The mild symptoms include slight fever, general malaise and weakness and headache. In 20 percent of infected individuals, however, the disease may progress to more serious symptoms, including hemorrhaging in gums, eyes or nose, respiratory distress, repeated vomiting, facial swelling, pain in the chest, back, and abdomen, and shock. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis.

He instructed them to raise the threat level and carry out awareness campaign to prevent the incident growing to an epidemic.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nEpiCore Surveillance Project member\nDr Chidozie Ugwu\n\n[The seriousness of the Lassa fever outbreak in Ogun state has been recognized with an increased threat level by the Ministry of Health. This is important for health care professionals in health centers to avoid nosocomial transmission. A committee addressing Lassa fever has made valuable recommendations that should contribute to the reduction of human cases both in and outside health centers. The risk of infection remains in rodent populations. The virus is endemic in multimammate rodents (_Mastomys_ spp).\n\nInterestingly, the previous ProMED-mail post (archive no 20161221.4713167) of suspected Lassa fever cases in Ogun state included a request for information about confirmation, or not, of the etiology of these cases.

This is important for health care professionals in health centers to avoid nosocomial transmission. A committee addressing Lassa fever has made valuable recommendations that should contribute to the reduction of human cases both in and outside health centers. The risk of infection remains in rodent populations. The virus is endemic in multimammate rodents (_Mastomys_ spp).\n\nInterestingly, the previous ProMED-mail post (archive no 20161221.4713167) of suspected Lassa fever cases in Ogun state included a request for information about confirmation, or not, of the etiology of these cases.

Ihekweazu said in the statement that the case reported from Gombe died on 22 Aug 2016, while other cases are still alive.\n\nHe said that public health response commenced immediately in all the affected states under the leadership of the respective state's Ministries of Health. According to him, resources were immediately mobilized from NCDC and its partner, the Nigerian Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (NFELTP), to support the investigation and management of cases in the affected states.\n\n\"We commend the early detection and reporting of the most recent cases, as it significantly improves the likelihood of survival for the cases and also reduces the risk of further transmission. \"We also urge states to report cases immediately for Lassa fever, while improving on the timeliness of their reporting generally.

Lassa virus is endemic in rodents in Nigeria and cases can occur at any time.

Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection.

Person to person transmission is also possible, albeit less common.\n\nFor people witnessing the symptoms, alarm bells may ring and raise fears of Ebola -- but this is not Ebola.\n\nWest Africa as a region is seeing a flare-up of the disease, but Nigeria -- where Lassa fever was first discovered in 1969 -- is experiencing much higher mortality rates than usual.\n\nOn average, Lassa fever is deadly in 1 percent of all individuals infected, with higher rates of 15 percent morbidity among people hospitalized for the illness, but the current outbreak in Nigeria has seen more than 50 percent of those affected dying from their infection.\n\nAccording to NCDC's latest report, dated 14 Mar 2016, the total number of reported cases is 254 (129 of which confirmed by lab tests) and the total number of deaths (suspected, probable and confirmed) is 137, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 53.9 percent.\n\nA 2012 outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria caused more than 1700 people to become infected, but 112 deaths, according to the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC). Despite lower case numbers, the death toll in the current outbreak are already higher.\n\n\"The deaths among cases are higher than normal, and we are currently establishing the reason for this,\" says Abdulsalami Nasidi, Director of the NCDC.\n\nA further concern is the geographic spread of the outbreak: \"More states are affected (than usual), and we're evaluating possible reasons,\" says Nasidi.\n\nLassa fever outbreaks occur most years in West Africa, as the disease is endemic to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria.\n\nEach year, the virus infects an estimated 100 000-300 000 and is responsible for 5000 deaths in the region as a whole.\n\nLassa virus is in the same family of viruses as Ebola and Marburg virus, which also cause fever and sometimes haemorrhage. [This is not correct. Lassa fever virus is an arenavirus and Ebola and Marburg viruses are filoviruses. - Mod.TY]. The virus is named after the Nigerian town of Lassa where it was first discovered.\n\nOutbreaks generally occur during the region's dry season -- typically between November to February -- but this time it's persisting. Officials are speculating on the reasons for the increased mortality and spread, but the truth remains unknown. \"Viruses change over time,\" says Nasidi.\n\nOne theory officials are suggesting for the spread of the virus into new states, is that there may be better awareness of symptoms after the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has infected more than 28 000 people. Previously, infections often went unreported as the disease mainly affects rural areas where populations can be highly infected, but don't notify the authorities.\n\nThe main culprit behind the transmission of Lassa fever is the \"multimammate rat\" -- a reservoir for the virus with the ability to spread it to humans. Touching, consuming, or inhaling, the urine or feces of a rat carrying the virus is the prime route of infection in humans.

Person to person transmission is also possible, albeit less common.\n\nFor people witnessing the symptoms, alarm bells may ring and raise fears of Ebola -- but this is not Ebola.\n\nWest Africa as a region is seeing a flare-up of the disease, but Nigeria -- where Lassa fever was first discovered in 1969 -- is experiencing much higher mortality rates than usual.\n\nOn average, Lassa fever is deadly in 1 percent of all individuals infected, with higher rates of 15 percent morbidity among people hospitalized for the illness, but the current outbreak in Nigeria has seen more than 50 percent of those affected dying from their infection.\n\nAccording to NCDC's latest report, dated 14 Mar 2016, the total number of reported cases is 254 (129 of which confirmed by lab tests) and the total number of deaths (suspected, probable and confirmed) is 137, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 53.9 percent.\n\nA 2012 outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria caused more than 1700 people to become infected, but 112 deaths, according to the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC). Despite lower case numbers, the death toll in the current outbreak are already higher.\n\n\"The deaths among cases are higher than normal, and we are currently establishing the reason for this,\" says Abdulsalami Nasidi, Director of the NCDC.\n\nA further concern is the geographic spread of the outbreak: \"More states are affected (than usual), and we're evaluating possible reasons,\" says Nasidi.\n\nLassa fever outbreaks occur most years in West Africa, as the disease is endemic to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria.\n\nEach year, the virus infects an estimated 100 000-300 000 and is responsible for 5000 deaths in the region as a whole.\n\nLassa virus is in the same family of viruses as Ebola and Marburg virus, which also cause fever and sometimes haemorrhage. [This is not correct. Lassa fever virus is an arenavirus and Ebola and Marburg viruses are filoviruses. - Mod.TY]. The virus is named after the Nigerian town of Lassa where it was first discovered.\n\nOutbreaks generally occur during the region's dry season -- typically between November to February -- but this time it's persisting. Officials are speculating on the reasons for the increased mortality and spread, but the truth remains unknown. \"Viruses change over time,\" says Nasidi.\n\nOne theory officials are suggesting for the spread of the virus into new states, is that there may be better awareness of symptoms after the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has infected more than 28 000 people. Previously, infections often went unreported as the disease mainly affects rural areas where populations can be highly infected, but don't notify the authorities.\n\nThe main culprit behind the transmission of Lassa fever is the \"multimammate rat\" -- a reservoir for the virus with the ability to spread it to humans.

Person to person transmission is also possible, albeit less common.\n\nFor people witnessing the symptoms, alarm bells may ring and raise fears of Ebola -- but this is not Ebola.\n\nWest Africa as a region is seeing a flare-up of the disease, but Nigeria -- where Lassa fever was first discovered in 1969 -- is experiencing much higher mortality rates than usual.\n\nOn average, Lassa fever is deadly in 1 percent of all individuals infected, with higher rates of 15 percent morbidity among people hospitalized for the illness, but the current outbreak in Nigeria has seen more than 50 percent of those affected dying from their infection.\n\nAccording to NCDC's latest report, dated 14 Mar 2016, the total number of reported cases is 254 (129 of which confirmed by lab tests) and the total number of deaths (suspected, probable and confirmed) is 137, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 53.9 percent.\n\nA 2012 outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria caused more than 1700 people to become infected, but 112 deaths, according to the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC). Despite lower case numbers, the death toll in the current outbreak are already higher.\n\n\"The deaths among cases are higher than normal, and we are currently establishing the reason for this,\" says Abdulsalami Nasidi, Director of the NCDC.\n\nA further concern is the geographic spread of the outbreak: \"More states are affected (than usual), and we're evaluating possible reasons,\" says Nasidi.\n\nLassa fever outbreaks occur most years in West Africa, as the disease is endemic to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria.\n\nEach year, the virus infects an estimated 100 000-300 000 and is responsible for 5000 deaths in the region as a whole.\n\nLassa virus is in the same family of viruses as Ebola and Marburg virus, which also cause fever and sometimes haemorrhage. [This is not correct. Lassa fever virus is an arenavirus and Ebola and Marburg viruses are filoviruses. - Mod.TY]. The virus is named after the Nigerian town of Lassa where it was first discovered.\n\nOutbreaks generally occur during the region's dry season -- typically between November to February -- but this time it's persisting. Officials are speculating on the reasons for the increased mortality and spread, but the truth remains unknown. \"Viruses change over time,\" says Nasidi.\n\nOne theory officials are suggesting for the spread of the virus into new states, is that there may be better awareness of symptoms after the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has infected more than 28 000 people. Previously, infections often went unreported as the disease mainly affects rural areas where populations can be highly infected, but don't notify the authorities.\n\nThe main culprit behind the transmission of Lassa fever is the \"multimammate rat\" -- a reservoir for the virus with the ability to spread it to humans. Touching, consuming, or inhaling, the urine or feces of a rat carrying the virus is the prime route of infection in humans. This generally happens through contaminated food and surfaces within people's homes -- particularly during the dry season.\n\n\"When the rains are over, the rats then come closer to humans to steal grains,\" says David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In rural areas, communities often store grains in their homes after the harvest to get them through the dry season. \"They [the rodents] urinate and defecate on the rice, which makes the uncooked rice a source of human infection,\" says Heymann. The meat of rodents is often eaten in the region, further increasing the likelihood of transmission.\n\nContact with the bodily fluids, or tissues, of another human carrying the virus is also a mode of transmission, but more rare.\n\nThe symptoms of the disease are wide-ranging and vary from mild to severe in different cases, making diagnosis a challenge.\n\nOne in 5 of those infected will experience symptoms including haemorrhage, respiratory problems, and facial swelling, especially if diagnosed late with the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The remaining 80 percent experience much milder symptoms such as fever and weakness, which can often go undiagnosed. Up to 1/3 of people infected also risk losing their hearing.\n\nTreatment is available with the antiviral drug ribavirin, but this has its greatest effect if used early.\n\nThe NCDC and Ministry of Health have increased resources to handle the outbreak, such as mapping those at most risk, improving access to diagnostics and engaging with communities to recognize the signs and symptoms. \"Every life counts and every case must be investigated,\" says Nasidi.\n\nGiven the increased mortality, the priority is prevention. This includes reducing the chances of contact between humans and rat colonies.\n\nSales of rat poison in Nigeria have boomed since the outbreak was announced, according to reports by the news service AFP.\n\nAs with Ebola, awareness and increased use of personal protective equipment when handling patients is also crucial to prevent human to human transmission, particularly in health clinics. \"The government has made the right recommendations about infection control in health facilities...the virus is passed from person to person by poor infection control,\" says Heymann.\n\nAs outbreaks are somewhat regular, health officials are still hopeful the current spike in infections will come to a natural end. \"From past experiences we expect numbers to start decreasing in March/April,\" says Nasidi.\n\n[Byline: Meera Senthilingam]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The number of Lassa fever deaths in Nigeria has increased from 63 as of week 7 (week ending 19 Feb 2016) to 130 reported above.

There has been no indication that a village-level control effort has been initiated yet.\n\nImages of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.\n\nMaps of Nigeria can be accessed at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2341. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria, Benin 20160227.4054108\nLassa fever - West Africa (08): Nigeria 20160221.4039559\nLassa fever - West Africa (06): Nigeria 20160216.4024752\nLassa fever - West Africa (03): Nigeria 20160207.4002672\nLassa fever - West Africa: Nigeria, Benin 20160131.3980796\nLassa fever - Nigeria (09): (DE) 20160125.3962747\nLassa fever - Nigeria (08) 20160123.3959896\nLassa fever - Nigeria (07) 20160123.3959273\nLassa fever - Nigeria (06) 20160117.3942974\nLassa fever - Nigeria (05) 20160113.3933680\nLassa fever - Nigeria (04) 20160110.3924977\nLassa fever - Nigeria (03): (RI) 20160106.3915154\nLassa fever - Nigeria (02): (TA) 20160104.3908901\nLassa fever - Nigeria: (KN) 20160101.3905902\n.................................................sb/dk/ty/mj/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "lassa fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-02-29 00:00:00", "2016-02-29 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-02-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Kafanchan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kaduna", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Zonkwa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WEST AFRICA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4054108", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (09): Nigeria, Benin", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4054108", "date": "2016-02-06 18:54:55", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (02): BENIN\n*************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 3 Feb 2016\nSource: Business Standard [edited]\nhttp://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/nine-people-suspected-dead-of-lassa-fever-in-benin-116020300052_1.html\n\n\nAs the world ramps up its fight against the Zika virus, West Africa is battling to contain a growing outbreak of Lassa fever with 9 people in Benin reported dead. \"Right now, there are a total of 20 suspected cases with 9 deaths,\" government health official Orou Bagou Yorou Chabi said.\n\nThe 1st Lassa fever case in the West African country of 10 million people was listed at the Hospital of St Martin de Papane, in Tchaourou, a city 350 km (220 miles) north of Cotonou [Benin's largest city, pop. about 1 million], the United Nations children agency UNICEF said in a statement.\n\nAn ongoing epidemic in neighbouring Nigeria has already killed 84 people, out of 168 suspected cases, according to UNICEF.\n\nStocks of Ribavirin, a drug used to treat the infection, were being shipped to Tchaourou and Cotonou, the UN agency added.\n\nBenin was last hit by a Lassa fever outbreak in October 2014, when 9 people suspected of having the virus died.\n\nLassa fever belongs to the same family as Marburg and Ebola, 2 deadly viruses that lead to infections with fever, vomiting and, in worse-case scenarios, haemorrhagic bleeding [these viruses are clinically known as hemorrhagic fever viruses but are in very different families.

Ebola was excluded, see: Ebola virus disease - West Africa (213): Sierra Leone, Benin false alarm, Mali 20141118.2966829. - Mod.JW]\n\nThe 2 people were among 5 health workers who died at a hospital in Tanguieta [Atakora department], in the north of the tiny West African nation, which borders Nigeria to the west. \"There were 5 deaths at the hospital in Tanguieta but from the samples taken only 2 were positive (for Lassa fever),\" she told AFP [Agence France-Presse]. Gazard said that \"no other case has yet been brought to our attention\". The WHO's representative in the country, Youssouf Gamatie, was quoted as saying in the Benin media: \"It's lucky that we have detected it in the initial phase.\" Benin's authorities said they were expecting additional medication to deal with any further cases.\n\nAccording to the WHO, Lassa fever is an acute haemorrhagic illness [caused by a virus] which belongs to the arenavirus family of viruses, which also includes the Ebola-like _Marburgvirus_. [This statement about _Marburgvirus_ is incorrect. _Marburgvirus_ belongs to the filovirus family, as does _Ebolavirus_. - Mod.TY]. It was 1st identified in 1969 in the north Nigerian town of the same name.\n\nThe virus, which is endemic in rodents in West Africa, is transmitted to humans by contact with food or household items contaminated with the animals' faeces and urine. Person-to-person contact is also possible through bodily fluids, particularly in hospitals when adequate infection control measures are not taken.\n\nPeople with Lassa fever do not display symptoms in 80 percent of cases but it can cause serious symptoms and death in the remainder.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the number of Lassa fever infections in west Africa every year is between\n100 000-300 000, with about 5000 deaths.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although this is the 1st report of Lassa fever that ProMED-mail has posted for Benin, the occurrence is not surprising. Benin adjoins Nigeria in West Africa. As noted in the 2014 ProMED-mail post on Lassa fever in Nigeria cited below, Lassa fever virus is endemic in Nigeria and is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country. It is safe to assume that Lassa fever virus is also endemic in Benin. As Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived post 20130131.1524034: \"In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multi-system disease. Exceptionally, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality ratio can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine or treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients.\" Unfortunately, transmission occurs all to frequently in hospitals with inadequate isolation and personal protection for medical staff.\n\nThe virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp.).

Although Lassa fever is endemic in Liberia and occurring as sporadic cases in Bong, Nimba and Lofa counties, this is the 1st time a case has been reported in Margibi County which is close to Montserrado County where the national capital city, Monrovia is located.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever virus is endemic in Nigeria.

Mod.CP provided an excellent summary of Lassa fever (ProMED-mail archive no. 20130911.1937742): \"Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is an endemic disease in portions of West Africa. It is recognized in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone as well as Nigeria. However, because the rodent species which carry the virus are found throughout West Africa, the actual geographic range of the disease may extend to other countries in the region. Individuals at risk are those who live in or visit areas with a high population of _Mastomys_ rodents infected with Lassa virus or are exposed to infected humans.\n\n\"Primary transmission of the Lassa virus to humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with _Mastomys_ rodents, especially in the geographic regions where outbreaks occur. Storing food away in rodent-proof containers and keeping living areas clean help to discourage rodents from entering homes. When caring for patients with Lassa fever, further transmission of the disease through person-to-person contact or nosocomial routes can be avoided by taking preventive precautions against contact with patient secretions (together called VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever] isolation precautions or barrier nursing methods) [http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual.htm]. Such precautions include wearing protective clothing, such as masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles; using infection control measures, such as complete equipment sterilization; and isolating infected patients from contact with unprotected persons until the disease has run its course. The disease can be treated.\n\n\"Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and nonspecific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult. The anti-viral drug ribavirin can be used in treatment of severe cases.

A total of 14 cases including one death were reported from 27 Feb 2014 to 10 Mar 2014. A total of 11 of the cases had been reported among UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) Kakata camp peace keepers, 2 among UNMIL civil/UNPOL [United Nations Police] in the camp, while one case is from the neighboring community related to cases in the camp. All the 14 cases have been laboratory confirmed to be due to Lassa fever. Although Lassa fever is endemic in Liberia and occurring as sporadic cases in Bong, Nimba and Lofa counties, this is the 1st time a case has been reported in Margibi County which is close to Montserrado County where the national capital city, Monrovia is located.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever virus is endemic in Nigeria. This is the 4th report of cases of Lassa fever virus for Nigeria in 2014 that ProMED-mail has posted. Cases have occurred sporadically in Liberia and this is the 1st report for 2014. Mod.CP provided an excellent summary of Lassa fever (ProMED-mail archive no. 20130911.1937742): \"Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is an endemic disease in portions of West Africa. It is recognized in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone as well as Nigeria. However, because the rodent species which carry the virus are found throughout West Africa, the actual geographic range of the disease may extend to other countries in the region. Individuals at risk are those who live in or visit areas with a high population of _Mastomys_ rodents infected with Lassa virus or are exposed to infected humans.\n\n\"Primary transmission of the Lassa virus to humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with _Mastomys_ rodents, especially in the geographic regions where outbreaks occur. Storing food away in rodent-proof containers and keeping living areas clean help to discourage rodents from entering homes. When caring for patients with Lassa fever, further transmission of the disease through person-to-person contact or nosocomial routes can be avoided by taking preventive precautions against contact with patient secretions (together called VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever] isolation precautions or barrier nursing methods) [http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual.htm]. Such precautions include wearing protective clothing, such as masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles; using infection control measures, such as complete equipment sterilization; and isolating infected patients from contact with unprotected persons until the disease has run its course. The disease can be treated.\n\n\"Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and nonspecific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult. The anti-viral drug ribavirin can be used in treatment of severe cases.

A total of 14 cases including one death were reported from 27 Feb 2014 to 10 Mar 2014. A total of 11 of the cases had been reported among UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) Kakata camp peace keepers, 2 among UNMIL civil/UNPOL [United Nations Police] in the camp, while one case is from the neighboring community related to cases in the camp. All the 14 cases have been laboratory confirmed to be due to Lassa fever. Although Lassa fever is endemic in Liberia and occurring as sporadic cases in Bong, Nimba and Lofa counties, this is the 1st time a case has been reported in Margibi County which is close to Montserrado County where the national capital city, Monrovia is located.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever virus is endemic in Nigeria. This is the 4th report of cases of Lassa fever virus for Nigeria in 2014 that ProMED-mail has posted. Cases have occurred sporadically in Liberia and this is the 1st report for 2014. Mod.CP provided an excellent summary of Lassa fever (ProMED-mail archive no. 20130911.1937742): \"Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is an endemic disease in portions of West Africa. It is recognized in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone as well as Nigeria. However, because the rodent species which carry the virus are found throughout West Africa, the actual geographic range of the disease may extend to other countries in the region. Individuals at risk are those who live in or visit areas with a high population of _Mastomys_ rodents infected with Lassa virus or are exposed to infected humans.\n\n\"Primary transmission of the Lassa virus to humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with _Mastomys_ rodents, especially in the geographic regions where outbreaks occur. Storing food away in rodent-proof containers and keeping living areas clean help to discourage rodents from entering homes. When caring for patients with Lassa fever, further transmission of the disease through person-to-person contact or nosocomial routes can be avoided by taking preventive precautions against contact with patient secretions (together called VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever] isolation precautions or barrier nursing methods) [http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual.htm]. Such precautions include wearing protective clothing, such as masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles; using infection control measures, such as complete equipment sterilization; and isolating infected patients from contact with unprotected persons until the disease has run its course. The disease can be treated.\n\n\"Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and nonspecific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult. The anti-viral drug ribavirin can be used in treatment of severe cases.

The illness was discovered in 1969 when 2 missionary nurses died in Nigeria, West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. Lassa fever virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 percent.\n\nThe reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the \"multimammate rat\" of the genus _Mastomys_ (see image at http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fil:Mastomys_coucha.jpg.). It is not certain which species of _Mastomys_ are associated with Lassa; however, at least 2 species carry the virus in Sierra Leone. _Mastomys_ rodents breed very frequently, produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of West, Central, and East Africa. In addition, _Mastomys_ generally readily colonize human homes. Lassa fever may also spread through person-to-person contact. This type of transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with virus in the blood, tissue, secretions, or excretions of an individual infected with the Lassa virus.\n\nApproximately 15-20 percent of patients hospitalized for Lassa fever die from the illness. The death rates are particularly high for women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, and for fetuses, about 95 percent of which die in the uterus of infected pregnant mothers. However, overall only about one percent of infections with Lassa virus result in death. The antiviral ribavirin has been used with success in the treatment of Lassa fever patients.

The illness was discovered in 1969 when 2 missionary nurses died in Nigeria, West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. Lassa fever virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 percent.\n\nThe reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the \"multimammate rat\" of the genus _Mastomys_ (see image at http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fil:Mastomys_coucha.jpg.). It is not certain which species of _Mastomys_ are associated with Lassa; however, at least 2 species carry the virus in Sierra Leone. _Mastomys_ rodents breed very frequently, produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of West, Central, and East Africa. In addition, _Mastomys_ generally readily colonize human homes. Lassa fever may also spread through person-to-person contact. This type of transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with virus in the blood, tissue, secretions, or excretions of an individual infected with the Lassa virus.\n\nApproximately 15-20 percent of patients hospitalized for Lassa fever die from the illness. The death rates are particularly high for women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, and for fetuses, about 95 percent of which die in the uterus of infected pregnant mothers. However, overall only about one percent of infections with Lassa virus result in death. The antiviral ribavirin has been used with success in the treatment of Lassa fever patients.

The 3 victims including the deceased, the Weekly Trust learnt, were neighbours in Tudun Gwandara, an over-populated and one of the dirtiest sections of the metropolis.\n\nDr Ashiki told Weekly Trust that the 2 victims are still on admission at his hospital, and are \"doing very well.\" He expressed hope that with the medication they are receiving, they will be out of the hospital hale and hearty. He confirmed that one other person also contacted the virus, but added that \"he is not with us; he was not hospitalized here.\"\n\nEnquires by the Weekly Trust showed that the 3rd patient, a male, could not secure admission at the DASH because of inadequacy of beds, following which he was advised to proceed to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), in Keffi, about an hour and 40 minutes drive from Lafia. But sources said this hospital also did not have bed space for the patient, and had to advise him to seek medical attention elsewhere. He died eventually, shuttling between DASH and FMC.\n\nDr Emmanuel Akabe, State Commissioner for Health who confirmed the outbreak by telephone also informed the Weekly Trust that he has information that the 3rd victim died 3 days ago. He said the patient was first at DASH, but added that there was no bed space to accommodate him, following which the state hospital referred him to the Federal Government-owned health facility, in Keffi. The commissioner said reports available to him showed that the patient died 3 days ago, after he reached DASH, but refused to stay longer while arrangement for his bed was being made.\n\nJamilu Nagogo, head of the information unit at the FMC, confirmed that the patient was at the hospital for medical attention, just as he confirmed that he had no admission there because of lack of bed space.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The illness was discovered in 1969 when 2 missionary nurses died in Nigeria, West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. Lassa fever virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 percent.\n\nThe reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the \"multimammate rat\" of the genus _Mastomys_ (see image at http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fil:Mastomys_coucha.jpg.). It is not certain which species of _Mastomys_ are associated with Lassa; however, at least 2 species carry the virus in Sierra Leone. _Mastomys_ rodents breed very frequently, produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of West, Central, and East Africa. In addition, _Mastomys_ generally readily colonize human homes. Lassa fever may also spread through person-to-person contact. This type of transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with virus in the blood, tissue, secretions, or excretions of an individual infected with the Lassa virus.\n\nApproximately 15-20 percent of patients hospitalized for Lassa fever die from the illness. The death rates are particularly high for women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, and for fetuses, about 95 percent of which die in the uterus of infected pregnant mothers. However, overall only about one percent of infections with Lassa virus result in death. The antiviral ribavirin has been used with success in the treatment of Lassa fever patients. It is not stated in this report the nature of the treatment available in Nigerian hospitals.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive of Nigeria can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/50T5.

Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. This is the 1st recent report of Lassa fever in Taraba state. So far 2 other outbreaks of Lassa fever been reported in Rivers state and Ebonyi state, also in southern of Nigeria.\n\nAbout 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen and kidneys. Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the \"multimammate rat\". _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta.\n\nLassa fever occurs in all age groups and in both men and women. Persons at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where Mastomys are usually found, especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions. Health care workers are at risk if proper barrier nursing and infection control practices are not maintained. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and non-specific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult, especially early in the course of the disease. Lassa fever is difficult to distinguish from many other diseases which cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, yellow fever and other viral haemorrhagic fevers.

So far 2 other outbreaks of Lassa fever been reported in Rivers state and Ebonyi state, also in southern of Nigeria.\n\nAbout 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen and kidneys.

Persons at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where Mastomys are usually found, especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions.

The virus is spread through contact with rat urine or faeces and\nlater between humans through contact with bodily secretions.\n\nTwo people died in October [2010] in Makeni, including a woman (who ran a\nrestaurant selling rat meat) and her 6 year old son.\n\nOf the 153 cases recorded nationwide in the 1st 10 months of the year, 48\npeople have died, according to health officials.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nThomas James Allen\n<tjallen@pipeline.com>\n\n[This report records another fatal case of Lassa fever in the vicinity of\nthe village of Makeni in northern Sierra Leone.

More than 51 million Nigerians\nare at risk, with the annual number of illnesses estimated at 3\nmillion and with the number of deaths estimated at about 58 330.\n\nThis disclosure came as the Guild of Medical Directors yesterday [18\nMar 2009] in Abuja demanded an adequate supply of Ribavirin (the\nantiviral drug for the treatment of Lassa fever) in the Federal\nCapital Territory (FCT) and its environs. Chief Medical Director of\nthe Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Irrua Edo State, Prof. George\nAkpede, made the disclosure yesterday on the occasion of the\ncommissioning of the Lassa Fever Diagnostic and Research Laboratory,\nInstitute of Lassa Fever Research and Control at the Irrua\nSpecialists Teaching Hospital, Irrua, Edo State. He said the Lassa\nfever epidemic was no longer limited to some states as it was thought\nbut had assumed virtually a country-wide dimension.\n\nThe outbreak of Lassa fever has been confirmed in the FCT and its\nenvirons, and out of the 12 cases reported since February [2009], 5\npatients have died.\n\nMeanwhile, in a presentation on Lassa fever during the monthly\nmeeting of the Abuja Chapter of the Guild, the National President, Dr\nCharles Cudjoe, called for more rapid diagnostic test centres for\nLassa fever. \"The Guild did a survey at the outbreak of this disease,\nand, disturbingly, we discovered that there was not enough Ribavirin.\nWe discovered that the drug that is in stock in some pharmaceutical\nstores would expire this month [March 2009]. That is a bit of a\nproblem, because we need to tackle this as quickly as possible. All\nhands must be on deck to import these drugs from the companies that\nmake them. Even if the epidemic does not expand, we should be able to\nhandle the few cases that come in,\" he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) discovered that a pack of 45 tablets\nof Ribavirin 400 mg is sold for 115 pounds sterling [USD 167] in the\nUK, while 84 tablets of the same drug went for 274 pounds sterling\n[USD 398]. A survey had shown that Roche and Swipha are the 2\ncompanies that manufacture this drug. In Abuja, 45 tablets of\nRibavirin 400 mg went for Naira 25 000 [USD 169] for a stock that is\ndue to expire this month [March 2009], while the cost for the same\ndrug with a later expiration date is about Naira 120 000 [USD 807].\nCudjoe expressed reservation over the handling of the epidemic that\nwas 1st discovered in the town of Lassa in Borno.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur A-Lan Banks\n\n[Since January 2008, Lassa fever virus infection has affected more\nthan 390 people and been responsible for 55 deaths in Nigeria. Since\nFebruary 2009, there have been 12 additional cases and 5 deaths in\nthe proximity of the Federal Capital Territory. From these figures,\nit is difficult to predict the future course of the epidemic.\n\nRibavirin is an anti-viral drug indicated for severe respiratory\nsyncytial virus infections (individually), hepatitis C infection\n(used in conjunction with peginterferon alfa-2b) and other viral\ninfections. It has been used successfully in hospitals in the\ntreatment of Lassa fever virus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug,\nwhich, when metabolized, resembles purine RNA nucleotides. In this\nform, it interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral\nreplication. How it exactly affects viral replication is unknown.\nMultiple mechanisms may be responsible for its actions. The primary\nobserved serious adverse side-effect of Ribavirin is hemolytic\nanemia. Ribavirin is also a teratogen in some animal species and thus\nposes a theoretical reproductive risk in humans, remaining a hazard\nas long as the drug is present, which can be as long as 6 months\nafter a course of the drug has ended (see:\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin>).\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Nigeria is available at\n<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?v=9.6,6.1,6>.\n- Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - Nigeria (06) 20090309.0981\nLassa fever - Nigeria (05) 20090308.0971\nLassa fever - Nigeria (04): control 20090306.0937\nLassa fever - Nigeria (03) 20090305.0913\nLassa fever - Nigeria (02) 20090225.0788\nLassa fever - Nigeria 20090218.0669\nLassa fever - UK ex Nigeria (03): fatal 20090130.0414\nLassa fever - UK ex Nigeria (02) 20090124.0308\nLassa fever - UK ex Nigeria 20090123.0296\n2008\n----\nLassa fever - Nigeria (02) 20080611.1847\nLassa fever - Nigeria: (Ebonyi) 20080323.1100\n2007\n----\nLassa fever - Nigeria 20071205.3925\n..........................................cp/msp/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

More than 51 million Nigerians\nare at risk, with the annual number of illnesses estimated at 3\nmillion and with the number of deaths estimated at about 58 330.\n\nThis disclosure came as the Guild of Medical Directors yesterday [18\nMar 2009] in Abuja demanded an adequate supply of Ribavirin (the\nantiviral drug for the treatment of Lassa fever) in the Federal\nCapital Territory (FCT) and its environs. Chief Medical Director of\nthe Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Irrua Edo State, Prof. George\nAkpede, made the disclosure yesterday on the occasion of the\ncommissioning of the Lassa Fever Diagnostic and Research Laboratory,\nInstitute of Lassa Fever Research and Control at the Irrua\nSpecialists Teaching Hospital, Irrua, Edo State. He said the Lassa\nfever epidemic was no longer limited to some states as it was thought\nbut had assumed virtually a country-wide dimension.\n\nThe outbreak of Lassa fever has been confirmed in the FCT and its\nenvirons, and out of the 12 cases reported since February [2009], 5\npatients have died.\n\nMeanwhile, in a presentation on Lassa fever during the monthly\nmeeting of the Abuja Chapter of the Guild, the National President, Dr\nCharles Cudjoe, called for more rapid diagnostic test centres for\nLassa fever. \"The Guild did a survey at the outbreak of this disease,\nand, disturbingly, we discovered that there was not enough Ribavirin.\nWe discovered that the drug that is in stock in some pharmaceutical\nstores would expire this month [March 2009]. That is a bit of a\nproblem, because we need to tackle this as quickly as possible. All\nhands must be on deck to import these drugs from the companies that\nmake them. Even if the epidemic does not expand, we should be able to\nhandle the few cases that come in,\" he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) discovered that a pack of 45 tablets\nof Ribavirin 400 mg is sold for 115 pounds sterling [USD 167] in the\nUK, while 84 tablets of the same drug went for 274 pounds sterling\n[USD 398]. A survey had shown that Roche and Swipha are the 2\ncompanies that manufacture this drug. In Abuja, 45 tablets of\nRibavirin 400 mg went for Naira 25 000 [USD 169] for a stock that is\ndue to expire this month [March 2009], while the cost for the same\ndrug with a later expiration date is about Naira 120 000 [USD 807].\nCudjoe expressed reservation over the handling of the epidemic that\nwas 1st discovered in the town of Lassa in Borno.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur A-Lan Banks\n\n[Since January 2008, Lassa fever virus infection has affected more\nthan 390 people and been responsible for 55 deaths in Nigeria.

From these figures,\nit is difficult to predict the future course of the epidemic.\n\nRibavirin is an anti-viral drug indicated for severe respiratory\nsyncytial virus infections (individually), hepatitis C infection\n(used in conjunction with peginterferon alfa-2b) and other viral\ninfections. It has been used successfully in hospitals in the\ntreatment of Lassa fever virus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug,\nwhich, when metabolized, resembles purine RNA nucleotides. In this\nform, it interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral\nreplication. How it exactly affects viral replication is unknown.\nMultiple mechanisms may be responsible for its actions. The primary\nobserved serious adverse side-effect of Ribavirin is hemolytic\nanemia. Ribavirin is also a teratogen in some animal species and thus\nposes a theoretical reproductive risk in humans, remaining a hazard\nas long as the drug is present, which can be as long as 6 months\nafter a course of the drug has ended (see:\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin>).\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Nigeria is available at\n<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?v=9.6,6.1,6>.\n- Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nLassa fever - Nigeria (06) 20090309.0981\nLassa fever - Nigeria (05) 20090308.0971\nLassa fever - Nigeria (04): control 20090306.0937\nLassa fever - Nigeria (03) 20090305.0913\nLassa fever - Nigeria (02) 20090225.0788\nLassa fever - Nigeria 20090218.0669\nLassa fever - UK ex Nigeria (03): fatal 20090130.0414\nLassa fever - UK ex Nigeria (02) 20090124.0308\nLassa fever - UK ex Nigeria 20090123.0296\n2008\n----\nLassa fever - Nigeria (02) 20080611.1847\nLassa fever - Nigeria: (Ebonyi) 20080323.1100\n2007\n----\nLassa fever - Nigeria 20071205.3925\n..........................................cp/msp/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

He, however, disclosed that some\ndrastic measures were under way as the Irrua Specialist Teaching\nHospital had entered into partnerships with Behard-Notch Institute of\nTropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany, and Harvard University, USA for\ncollaboration in Lassa fever research and control efforts. Part of\nthe collaboration, according to him, had resulted in the donation of\ndiagnostic facilities for the confirmation of the disease in the\nhospital without samples having to be sent out of the country any longer.\n\nIn his contribution, [the] member representing Esan Central/Esan\nWest/Igueben Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives,\nMr. Patrick Ikhariale, also expressed concern over the spread of the\nLassa fever epidemic nation-wide and called for urgent control\nmeasures at the national level. Ikhariale assured that he would draw\nthe attention of the National Assembly to the menace posed by the\ndisease to millions of Nigerians.\n\n[Byline: Adibe Emenyonu]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur A-Lan Banks\n\n[Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease, whereby humans become infected\nfrom contact with infected animals. The animal reservoirs of Lassa\nvirus are rodents of the genus _Mastomys_, the \"multimammate rat.\"\nLassa virus-infected animals do not become ill, but they can shed the\nvirus in their urine and faeces. (A photograph of a multimammate rat\ncan be accessed at\n<http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p145/hawthornrats/other%20pets/multis/DSCF4892.jpg>).\n\nIn humans Lassa viral haemorrhagic fever is an acute illness of 1-4\nweeks duration that occurs in West Africa. The virus is a\nsingle-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family\n_Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea\n(Conakry), Liberia, Sierra Leone, and parts of Nigeria, but probably\nexists in other West African countries as well.\n\nAbout 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining\ncases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects\nseveral organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys.\nThe incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. It has\nbeen estimated that about 300 000 to 500 000 cases of Lassa fever and\n5000 deaths occur yearly across West Africa. The overall\ncase-fatality rate is 1 percent, and up to 15 percent among\nhospitalized patients.\n\nThe disease is especially severe late in pregnancy, with maternal\ndeath and/or fetal loss occurring in greater than 80 percent of cases\nduring the 3rd trimester.\n\nHumans usually become infected with Lassa virus from exposure to\nexcreta of infected _Mastomys_.

Torres <torresjaime@cantv.net>\nSource: EFE Salud [translated from Spanish by Mod.TY; edited]\n<http://www.efe.es/salud/principal.asp?opcion=14>\n\nBelgian health authorities issued a preventive call to the passengers arriving\nin Brussels from Sierra Leone on 11 Jul [2006], or who flew on the morning of\nthat day to Frankfurt, Germany. Information from Germany indicated that a\nLassa fever case traveled that route.\nBelgian health authorities were informed last night [21 Jul 2006] that a\nperson hospitalized in Germany arrived in Brussels that day [21 Jul 2006] in a\nBrussels Airlines flight coming from Freetown, [Sierra Leone], where [the\npassenger] contracted Lassa fever, a hemorrhagic viral fever, per the analysis\nthat was provided.\nThe patient, who arrived in Brussels a 03:35 GMT, took a flight to Frankfurt\nwith the same company at 04:30 GMT, according to the radio station Bel-RTL.\ufffd\nHealth authorities [Belgian?] who made the announcement concerning the case\nrequest that passengers on those 2 flights contact the Ambres University\nHospital.\nLassa fever, which takes its name from the region in Nigeria where the first\ncase appeared in 1969, is very contagious and can be fatal. Lassa fever virus\nis transmitted in blood, urine, saliva, and respiratory secretions, although\nthe patient did not manifest this [respiratory symptoms] during the trip from\nFreetown to Frankfurt, according to the communication.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Fortunately, the risk of aerosolized Lassa fever virus transmission via the\nrespiratory route is extremely low.\nThere have been sporadic cases of rodent reservoir-to-human transmission in\nWest Africa. Human-to-human Lassa fever virus transmission has been mainly a\nhospital problem when medical staff, other patient care-givers, and persons\n(especially family members) in intimate contact with Lassa fever patients have\nbeen directly exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, usually in the absence\nof barrier nursing. Early in the initial Nigerian epidemic, a nurse infected\nand ill with Lassa fever virus traveled from Nigeria to New York by air\nwithout transmission of the virus to other passengers or the airline crew. In\nstudies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, there was no evidence of Lassa fever\nvirus transmission to airline passengers traveling with confirmed Lassa fever\ncases (1). Similarly, in 2004, 19 passengers on a flight from London to\nNewark, New Jersey, USA, with a Lassa fever virus-infected man returning from\nLiberia, were considered at low risk of exposure, and none became infected\nwith the virus -- see ProMED ref. below. While awareness is indicated, care\nshould be taken not to engender fear among the passengers.\nReference:\n1. Galbraith NS, Berrie JRH, Forbes P, Young S.

Lassa virus\nbelongs to the old world group of arenaviruses. Like all arenaviruses these\nviruses cause persistent infections of rodents (_Mastomys_ sp. in the case\nof Lassa virus) usually without obvious signs of disease. Humans and other\nanimals are infected through contact with rodent excreta, particularly\nurine. Cases of Lassa fever are limited to West Africa and have been\nreported most frequently from Sierra Leone, and to a lesser extent from\nNigeria, Liberia, and Guinea. In endemic areas of rural West Africa\nsubclinical infection is common, but occasional outbreaks with high\nmortality rates have been recorded. There is also risk of transmission of\ndisease when unrecognized Lassa fever cases are imported into non-endemic\nregions for treatment of haemorrhagic disease.

Lassa fever guidelines for prevention and case\nmanagement developed by WHO and the NGO MERLIN have been widely\ndistributed.\nContrary to newspaper reports, there have been no confirmed cases in IDP\ncamps.
