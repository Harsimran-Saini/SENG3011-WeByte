But yesterday [23 Apr 2005], the number of\nconfirmed cases increased to 32, with 200 suspected cases also reported to\nthe health authority.\n\nThe children and adults are believed to have become infected with the bug\nwhile petting and hand-feeding newborn lambs in a barn at the center. The\nlambs have already been removed from the park as a precautionary measure. A\nspokesman for NHS Tayside said yesterday [23 Apr 2005]: \"There are now 32\nconfirmed cases, although we expect that number to continue to rise. A\nfurther 200 people who visited Auchingarrich have reported becoming ill\nwith symptoms consistent with cryptosporidium infection. It is very\nimportant to stress, however, that these are not confirmed cases, and\nfurther investigations are ongoing, and it is unlikely that all will have\nbeen infected. Laboratory tests are continuing, and we hope to give a\nfurther update early next week.\" He added: \"There is only one child still\nin hospital, but no one is seriously ill.\" The spokesman said the center\nwould remain open. He explained: \"The view of the incident control team is\nthat the center has voluntarily suspended animal petting, and the facility\nwhere that happened has been closed. The bales of hay within it have been\nburned, and it has been disinfected. Our view at the moment is that the\nrisk to the public has been removed, although we have to remind people\nagain and again to please wash their hands after they have been out in a\nrural setting and have been in contact with animals or their environment.\nIt is absolutely vital to observe good hygiene.\"\n\nCryptosporidium is a parasite which is commonly found in animal intestines.\nIt can cause diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps and a slight fever. Members\nof the outbreak control team from NHS Tayside and officials from Perth and\nKinross Council's environmental health service are continuing an\ninvestigation into the outbreak. Scotland's largest cryptosporidium\noutbreak of recent times was in Glasgow in 1998 when more than 300 people\nwere confirmed as having been affected by the stomach bug.\n\n[byline: Frank Urquhart]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail reported in October 2003 that more than 200 cases had been\nreported from Scotland since March that year. As stressed in this message,\nnot all cases with gastrointestinal symptoms have been diagnosed with\ncryptosporidium infection.\n\nCryptosporidium is typically an intestinal parasite of calves, not lambs,\nand contact with animals may not be a particular risk factor, except when\nthe animal has diarrhea at the time of contact. Other infections may also\nbe possible, like Vero-toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (VTEC), for which\ncontact with animals is a well recognized risk factor. - Mod.EP]\nSee Also\n2003\n---\nCryptosporidiosis - UK (Scotland): background 20031015.2595\nCryptosporidiosis - UK (Scotland) 20031014.2591\nCryptosporidiosis, swimming pool - Spain (Majorca) (02) 20030806.1935\nCryptosporidiosis - Spain: background 20030802.1894\nCryptosporidiosis, swimming pool - Spain (Majorca) 20030730.1869\nCryptosporidiosis, swimming pool - Spain (Majorca) 20030730.1869\n2002\n---\nCryptosporidiosis, water supply - UK (Scotland) (03) 20020808.4995\nCryptosporidiosis, water supply - UK (Scotland) (02) 20020806.4957\nCryptosporidiosis, water supply - UK (Scotland) 20020314.3743\n2000\n---\nCryptosporidiosis - UK (Scotland) 20000605.0903\nCryptosporidiosis, human ex sheep - UK (England) 20000419.0569\n1999\n---\nCryptosporidiosis, swimming pools - UK (England) 19991125.2087\nCryptosporidiosis - UK (NW England) 19990514.0788\n1998\n---\nCryptosporidiosis - UK (04) 19980520.0963\nCryptosporidiosis - UK 19980510.0927\n\n..........................ep/msp/sh\n\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The majority are associated with\none hotel, but there are a few cases associated with other hotels and with\nno history of having visited the main outbreak hotel. 2 possibilities that\nneed to be considered are contamination of the drinking water supply or\ncontamination of a water theme park used as a popular excursion venue.\nReports are being received of a small number of cases associated with other\nresorts in Mallorca and Menorca.\n\n[Prof. Cartwright has provided information on management of swimming pools\nprovided below. - Mod.MPP]\nThe management of swimming pools associated with Cryptosporidiosis or\ncontaminated by Cryptosporidium oocysts; Pilot Guidance for the U.K.\nFederation of Tour Operators Prepared by Prof. Rodney Cartwright August 2003\nThese notes have been prepared for guidance on the actions to be taken when\ncryptosporidium infection is associated with a swimming pool. They do not\ncover action for prevention of contamination such as a faecal accident\npolicy. Many of the procedures recommended should be undertaken only by an\noperative with the appropriate training. The use of high chlorine levels\nis hazardous and the appropriate health and safety precautions must be\nfollowed.\n1. I am unaware of any published procedure for the decontamination of a\nswimming pool contaminated with cryptosporidium oocysts. There are no\npublished studies on the efficacy of any procedures on the disinfection of\nswimming pools against cryptosporidium, although there is anecdotal\nevidence that certain actions have been associated with the cessation of\nfurther cases of cryptosporidiosis.\n2. There are recommendations for a response to a faecal accident. US\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention in their weekly publication\n(MMWR) of 25 May 2001 includes advice for contamination by a liquid stool.\na. Raise the free available chlorine concentration to 20 mg/L and maintain\nthe pH between 7.2 and 7.5. Ensure this concentration is found throughout\nall co-circulating pools by sampling at least 3 widely spaced locations\naway from return water outlets. This chlorine and pH level should be\nsufficient to inactivate Cryptosporidium and should be maintained for at\nleast 8 hours, equivalent to a CT inactivation value of 9600. A higher or\nlower free available chlorine level/inactivation time can be used as long\nas a CT inactivation value equalling 9600 is maintained for Cryptosporidium\ninactivation. State or local regulators may require higher free available\nchlorine levels in the presence of chlorine stabilizers such as chlorinated\nisocyanurates. If necessary, consult an aquatics professional to determine\nand identify the feasibility, practical methods, and safety considerations\nbefore attempting the hyperchlorination of any pool.\nb. Ensure that the filtration system is operating while the pool reaches\nand maintains the proper free available chlorine concentration during\ndisinfection.\nc. Backwash the filter thoroughly after reaching the CT value. Be sure the\neffluent is discharged directly to waste and in accordance with state or\nlocal regulations. Do not return the backwash through the filter. Where\nappropriate, replace the filter media.\nd. Swimmers may be allowed into the pool after the required CT value has\nbeen achieved and the free available chlorine level has been returned to\nthe normal operating range allowed by the state or local regulatory\nauthority. Maintain the free available chlorine concentration and pH at\nstandard operating levels based on state or local regulations. If\nnecessary, consult state or local regulatory authorities for\nrecommendations on bringing the free available chlorine levels back to an\nacceptable operating range.\nThis guidance assumes a correctly installed and maintained water treatment\nsystem.\n3. The UK Pool Water Treatment Advisory Group (PWTAG) Swimming Pool Water\n-treatment and Quality Standards (1999) following a faecal accident where\nthere is a possibility of cryptosporidium contamination it states and\nrecommends that:\nThe appropriate procedure relies on the fact that the cysts are, in\nprinciple, large enough to be filtered out.\n- The pool is cleared of people immediately.\n- Disinfectant levels are maintained at the top of the recommended range.\n- The pool is vacuumed and swept.\n- Using a coagulant, the water is filtered for 6 turnover cycles (which\ncould well take up to a day, and so might mean closing the pool until the\nnext day).\n- The filter is backwashed.\n- The pool can then be reopened.\nClearly this is a fairly drastic course of action that any pool operator\nwould want to avoid if possible. But if there is a good reason to suspect\nthat Cryptosporidium or Giardia is responsible (certainly if the person\ninvolved has had diarrhoea for some days), it would be the safest\nprocedure.

The local consultant in communicable disease control (CCDC)\nshould be notified. A copy of such emergency measures can usefully be\nincluded in the operation and maintenance manual.\n4. In the PWTAG technical guidance note of February 2001 on Cryptosporidium\nconcentrates on coagulation and filtration but does not deal directly with\ndecontamination of a known contaminated pool. They mention chlorine at a\nlevel of 30mg/L for 4 hours as being necessary to kill cryptosporidium\noocysts but make no recommendations on the use of chlorine. Further\ndetailed advice is given on the use of coagulants and filters.\n5. In the UK there is concern on relying on high chlorine levels alone as a\nmeans of disinfection because\na. There are no published data on the effect of chlorine on cryptosporidium\noocysts in a swimming pool. It is understood that the studies that have\nbeen undertaken are in a laboratory setting.\nb. Chlorine is inactivated by organic material and there may be high levels\nof such material in parts of a pool and especially in filters.\nc. It would be necessary for the chlorine to be evenly distributed\nthroughout the pool.\nd. For chlorine to be effective the pH must be carefully controlled (CDC\nrecommend 7.2 - 7.5)\ne. Other chemicals may interfere with the action of the chlorine.\n6. Concerns with filtration include\na. The need for the filters to be operated at the correct pressure and\nwater flow. The optimum operating conditions should be provided by the\nfilter suppliers\nb. The use of sand of the correct particle size in the filters.\nc. Proper maintenance and back washing of the filters.\nd. The time taken for all the pool water to be filtered. Water equivalent\nto the pool volume may pass through in a given time, but the structure of\nthe pool may be such that all the water has not passed through. That is\nthere may be areas of poor circulation in the pool.\n7. Water can be tested for the presence of cryptosporidium\noocysts. Normally 10L grab samples are tested but larger volumes can be\nexamined by the use of a cartridge filter. The volume of water and\ncollection method should be discussed with the test laboratory. Before\nconsidering the appropriate action, an understanding of the water test\nresults is necessary so that misunderstandings do not occur.\na. Cryptosporidium oocysts are not evenly distributed in the\nwater. Therefore the numbers in a sample do not on their own have any\nsignificance. If oocysts are present, that water is contaminated and poses\na potential risk to bathers.\nb. The absence of oocysts in a sample does not mean that there are no\noocysts elsewhere in the pool that could be a hazard to bathers.\nc. All laboratory tests should be undertaken in a laboratory with\naccreditation for cryptosporidium testing in water. The test method should\nbe based on the US EPA Analytical Method 1662 \"Cryptosporidium in Water by\nFiltraion/IMS/FA\"\nd. The tests undertaken do not distinguish between live and dead\noocysts. As a rule of thumb they should all be regarded as alive and\npotentially infectious.\ne. If a suspect pool has negative test results for oocysts, further samples\n-- including a backwash and a sample of sand from the top 30cm of the\nfilter -- should be examined.\nf. Examining the deposit from the pump strainer is also worth considering.\n8.

But if there is a good reason to suspect\nthat Cryptosporidium or Giardia is responsible (certainly if the person\ninvolved has had diarrhoea for some days), it would be the safest\nprocedure. The local consultant in communicable disease control (CCDC)\nshould be notified. A copy of such emergency measures can usefully be\nincluded in the operation and maintenance manual.\n4.

Other chemicals may interfere with the action of the chlorine.\n6. Concerns with filtration include\na. The need for the filters to be operated at the correct pressure and\nwater flow. The optimum operating conditions should be provided by the\nfilter suppliers\nb. The use of sand of the correct particle size in the filters.\nc. Proper maintenance and back washing of the filters.\nd. The time taken for all the pool water to be filtered. Water equivalent\nto the pool volume may pass through in a given time, but the structure of\nthe pool may be such that all the water has not passed through. That is\nthere may be areas of poor circulation in the pool.\n7. Water can be tested for the presence of cryptosporidium\noocysts. Normally 10L grab samples are tested but larger volumes can be\nexamined by the use of a cartridge filter. The volume of water and\ncollection method should be discussed with the test laboratory.

The majority are associated with\none hotel, but there are a few cases associated with other hotels and with\nno history of having visited the main outbreak hotel. 2 possibilities that\nneed to be considered are contamination of the drinking water supply or\ncontamination of a water theme park used as a popular excursion venue.\nReports are being received of a small number of cases associated with other\nresorts in Mallorca and Menorca.\n\n[Prof. Cartwright has provided information on management of swimming pools\nprovided below. - Mod.MPP]\nThe management of swimming pools associated with Cryptosporidiosis or\ncontaminated by Cryptosporidium oocysts; Pilot Guidance for the U.K.\nFederation of Tour Operators Prepared by Prof. Rodney Cartwright August 2003\nThese notes have been prepared for guidance on the actions to be taken when\ncryptosporidium infection is associated with a swimming pool. They do not\ncover action for prevention of contamination such as a faecal accident\npolicy. Many of the procedures recommended should be undertaken only by an\noperative with the appropriate training. The use of high chlorine levels\nis hazardous and the appropriate health and safety precautions must be\nfollowed.\n1. I am unaware of any published procedure for the decontamination of a\nswimming pool contaminated with cryptosporidium oocysts. There are no\npublished studies on the efficacy of any procedures on the disinfection of\nswimming pools against cryptosporidium, although there is anecdotal\nevidence that certain actions have been associated with the cessation of\nfurther cases of cryptosporidiosis.\n2. There are recommendations for a response to a faecal accident. US\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention in their weekly publication\n(MMWR) of 25 May 2001 includes advice for contamination by a liquid stool.\na. Raise the free available chlorine concentration to 20 mg/L and maintain\nthe pH between 7.2 and 7.5. Ensure this concentration is found throughout\nall co-circulating pools by sampling at least 3 widely spaced locations\naway from return water outlets. This chlorine and pH level should be\nsufficient to inactivate Cryptosporidium and should be maintained for at\nleast 8 hours, equivalent to a CT inactivation value of 9600. A higher or\nlower free available chlorine level/inactivation time can be used as long\nas a CT inactivation value equalling 9600 is maintained for Cryptosporidium\ninactivation. State or local regulators may require higher free available\nchlorine levels in the presence of chlorine stabilizers such as chlorinated\nisocyanurates. If necessary, consult an aquatics professional to determine\nand identify the feasibility, practical methods, and safety considerations\nbefore attempting the hyperchlorination of any pool.\nb. Ensure that the filtration system is operating while the pool reaches\nand maintains the proper free available chlorine concentration during\ndisinfection.\nc. Backwash the filter thoroughly after reaching the CT value. Be sure the\neffluent is discharged directly to waste and in accordance with state or\nlocal regulations. Do not return the backwash through the filter. Where\nappropriate, replace the filter media.\nd. Swimmers may be allowed into the pool after the required CT value has\nbeen achieved and the free available chlorine level has been returned to\nthe normal operating range allowed by the state or local regulatory\nauthority. Maintain the free available chlorine concentration and pH at\nstandard operating levels based on state or local regulations.

Reports of\ncryptosporidiosis in Scotland usually peak in late March and April, but few\nof the recent 120 cases are included in the national total of 168 cases\nreported to the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health\n(SCIEH) in the first 18 weeks of 1998. The true total to date is likely to\nbe 200-250, considerably higher than the total of 144 for the first 18 weeks\nof 1997. Between 600 and 900 cases have been reported in each of the past\neight years. Cryptosporidiosis is a protozoal infection that causes profuse\nwatery diarrhoea and abdominal pain, sometimes with anorexia, vomiting, and\nfever. Infection may be asymptomatic, but the disease can be life\nthreatening in immunocompromised patients.\nConsultants in public health medicine from central Scotland, relevant water\nauthorities, the Scottish Parasite Reference Laboratory, SCIEH, and the\nScottish Office met on 1 May to consider the situation. Most of the recent\ncases of cryptosporidiosis are children, but all age groups are represented.\nA few patients have been admitted to hospital, including two elderly women.\nA substantial proportion of the cases are thought to be due to animal\ncontact, particularly at 'petting farms' or animal markets, where children\nare encouraged to handle young animals. Cases are known to have consumed\npotable water from several different public water supplies, and routine\nwater monitoring has shown no deviation from baseline levels. Risk factors\namong individual cases are being investigated more closely. It seems likely\nthat several factors have contributed to this outbreak.\nPress statements have emphasised the need for careful hygiene when handling\nfarm animals or sick pets and to prevent spread from person to person, and\nhave advised against the consumption of untreated water from any source.\nPeople in the UK with impaired immunity (for example, patients with AIDS or\non renal dialysis) have already been advised not to drink unboiled water\nfrom any source (1), and only water that has been boiled previously should\nbe given to babies to drink or used to reconstitute their feeds. Water\nsupplies are being monitored more closely, local health professionals have\nbeen advised, and farmers and teachers are being sent information on health\nand safety at open farms.\nReference:\n1.Department of the Environment and Department of Health.

Reports of\ncryptosporidiosis in Scotland usually peak in late March and April, but few\nof the recent 120 cases are included in the national total of 168 cases\nreported to the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health\n(SCIEH) in the first 18 weeks of 1998. The true total to date is likely to\nbe 200-250, considerably higher than the total of 144 for the first 18 weeks\nof 1997. Between 600 and 900 cases have been reported in each of the past\neight years. Cryptosporidiosis is a protozoal infection that causes profuse\nwatery diarrhoea and abdominal pain, sometimes with anorexia, vomiting, and\nfever. Infection may be asymptomatic, but the disease can be life\nthreatening in immunocompromised patients.\nConsultants in public health medicine from central Scotland, relevant water\nauthorities, the Scottish Parasite Reference Laboratory, SCIEH, and the\nScottish Office met on 1 May to consider the situation. Most of the recent\ncases of cryptosporidiosis are children, but all age groups are represented.\nA few patients have been admitted to hospital, including two elderly women.\nA substantial proportion of the cases are thought to be due to animal\ncontact, particularly at 'petting farms' or animal markets, where children\nare encouraged to handle young animals. Cases are known to have consumed\npotable water from several different public water supplies, and routine\nwater monitoring has shown no deviation from baseline levels. Risk factors\namong individual cases are being investigated more closely. It seems likely\nthat several factors have contributed to this outbreak.\nPress statements have emphasised the need for careful hygiene when handling\nfarm animals or sick pets and to prevent spread from person to person, and\nhave advised against the consumption of untreated water from any source.\nPeople in the UK with impaired immunity (for example, patients with AIDS or\non renal dialysis) have already been advised not to drink unboiled water\nfrom any source (1), and only water that has been boiled previously should\nbe given to babies to drink or used to reconstitute their feeds. Water\nsupplies are being monitored more closely, local health professionals have\nbeen advised, and farmers and teachers are being sent information on health\nand safety at open farms.\nReference:\n1.Department of the Environment and Department of Health.

Reports of\ncryptosporidiosis in Scotland usually peak in late March and April, but few\nof the recent 120 cases are included in the national total of 168 cases\nreported to the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health\n(SCIEH) in the first 18 weeks of 1998. The true total to date is likely to\nbe 200-250, considerably higher than the total of 144 for the first 18 weeks\nof 1997. Between 600 and 900 cases have been reported in each of the past\neight years. Cryptosporidiosis is a protozoal infection that causes profuse\nwatery diarrhoea and abdominal pain, sometimes with anorexia, vomiting, and\nfever. Infection may be asymptomatic, but the disease can be life\nthreatening in immunocompromised patients.\nConsultants in public health medicine from central Scotland, relevant water\nauthorities, the Scottish Parasite Reference Laboratory, SCIEH, and the\nScottish Office met on 1 May to consider the situation. Most of the recent\ncases of cryptosporidiosis are children, but all age groups are represented.\nA few patients have been admitted to hospital, including two elderly women.\nA substantial proportion of the cases are thought to be due to animal\ncontact, particularly at 'petting farms' or animal markets, where children\nare encouraged to handle young animals. Cases are known to have consumed\npotable water from several different public water supplies, and routine\nwater monitoring has shown no deviation from baseline levels. Risk factors\namong individual cases are being investigated more closely. It seems likely\nthat several factors have contributed to this outbreak.\nPress statements have emphasised the need for careful hygiene when handling\nfarm animals or sick pets and to prevent spread from person to person, and\nhave advised against the consumption of untreated water from any source.\nPeople in the UK with impaired immunity (for example, patients with AIDS or\non renal dialysis) have already been advised not to drink unboiled water\nfrom any source (1), and only water that has been boiled previously should\nbe given to babies to drink or used to reconstitute their feeds. Water\nsupplies are being monitored more closely, local health professionals have\nbeen advised, and farmers and teachers are being sent information on health\nand safety at open farms.\nReference:\n1.Department of the Environment and Department of Health.

Reports of\ncryptosporidiosis in Scotland usually peak in late March and April, but few\nof the recent 120 cases are included in the national total of 168 cases\nreported to the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health\n(SCIEH) in the first 18 weeks of 1998. The true total to date is likely to\nbe 200-250, considerably higher than the total of 144 for the first 18 weeks\nof 1997. Between 600 and 900 cases have been reported in each of the past\neight years. Cryptosporidiosis is a protozoal infection that causes profuse\nwatery diarrhoea and abdominal pain, sometimes with anorexia, vomiting, and\nfever. Infection may be asymptomatic, but the disease can be life\nthreatening in immunocompromised patients.\nConsultants in public health medicine from central Scotland, relevant water\nauthorities, the Scottish Parasite Reference Laboratory, SCIEH, and the\nScottish Office met on 1 May to consider the situation. Most of the recent\ncases of cryptosporidiosis are children, but all age groups are represented.\nA few patients have been admitted to hospital, including two elderly women.\nA substantial proportion of the cases are thought to be due to animal\ncontact, particularly at 'petting farms' or animal markets, where children\nare encouraged to handle young animals. Cases are known to have consumed\npotable water from several different public water supplies, and routine\nwater monitoring has shown no deviation from baseline levels. Risk factors\namong individual cases are being investigated more closely. It seems likely\nthat several factors have contributed to this outbreak.\nPress statements have emphasised the need for careful hygiene when handling\nfarm animals or sick pets and to prevent spread from person to person, and\nhave advised against the consumption of untreated water from any source.\nPeople in the UK with impaired immunity (for example, patients with AIDS or\non renal dialysis) have already been advised not to drink unboiled water\nfrom any source (1), and only water that has been boiled previously should\nbe given to babies to drink or used to reconstitute their feeds. Water\nsupplies are being monitored more closely, local health professionals have\nbeen advised, and farmers and teachers are being sent information on health\nand safety at open farms.\nReference:\n1.Department of the Environment and Department of Health.

The water company\nissued a 'boil water' notice dated 2 March to 300 000 properties.\nA team has been set up to manage this incident. CDSC (Anglia and Oxford)\nis coordinating the epidemiological studies.\nThree clusters reported in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire since the\nmiddle of January 1997 have been investigated by local outbreak teams.\nNo common factors were identified among cases. The water supplies to the\nareas concerned are apparently distinct. Cryptosporidial oocysts were\nnot detected in any of the three water distribution systems supplying\nthe affected areas. The water companies rerouted supplies to two of the\naffected areas and introduced other precautionary measures.
