Evidence of vertical transmission of Zika virus in field-collected eggs of _Aedes aegypti_ in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nArboviruses are viruses transmitted to humans and other animals by the bite of hematophagous arthropods. Infections caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and the deadlier yellow fever virus (YFV) are current public health problems in several countries, mainly those located in tropical and subtropical regions. One of the main prevention strategies continues to be vector control, with the elimination of breeding sites and surveillance of infested areas. The use of ovitraps for _Aedes_ mosquitos monitoring has already demonstrated promising results, and maybe be also useful for arboviral surveillance.\n\nMethods\nThis work aimed to detect natural vertical transmission of arboviruses in _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Mosquito egg collection was carried out using ovitraps in Itacoatiara, a mid-size city in Amazonas state, Brazil. Collected eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae were tested for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA by RT-qPCR.\n\nResults\nA total of 2057 specimens (1793 _Ae. aegypti_ and 264 _Ae. albopictus_), in 154 larvae pools were processed. Results showed one positive pool for CHIKV and one positive pool for ZIKV. The active ZIKV infection was further confirmed by the detection of the negative-strand viral RNA and nucleotide sequencing which confirmed the Asian genotype. The Infection Rate per 1000 mosquitoes tested was assessed by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with 0.45 and 0.44 for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, and by Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) with 0.45 for both viruses.\n\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st detection of ZIKV in natural vertical transmission in the _Ae. aegypti_, a fact that may contribute to ZIKV maintenance in nature during epidemics periods. Furthermore, our results highlight that the use of ovitraps and the molecular detection of arbovirus may contribute to health surveillance, directing the efforts to more efficient transmission blockade.\n\nAuthor summary\nThe control of the vast majority of arbovirus infections relies on entomological measures to reduce mosquito infestation. Therefore, this study analyzed the use of ovitraps for arboviral surveillance in a mid-size city of the Amazonas state, Brazil. We found one larva pool infected with chikungunya virus, before the 1st human case confirmed in this municipality.

Recent outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Africa and Asia are driven by a variant carrying mutations associated with increased fitness for _Aedes aegypti_.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In 2016, a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak was reported in Mandera, Kenya. This was the 1st major CHIKV outbreak in the country since the global re-emergence of this virus, which arose as an initial outbreak in Kenya in 2004. Therefore, we collected samples and sequenced viral genomes from the 2016 Mandera outbreak.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: All Kenyan genomes contained 2 mutations, E1:K211E and E2:V264A, recently reported to have an association with increased infectivity, dissemination and transmission in the _Aedes aegypti_ vector. Phylogeographic inference of temporal and spatial virus relationships using Bayesian approaches showed that this _Ae. aegypti_ adapted strain emerged within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) lineage of CHIKV between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India. It was also in India where the 1st large outbreak caused by this strain appeared, in New Delhi, 2010. More importantly, our results also showed that this strain is no longer contained in India, and that it has more recently caused several major outbreaks of CHIKV, including the 2016 outbreaks in India, Pakistan and Kenya, and the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh. In addition to its capability to cause large outbreaks in different regions of the world, this CHIKV strain has the capacity to replace less adapted wild type strains in _Ae. aegypti_-rich regions. Indeed, all the latest full CHIKV genomes of the ECSA Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL), from the regions of high _Ae. aegypti_ prevalence, carry these 2 mutations, including samples collected in Japan, Australia, and China.\n\nConclusions/Significance: Our results point to the importance of continued genomic-based surveillance of this strain's global spread, and they prompt urgent vector competence studies in Asian and African countries, in order to assess the level of vector receptiveness, virus transmission, and the impact this might have on this strain's ability to cause major outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The authors make a good case for the need to assess chikungunya virus genomic variation and the relationship of these variants to _Aedes aegypti_ vector efficiency as they relate to the risk of outbreaks. Unfortunately, it is not easy to attract the resources necessary to do these kinds of studies in advance of a possible outbreak. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] _Aedes albopictus_ in Europe\nDate: Thu 19 Jul 2018\nSource: Eurosurveillance Volume 23, Issue 29 [edited]\nhttps://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.29.1800033\n\n\nHeitmann Anna, Jansen Stephanie, Luhken Renke, Helms Michelle, Pluskota Bjorn, Becker Norbert, Kuhn Carola, Schmidt-Chanasit Jonas, Tannich Egbert. Experimental risk assessment for chikungunya virus transmission based on vector competence, distribution and temperature suitability in Europe, 2018.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nOver the last decade, the abundant distribution of the Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ in southern Europe and the import of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) by infected travellers has resulted in at least 5 local outbreaks of chikungunya fever in France and Italy. Considering the ongoing spread of _Ae. albopictus_ to central Europe, we performed an analysis of the Europe-wide spatial risk of CHIKV transmission under different temperature conditions.\n\nMethods\n_Ae. albopictus_ specimens from Germany and Italy were orally infected with CHIKV from an outbreak in France and kept for 2 weeks at 18 C, 21 C or 24 C [64 F, 70 F or 75 F]. A salivation assay was conducted to detect infectious CHIKV.\n\nResults\nAnalyses of mosquito saliva for infectious virus particles demonstrated transmission rates (TRs) of\u2009over 35 percent. Highest TRs of 50 percent for the mosquito population from Germany were detected at 18 C, while the Italian population had highest TRs of 63 percent at 18 C and 21 C, respectively. Temperature data indicated a potential risk of CHIKV transmission for extended durations, i.e. sufficiently long time periods allowing extrinsic incubation of the virus. This was shown for areas already colonised by _Ae. albopictus_, as well as for large parts of central Europe that are not colonised.\n\nConclusion\nThe current risk of CHIKV transmission in Europe is not primarily restricted by temperature, which allows extrinsic incubation of the virus, but rather by the vector distribution. Accordingly, all European countries with established populations of _Ae. albopictus_ should implement respective entomological surveillance and monitoring systems, as basis for suitable control measures.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nand\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The 3 CHIKV outbreaks in France and 2 in Italy between 2007-2017 highlight the risk of autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Europe. This is a dynamic situation and can be expected to change as global warming is likely to extend the range of _Ae. albopictus_ northward into Europe. Interested readers are encouraged to access the full article with its table and maps. The risk map of CHIKV transmission is especially interesting.\n\nIn a related study the investigators compared the vector competence of an Italian population of _Aedes albopictus_ for 2 strains of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), with and without E1:A226V mutation, responsible for outbreaks in 2007 in the Emilia Romagna region and 2017 in the Lazio and Calabria regions, respectively. _Ae. albopictus_ showed similar vector competence for both viral strains, indicating that the E1:A226V mutation is not exclusively responsible for the ability of CHIKV to replicate well in this mosquito species.

The participants had produced antibodies to protect themselves against chikungunya 4 weeks after injections of its lead candidate vaccine.\n\n\"Up to 100 percent were protected after 2 vaccinations,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"We also had excellent safety observations.\"\n\nThemis makes the vaccine by modifying the measles vaccine Schwarz strain to express an antigen for chikungunya [virus]. The measles vaccine has been used in billions in people, so its safety and efficacy are well established.\n\nChikungunya [virus causes] a serious disease that causes joint pains and fever. Often resembling dengue fever in the initial stages, it is usually transmitted by mosquitoes from the _Aedes_ genus in tropical regions, but outbreaks have been recorded in Europe, such as in Italy last year [2017].\n\n\"The mosquito is now endemic in Southern Europe,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"Countries like Austria, France and Croatia can have outbreaks now.\"\n\nFurthermore, as globalization and climate change trends continue, Tauber told me that we will need more treatments for tropical diseases across the world. \"We are going to have more of the so-called tropical infections in the future than we have had in the past.\"\n\nAs there is currently no treatment or vaccine in the market for chikungunya. Themis' vaccine, if approved, would have the advantage of being 1st to market. Themis is planning to start a Phase III trial of the chikungunya treatment in early 2020.\n\nOther companies are also developing treatments for insect-borne diseases. Instead of vaccines, UK biotech Oxitec has released genetically engineered mosquitoes in Brazil that die out before they can pass on diseases. The Swiss company Humabs has an antibody treatment for Zika in preclinical development.\n\n[Byline: Jonathan Smith]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Vaccine fast tracked\nDate: Fri 4 May 2018\nSource: MD [edited]\nhttps://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/potential-chikungunya-virus-vaccine-designated-for-fda-fast-track\n\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to an investigative vaccine designed to prevent disease caused by chikungunya virus.\n\nPaxVax, an independent specialty vaccine company, is developing the prophylaxis. Chikungunya [virus causes] a disease which includes headache, muscle pain, skin rash, and severe joint pain that can persist for years and spreads through mosquito bites and can result in widespread outbreaks. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of infectious diseases transmitted from tick, flea, and mosquito bites to humans has more than tripled in the US in recent years.\n\nTrials for the PaxVax vaccine, which is a virus-like particle (VLP) treatment licensed from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently began enrolling for a 400-paitent phase 2B dose-finding study. A previous phase 2A study conducted by the NIAID's parent organization the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tested the vaccine's effects in participants.\n\nThe virus is arthropod-borne and shares a close relation to other viruses identified in Africa, South America, and Australia. It's a small, spherical RNA virus vectored by the daytime-biting _Aedes aegypti _mosquito, better known for transmitting Zika virus, yellow fever, and dengue viruses.\n\nChikungunya [virus infection] has only recently become a domestic issue. The 1st local transmission of the disease in the Americas was diagnosed in the Caribbean in late 2013, but it has since been identified in 45 countries in the Western hemisphere. The Pan American Health Organization has identified more than 1.7 million possible cases since the 1st identification. Residents of and travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, India, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America [have been infected].\n\nIndividuals at greater risk of serious complications due to the virus include infants, elderly people, and people with chronic medical conditions.\n\nIf clinical development progresses, the PaxVax vaccine could become the 1st approved by the FDA for the prevention of chikungunya [virus infection]. Eva Harris, PhD, director, Center for Global Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, said the field is in \"desperate need for a medical and public health intervention.\"\n\n\"It is exciting to see this vaccine candidate moving forward with Fast Track designation as this is an extremely debilitating disease with the potential for causing serious long-term sequelae,\" Harris said in a statement.\n\nLisa Danzig, MD, chief medical officer, ParVax, said the Fast Track designation is yet another positive step for the vaccine's development, as well as being a recognition of the unmet clinical need.\n\n\"This is another example of the capabilities of our technology platform and our steadfast commitment to developing specialty vaccines that protect against overlooked infectious diseases, as mosquito-borne diseases continue to increase due to air travel and warmer weather,\" Danzig said.\n\nResults of the phase 2B trial are expected to be finalized in early 2019.\n\n[Byline: Kevin Kunzmann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that the phase 2B trials elicit good immune responses for this vaccine and the one in the report above and will open the way for phase 3 trials and licensure of the vaccine.

Kim, Julie M. Fox, Sharmila Nair, Katherine Basore, William B. Klimstra, et al. Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\nAbstract\nArthritogenic alphaviruses comprise a group of enveloped RNA viruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease. The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screen to identify the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya, Ross River, Mayaro and O'nyong nyong viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced levels of viral infection of cells and, reciprocally, ectopic expression of these genes resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to chikungunya virus particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc fusion protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked chikungunya virus infection in multiple cell types, including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of chikungunya virus E2 protein, which are a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of the Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies to mice reduced chikungunya and O'nyong nyong virus infection as well as associated foot swelling. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[Knowing the cellular receptor may permit development of drugs or antibodies on a commercial scale that can block cell attachment by the virus. It will be interesting to see whether that blockage is as effective in animals, and eventually humans, as it is in cell cultures. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[8] New virus subgroup\nDate: Thu 10 May 2018\nSource: PLoS One [edited]\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196857\n\n\nSarah Keller White, Carla Mavian ,Marco Salemi, John Glenn Morris Jr., Maha A. Elbadry, Bernard A. Okech, et al. A new \"American\" subgroup of African-lineage Chikungunya virus detected in and isolated from mosquitoes collected in Haiti, 2016.\n\nAbstract\nAs part of on-going arboviral surveillance activity in a semi-rural region in Haiti, chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-positive mosquito pools were identified in 2014 (the peak of the Caribbean Asian-clade epidemic), and again in 2016 by RT-PCR. In 2014, CHIKV was only identified in _Aedes aegypti_ (11 positive pools/124 screened). In contrast, in sampling in 2016, CHIKV was not identified in _Ae. aegypti_, but, rather, in (a) a female _Aedes albopictus_ pool, and (b) a female _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pool. Genomic sequence analyses indicated that the CHIKV viruses in the 2016 mosquito pools were from the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage, rather than the Asian lineage. In phylogenetic studies, these ECSA lineage strains form a new ECSA subgroup (subgroup IIa) together with Brazilian ECSA lineage strains from an isolated human outbreak in 2014, and a mosquito pool in 2016. Additional analyses date the most recent common ancestor of the ECSA IIa subgroup around May 2007, and the 2016 Haitian CHIKV genomes around December 2015. Known CHIKV mutations associated with improved _Ae. albopictus_ vector competence were not identified. Isolation of this newly identified lineage from _Ae. albopictus_ is of concern, as this vector has a broader geographic range than _Ae. aegypti_, especially in temperate areas of North America, and stresses the importance for continued vector surveillance.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The isolation of this new lineage of chikungunya virus from _Aedes albopictus_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pools is an important 1st step in pointing the way to laboratory studies that would establish their susceptibility to the virus and ability (or not) to transmit it efficiently. It is reasonable to assume that new lineages of CHIKV will emerge over time. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (07): Africa (Sudan) mixed outbreak 20181011.6085457\nChikungunya (06): Africa (Sudan)

Evidence of vertical transmission of Zika virus in field-collected eggs of _Aedes aegypti_ in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nArboviruses are viruses transmitted to humans and other animals by the bite of hematophagous arthropods. Infections caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and the deadlier yellow fever virus (YFV) are current public health problems in several countries, mainly those located in tropical and subtropical regions. One of the main prevention strategies continues to be vector control, with the elimination of breeding sites and surveillance of infested areas. The use of ovitraps for _Aedes_ mosquitos monitoring has already demonstrated promising results, and maybe be also useful for arboviral surveillance.\n\nMethods\nThis work aimed to detect natural vertical transmission of arboviruses in _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Mosquito egg collection was carried out using ovitraps in Itacoatiara, a mid-size city in Amazonas state, Brazil. Collected eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae were tested for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA by RT-qPCR.\n\nResults\nA total of 2057 specimens (1793 _Ae. aegypti_ and 264 _Ae. albopictus_), in 154 larvae pools were processed. Results showed one positive pool for CHIKV and one positive pool for ZIKV. The active ZIKV infection was further confirmed by the detection of the negative-strand viral RNA and nucleotide sequencing which confirmed the Asian genotype. The Infection Rate per 1000 mosquitoes tested was assessed by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with 0.45 and 0.44 for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, and by Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) with 0.45 for both viruses.\n\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st detection of ZIKV in natural vertical transmission in the _Ae. aegypti_, a fact that may contribute to ZIKV maintenance in nature during epidemics periods. Furthermore, our results highlight that the use of ovitraps and the molecular detection of arbovirus may contribute to health surveillance, directing the efforts to more efficient transmission blockade.\n\nAuthor summary\nThe control of the vast majority of arbovirus infections relies on entomological measures to reduce mosquito infestation. Therefore, this study analyzed the use of ovitraps for arboviral surveillance in a mid-size city of the Amazonas state, Brazil. We found one larva pool infected with chikungunya virus, before the 1st human case confirmed in this municipality. Another pool was infected with Zika virus, demonstrating the 1st evidence that vertical transmission occurs in naturally infected _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito populations.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The detection of transovarial transmission (TOT) is of epidemiological significance. Should TOT be efficient, the virus might be sustained in _Aedes aegypti_ populations without requiring human infectious blood meals and making control of the virus difficult. Further field and laboratory studies are needed to determine TOT efficiency. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] Virus variants and vectors\nDate: Fri 20 Jul 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/373316 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/20/373316\n\n\nIrina Maljkovic Berry, Fredrick Eyase, Simon Pollett, Limbaso, S Konongoi, Katherine Figueroa, Victor Ofula, et al. Recent outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Africa and Asia are driven by a variant carrying mutations associated with increased fitness for _Aedes aegypti_.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In 2016, a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak was reported in Mandera, Kenya. This was the 1st major CHIKV outbreak in the country since the global re-emergence of this virus, which arose as an initial outbreak in Kenya in 2004. Therefore, we collected samples and sequenced viral genomes from the 2016 Mandera outbreak.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: All Kenyan genomes contained 2 mutations, E1:K211E and E2:V264A, recently reported to have an association with increased infectivity, dissemination and transmission in the _Aedes aegypti_ vector. Phylogeographic inference of temporal and spatial virus relationships using Bayesian approaches showed that this _Ae. aegypti_ adapted strain emerged within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) lineage of CHIKV between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India. It was also in India where the 1st large outbreak caused by this strain appeared, in New Delhi, 2010. More importantly, our results also showed that this strain is no longer contained in India, and that it has more recently caused several major outbreaks of CHIKV, including the 2016 outbreaks in India, Pakistan and Kenya, and the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh. In addition to its capability to cause large outbreaks in different regions of the world, this CHIKV strain has the capacity to replace less adapted wild type strains in _Ae. aegypti_-rich regions. Indeed, all the latest full CHIKV genomes of the ECSA Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL), from the regions of high _Ae. aegypti_ prevalence, carry these 2 mutations, including samples collected in Japan, Australia, and China.\n\nConclusions/Significance: Our results point to the importance of continued genomic-based surveillance of this strain's global spread, and they prompt urgent vector competence studies in Asian and African countries, in order to assess the level of vector receptiveness, virus transmission, and the impact this might have on this strain's ability to cause major outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The authors make a good case for the need to assess chikungunya virus genomic variation and the relationship of these variants to _Aedes aegypti_ vector efficiency as they relate to the risk of outbreaks. Unfortunately, it is not easy to attract the resources necessary to do these kinds of studies in advance of a possible outbreak. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] _Aedes albopictus_ in Europe\nDate: Thu 19 Jul 2018\nSource: Eurosurveillance Volume 23, Issue 29 [edited]\nhttps://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.29.1800033\n\n\nHeitmann Anna, Jansen Stephanie, Luhken Renke, Helms Michelle, Pluskota Bjorn, Becker Norbert, Kuhn Carola, Schmidt-Chanasit Jonas, Tannich Egbert. Experimental risk assessment for chikungunya virus transmission based on vector competence, distribution and temperature suitability in Europe, 2018.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nOver the last decade, the abundant distribution of the Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ in southern Europe and the import of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) by infected travellers has resulted in at least 5 local outbreaks of chikungunya fever in France and Italy. Considering the ongoing spread of _Ae. albopictus_ to central Europe, we performed an analysis of the Europe-wide spatial risk of CHIKV transmission under different temperature conditions.\n\nMethods\n_Ae. albopictus_ specimens from Germany and Italy were orally infected with CHIKV from an outbreak in France and kept for 2 weeks at 18 C, 21 C or 24 C [64 F, 70 F or 75 F]. A salivation assay was conducted to detect infectious CHIKV.\n\nResults\nAnalyses of mosquito saliva for infectious virus particles demonstrated transmission rates (TRs) of\u2009over 35 percent. Highest TRs of 50 percent for the mosquito population from Germany were detected at 18 C, while the Italian population had highest TRs of 63 percent at 18 C and 21 C, respectively. Temperature data indicated a potential risk of CHIKV transmission for extended durations, i.e. sufficiently long time periods allowing extrinsic incubation of the virus. This was shown for areas already colonised by _Ae. albopictus_, as well as for large parts of central Europe that are not colonised.\n\nConclusion\nThe current risk of CHIKV transmission in Europe is not primarily restricted by temperature, which allows extrinsic incubation of the virus, but rather by the vector distribution. Accordingly, all European countries with established populations of _Ae. albopictus_ should implement respective entomological surveillance and monitoring systems, as basis for suitable control measures.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nand\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The 3 CHIKV outbreaks in France and 2 in Italy between 2007-2017 highlight the risk of autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Europe. This is a dynamic situation and can be expected to change as global warming is likely to extend the range of _Ae. albopictus_ northward into Europe. Interested readers are encouraged to access the full article with its table and maps. The risk map of CHIKV transmission is especially interesting.\n\nIn a related study the investigators compared the vector competence of an Italian population of _Aedes albopictus_ for 2 strains of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), with and without E1:A226V mutation, responsible for outbreaks in 2007 in the Emilia Romagna region and 2017 in the Lazio and Calabria regions, respectively. _Ae. albopictus_ showed similar vector competence for both viral strains, indicating that the E1:A226V mutation is not exclusively responsible for the ability of CHIKV to replicate well in this mosquito species.

The participants had produced antibodies to protect themselves against chikungunya 4 weeks after injections of its lead candidate vaccine.\n\n\"Up to 100 percent were protected after 2 vaccinations,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"We also had excellent safety observations.\"\n\nThemis makes the vaccine by modifying the measles vaccine Schwarz strain to express an antigen for chikungunya [virus]. The measles vaccine has been used in billions in people, so its safety and efficacy are well established.\n\nChikungunya [virus causes] a serious disease that causes joint pains and fever. Often resembling dengue fever in the initial stages, it is usually transmitted by mosquitoes from the _Aedes_ genus in tropical regions, but outbreaks have been recorded in Europe, such as in Italy last year [2017].\n\n\"The mosquito is now endemic in Southern Europe,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"Countries like Austria, France and Croatia can have outbreaks now.\"\n\nFurthermore, as globalization and climate change trends continue, Tauber told me that we will need more treatments for tropical diseases across the world. \"We are going to have more of the so-called tropical infections in the future than we have had in the past.\"\n\nAs there is currently no treatment or vaccine in the market for chikungunya. Themis' vaccine, if approved, would have the advantage of being 1st to market. Themis is planning to start a Phase III trial of the chikungunya treatment in early 2020.\n\nOther companies are also developing treatments for insect-borne diseases. Instead of vaccines, UK biotech Oxitec has released genetically engineered mosquitoes in Brazil that die out before they can pass on diseases. The Swiss company Humabs has an antibody treatment for Zika in preclinical development.\n\n[Byline: Jonathan Smith]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Vaccine fast tracked\nDate: Fri 4 May 2018\nSource: MD [edited]\nhttps://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/potential-chikungunya-virus-vaccine-designated-for-fda-fast-track\n\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to an investigative vaccine designed to prevent disease caused by chikungunya virus.\n\nPaxVax, an independent specialty vaccine company, is developing the prophylaxis. Chikungunya [virus causes] a disease which includes headache, muscle pain, skin rash, and severe joint pain that can persist for years and spreads through mosquito bites and can result in widespread outbreaks. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of infectious diseases transmitted from tick, flea, and mosquito bites to humans has more than tripled in the US in recent years.\n\nTrials for the PaxVax vaccine, which is a virus-like particle (VLP) treatment licensed from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently began enrolling for a 400-paitent phase 2B dose-finding study. A previous phase 2A study conducted by the NIAID's parent organization the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tested the vaccine's effects in participants.\n\nThe virus is arthropod-borne and shares a close relation to other viruses identified in Africa, South America, and Australia. It's a small, spherical RNA virus vectored by the daytime-biting _Aedes aegypti _mosquito, better known for transmitting Zika virus, yellow fever, and dengue viruses.\n\nChikungunya [virus infection] has only recently become a domestic issue. The 1st local transmission of the disease in the Americas was diagnosed in the Caribbean in late 2013, but it has since been identified in 45 countries in the Western hemisphere. The Pan American Health Organization has identified more than 1.7 million possible cases since the 1st identification. Residents of and travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, India, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America [have been infected].\n\nIndividuals at greater risk of serious complications due to the virus include infants, elderly people, and people with chronic medical conditions.\n\nIf clinical development progresses, the PaxVax vaccine could become the 1st approved by the FDA for the prevention of chikungunya [virus infection]. Eva Harris, PhD, director, Center for Global Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, said the field is in \"desperate need for a medical and public health intervention.\"\n\n\"It is exciting to see this vaccine candidate moving forward with Fast Track designation as this is an extremely debilitating disease with the potential for causing serious long-term sequelae,\" Harris said in a statement.\n\nLisa Danzig, MD, chief medical officer, ParVax, said the Fast Track designation is yet another positive step for the vaccine's development, as well as being a recognition of the unmet clinical need.\n\n\"This is another example of the capabilities of our technology platform and our steadfast commitment to developing specialty vaccines that protect against overlooked infectious diseases, as mosquito-borne diseases continue to increase due to air travel and warmer weather,\" Danzig said.\n\nResults of the phase 2B trial are expected to be finalized in early 2019.\n\n[Byline: Kevin Kunzmann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that the phase 2B trials elicit good immune responses for this vaccine and the one in the report above and will open the way for phase 3 trials and licensure of the vaccine.

Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced levels of viral infection of cells and, reciprocally, ectopic expression of these genes resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to chikungunya virus particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc fusion protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked chikungunya virus infection in multiple cell types, including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of chikungunya virus E2 protein, which are a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of the Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies to mice reduced chikungunya and O'nyong nyong virus infection as well as associated foot swelling. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[Knowing the cellular receptor may permit development of drugs or antibodies on a commercial scale that can block cell attachment by the virus. It will be interesting to see whether that blockage is as effective in animals, and eventually humans, as it is in cell cultures. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[8] New virus subgroup\nDate: Thu 10 May 2018\nSource: PLoS One [edited]\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196857\n\n\nSarah Keller White, Carla Mavian ,Marco Salemi, John Glenn Morris Jr., Maha A. Elbadry, Bernard A. Okech, et al. A new \"American\" subgroup of African-lineage Chikungunya virus detected in and isolated from mosquitoes collected in Haiti, 2016.\n\nAbstract\nAs part of on-going arboviral surveillance activity in a semi-rural region in Haiti, chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-positive mosquito pools were identified in 2014 (the peak of the Caribbean Asian-clade epidemic), and again in 2016 by RT-PCR. In 2014, CHIKV was only identified in _Aedes aegypti_ (11 positive pools/124 screened). In contrast, in sampling in 2016, CHIKV was not identified in _Ae. aegypti_, but, rather, in (a) a female _Aedes albopictus_ pool, and (b) a female _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pool. Genomic sequence analyses indicated that the CHIKV viruses in the 2016 mosquito pools were from the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage, rather than the Asian lineage. In phylogenetic studies, these ECSA lineage strains form a new ECSA subgroup (subgroup IIa) together with Brazilian ECSA lineage strains from an isolated human outbreak in 2014, and a mosquito pool in 2016. Additional analyses date the most recent common ancestor of the ECSA IIa subgroup around May 2007, and the 2016 Haitian CHIKV genomes around December 2015. Known CHIKV mutations associated with improved _Ae. albopictus_ vector competence were not identified. Isolation of this newly identified lineage from _Ae. albopictus_ is of concern, as this vector has a broader geographic range than _Ae. aegypti_, especially in temperate areas of North America, and stresses the importance for continued vector surveillance.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The isolation of this new lineage of chikungunya virus from _Aedes albopictus_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pools is an important 1st step in pointing the way to laboratory studies that would establish their susceptibility to the virus and ability (or not) to transmit it efficiently. It is reasonable to assume that new lineages of CHIKV will emerge over time. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (07): Africa (Sudan) mixed outbreak 20181011.6085457\nChikungunya (06): Africa (Sudan)

Evidence of vertical transmission of Zika virus in field-collected eggs of _Aedes aegypti_ in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nArboviruses are viruses transmitted to humans and other animals by the bite of hematophagous arthropods. Infections caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and the deadlier yellow fever virus (YFV) are current public health problems in several countries, mainly those located in tropical and subtropical regions. One of the main prevention strategies continues to be vector control, with the elimination of breeding sites and surveillance of infested areas. The use of ovitraps for _Aedes_ mosquitos monitoring has already demonstrated promising results, and maybe be also useful for arboviral surveillance.\n\nMethods\nThis work aimed to detect natural vertical transmission of arboviruses in _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Mosquito egg collection was carried out using ovitraps in Itacoatiara, a mid-size city in Amazonas state, Brazil. Collected eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae were tested for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA by RT-qPCR.\n\nResults\nA total of 2057 specimens (1793 _Ae. aegypti_ and 264 _Ae. albopictus_), in 154 larvae pools were processed. Results showed one positive pool for CHIKV and one positive pool for ZIKV. The active ZIKV infection was further confirmed by the detection of the negative-strand viral RNA and nucleotide sequencing which confirmed the Asian genotype. The Infection Rate per 1000 mosquitoes tested was assessed by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with 0.45 and 0.44 for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, and by Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) with 0.45 for both viruses.\n\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st detection of ZIKV in natural vertical transmission in the _Ae. aegypti_, a fact that may contribute to ZIKV maintenance in nature during epidemics periods. Furthermore, our results highlight that the use of ovitraps and the molecular detection of arbovirus may contribute to health surveillance, directing the efforts to more efficient transmission blockade.\n\nAuthor summary\nThe control of the vast majority of arbovirus infections relies on entomological measures to reduce mosquito infestation. Therefore, this study analyzed the use of ovitraps for arboviral surveillance in a mid-size city of the Amazonas state, Brazil. We found one larva pool infected with chikungunya virus, before the 1st human case confirmed in this municipality. Another pool was infected with Zika virus, demonstrating the 1st evidence that vertical transmission occurs in naturally infected _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito populations.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The detection of transovarial transmission (TOT) is of epidemiological significance. Should TOT be efficient, the virus might be sustained in _Aedes aegypti_ populations without requiring human infectious blood meals and making control of the virus difficult. Further field and laboratory studies are needed to determine TOT efficiency. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] Virus variants and vectors\nDate: Fri 20 Jul 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/373316 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/20/373316\n\n\nIrina Maljkovic Berry, Fredrick Eyase, Simon Pollett, Limbaso, S Konongoi, Katherine Figueroa, Victor Ofula, et al. Recent outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Africa and Asia are driven by a variant carrying mutations associated with increased fitness for _Aedes aegypti_.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In 2016, a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak was reported in Mandera, Kenya. This was the 1st major CHIKV outbreak in the country since the global re-emergence of this virus, which arose as an initial outbreak in Kenya in 2004. Therefore, we collected samples and sequenced viral genomes from the 2016 Mandera outbreak.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: All Kenyan genomes contained 2 mutations, E1:K211E and E2:V264A, recently reported to have an association with increased infectivity, dissemination and transmission in the _Aedes aegypti_ vector. Phylogeographic inference of temporal and spatial virus relationships using Bayesian approaches showed that this _Ae. aegypti_ adapted strain emerged within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) lineage of CHIKV between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India. It was also in India where the 1st large outbreak caused by this strain appeared, in New Delhi, 2010. More importantly, our results also showed that this strain is no longer contained in India, and that it has more recently caused several major outbreaks of CHIKV, including the 2016 outbreaks in India, Pakistan and Kenya, and the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh. In addition to its capability to cause large outbreaks in different regions of the world, this CHIKV strain has the capacity to replace less adapted wild type strains in _Ae. aegypti_-rich regions. Indeed, all the latest full CHIKV genomes of the ECSA Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL), from the regions of high _Ae. aegypti_ prevalence, carry these 2 mutations, including samples collected in Japan, Australia, and China.\n\nConclusions/Significance: Our results point to the importance of continued genomic-based surveillance of this strain's global spread, and they prompt urgent vector competence studies in Asian and African countries, in order to assess the level of vector receptiveness, virus transmission, and the impact this might have on this strain's ability to cause major outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The authors make a good case for the need to assess chikungunya virus genomic variation and the relationship of these variants to _Aedes aegypti_ vector efficiency as they relate to the risk of outbreaks. Unfortunately, it is not easy to attract the resources necessary to do these kinds of studies in advance of a possible outbreak. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] _Aedes albopictus_ in Europe\nDate: Thu 19 Jul 2018\nSource: Eurosurveillance Volume 23, Issue 29 [edited]\nhttps://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.29.1800033\n\n\nHeitmann Anna, Jansen Stephanie, Luhken Renke, Helms Michelle, Pluskota Bjorn, Becker Norbert, Kuhn Carola, Schmidt-Chanasit Jonas, Tannich Egbert. Experimental risk assessment for chikungunya virus transmission based on vector competence, distribution and temperature suitability in Europe, 2018.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nOver the last decade, the abundant distribution of the Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ in southern Europe and the import of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) by infected travellers has resulted in at least 5 local outbreaks of chikungunya fever in France and Italy. Considering the ongoing spread of _Ae. albopictus_ to central Europe, we performed an analysis of the Europe-wide spatial risk of CHIKV transmission under different temperature conditions.\n\nMethods\n_Ae. albopictus_ specimens from Germany and Italy were orally infected with CHIKV from an outbreak in France and kept for 2 weeks at 18 C, 21 C or 24 C [64 F, 70 F or 75 F]. A salivation assay was conducted to detect infectious CHIKV.\n\nResults\nAnalyses of mosquito saliva for infectious virus particles demonstrated transmission rates (TRs) of\u2009over 35 percent. Highest TRs of 50 percent for the mosquito population from Germany were detected at 18 C, while the Italian population had highest TRs of 63 percent at 18 C and 21 C, respectively. Temperature data indicated a potential risk of CHIKV transmission for extended durations, i.e. sufficiently long time periods allowing extrinsic incubation of the virus. This was shown for areas already colonised by _Ae. albopictus_, as well as for large parts of central Europe that are not colonised.\n\nConclusion\nThe current risk of CHIKV transmission in Europe is not primarily restricted by temperature, which allows extrinsic incubation of the virus, but rather by the vector distribution. Accordingly, all European countries with established populations of _Ae. albopictus_ should implement respective entomological surveillance and monitoring systems, as basis for suitable control measures.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nand\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The 3 CHIKV outbreaks in France and 2 in Italy between 2007-2017 highlight the risk of autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Europe. This is a dynamic situation and can be expected to change as global warming is likely to extend the range of _Ae. albopictus_ northward into Europe. Interested readers are encouraged to access the full article with its table and maps. The risk map of CHIKV transmission is especially interesting.\n\nIn a related study the investigators compared the vector competence of an Italian population of _Aedes albopictus_ for 2 strains of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), with and without E1:A226V mutation, responsible for outbreaks in 2007 in the Emilia Romagna region and 2017 in the Lazio and Calabria regions, respectively. _Ae. albopictus_ showed similar vector competence for both viral strains, indicating that the E1:A226V mutation is not exclusively responsible for the ability of CHIKV to replicate well in this mosquito species.

The participants had produced antibodies to protect themselves against chikungunya 4 weeks after injections of its lead candidate vaccine.\n\n\"Up to 100 percent were protected after 2 vaccinations,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"We also had excellent safety observations.\"\n\nThemis makes the vaccine by modifying the measles vaccine Schwarz strain to express an antigen for chikungunya [virus]. The measles vaccine has been used in billions in people, so its safety and efficacy are well established.\n\nChikungunya [virus causes] a serious disease that causes joint pains and fever. Often resembling dengue fever in the initial stages, it is usually transmitted by mosquitoes from the _Aedes_ genus in tropical regions, but outbreaks have been recorded in Europe, such as in Italy last year [2017].\n\n\"The mosquito is now endemic in Southern Europe,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"Countries like Austria, France and Croatia can have outbreaks now.\"\n\nFurthermore, as globalization and climate change trends continue, Tauber told me that we will need more treatments for tropical diseases across the world. \"We are going to have more of the so-called tropical infections in the future than we have had in the past.\"\n\nAs there is currently no treatment or vaccine in the market for chikungunya. Themis' vaccine, if approved, would have the advantage of being 1st to market. Themis is planning to start a Phase III trial of the chikungunya treatment in early 2020.\n\nOther companies are also developing treatments for insect-borne diseases. Instead of vaccines, UK biotech Oxitec has released genetically engineered mosquitoes in Brazil that die out before they can pass on diseases. The Swiss company Humabs has an antibody treatment for Zika in preclinical development.\n\n[Byline: Jonathan Smith]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Vaccine fast tracked\nDate: Fri 4 May 2018\nSource: MD [edited]\nhttps://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/potential-chikungunya-virus-vaccine-designated-for-fda-fast-track\n\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to an investigative vaccine designed to prevent disease caused by chikungunya virus.\n\nPaxVax, an independent specialty vaccine company, is developing the prophylaxis. Chikungunya [virus causes] a disease which includes headache, muscle pain, skin rash, and severe joint pain that can persist for years and spreads through mosquito bites and can result in widespread outbreaks. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of infectious diseases transmitted from tick, flea, and mosquito bites to humans has more than tripled in the US in recent years.\n\nTrials for the PaxVax vaccine, which is a virus-like particle (VLP) treatment licensed from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently began enrolling for a 400-paitent phase 2B dose-finding study. A previous phase 2A study conducted by the NIAID's parent organization the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tested the vaccine's effects in participants.\n\nThe virus is arthropod-borne and shares a close relation to other viruses identified in Africa, South America, and Australia. It's a small, spherical RNA virus vectored by the daytime-biting _Aedes aegypti _mosquito, better known for transmitting Zika virus, yellow fever, and dengue viruses.\n\nChikungunya [virus infection] has only recently become a domestic issue. The 1st local transmission of the disease in the Americas was diagnosed in the Caribbean in late 2013, but it has since been identified in 45 countries in the Western hemisphere. The Pan American Health Organization has identified more than 1.7 million possible cases since the 1st identification. Residents of and travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, India, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America [have been infected].\n\nIndividuals at greater risk of serious complications due to the virus include infants, elderly people, and people with chronic medical conditions.\n\nIf clinical development progresses, the PaxVax vaccine could become the 1st approved by the FDA for the prevention of chikungunya [virus infection]. Eva Harris, PhD, director, Center for Global Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, said the field is in \"desperate need for a medical and public health intervention.\"\n\n\"It is exciting to see this vaccine candidate moving forward with Fast Track designation as this is an extremely debilitating disease with the potential for causing serious long-term sequelae,\" Harris said in a statement.\n\nLisa Danzig, MD, chief medical officer, ParVax, said the Fast Track designation is yet another positive step for the vaccine's development, as well as being a recognition of the unmet clinical need.\n\n\"This is another example of the capabilities of our technology platform and our steadfast commitment to developing specialty vaccines that protect against overlooked infectious diseases, as mosquito-borne diseases continue to increase due to air travel and warmer weather,\" Danzig said.\n\nResults of the phase 2B trial are expected to be finalized in early 2019.\n\n[Byline: Kevin Kunzmann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that the phase 2B trials elicit good immune responses for this vaccine and the one in the report above and will open the way for phase 3 trials and licensure of the vaccine.

Kim, Julie M. Fox, Sharmila Nair, Katherine Basore, William B. Klimstra, et al. Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\nAbstract\nArthritogenic alphaviruses comprise a group of enveloped RNA viruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease. The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screen to identify the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya, Ross River, Mayaro and O'nyong nyong viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced levels of viral infection of cells and, reciprocally, ectopic expression of these genes resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to chikungunya virus particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc fusion protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked chikungunya virus infection in multiple cell types, including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of chikungunya virus E2 protein, which are a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of the Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies to mice reduced chikungunya and O'nyong nyong virus infection as well as associated foot swelling. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[Knowing the cellular receptor may permit development of drugs or antibodies on a commercial scale that can block cell attachment by the virus.

Elbadry, Bernard A. Okech, et al. A new \"American\" subgroup of African-lineage Chikungunya virus detected in and isolated from mosquitoes collected in Haiti, 2016.\n\nAbstract\nAs part of on-going arboviral surveillance activity in a semi-rural region in Haiti, chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-positive mosquito pools were identified in 2014 (the peak of the Caribbean Asian-clade epidemic), and again in 2016 by RT-PCR. In 2014, CHIKV was only identified in _Aedes aegypti_ (11 positive pools/124 screened). In contrast, in sampling in 2016, CHIKV was not identified in _Ae. aegypti_, but, rather, in (a) a female _Aedes albopictus_ pool, and (b) a female _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pool. Genomic sequence analyses indicated that the CHIKV viruses in the 2016 mosquito pools were from the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage, rather than the Asian lineage. In phylogenetic studies, these ECSA lineage strains form a new ECSA subgroup (subgroup IIa) together with Brazilian ECSA lineage strains from an isolated human outbreak in 2014, and a mosquito pool in 2016. Additional analyses date the most recent common ancestor of the ECSA IIa subgroup around May 2007, and the 2016 Haitian CHIKV genomes around December 2015. Known CHIKV mutations associated with improved _Ae. albopictus_ vector competence were not identified. Isolation of this newly identified lineage from _Ae. albopictus_ is of concern, as this vector has a broader geographic range than _Ae. aegypti_, especially in temperate areas of North America, and stresses the importance for continued vector surveillance.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The isolation of this new lineage of chikungunya virus from _Aedes albopictus_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pools is an important 1st step in pointing the way to laboratory studies that would establish their susceptibility to the virus and ability (or not) to transmit it efficiently.

Evidence of vertical transmission of Zika virus in field-collected eggs of _Aedes aegypti_ in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nArboviruses are viruses transmitted to humans and other animals by the bite of hematophagous arthropods. Infections caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and the deadlier yellow fever virus (YFV) are current public health problems in several countries, mainly those located in tropical and subtropical regions. One of the main prevention strategies continues to be vector control, with the elimination of breeding sites and surveillance of infested areas. The use of ovitraps for _Aedes_ mosquitos monitoring has already demonstrated promising results, and maybe be also useful for arboviral surveillance.\n\nMethods\nThis work aimed to detect natural vertical transmission of arboviruses in _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Mosquito egg collection was carried out using ovitraps in Itacoatiara, a mid-size city in Amazonas state, Brazil. Collected eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae were tested for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA by RT-qPCR.\n\nResults\nA total of 2057 specimens (1793 _Ae. aegypti_ and 264 _Ae. albopictus_), in 154 larvae pools were processed. Results showed one positive pool for CHIKV and one positive pool for ZIKV. The active ZIKV infection was further confirmed by the detection of the negative-strand viral RNA and nucleotide sequencing which confirmed the Asian genotype. The Infection Rate per 1000 mosquitoes tested was assessed by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with 0.45 and 0.44 for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, and by Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) with 0.45 for both viruses.\n\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st detection of ZIKV in natural vertical transmission in the _Ae. aegypti_, a fact that may contribute to ZIKV maintenance in nature during epidemics periods. Furthermore, our results highlight that the use of ovitraps and the molecular detection of arbovirus may contribute to health surveillance, directing the efforts to more efficient transmission blockade.\n\nAuthor summary\nThe control of the vast majority of arbovirus infections relies on entomological measures to reduce mosquito infestation. Therefore, this study analyzed the use of ovitraps for arboviral surveillance in a mid-size city of the Amazonas state, Brazil. We found one larva pool infected with chikungunya virus, before the 1st human case confirmed in this municipality. Another pool was infected with Zika virus, demonstrating the 1st evidence that vertical transmission occurs in naturally infected _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito populations.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The detection of transovarial transmission (TOT) is of epidemiological significance. Should TOT be efficient, the virus might be sustained in _Aedes aegypti_ populations without requiring human infectious blood meals and making control of the virus difficult. Further field and laboratory studies are needed to determine TOT efficiency. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] Virus variants and vectors\nDate: Fri 20 Jul 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/373316 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/20/373316\n\n\nIrina Maljkovic Berry, Fredrick Eyase, Simon Pollett, Limbaso, S Konongoi, Katherine Figueroa, Victor Ofula, et al. Recent outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Africa and Asia are driven by a variant carrying mutations associated with increased fitness for _Aedes aegypti_.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In 2016, a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak was reported in Mandera, Kenya. This was the 1st major CHIKV outbreak in the country since the global re-emergence of this virus, which arose as an initial outbreak in Kenya in 2004. Therefore, we collected samples and sequenced viral genomes from the 2016 Mandera outbreak.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: All Kenyan genomes contained 2 mutations, E1:K211E and E2:V264A, recently reported to have an association with increased infectivity, dissemination and transmission in the _Aedes aegypti_ vector. Phylogeographic inference of temporal and spatial virus relationships using Bayesian approaches showed that this _Ae. aegypti_ adapted strain emerged within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) lineage of CHIKV between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India. It was also in India where the 1st large outbreak caused by this strain appeared, in New Delhi, 2010. More importantly, our results also showed that this strain is no longer contained in India, and that it has more recently caused several major outbreaks of CHIKV, including the 2016 outbreaks in India, Pakistan and Kenya, and the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh. In addition to its capability to cause large outbreaks in different regions of the world, this CHIKV strain has the capacity to replace less adapted wild type strains in _Ae. aegypti_-rich regions. Indeed, all the latest full CHIKV genomes of the ECSA Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL), from the regions of high _Ae. aegypti_ prevalence, carry these 2 mutations, including samples collected in Japan, Australia, and China.\n\nConclusions/Significance: Our results point to the importance of continued genomic-based surveillance of this strain's global spread, and they prompt urgent vector competence studies in Asian and African countries, in order to assess the level of vector receptiveness, virus transmission, and the impact this might have on this strain's ability to cause major outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The authors make a good case for the need to assess chikungunya virus genomic variation and the relationship of these variants to _Aedes aegypti_ vector efficiency as they relate to the risk of outbreaks. Unfortunately, it is not easy to attract the resources necessary to do these kinds of studies in advance of a possible outbreak. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] _Aedes albopictus_ in Europe\nDate: Thu 19 Jul 2018\nSource: Eurosurveillance Volume 23, Issue 29 [edited]\nhttps://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.29.1800033\n\n\nHeitmann Anna, Jansen Stephanie, Luhken Renke, Helms Michelle, Pluskota Bjorn, Becker Norbert, Kuhn Carola, Schmidt-Chanasit Jonas, Tannich Egbert. Experimental risk assessment for chikungunya virus transmission based on vector competence, distribution and temperature suitability in Europe, 2018.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nOver the last decade, the abundant distribution of the Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ in southern Europe and the import of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) by infected travellers has resulted in at least 5 local outbreaks of chikungunya fever in France and Italy. Considering the ongoing spread of _Ae. albopictus_ to central Europe, we performed an analysis of the Europe-wide spatial risk of CHIKV transmission under different temperature conditions.\n\nMethods\n_Ae. albopictus_ specimens from Germany and Italy were orally infected with CHIKV from an outbreak in France and kept for 2 weeks at 18 C, 21 C or 24 C [64 F, 70 F or 75 F]. A salivation assay was conducted to detect infectious CHIKV.\n\nResults\nAnalyses of mosquito saliva for infectious virus particles demonstrated transmission rates (TRs) of\u2009over 35 percent. Highest TRs of 50 percent for the mosquito population from Germany were detected at 18 C, while the Italian population had highest TRs of 63 percent at 18 C and 21 C, respectively. Temperature data indicated a potential risk of CHIKV transmission for extended durations, i.e. sufficiently long time periods allowing extrinsic incubation of the virus. This was shown for areas already colonised by _Ae. albopictus_, as well as for large parts of central Europe that are not colonised.\n\nConclusion\nThe current risk of CHIKV transmission in Europe is not primarily restricted by temperature, which allows extrinsic incubation of the virus, but rather by the vector distribution. Accordingly, all European countries with established populations of _Ae. albopictus_ should implement respective entomological surveillance and monitoring systems, as basis for suitable control measures.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nand\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The 3 CHIKV outbreaks in France and 2 in Italy between 2007-2017 highlight the risk of autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Europe. This is a dynamic situation and can be expected to change as global warming is likely to extend the range of _Ae. albopictus_ northward into Europe.

The risk map of CHIKV transmission is especially interesting.\n\nIn a related study the investigators compared the vector competence of an Italian population of _Aedes albopictus_ for 2 strains of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), with and without E1:A226V mutation, responsible for outbreaks in 2007 in the Emilia Romagna region and 2017 in the Lazio and Calabria regions, respectively. _Ae. albopictus_ showed similar vector competence for both viral strains, indicating that the E1:A226V mutation is not exclusively responsible for the ability of CHIKV to replicate well in this mosquito species.

The participants had produced antibodies to protect themselves against chikungunya 4 weeks after injections of its lead candidate vaccine.\n\n\"Up to 100 percent were protected after 2 vaccinations,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"We also had excellent safety observations.\"\n\nThemis makes the vaccine by modifying the measles vaccine Schwarz strain to express an antigen for chikungunya [virus]. The measles vaccine has been used in billions in people, so its safety and efficacy are well established.\n\nChikungunya [virus causes] a serious disease that causes joint pains and fever. Often resembling dengue fever in the initial stages, it is usually transmitted by mosquitoes from the _Aedes_ genus in tropical regions, but outbreaks have been recorded in Europe, such as in Italy last year [2017].\n\n\"The mosquito is now endemic in Southern Europe,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"Countries like Austria, France and Croatia can have outbreaks now.\"\n\nFurthermore, as globalization and climate change trends continue, Tauber told me that we will need more treatments for tropical diseases across the world. \"We are going to have more of the so-called tropical infections in the future than we have had in the past.\"\n\nAs there is currently no treatment or vaccine in the market for chikungunya. Themis' vaccine, if approved, would have the advantage of being 1st to market. Themis is planning to start a Phase III trial of the chikungunya treatment in early 2020.\n\nOther companies are also developing treatments for insect-borne diseases. Instead of vaccines, UK biotech Oxitec has released genetically engineered mosquitoes in Brazil that die out before they can pass on diseases. The Swiss company Humabs has an antibody treatment for Zika in preclinical development.\n\n[Byline: Jonathan Smith]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Vaccine fast tracked\nDate: Fri 4 May 2018\nSource: MD [edited]\nhttps://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/potential-chikungunya-virus-vaccine-designated-for-fda-fast-track\n\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to an investigative vaccine designed to prevent disease caused by chikungunya virus.\n\nPaxVax, an independent specialty vaccine company, is developing the prophylaxis. Chikungunya [virus causes] a disease which includes headache, muscle pain, skin rash, and severe joint pain that can persist for years and spreads through mosquito bites and can result in widespread outbreaks. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of infectious diseases transmitted from tick, flea, and mosquito bites to humans has more than tripled in the US in recent years.\n\nTrials for the PaxVax vaccine, which is a virus-like particle (VLP) treatment licensed from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently began enrolling for a 400-paitent phase 2B dose-finding study. A previous phase 2A study conducted by the NIAID's parent organization the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tested the vaccine's effects in participants.\n\nThe virus is arthropod-borne and shares a close relation to other viruses identified in Africa, South America, and Australia. It's a small, spherical RNA virus vectored by the daytime-biting _Aedes aegypti _mosquito, better known for transmitting Zika virus, yellow fever, and dengue viruses.\n\nChikungunya [virus infection] has only recently become a domestic issue. The 1st local transmission of the disease in the Americas was diagnosed in the Caribbean in late 2013, but it has since been identified in 45 countries in the Western hemisphere. The Pan American Health Organization has identified more than 1.7 million possible cases since the 1st identification. Residents of and travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, India, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America [have been infected].\n\nIndividuals at greater risk of serious complications due to the virus include infants, elderly people, and people with chronic medical conditions.\n\nIf clinical development progresses, the PaxVax vaccine could become the 1st approved by the FDA for the prevention of chikungunya [virus infection]. Eva Harris, PhD, director, Center for Global Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, said the field is in \"desperate need for a medical and public health intervention.\"\n\n\"It is exciting to see this vaccine candidate moving forward with Fast Track designation as this is an extremely debilitating disease with the potential for causing serious long-term sequelae,\" Harris said in a statement.\n\nLisa Danzig, MD, chief medical officer, ParVax, said the Fast Track designation is yet another positive step for the vaccine's development, as well as being a recognition of the unmet clinical need.\n\n\"This is another example of the capabilities of our technology platform and our steadfast commitment to developing specialty vaccines that protect against overlooked infectious diseases, as mosquito-borne diseases continue to increase due to air travel and warmer weather,\" Danzig said.\n\nResults of the phase 2B trial are expected to be finalized in early 2019.\n\n[Byline: Kevin Kunzmann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that the phase 2B trials elicit good immune responses for this vaccine and the one in the report above and will open the way for phase 3 trials and licensure of the vaccine. One hopes that the cost will be affordable for individuals and countries where chikungunya virus infections are a problem. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Virus receptor\nDate: 16 May 2018\nSource: Nature 557, pages570-574 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0121-3\n\n\nRong Zhang, Arthur S. Kim, Julie M. Fox, Sharmila Nair, Katherine Basore, William B. Klimstra, et al. Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\nAbstract\nArthritogenic alphaviruses comprise a group of enveloped RNA viruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease. The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screen to identify the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya, Ross River, Mayaro and O'nyong nyong viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced levels of viral infection of cells and, reciprocally, ectopic expression of these genes resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to chikungunya virus particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc fusion protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked chikungunya virus infection in multiple cell types, including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of chikungunya virus E2 protein, which are a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of the Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies to mice reduced chikungunya and O'nyong nyong virus infection as well as associated foot swelling. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[Knowing the cellular receptor may permit development of drugs or antibodies on a commercial scale that can block cell attachment by the virus. It will be interesting to see whether that blockage is as effective in animals, and eventually humans, as it is in cell cultures. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[8] New virus subgroup\nDate: Thu 10 May 2018\nSource: PLoS One [edited]\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196857\n\n\nSarah Keller White, Carla Mavian ,Marco Salemi, John Glenn Morris Jr., Maha A. Elbadry, Bernard A. Okech, et al. A new \"American\" subgroup of African-lineage Chikungunya virus detected in and isolated from mosquitoes collected in Haiti, 2016.\n\nAbstract\nAs part of on-going arboviral surveillance activity in a semi-rural region in Haiti, chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-positive mosquito pools were identified in 2014 (the peak of the Caribbean Asian-clade epidemic), and again in 2016 by RT-PCR. In 2014, CHIKV was only identified in _Aedes aegypti_ (11 positive pools/124 screened). In contrast, in sampling in 2016, CHIKV was not identified in _Ae. aegypti_, but, rather, in (a) a female _Aedes albopictus_ pool, and (b) a female _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pool. Genomic sequence analyses indicated that the CHIKV viruses in the 2016 mosquito pools were from the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage, rather than the Asian lineage. In phylogenetic studies, these ECSA lineage strains form a new ECSA subgroup (subgroup IIa) together with Brazilian ECSA lineage strains from an isolated human outbreak in 2014, and a mosquito pool in 2016. Additional analyses date the most recent common ancestor of the ECSA IIa subgroup around May 2007, and the 2016 Haitian CHIKV genomes around December 2015. Known CHIKV mutations associated with improved _Ae. albopictus_ vector competence were not identified. Isolation of this newly identified lineage from _Ae. albopictus_ is of concern, as this vector has a broader geographic range than _Ae. aegypti_, especially in temperate areas of North America, and stresses the importance for continued vector surveillance.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The isolation of this new lineage of chikungunya virus from _Aedes albopictus_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pools is an important 1st step in pointing the way to laboratory studies that would establish their susceptibility to the virus and ability (or not) to transmit it efficiently. It is reasonable to assume that new lineages of CHIKV will emerge over time. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (07): Africa (Sudan) mixed outbreak 20181011.6085457\nChikungunya (06): Africa (Sudan)

Evidence of vertical transmission of Zika virus in field-collected eggs of _Aedes aegypti_ in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nArboviruses are viruses transmitted to humans and other animals by the bite of hematophagous arthropods. Infections caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and the deadlier yellow fever virus (YFV) are current public health problems in several countries, mainly those located in tropical and subtropical regions. One of the main prevention strategies continues to be vector control, with the elimination of breeding sites and surveillance of infested areas. The use of ovitraps for _Aedes_ mosquitos monitoring has already demonstrated promising results, and maybe be also useful for arboviral surveillance.\n\nMethods\nThis work aimed to detect natural vertical transmission of arboviruses in _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Mosquito egg collection was carried out using ovitraps in Itacoatiara, a mid-size city in Amazonas state, Brazil. Collected eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae were tested for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA by RT-qPCR.\n\nResults\nA total of 2057 specimens (1793 _Ae. aegypti_ and 264 _Ae. albopictus_), in 154 larvae pools were processed. Results showed one positive pool for CHIKV and one positive pool for ZIKV. The active ZIKV infection was further confirmed by the detection of the negative-strand viral RNA and nucleotide sequencing which confirmed the Asian genotype. The Infection Rate per 1000 mosquitoes tested was assessed by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with 0.45 and 0.44 for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, and by Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) with 0.45 for both viruses.\n\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st detection of ZIKV in natural vertical transmission in the _Ae. aegypti_, a fact that may contribute to ZIKV maintenance in nature during epidemics periods. Furthermore, our results highlight that the use of ovitraps and the molecular detection of arbovirus may contribute to health surveillance, directing the efforts to more efficient transmission blockade.\n\nAuthor summary\nThe control of the vast majority of arbovirus infections relies on entomological measures to reduce mosquito infestation. Therefore, this study analyzed the use of ovitraps for arboviral surveillance in a mid-size city of the Amazonas state, Brazil. We found one larva pool infected with chikungunya virus, before the 1st human case confirmed in this municipality. Another pool was infected with Zika virus, demonstrating the 1st evidence that vertical transmission occurs in naturally infected _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito populations.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The detection of transovarial transmission (TOT) is of epidemiological significance. Should TOT be efficient, the virus might be sustained in _Aedes aegypti_ populations without requiring human infectious blood meals and making control of the virus difficult. Further field and laboratory studies are needed to determine TOT efficiency. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] Virus variants and vectors\nDate: Fri 20 Jul 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/373316 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/20/373316\n\n\nIrina Maljkovic Berry, Fredrick Eyase, Simon Pollett, Limbaso, S Konongoi, Katherine Figueroa, Victor Ofula, et al. Recent outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Africa and Asia are driven by a variant carrying mutations associated with increased fitness for _Aedes aegypti_.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In 2016, a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak was reported in Mandera, Kenya. This was the 1st major CHIKV outbreak in the country since the global re-emergence of this virus, which arose as an initial outbreak in Kenya in 2004. Therefore, we collected samples and sequenced viral genomes from the 2016 Mandera outbreak.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: All Kenyan genomes contained 2 mutations, E1:K211E and E2:V264A, recently reported to have an association with increased infectivity, dissemination and transmission in the _Aedes aegypti_ vector. Phylogeographic inference of temporal and spatial virus relationships using Bayesian approaches showed that this _Ae. aegypti_ adapted strain emerged within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) lineage of CHIKV between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India. It was also in India where the 1st large outbreak caused by this strain appeared, in New Delhi, 2010. More importantly, our results also showed that this strain is no longer contained in India, and that it has more recently caused several major outbreaks of CHIKV, including the 2016 outbreaks in India, Pakistan and Kenya, and the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh. In addition to its capability to cause large outbreaks in different regions of the world, this CHIKV strain has the capacity to replace less adapted wild type strains in _Ae. aegypti_-rich regions. Indeed, all the latest full CHIKV genomes of the ECSA Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL), from the regions of high _Ae. aegypti_ prevalence, carry these 2 mutations, including samples collected in Japan, Australia, and China.\n\nConclusions/Significance: Our results point to the importance of continued genomic-based surveillance of this strain's global spread, and they prompt urgent vector competence studies in Asian and African countries, in order to assess the level of vector receptiveness, virus transmission, and the impact this might have on this strain's ability to cause major outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The authors make a good case for the need to assess chikungunya virus genomic variation and the relationship of these variants to _Aedes aegypti_ vector efficiency as they relate to the risk of outbreaks.

Experimental risk assessment for chikungunya virus transmission based on vector competence, distribution and temperature suitability in Europe, 2018.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nOver the last decade, the abundant distribution of the Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ in southern Europe and the import of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) by infected travellers has resulted in at least 5 local outbreaks of chikungunya fever in France and Italy. Considering the ongoing spread of _Ae. albopictus_ to central Europe, we performed an analysis of the Europe-wide spatial risk of CHIKV transmission under different temperature conditions.\n\nMethods\n_Ae. albopictus_ specimens from Germany and Italy were orally infected with CHIKV from an outbreak in France and kept for 2 weeks at 18 C, 21 C or 24 C [64 F, 70 F or 75 F]. A salivation assay was conducted to detect infectious CHIKV.\n\nResults\nAnalyses of mosquito saliva for infectious virus particles demonstrated transmission rates (TRs) of\u2009over 35 percent. Highest TRs of 50 percent for the mosquito population from Germany were detected at 18 C, while the Italian population had highest TRs of 63 percent at 18 C and 21 C, respectively. Temperature data indicated a potential risk of CHIKV transmission for extended durations, i.e. sufficiently long time periods allowing extrinsic incubation of the virus. This was shown for areas already colonised by _Ae. albopictus_, as well as for large parts of central Europe that are not colonised.\n\nConclusion\nThe current risk of CHIKV transmission in Europe is not primarily restricted by temperature, which allows extrinsic incubation of the virus, but rather by the vector distribution. Accordingly, all European countries with established populations of _Ae. albopictus_ should implement respective entomological surveillance and monitoring systems, as basis for suitable control measures.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nand\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The 3 CHIKV outbreaks in France and 2 in Italy between 2007-2017 highlight the risk of autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Europe.

Interested readers are encouraged to access the full article with its table and maps. The risk map of CHIKV transmission is especially interesting.\n\nIn a related study the investigators compared the vector competence of an Italian population of _Aedes albopictus_ for 2 strains of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), with and without E1:A226V mutation, responsible for outbreaks in 2007 in the Emilia Romagna region and 2017 in the Lazio and Calabria regions, respectively. _Ae. albopictus_ showed similar vector competence for both viral strains, indicating that the E1:A226V mutation is not exclusively responsible for the ability of CHIKV to replicate well in this mosquito species.

The participants had produced antibodies to protect themselves against chikungunya 4 weeks after injections of its lead candidate vaccine.\n\n\"Up to 100 percent were protected after 2 vaccinations,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"We also had excellent safety observations.\"\n\nThemis makes the vaccine by modifying the measles vaccine Schwarz strain to express an antigen for chikungunya [virus]. The measles vaccine has been used in billions in people, so its safety and efficacy are well established.\n\nChikungunya [virus causes] a serious disease that causes joint pains and fever. Often resembling dengue fever in the initial stages, it is usually transmitted by mosquitoes from the _Aedes_ genus in tropical regions, but outbreaks have been recorded in Europe, such as in Italy last year [2017].\n\n\"The mosquito is now endemic in Southern Europe,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"Countries like Austria, France and Croatia can have outbreaks now.\"\n\nFurthermore, as globalization and climate change trends continue, Tauber told me that we will need more treatments for tropical diseases across the world. \"We are going to have more of the so-called tropical infections in the future than we have had in the past.\"\n\nAs there is currently no treatment or vaccine in the market for chikungunya. Themis' vaccine, if approved, would have the advantage of being 1st to market. Themis is planning to start a Phase III trial of the chikungunya treatment in early 2020.\n\nOther companies are also developing treatments for insect-borne diseases. Instead of vaccines, UK biotech Oxitec has released genetically engineered mosquitoes in Brazil that die out before they can pass on diseases.

Chikungunya [virus causes] a disease which includes headache, muscle pain, skin rash, and severe joint pain that can persist for years and spreads through mosquito bites and can result in widespread outbreaks. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of infectious diseases transmitted from tick, flea, and mosquito bites to humans has more than tripled in the US in recent years.\n\nTrials for the PaxVax vaccine, which is a virus-like particle (VLP) treatment licensed from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently began enrolling for a 400-paitent phase 2B dose-finding study. A previous phase 2A study conducted by the NIAID's parent organization the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tested the vaccine's effects in participants.\n\nThe virus is arthropod-borne and shares a close relation to other viruses identified in Africa, South America, and Australia. It's a small, spherical RNA virus vectored by the daytime-biting _Aedes aegypti _mosquito, better known for transmitting Zika virus, yellow fever, and dengue viruses.\n\nChikungunya [virus infection] has only recently become a domestic issue. The 1st local transmission of the disease in the Americas was diagnosed in the Caribbean in late 2013, but it has since been identified in 45 countries in the Western hemisphere. The Pan American Health Organization has identified more than 1.7 million possible cases since the 1st identification. Residents of and travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, India, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America [have been infected].\n\nIndividuals at greater risk of serious complications due to the virus include infants, elderly people, and people with chronic medical conditions.\n\nIf clinical development progresses, the PaxVax vaccine could become the 1st approved by the FDA for the prevention of chikungunya [virus infection]. Eva Harris, PhD, director, Center for Global Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, said the field is in \"desperate need for a medical and public health intervention.\"\n\n\"It is exciting to see this vaccine candidate moving forward with Fast Track designation as this is an extremely debilitating disease with the potential for causing serious long-term sequelae,\" Harris said in a statement.\n\nLisa Danzig, MD, chief medical officer, ParVax, said the Fast Track designation is yet another positive step for the vaccine's development, as well as being a recognition of the unmet clinical need.\n\n\"This is another example of the capabilities of our technology platform and our steadfast commitment to developing specialty vaccines that protect against overlooked infectious diseases, as mosquito-borne diseases continue to increase due to air travel and warmer weather,\" Danzig said.\n\nResults of the phase 2B trial are expected to be finalized in early 2019.\n\n[Byline: Kevin Kunzmann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that the phase 2B trials elicit good immune responses for this vaccine and the one in the report above and will open the way for phase 3 trials and licensure of the vaccine.

Kim, Julie M. Fox, Sharmila Nair, Katherine Basore, William B. Klimstra, et al. Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\nAbstract\nArthritogenic alphaviruses comprise a group of enveloped RNA viruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease. The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screen to identify the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya, Ross River, Mayaro and O'nyong nyong viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced levels of viral infection of cells and, reciprocally, ectopic expression of these genes resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to chikungunya virus particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc fusion protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked chikungunya virus infection in multiple cell types, including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of chikungunya virus E2 protein, which are a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of the Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies to mice reduced chikungunya and O'nyong nyong virus infection as well as associated foot swelling. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[Knowing the cellular receptor may permit development of drugs or antibodies on a commercial scale that can block cell attachment by the virus.

Elbadry, Bernard A. Okech, et al. A new \"American\" subgroup of African-lineage Chikungunya virus detected in and isolated from mosquitoes collected in Haiti, 2016.\n\nAbstract\nAs part of on-going arboviral surveillance activity in a semi-rural region in Haiti, chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-positive mosquito pools were identified in 2014 (the peak of the Caribbean Asian-clade epidemic), and again in 2016 by RT-PCR. In 2014, CHIKV was only identified in _Aedes aegypti_ (11 positive pools/124 screened). In contrast, in sampling in 2016, CHIKV was not identified in _Ae. aegypti_, but, rather, in (a) a female _Aedes albopictus_ pool, and (b) a female _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pool. Genomic sequence analyses indicated that the CHIKV viruses in the 2016 mosquito pools were from the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage, rather than the Asian lineage. In phylogenetic studies, these ECSA lineage strains form a new ECSA subgroup (subgroup IIa) together with Brazilian ECSA lineage strains from an isolated human outbreak in 2014, and a mosquito pool in 2016. Additional analyses date the most recent common ancestor of the ECSA IIa subgroup around May 2007, and the 2016 Haitian CHIKV genomes around December 2015. Known CHIKV mutations associated with improved _Ae. albopictus_ vector competence were not identified. Isolation of this newly identified lineage from _Ae. albopictus_ is of concern, as this vector has a broader geographic range than _Ae. aegypti_, especially in temperate areas of North America, and stresses the importance for continued vector surveillance.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The isolation of this new lineage of chikungunya virus from _Aedes albopictus_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pools is an important 1st step in pointing the way to laboratory studies that would establish their susceptibility to the virus and ability (or not) to transmit it efficiently.

Evidence of vertical transmission of Zika virus in field-collected eggs of _Aedes aegypti_ in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nArboviruses are viruses transmitted to humans and other animals by the bite of hematophagous arthropods. Infections caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and the deadlier yellow fever virus (YFV) are current public health problems in several countries, mainly those located in tropical and subtropical regions. One of the main prevention strategies continues to be vector control, with the elimination of breeding sites and surveillance of infested areas. The use of ovitraps for _Aedes_ mosquitos monitoring has already demonstrated promising results, and maybe be also useful for arboviral surveillance.\n\nMethods\nThis work aimed to detect natural vertical transmission of arboviruses in _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Mosquito egg collection was carried out using ovitraps in Itacoatiara, a mid-size city in Amazonas state, Brazil. Collected eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae were tested for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA by RT-qPCR.\n\nResults\nA total of 2057 specimens (1793 _Ae. aegypti_ and 264 _Ae. albopictus_), in 154 larvae pools were processed. Results showed one positive pool for CHIKV and one positive pool for ZIKV. The active ZIKV infection was further confirmed by the detection of the negative-strand viral RNA and nucleotide sequencing which confirmed the Asian genotype. The Infection Rate per 1000 mosquitoes tested was assessed by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with 0.45 and 0.44 for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, and by Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) with 0.45 for both viruses.\n\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st detection of ZIKV in natural vertical transmission in the _Ae. aegypti_, a fact that may contribute to ZIKV maintenance in nature during epidemics periods. Furthermore, our results highlight that the use of ovitraps and the molecular detection of arbovirus may contribute to health surveillance, directing the efforts to more efficient transmission blockade.\n\nAuthor summary\nThe control of the vast majority of arbovirus infections relies on entomological measures to reduce mosquito infestation. Therefore, this study analyzed the use of ovitraps for arboviral surveillance in a mid-size city of the Amazonas state, Brazil. We found one larva pool infected with chikungunya virus, before the 1st human case confirmed in this municipality.

Recent outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Africa and Asia are driven by a variant carrying mutations associated with increased fitness for _Aedes aegypti_.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In 2016, a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak was reported in Mandera, Kenya. This was the 1st major CHIKV outbreak in the country since the global re-emergence of this virus, which arose as an initial outbreak in Kenya in 2004. Therefore, we collected samples and sequenced viral genomes from the 2016 Mandera outbreak.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: All Kenyan genomes contained 2 mutations, E1:K211E and E2:V264A, recently reported to have an association with increased infectivity, dissemination and transmission in the _Aedes aegypti_ vector. Phylogeographic inference of temporal and spatial virus relationships using Bayesian approaches showed that this _Ae. aegypti_ adapted strain emerged within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) lineage of CHIKV between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India. It was also in India where the 1st large outbreak caused by this strain appeared, in New Delhi, 2010. More importantly, our results also showed that this strain is no longer contained in India, and that it has more recently caused several major outbreaks of CHIKV, including the 2016 outbreaks in India, Pakistan and Kenya, and the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh. In addition to its capability to cause large outbreaks in different regions of the world, this CHIKV strain has the capacity to replace less adapted wild type strains in _Ae. aegypti_-rich regions. Indeed, all the latest full CHIKV genomes of the ECSA Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL), from the regions of high _Ae. aegypti_ prevalence, carry these 2 mutations, including samples collected in Japan, Australia, and China.\n\nConclusions/Significance: Our results point to the importance of continued genomic-based surveillance of this strain's global spread, and they prompt urgent vector competence studies in Asian and African countries, in order to assess the level of vector receptiveness, virus transmission, and the impact this might have on this strain's ability to cause major outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The authors make a good case for the need to assess chikungunya virus genomic variation and the relationship of these variants to _Aedes aegypti_ vector efficiency as they relate to the risk of outbreaks. Unfortunately, it is not easy to attract the resources necessary to do these kinds of studies in advance of a possible outbreak. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] _Aedes albopictus_ in Europe\nDate: Thu 19 Jul 2018\nSource: Eurosurveillance Volume 23, Issue 29 [edited]\nhttps://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.29.1800033\n\n\nHeitmann Anna, Jansen Stephanie, Luhken Renke, Helms Michelle, Pluskota Bjorn, Becker Norbert, Kuhn Carola, Schmidt-Chanasit Jonas, Tannich Egbert. Experimental risk assessment for chikungunya virus transmission based on vector competence, distribution and temperature suitability in Europe, 2018.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nOver the last decade, the abundant distribution of the Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ in southern Europe and the import of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) by infected travellers has resulted in at least 5 local outbreaks of chikungunya fever in France and Italy. Considering the ongoing spread of _Ae. albopictus_ to central Europe, we performed an analysis of the Europe-wide spatial risk of CHIKV transmission under different temperature conditions.\n\nMethods\n_Ae. albopictus_ specimens from Germany and Italy were orally infected with CHIKV from an outbreak in France and kept for 2 weeks at 18 C, 21 C or 24 C [64 F, 70 F or 75 F]. A salivation assay was conducted to detect infectious CHIKV.\n\nResults\nAnalyses of mosquito saliva for infectious virus particles demonstrated transmission rates (TRs) of\u2009over 35 percent. Highest TRs of 50 percent for the mosquito population from Germany were detected at 18 C, while the Italian population had highest TRs of 63 percent at 18 C and 21 C, respectively. Temperature data indicated a potential risk of CHIKV transmission for extended durations, i.e. sufficiently long time periods allowing extrinsic incubation of the virus. This was shown for areas already colonised by _Ae. albopictus_, as well as for large parts of central Europe that are not colonised.\n\nConclusion\nThe current risk of CHIKV transmission in Europe is not primarily restricted by temperature, which allows extrinsic incubation of the virus, but rather by the vector distribution. Accordingly, all European countries with established populations of _Ae. albopictus_ should implement respective entomological surveillance and monitoring systems, as basis for suitable control measures.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nand\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The 3 CHIKV outbreaks in France and 2 in Italy between 2007-2017 highlight the risk of autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Europe. This is a dynamic situation and can be expected to change as global warming is likely to extend the range of _Ae. albopictus_ northward into Europe. Interested readers are encouraged to access the full article with its table and maps. The risk map of CHIKV transmission is especially interesting.\n\nIn a related study the investigators compared the vector competence of an Italian population of _Aedes albopictus_ for 2 strains of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), with and without E1:A226V mutation, responsible for outbreaks in 2007 in the Emilia Romagna region and 2017 in the Lazio and Calabria regions, respectively. _Ae. albopictus_ showed similar vector competence for both viral strains, indicating that the E1:A226V mutation is not exclusively responsible for the ability of CHIKV to replicate well in this mosquito species.

The participants had produced antibodies to protect themselves against chikungunya 4 weeks after injections of its lead candidate vaccine.\n\n\"Up to 100 percent were protected after 2 vaccinations,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"We also had excellent safety observations.\"\n\nThemis makes the vaccine by modifying the measles vaccine Schwarz strain to express an antigen for chikungunya [virus]. The measles vaccine has been used in billions in people, so its safety and efficacy are well established.\n\nChikungunya [virus causes] a serious disease that causes joint pains and fever. Often resembling dengue fever in the initial stages, it is usually transmitted by mosquitoes from the _Aedes_ genus in tropical regions, but outbreaks have been recorded in Europe, such as in Italy last year [2017].\n\n\"The mosquito is now endemic in Southern Europe,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"Countries like Austria, France and Croatia can have outbreaks now.\"\n\nFurthermore, as globalization and climate change trends continue, Tauber told me that we will need more treatments for tropical diseases across the world. \"We are going to have more of the so-called tropical infections in the future than we have had in the past.\"\n\nAs there is currently no treatment or vaccine in the market for chikungunya. Themis' vaccine, if approved, would have the advantage of being 1st to market. Themis is planning to start a Phase III trial of the chikungunya treatment in early 2020.\n\nOther companies are also developing treatments for insect-borne diseases. Instead of vaccines, UK biotech Oxitec has released genetically engineered mosquitoes in Brazil that die out before they can pass on diseases. The Swiss company Humabs has an antibody treatment for Zika in preclinical development.\n\n[Byline: Jonathan Smith]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Vaccine fast tracked\nDate: Fri 4 May 2018\nSource: MD [edited]\nhttps://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/potential-chikungunya-virus-vaccine-designated-for-fda-fast-track\n\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to an investigative vaccine designed to prevent disease caused by chikungunya virus.\n\nPaxVax, an independent specialty vaccine company, is developing the prophylaxis. Chikungunya [virus causes] a disease which includes headache, muscle pain, skin rash, and severe joint pain that can persist for years and spreads through mosquito bites and can result in widespread outbreaks. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of infectious diseases transmitted from tick, flea, and mosquito bites to humans has more than tripled in the US in recent years.\n\nTrials for the PaxVax vaccine, which is a virus-like particle (VLP) treatment licensed from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently began enrolling for a 400-paitent phase 2B dose-finding study. A previous phase 2A study conducted by the NIAID's parent organization the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tested the vaccine's effects in participants.\n\nThe virus is arthropod-borne and shares a close relation to other viruses identified in Africa, South America, and Australia. It's a small, spherical RNA virus vectored by the daytime-biting _Aedes aegypti _mosquito, better known for transmitting Zika virus, yellow fever, and dengue viruses.\n\nChikungunya [virus infection] has only recently become a domestic issue. The 1st local transmission of the disease in the Americas was diagnosed in the Caribbean in late 2013, but it has since been identified in 45 countries in the Western hemisphere. The Pan American Health Organization has identified more than 1.7 million possible cases since the 1st identification. Residents of and travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, India, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America [have been infected].\n\nIndividuals at greater risk of serious complications due to the virus include infants, elderly people, and people with chronic medical conditions.\n\nIf clinical development progresses, the PaxVax vaccine could become the 1st approved by the FDA for the prevention of chikungunya [virus infection]. Eva Harris, PhD, director, Center for Global Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, said the field is in \"desperate need for a medical and public health intervention.\"\n\n\"It is exciting to see this vaccine candidate moving forward with Fast Track designation as this is an extremely debilitating disease with the potential for causing serious long-term sequelae,\" Harris said in a statement.\n\nLisa Danzig, MD, chief medical officer, ParVax, said the Fast Track designation is yet another positive step for the vaccine's development, as well as being a recognition of the unmet clinical need.\n\n\"This is another example of the capabilities of our technology platform and our steadfast commitment to developing specialty vaccines that protect against overlooked infectious diseases, as mosquito-borne diseases continue to increase due to air travel and warmer weather,\" Danzig said.\n\nResults of the phase 2B trial are expected to be finalized in early 2019.\n\n[Byline: Kevin Kunzmann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that the phase 2B trials elicit good immune responses for this vaccine and the one in the report above and will open the way for phase 3 trials and licensure of the vaccine.

Kim, Julie M. Fox, Sharmila Nair, Katherine Basore, William B. Klimstra, et al. Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\nAbstract\nArthritogenic alphaviruses comprise a group of enveloped RNA viruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease. The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screen to identify the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya, Ross River, Mayaro and O'nyong nyong viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced levels of viral infection of cells and, reciprocally, ectopic expression of these genes resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to chikungunya virus particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc fusion protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked chikungunya virus infection in multiple cell types, including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of chikungunya virus E2 protein, which are a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of the Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies to mice reduced chikungunya and O'nyong nyong virus infection as well as associated foot swelling. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[Knowing the cellular receptor may permit development of drugs or antibodies on a commercial scale that can block cell attachment by the virus. It will be interesting to see whether that blockage is as effective in animals, and eventually humans, as it is in cell cultures. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[8] New virus subgroup\nDate: Thu 10 May 2018\nSource: PLoS One [edited]\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196857\n\n\nSarah Keller White, Carla Mavian ,Marco Salemi, John Glenn Morris Jr., Maha A. Elbadry, Bernard A. Okech, et al. A new \"American\" subgroup of African-lineage Chikungunya virus detected in and isolated from mosquitoes collected in Haiti, 2016.\n\nAbstract\nAs part of on-going arboviral surveillance activity in a semi-rural region in Haiti, chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-positive mosquito pools were identified in 2014 (the peak of the Caribbean Asian-clade epidemic), and again in 2016 by RT-PCR. In 2014, CHIKV was only identified in _Aedes aegypti_ (11 positive pools/124 screened). In contrast, in sampling in 2016, CHIKV was not identified in _Ae. aegypti_, but, rather, in (a) a female _Aedes albopictus_ pool, and (b) a female _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pool. Genomic sequence analyses indicated that the CHIKV viruses in the 2016 mosquito pools were from the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage, rather than the Asian lineage. In phylogenetic studies, these ECSA lineage strains form a new ECSA subgroup (subgroup IIa) together with Brazilian ECSA lineage strains from an isolated human outbreak in 2014, and a mosquito pool in 2016. Additional analyses date the most recent common ancestor of the ECSA IIa subgroup around May 2007, and the 2016 Haitian CHIKV genomes around December 2015. Known CHIKV mutations associated with improved _Ae. albopictus_ vector competence were not identified. Isolation of this newly identified lineage from _Ae. albopictus_ is of concern, as this vector has a broader geographic range than _Ae. aegypti_, especially in temperate areas of North America, and stresses the importance for continued vector surveillance.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The isolation of this new lineage of chikungunya virus from _Aedes albopictus_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pools is an important 1st step in pointing the way to laboratory studies that would establish their susceptibility to the virus and ability (or not) to transmit it efficiently. It is reasonable to assume that new lineages of CHIKV will emerge over time. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (07): Africa (Sudan) mixed outbreak 20181011.6085457\nChikungunya (06): Africa (Sudan)

Evidence of vertical transmission of Zika virus in field-collected eggs of _Aedes aegypti_ in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nArboviruses are viruses transmitted to humans and other animals by the bite of hematophagous arthropods. Infections caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and the deadlier yellow fever virus (YFV) are current public health problems in several countries, mainly those located in tropical and subtropical regions. One of the main prevention strategies continues to be vector control, with the elimination of breeding sites and surveillance of infested areas. The use of ovitraps for _Aedes_ mosquitos monitoring has already demonstrated promising results, and maybe be also useful for arboviral surveillance.\n\nMethods\nThis work aimed to detect natural vertical transmission of arboviruses in _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Mosquito egg collection was carried out using ovitraps in Itacoatiara, a mid-size city in Amazonas state, Brazil. Collected eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae were tested for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA by RT-qPCR.\n\nResults\nA total of 2057 specimens (1793 _Ae. aegypti_ and 264 _Ae. albopictus_), in 154 larvae pools were processed. Results showed one positive pool for CHIKV and one positive pool for ZIKV. The active ZIKV infection was further confirmed by the detection of the negative-strand viral RNA and nucleotide sequencing which confirmed the Asian genotype. The Infection Rate per 1000 mosquitoes tested was assessed by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with 0.45 and 0.44 for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, and by Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) with 0.45 for both viruses.\n\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st detection of ZIKV in natural vertical transmission in the _Ae. aegypti_, a fact that may contribute to ZIKV maintenance in nature during epidemics periods. Furthermore, our results highlight that the use of ovitraps and the molecular detection of arbovirus may contribute to health surveillance, directing the efforts to more efficient transmission blockade.\n\nAuthor summary\nThe control of the vast majority of arbovirus infections relies on entomological measures to reduce mosquito infestation. Therefore, this study analyzed the use of ovitraps for arboviral surveillance in a mid-size city of the Amazonas state, Brazil. We found one larva pool infected with chikungunya virus, before the 1st human case confirmed in this municipality. Another pool was infected with Zika virus, demonstrating the 1st evidence that vertical transmission occurs in naturally infected _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito populations.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The detection of transovarial transmission (TOT) is of epidemiological significance. Should TOT be efficient, the virus might be sustained in _Aedes aegypti_ populations without requiring human infectious blood meals and making control of the virus difficult. Further field and laboratory studies are needed to determine TOT efficiency. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] Virus variants and vectors\nDate: Fri 20 Jul 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/373316 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/20/373316\n\n\nIrina Maljkovic Berry, Fredrick Eyase, Simon Pollett, Limbaso, S Konongoi, Katherine Figueroa, Victor Ofula, et al. Recent outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Africa and Asia are driven by a variant carrying mutations associated with increased fitness for _Aedes aegypti_.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In 2016, a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak was reported in Mandera, Kenya. This was the 1st major CHIKV outbreak in the country since the global re-emergence of this virus, which arose as an initial outbreak in Kenya in 2004. Therefore, we collected samples and sequenced viral genomes from the 2016 Mandera outbreak.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: All Kenyan genomes contained 2 mutations, E1:K211E and E2:V264A, recently reported to have an association with increased infectivity, dissemination and transmission in the _Aedes aegypti_ vector. Phylogeographic inference of temporal and spatial virus relationships using Bayesian approaches showed that this _Ae. aegypti_ adapted strain emerged within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) lineage of CHIKV between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India. It was also in India where the 1st large outbreak caused by this strain appeared, in New Delhi, 2010. More importantly, our results also showed that this strain is no longer contained in India, and that it has more recently caused several major outbreaks of CHIKV, including the 2016 outbreaks in India, Pakistan and Kenya, and the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh. In addition to its capability to cause large outbreaks in different regions of the world, this CHIKV strain has the capacity to replace less adapted wild type strains in _Ae. aegypti_-rich regions. Indeed, all the latest full CHIKV genomes of the ECSA Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL), from the regions of high _Ae. aegypti_ prevalence, carry these 2 mutations, including samples collected in Japan, Australia, and China.\n\nConclusions/Significance: Our results point to the importance of continued genomic-based surveillance of this strain's global spread, and they prompt urgent vector competence studies in Asian and African countries, in order to assess the level of vector receptiveness, virus transmission, and the impact this might have on this strain's ability to cause major outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The authors make a good case for the need to assess chikungunya virus genomic variation and the relationship of these variants to _Aedes aegypti_ vector efficiency as they relate to the risk of outbreaks. Unfortunately, it is not easy to attract the resources necessary to do these kinds of studies in advance of a possible outbreak. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] _Aedes albopictus_ in Europe\nDate: Thu 19 Jul 2018\nSource: Eurosurveillance Volume 23, Issue 29 [edited]\nhttps://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.29.1800033\n\n\nHeitmann Anna, Jansen Stephanie, Luhken Renke, Helms Michelle, Pluskota Bjorn, Becker Norbert, Kuhn Carola, Schmidt-Chanasit Jonas, Tannich Egbert. Experimental risk assessment for chikungunya virus transmission based on vector competence, distribution and temperature suitability in Europe, 2018.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nOver the last decade, the abundant distribution of the Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ in southern Europe and the import of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) by infected travellers has resulted in at least 5 local outbreaks of chikungunya fever in France and Italy. Considering the ongoing spread of _Ae. albopictus_ to central Europe, we performed an analysis of the Europe-wide spatial risk of CHIKV transmission under different temperature conditions.\n\nMethods\n_Ae. albopictus_ specimens from Germany and Italy were orally infected with CHIKV from an outbreak in France and kept for 2 weeks at 18 C, 21 C or 24 C [64 F, 70 F or 75 F]. A salivation assay was conducted to detect infectious CHIKV.\n\nResults\nAnalyses of mosquito saliva for infectious virus particles demonstrated transmission rates (TRs) of\u2009over 35 percent. Highest TRs of 50 percent for the mosquito population from Germany were detected at 18 C, while the Italian population had highest TRs of 63 percent at 18 C and 21 C, respectively. Temperature data indicated a potential risk of CHIKV transmission for extended durations, i.e. sufficiently long time periods allowing extrinsic incubation of the virus. This was shown for areas already colonised by _Ae. albopictus_, as well as for large parts of central Europe that are not colonised.\n\nConclusion\nThe current risk of CHIKV transmission in Europe is not primarily restricted by temperature, which allows extrinsic incubation of the virus, but rather by the vector distribution. Accordingly, all European countries with established populations of _Ae. albopictus_ should implement respective entomological surveillance and monitoring systems, as basis for suitable control measures.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nand\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The 3 CHIKV outbreaks in France and 2 in Italy between 2007-2017 highlight the risk of autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Europe. This is a dynamic situation and can be expected to change as global warming is likely to extend the range of _Ae. albopictus_ northward into Europe. Interested readers are encouraged to access the full article with its table and maps. The risk map of CHIKV transmission is especially interesting.\n\nIn a related study the investigators compared the vector competence of an Italian population of _Aedes albopictus_ for 2 strains of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), with and without E1:A226V mutation, responsible for outbreaks in 2007 in the Emilia Romagna region and 2017 in the Lazio and Calabria regions, respectively. _Ae. albopictus_ showed similar vector competence for both viral strains, indicating that the E1:A226V mutation is not exclusively responsible for the ability of CHIKV to replicate well in this mosquito species.

The participants had produced antibodies to protect themselves against chikungunya 4 weeks after injections of its lead candidate vaccine.\n\n\"Up to 100 percent were protected after 2 vaccinations,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"We also had excellent safety observations.\"\n\nThemis makes the vaccine by modifying the measles vaccine Schwarz strain to express an antigen for chikungunya [virus]. The measles vaccine has been used in billions in people, so its safety and efficacy are well established.\n\nChikungunya [virus causes] a serious disease that causes joint pains and fever. Often resembling dengue fever in the initial stages, it is usually transmitted by mosquitoes from the _Aedes_ genus in tropical regions, but outbreaks have been recorded in Europe, such as in Italy last year [2017].\n\n\"The mosquito is now endemic in Southern Europe,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"Countries like Austria, France and Croatia can have outbreaks now.\"\n\nFurthermore, as globalization and climate change trends continue, Tauber told me that we will need more treatments for tropical diseases across the world. \"We are going to have more of the so-called tropical infections in the future than we have had in the past.\"\n\nAs there is currently no treatment or vaccine in the market for chikungunya. Themis' vaccine, if approved, would have the advantage of being 1st to market. Themis is planning to start a Phase III trial of the chikungunya treatment in early 2020.\n\nOther companies are also developing treatments for insect-borne diseases. Instead of vaccines, UK biotech Oxitec has released genetically engineered mosquitoes in Brazil that die out before they can pass on diseases. The Swiss company Humabs has an antibody treatment for Zika in preclinical development.\n\n[Byline: Jonathan Smith]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Vaccine fast tracked\nDate: Fri 4 May 2018\nSource: MD [edited]\nhttps://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/potential-chikungunya-virus-vaccine-designated-for-fda-fast-track\n\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to an investigative vaccine designed to prevent disease caused by chikungunya virus.\n\nPaxVax, an independent specialty vaccine company, is developing the prophylaxis. Chikungunya [virus causes] a disease which includes headache, muscle pain, skin rash, and severe joint pain that can persist for years and spreads through mosquito bites and can result in widespread outbreaks. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of infectious diseases transmitted from tick, flea, and mosquito bites to humans has more than tripled in the US in recent years.\n\nTrials for the PaxVax vaccine, which is a virus-like particle (VLP) treatment licensed from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently began enrolling for a 400-paitent phase 2B dose-finding study. A previous phase 2A study conducted by the NIAID's parent organization the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tested the vaccine's effects in participants.\n\nThe virus is arthropod-borne and shares a close relation to other viruses identified in Africa, South America, and Australia. It's a small, spherical RNA virus vectored by the daytime-biting _Aedes aegypti _mosquito, better known for transmitting Zika virus, yellow fever, and dengue viruses.\n\nChikungunya [virus infection] has only recently become a domestic issue. The 1st local transmission of the disease in the Americas was diagnosed in the Caribbean in late 2013, but it has since been identified in 45 countries in the Western hemisphere. The Pan American Health Organization has identified more than 1.7 million possible cases since the 1st identification. Residents of and travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, India, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America [have been infected].\n\nIndividuals at greater risk of serious complications due to the virus include infants, elderly people, and people with chronic medical conditions.\n\nIf clinical development progresses, the PaxVax vaccine could become the 1st approved by the FDA for the prevention of chikungunya [virus infection]. Eva Harris, PhD, director, Center for Global Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, said the field is in \"desperate need for a medical and public health intervention.\"\n\n\"It is exciting to see this vaccine candidate moving forward with Fast Track designation as this is an extremely debilitating disease with the potential for causing serious long-term sequelae,\" Harris said in a statement.\n\nLisa Danzig, MD, chief medical officer, ParVax, said the Fast Track designation is yet another positive step for the vaccine's development, as well as being a recognition of the unmet clinical need.\n\n\"This is another example of the capabilities of our technology platform and our steadfast commitment to developing specialty vaccines that protect against overlooked infectious diseases, as mosquito-borne diseases continue to increase due to air travel and warmer weather,\" Danzig said.\n\nResults of the phase 2B trial are expected to be finalized in early 2019.\n\n[Byline: Kevin Kunzmann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that the phase 2B trials elicit good immune responses for this vaccine and the one in the report above and will open the way for phase 3 trials and licensure of the vaccine.

Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced levels of viral infection of cells and, reciprocally, ectopic expression of these genes resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to chikungunya virus particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc fusion protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked chikungunya virus infection in multiple cell types, including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of chikungunya virus E2 protein, which are a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of the Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies to mice reduced chikungunya and O'nyong nyong virus infection as well as associated foot swelling. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[Knowing the cellular receptor may permit development of drugs or antibodies on a commercial scale that can block cell attachment by the virus. It will be interesting to see whether that blockage is as effective in animals, and eventually humans, as it is in cell cultures. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[8] New virus subgroup\nDate: Thu 10 May 2018\nSource: PLoS One [edited]\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196857\n\n\nSarah Keller White, Carla Mavian ,Marco Salemi, John Glenn Morris Jr., Maha A. Elbadry, Bernard A. Okech, et al. A new \"American\" subgroup of African-lineage Chikungunya virus detected in and isolated from mosquitoes collected in Haiti, 2016.\n\nAbstract\nAs part of on-going arboviral surveillance activity in a semi-rural region in Haiti, chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-positive mosquito pools were identified in 2014 (the peak of the Caribbean Asian-clade epidemic), and again in 2016 by RT-PCR. In 2014, CHIKV was only identified in _Aedes aegypti_ (11 positive pools/124 screened). In contrast, in sampling in 2016, CHIKV was not identified in _Ae. aegypti_, but, rather, in (a) a female _Aedes albopictus_ pool, and (b) a female _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pool. Genomic sequence analyses indicated that the CHIKV viruses in the 2016 mosquito pools were from the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage, rather than the Asian lineage. In phylogenetic studies, these ECSA lineage strains form a new ECSA subgroup (subgroup IIa) together with Brazilian ECSA lineage strains from an isolated human outbreak in 2014, and a mosquito pool in 2016. Additional analyses date the most recent common ancestor of the ECSA IIa subgroup around May 2007, and the 2016 Haitian CHIKV genomes around December 2015. Known CHIKV mutations associated with improved _Ae. albopictus_ vector competence were not identified. Isolation of this newly identified lineage from _Ae. albopictus_ is of concern, as this vector has a broader geographic range than _Ae. aegypti_, especially in temperate areas of North America, and stresses the importance for continued vector surveillance.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The isolation of this new lineage of chikungunya virus from _Aedes albopictus_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pools is an important 1st step in pointing the way to laboratory studies that would establish their susceptibility to the virus and ability (or not) to transmit it efficiently. It is reasonable to assume that new lineages of CHIKV will emerge over time. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (07): Africa (Sudan) mixed outbreak 20181011.6085457\nChikungunya (06): Africa (Sudan)

Evidence of vertical transmission of Zika virus in field-collected eggs of _Aedes aegypti_ in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nArboviruses are viruses transmitted to humans and other animals by the bite of hematophagous arthropods. Infections caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and the deadlier yellow fever virus (YFV) are current public health problems in several countries, mainly those located in tropical and subtropical regions. One of the main prevention strategies continues to be vector control, with the elimination of breeding sites and surveillance of infested areas. The use of ovitraps for _Aedes_ mosquitos monitoring has already demonstrated promising results, and maybe be also useful for arboviral surveillance.\n\nMethods\nThis work aimed to detect natural vertical transmission of arboviruses in _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Mosquito egg collection was carried out using ovitraps in Itacoatiara, a mid-size city in Amazonas state, Brazil. Collected eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae were tested for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA by RT-qPCR.\n\nResults\nA total of 2057 specimens (1793 _Ae. aegypti_ and 264 _Ae. albopictus_), in 154 larvae pools were processed. Results showed one positive pool for CHIKV and one positive pool for ZIKV. The active ZIKV infection was further confirmed by the detection of the negative-strand viral RNA and nucleotide sequencing which confirmed the Asian genotype. The Infection Rate per 1000 mosquitoes tested was assessed by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with 0.45 and 0.44 for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, and by Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) with 0.45 for both viruses.\n\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st detection of ZIKV in natural vertical transmission in the _Ae. aegypti_, a fact that may contribute to ZIKV maintenance in nature during epidemics periods. Furthermore, our results highlight that the use of ovitraps and the molecular detection of arbovirus may contribute to health surveillance, directing the efforts to more efficient transmission blockade.\n\nAuthor summary\nThe control of the vast majority of arbovirus infections relies on entomological measures to reduce mosquito infestation. Therefore, this study analyzed the use of ovitraps for arboviral surveillance in a mid-size city of the Amazonas state, Brazil. We found one larva pool infected with chikungunya virus, before the 1st human case confirmed in this municipality. Another pool was infected with Zika virus, demonstrating the 1st evidence that vertical transmission occurs in naturally infected _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito populations.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The detection of transovarial transmission (TOT) is of epidemiological significance. Should TOT be efficient, the virus might be sustained in _Aedes aegypti_ populations without requiring human infectious blood meals and making control of the virus difficult. Further field and laboratory studies are needed to determine TOT efficiency. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] Virus variants and vectors\nDate: Fri 20 Jul 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/373316 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/20/373316\n\n\nIrina Maljkovic Berry, Fredrick Eyase, Simon Pollett, Limbaso, S Konongoi, Katherine Figueroa, Victor Ofula, et al. Recent outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Africa and Asia are driven by a variant carrying mutations associated with increased fitness for _Aedes aegypti_.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In 2016, a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak was reported in Mandera, Kenya. This was the 1st major CHIKV outbreak in the country since the global re-emergence of this virus, which arose as an initial outbreak in Kenya in 2004. Therefore, we collected samples and sequenced viral genomes from the 2016 Mandera outbreak.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: All Kenyan genomes contained 2 mutations, E1:K211E and E2:V264A, recently reported to have an association with increased infectivity, dissemination and transmission in the _Aedes aegypti_ vector. Phylogeographic inference of temporal and spatial virus relationships using Bayesian approaches showed that this _Ae. aegypti_ adapted strain emerged within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) lineage of CHIKV between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India. It was also in India where the 1st large outbreak caused by this strain appeared, in New Delhi, 2010. More importantly, our results also showed that this strain is no longer contained in India, and that it has more recently caused several major outbreaks of CHIKV, including the 2016 outbreaks in India, Pakistan and Kenya, and the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh. In addition to its capability to cause large outbreaks in different regions of the world, this CHIKV strain has the capacity to replace less adapted wild type strains in _Ae. aegypti_-rich regions. Indeed, all the latest full CHIKV genomes of the ECSA Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL), from the regions of high _Ae. aegypti_ prevalence, carry these 2 mutations, including samples collected in Japan, Australia, and China.\n\nConclusions/Significance: Our results point to the importance of continued genomic-based surveillance of this strain's global spread, and they prompt urgent vector competence studies in Asian and African countries, in order to assess the level of vector receptiveness, virus transmission, and the impact this might have on this strain's ability to cause major outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The authors make a good case for the need to assess chikungunya virus genomic variation and the relationship of these variants to _Aedes aegypti_ vector efficiency as they relate to the risk of outbreaks. Unfortunately, it is not easy to attract the resources necessary to do these kinds of studies in advance of a possible outbreak. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] _Aedes albopictus_ in Europe\nDate: Thu 19 Jul 2018\nSource: Eurosurveillance Volume 23, Issue 29 [edited]\nhttps://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.29.1800033\n\n\nHeitmann Anna, Jansen Stephanie, Luhken Renke, Helms Michelle, Pluskota Bjorn, Becker Norbert, Kuhn Carola, Schmidt-Chanasit Jonas, Tannich Egbert. Experimental risk assessment for chikungunya virus transmission based on vector competence, distribution and temperature suitability in Europe, 2018.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nOver the last decade, the abundant distribution of the Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ in southern Europe and the import of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) by infected travellers has resulted in at least 5 local outbreaks of chikungunya fever in France and Italy. Considering the ongoing spread of _Ae. albopictus_ to central Europe, we performed an analysis of the Europe-wide spatial risk of CHIKV transmission under different temperature conditions.\n\nMethods\n_Ae. albopictus_ specimens from Germany and Italy were orally infected with CHIKV from an outbreak in France and kept for 2 weeks at 18 C, 21 C or 24 C [64 F, 70 F or 75 F]. A salivation assay was conducted to detect infectious CHIKV.\n\nResults\nAnalyses of mosquito saliva for infectious virus particles demonstrated transmission rates (TRs) of\u2009over 35 percent. Highest TRs of 50 percent for the mosquito population from Germany were detected at 18 C, while the Italian population had highest TRs of 63 percent at 18 C and 21 C, respectively. Temperature data indicated a potential risk of CHIKV transmission for extended durations, i.e. sufficiently long time periods allowing extrinsic incubation of the virus. This was shown for areas already colonised by _Ae. albopictus_, as well as for large parts of central Europe that are not colonised.\n\nConclusion\nThe current risk of CHIKV transmission in Europe is not primarily restricted by temperature, which allows extrinsic incubation of the virus, but rather by the vector distribution. Accordingly, all European countries with established populations of _Ae. albopictus_ should implement respective entomological surveillance and monitoring systems, as basis for suitable control measures.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nand\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The 3 CHIKV outbreaks in France and 2 in Italy between 2007-2017 highlight the risk of autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Europe. This is a dynamic situation and can be expected to change as global warming is likely to extend the range of _Ae. albopictus_ northward into Europe. Interested readers are encouraged to access the full article with its table and maps. The risk map of CHIKV transmission is especially interesting.\n\nIn a related study the investigators compared the vector competence of an Italian population of _Aedes albopictus_ for 2 strains of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), with and without E1:A226V mutation, responsible for outbreaks in 2007 in the Emilia Romagna region and 2017 in the Lazio and Calabria regions, respectively. _Ae. albopictus_ showed similar vector competence for both viral strains, indicating that the E1:A226V mutation is not exclusively responsible for the ability of CHIKV to replicate well in this mosquito species.

The participants had produced antibodies to protect themselves against chikungunya 4 weeks after injections of its lead candidate vaccine.\n\n\"Up to 100 percent were protected after 2 vaccinations,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"We also had excellent safety observations.\"\n\nThemis makes the vaccine by modifying the measles vaccine Schwarz strain to express an antigen for chikungunya [virus]. The measles vaccine has been used in billions in people, so its safety and efficacy are well established.\n\nChikungunya [virus causes] a serious disease that causes joint pains and fever. Often resembling dengue fever in the initial stages, it is usually transmitted by mosquitoes from the _Aedes_ genus in tropical regions, but outbreaks have been recorded in Europe, such as in Italy last year [2017].\n\n\"The mosquito is now endemic in Southern Europe,\" Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. \"Countries like Austria, France and Croatia can have outbreaks now.\"\n\nFurthermore, as globalization and climate change trends continue, Tauber told me that we will need more treatments for tropical diseases across the world. \"We are going to have more of the so-called tropical infections in the future than we have had in the past.\"\n\nAs there is currently no treatment or vaccine in the market for chikungunya. Themis' vaccine, if approved, would have the advantage of being 1st to market. Themis is planning to start a Phase III trial of the chikungunya treatment in early 2020.\n\nOther companies are also developing treatments for insect-borne diseases. Instead of vaccines, UK biotech Oxitec has released genetically engineered mosquitoes in Brazil that die out before they can pass on diseases. The Swiss company Humabs has an antibody treatment for Zika in preclinical development.\n\n[Byline: Jonathan Smith]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Vaccine fast tracked\nDate: Fri 4 May 2018\nSource: MD [edited]\nhttps://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/potential-chikungunya-virus-vaccine-designated-for-fda-fast-track\n\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to an investigative vaccine designed to prevent disease caused by chikungunya virus.\n\nPaxVax, an independent specialty vaccine company, is developing the prophylaxis. Chikungunya [virus causes] a disease which includes headache, muscle pain, skin rash, and severe joint pain that can persist for years and spreads through mosquito bites and can result in widespread outbreaks. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of infectious diseases transmitted from tick, flea, and mosquito bites to humans has more than tripled in the US in recent years.\n\nTrials for the PaxVax vaccine, which is a virus-like particle (VLP) treatment licensed from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently began enrolling for a 400-paitent phase 2B dose-finding study. A previous phase 2A study conducted by the NIAID's parent organization the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tested the vaccine's effects in participants.\n\nThe virus is arthropod-borne and shares a close relation to other viruses identified in Africa, South America, and Australia. It's a small, spherical RNA virus vectored by the daytime-biting _Aedes aegypti _mosquito, better known for transmitting Zika virus, yellow fever, and dengue viruses.\n\nChikungunya [virus infection] has only recently become a domestic issue. The 1st local transmission of the disease in the Americas was diagnosed in the Caribbean in late 2013, but it has since been identified in 45 countries in the Western hemisphere. The Pan American Health Organization has identified more than 1.7 million possible cases since the 1st identification. Residents of and travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, India, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America [have been infected].\n\nIndividuals at greater risk of serious complications due to the virus include infants, elderly people, and people with chronic medical conditions.\n\nIf clinical development progresses, the PaxVax vaccine could become the 1st approved by the FDA for the prevention of chikungunya [virus infection]. Eva Harris, PhD, director, Center for Global Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, said the field is in \"desperate need for a medical and public health intervention.\"\n\n\"It is exciting to see this vaccine candidate moving forward with Fast Track designation as this is an extremely debilitating disease with the potential for causing serious long-term sequelae,\" Harris said in a statement.\n\nLisa Danzig, MD, chief medical officer, ParVax, said the Fast Track designation is yet another positive step for the vaccine's development, as well as being a recognition of the unmet clinical need.\n\n\"This is another example of the capabilities of our technology platform and our steadfast commitment to developing specialty vaccines that protect against overlooked infectious diseases, as mosquito-borne diseases continue to increase due to air travel and warmer weather,\" Danzig said.\n\nResults of the phase 2B trial are expected to be finalized in early 2019.\n\n[Byline: Kevin Kunzmann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that the phase 2B trials elicit good immune responses for this vaccine and the one in the report above and will open the way for phase 3 trials and licensure of the vaccine.

Kim, Julie M. Fox, Sharmila Nair, Katherine Basore, William B. Klimstra, et al. Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\nAbstract\nArthritogenic alphaviruses comprise a group of enveloped RNA viruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease. The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screen to identify the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya, Ross River, Mayaro and O'nyong nyong viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced levels of viral infection of cells and, reciprocally, ectopic expression of these genes resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to chikungunya virus particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc fusion protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked chikungunya virus infection in multiple cell types, including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of chikungunya virus E2 protein, which are a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of the Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies to mice reduced chikungunya and O'nyong nyong virus infection as well as associated foot swelling. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[Knowing the cellular receptor may permit development of drugs or antibodies on a commercial scale that can block cell attachment by the virus.

Elbadry, Bernard A. Okech, et al. A new \"American\" subgroup of African-lineage Chikungunya virus detected in and isolated from mosquitoes collected in Haiti, 2016.\n\nAbstract\nAs part of on-going arboviral surveillance activity in a semi-rural region in Haiti, chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-positive mosquito pools were identified in 2014 (the peak of the Caribbean Asian-clade epidemic), and again in 2016 by RT-PCR. In 2014, CHIKV was only identified in _Aedes aegypti_ (11 positive pools/124 screened). In contrast, in sampling in 2016, CHIKV was not identified in _Ae. aegypti_, but, rather, in (a) a female _Aedes albopictus_ pool, and (b) a female _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pool. Genomic sequence analyses indicated that the CHIKV viruses in the 2016 mosquito pools were from the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage, rather than the Asian lineage. In phylogenetic studies, these ECSA lineage strains form a new ECSA subgroup (subgroup IIa) together with Brazilian ECSA lineage strains from an isolated human outbreak in 2014, and a mosquito pool in 2016. Additional analyses date the most recent common ancestor of the ECSA IIa subgroup around May 2007, and the 2016 Haitian CHIKV genomes around December 2015. Known CHIKV mutations associated with improved _Ae. albopictus_ vector competence were not identified. Isolation of this newly identified lineage from _Ae. albopictus_ is of concern, as this vector has a broader geographic range than _Ae. aegypti_, especially in temperate areas of North America, and stresses the importance for continued vector surveillance.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels, Belgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The isolation of this new lineage of chikungunya virus from _Aedes albopictus_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pools is an important 1st step in pointing the way to laboratory studies that would establish their susceptibility to the virus and ability (or not) to transmit it efficiently.

Role of monkeys in the sylvatic cycle of chikungunya virus in Senegal. bioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/079046\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose the greatest risk of spillover into humans of any class of pathogens. Such spillover may occur as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a 2-step jump from the reservoir to a different amplification host species and thence to humans. Despite the widespread havoc wreaked by emerging arboviruses, little is known about their transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we used serosurveillance and mathematical modeling to elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Over 3 years, 219 African green monkeys, 78 patas monkeys, and 440 Guinea baboons were captured in the region surrounding Kedougou, Senegal. The age of each animal was determined by anthropometry and dentition, and exposure to CHIKV was determined by detection of neutralizing antibodies. We estimate age-specific CHIKV seroprevalence, force of infection (FoI), and basic reproductive number (R0) in each species. Among the different species, CHIKV FoI ranged from 0.13 to 1.12 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.81-2.28) and R0 ranged from 1.5 (CI 1.3-1.9) to 6.6 (CI 5.1-10.4). CHIKV infection of infant monkeys was detected even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of primatophilic mosquitoes and when population seropositivity, and therefore immunity, was too high for monkeys themselves to support continuous CHIKV transmission. We therefore conclude that monkeys in this region serve primarily as amplification rather than reservoir hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other vertebrate hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that a comprehensive serosurvey of other vertebrate animals will be undertaken in the areas where the positive monkeys were found, followed by laboratory tests of susceptibility to determine the amplitude and duration of viremia (if any) in the positive species. Similar studies are needed in the tropical Americas to determine is spill-back from humans to wild vertebrates, and especially non-human primates, has occurred there. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nKedougou, Senegal: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38299]\n\n******\n[3] Colombia: persistent arthralgia\nDate: Wed 20 Dec 2017\nSource: Arthritis and Rheumatology journal [edited]\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40384/abstract\n\n\nref: Chang AY, Encinales L, Porras A, et al.

Baseline and follow-up (20 months) symptoms were evaluated in serologically confirmed cases.\nResults\nAmong 500 patients enrolled, 485 cases were serologically confirmed with chikungunya [virus infections]. Patients were predominantly adults (age 49 +/- 16 years), female, had a high school or less level of education, and were of mestizo ethnicity. The most commonly affected joints were the small joints including the wrists, ankles, and fingers. The initial joint pain lasted a median of 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-8); 16 per cent of participants reported missing a median of 4 days (IQR 2-7) of school or work. After 20-months, 1/4 of the participants had persistent joint pain. A multivariable analysis indicated that significant predictors of persistent joint pain included college graduate status, initial symptoms of headache or knee pain, missed work, normal activities affected, 4 or more days of initial symptoms, and 4 or more weeks of initial pain.\nConclusions\nThis is the 1st report to describe the frequency of chikungunya-related arthritis in the Americas after a 20 month follow-up. The high frequency of chronic disease highlights the importance of development of prevention and treatment interventions.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are many anecdotal accounts of persistent and sometimes disabling persistent joint pain following chikungunya virus infections. The report above provides the results of a quantitative study of arthralgia, lasting 20 or more months following infection in a quarter of the study group. A follow up study of 36 pregnant women hospitalized in Colombia in 2015, 1 year after acute viremia, reported arthralgia in 2 or more joints in 13 patients. Despite disease severity, pregnant women with chikungunya should be treated in high-complexity obstetric units to rule out adverse outcomes. These women should also be followed up to treat potential relapses (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/11/17-0480_article). - Mod.TY]\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nAtl\u00e1ntico, Colombia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31670]\n\n******\n[4] Brazil: mortality\nDate: Mon 13 Nov 2017\nSource: PLoS (Public Library of Science) Currents Outbreaks journal [edited]\nhttp://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/excess-mortality-related-to-chikungunya-epidemics-in-the-context-of-co-circulation-of-other-arboviruses-in-brazil/\n\n\nFreitas ARR, Cavalcanti L, Von Zuben AP, Donalisio MR.

Studies in the Indian Ocean and India suggest that passive surveillance systems cannot recognize many of deaths associated with chikungunya, which can be inferred by an increase in the overall mortality observed during chikungunya epidemics.\nObjective\nWe assess the mortality associated with chikungunya epidemics in the most affected states in Brazil, from 2015 and 2016.\nMethods\nWe studied the monthly mortality by age group, comparing a period without epidemics to a chikungunya epidemic period, which we defined arbitrarily as consecutive months with incidences of more than 50 cases/100 000 persons.\nResults\nWe obtained official data from the National System of Reported Diseases (SINAN) and the Mortality Information System (SIM), both maintained by the Ministry of Health. We identified a significant increase in the all-cause mortality rate during chikungunya epidemics, while there was no similar mortality in the previous years, even during dengue epidemics. We estimated an excess of 4505 deaths in Pernambuco during the chikungunya epidemics (47.9 per 100 000 persons). The most affected age groups were the elderly and those under 1 year of age, and the same pattern occurred in all the states.\nDiscussion\nFurther studies at other sites are needed to confirm the association between increased mortality and chikungunya epidemics in different age groups. If these findings are confirmed, it will be necessary to revise the guidelines to recognize the actual mortality associated with chikungunya and to improve therapeutic approaches and protective measures in the most vulnerable groups.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although the case fatality rate has been very low, there have been sporadic deaths due to

Role of monkeys in the sylvatic cycle of chikungunya virus in Senegal. bioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/079046\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose the greatest risk of spillover into humans of any class of pathogens. Such spillover may occur as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a 2-step jump from the reservoir to a different amplification host species and thence to humans. Despite the widespread havoc wreaked by emerging arboviruses, little is known about their transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we used serosurveillance and mathematical modeling to elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Over 3 years, 219 African green monkeys, 78 patas monkeys, and 440 Guinea baboons were captured in the region surrounding Kedougou, Senegal. The age of each animal was determined by anthropometry and dentition, and exposure to CHIKV was determined by detection of neutralizing antibodies. We estimate age-specific CHIKV seroprevalence, force of infection (FoI), and basic reproductive number (R0) in each species. Among the different species, CHIKV FoI ranged from 0.13 to 1.12 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.81-2.28) and R0 ranged from 1.5 (CI 1.3-1.9) to 6.6 (CI 5.1-10.4). CHIKV infection of infant monkeys was detected even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of primatophilic mosquitoes and when population seropositivity, and therefore immunity, was too high for monkeys themselves to support continuous CHIKV transmission. We therefore conclude that monkeys in this region serve primarily as amplification rather than reservoir hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other vertebrate hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that a comprehensive serosurvey of other vertebrate animals will be undertaken in the areas where the positive monkeys were found, followed by laboratory tests of susceptibility to determine the amplitude and duration of viremia (if any) in the positive species. Similar studies are needed in the tropical Americas to determine is spill-back from humans to wild vertebrates, and especially non-human primates, has occurred there. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nKedougou, Senegal: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38299]\n\n******\n[3] Colombia: persistent arthralgia\nDate: Wed 20 Dec 2017\nSource: Arthritis and Rheumatology journal [edited]\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40384/abstract\n\n\nref: Chang AY, Encinales L, Porras A, et al.

[Epub ahead of print]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nObjective\nTo estimate the frequency of chronic joint pain after infection with chikungunya virus in a Latin American cohort.\nMethods\nA cross sectional follow-up of a prospective cohort of 500 chikungunya patients from Atl\u00e1ntico department, Colombia clinically diagnosed with chikungunya during the 2014-2015 Colombian epidemic. Baseline and follow-up (20 months) symptoms were evaluated in serologically confirmed cases.\nResults\nAmong 500 patients enrolled, 485 cases were serologically confirmed with chikungunya [virus infections]. Patients were predominantly adults (age 49 +/- 16 years), female, had a high school or less level of education, and were of mestizo ethnicity. The most commonly affected joints were the small joints including the wrists, ankles, and fingers. The initial joint pain lasted a median of 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-8); 16 per cent of participants reported missing a median of 4 days (IQR 2-7) of school or work. After 20-months, 1/4 of the participants had persistent joint pain. A multivariable analysis indicated that significant predictors of persistent joint pain included college graduate status, initial symptoms of headache or knee pain, missed work, normal activities affected, 4 or more days of initial symptoms, and 4 or more weeks of initial pain.\nConclusions\nThis is the 1st report to describe the frequency of chikungunya-related arthritis in the Americas after a 20 month follow-up. The high frequency of chronic disease highlights the importance of development of prevention and treatment interventions.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are many anecdotal accounts of persistent and sometimes disabling persistent joint pain following chikungunya virus infections. The report above provides the results of a quantitative study of arthralgia, lasting 20 or more months following infection in a quarter of the study group. A follow up study of 36 pregnant women hospitalized in Colombia in 2015, 1 year after acute viremia, reported arthralgia in 2 or more joints in 13 patients. Despite disease severity, pregnant women with chikungunya should be treated in high-complexity obstetric units to rule out adverse outcomes. These women should also be followed up to treat potential relapses (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/11/17-0480_article). - Mod.TY]\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nAtl\u00e1ntico, Colombia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31670]\n\n******\n[4] Brazil: mortality\nDate: Mon 13 Nov 2017\nSource: PLoS (Public Library of Science) Currents Outbreaks journal [edited]\nhttp://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/excess-mortality-related-to-chikungunya-epidemics-in-the-context-of-co-circulation-of-other-arboviruses-in-brazil/\n\n\nFreitas ARR, Cavalcanti L, Von Zuben AP, Donalisio MR.

Studies in the Indian Ocean and India suggest that passive surveillance systems cannot recognize many of deaths associated with chikungunya, which can be inferred by an increase in the overall mortality observed during chikungunya epidemics.\nObjective\nWe assess the mortality associated with chikungunya epidemics in the most affected states in Brazil, from 2015 and 2016.\nMethods\nWe studied the monthly mortality by age group, comparing a period without epidemics to a chikungunya epidemic period, which we defined arbitrarily as consecutive months with incidences of more than 50 cases/100 000 persons.\nResults\nWe obtained official data from the National System of Reported Diseases (SINAN) and the Mortality Information System (SIM), both maintained by the Ministry of Health. We identified a significant increase in the all-cause mortality rate during chikungunya epidemics, while there was no similar mortality in the previous years, even during dengue epidemics. We estimated an excess of 4505 deaths in Pernambuco during the chikungunya epidemics (47.9 per 100 000 persons). The most affected age groups were the elderly and those under 1 year of age, and the same pattern occurred in all the states.\nDiscussion\nFurther studies at other sites are needed to confirm the association between increased mortality and chikungunya epidemics in different age groups. If these findings are confirmed, it will be necessary to revise the guidelines to recognize the actual mortality associated with chikungunya and to improve therapeutic approaches and protective measures in the most vulnerable groups.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although the case fatality rate has been very low, there have been sporadic deaths due to

Role of monkeys in the sylvatic cycle of chikungunya virus in Senegal. bioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/079046\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose the greatest risk of spillover into humans of any class of pathogens. Such spillover may occur as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a 2-step jump from the reservoir to a different amplification host species and thence to humans. Despite the widespread havoc wreaked by emerging arboviruses, little is known about their transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we used serosurveillance and mathematical modeling to elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Over 3 years, 219 African green monkeys, 78 patas monkeys, and 440 Guinea baboons were captured in the region surrounding Kedougou, Senegal. The age of each animal was determined by anthropometry and dentition, and exposure to CHIKV was determined by detection of neutralizing antibodies. We estimate age-specific CHIKV seroprevalence, force of infection (FoI), and basic reproductive number (R0) in each species. Among the different species, CHIKV FoI ranged from 0.13 to 1.12 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.81-2.28) and R0 ranged from 1.5 (CI 1.3-1.9) to 6.6 (CI 5.1-10.4). CHIKV infection of infant monkeys was detected even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of primatophilic mosquitoes and when population seropositivity, and therefore immunity, was too high for monkeys themselves to support continuous CHIKV transmission. We therefore conclude that monkeys in this region serve primarily as amplification rather than reservoir hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other vertebrate hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that a comprehensive serosurvey of other vertebrate animals will be undertaken in the areas where the positive monkeys were found, followed by laboratory tests of susceptibility to determine the amplitude and duration of viremia (if any) in the positive species. Similar studies are needed in the tropical Americas to determine is spill-back from humans to wild vertebrates, and especially non-human primates, has occurred there. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nKedougou, Senegal: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38299]\n\n******\n[3] Colombia: persistent arthralgia\nDate: Wed 20 Dec 2017\nSource: Arthritis and Rheumatology journal [edited]\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40384/abstract\n\n\nref: Chang AY, Encinales L, Porras A, et al.

Baseline and follow-up (20 months) symptoms were evaluated in serologically confirmed cases.\nResults\nAmong 500 patients enrolled, 485 cases were serologically confirmed with chikungunya [virus infections]. Patients were predominantly adults (age 49 +/- 16 years), female, had a high school or less level of education, and were of mestizo ethnicity. The most commonly affected joints were the small joints including the wrists, ankles, and fingers. The initial joint pain lasted a median of 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-8); 16 per cent of participants reported missing a median of 4 days (IQR 2-7) of school or work. After 20-months, 1/4 of the participants had persistent joint pain. A multivariable analysis indicated that significant predictors of persistent joint pain included college graduate status, initial symptoms of headache or knee pain, missed work, normal activities affected, 4 or more days of initial symptoms, and 4 or more weeks of initial pain.\nConclusions\nThis is the 1st report to describe the frequency of chikungunya-related arthritis in the Americas after a 20 month follow-up. The high frequency of chronic disease highlights the importance of development of prevention and treatment interventions.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are many anecdotal accounts of persistent and sometimes disabling persistent joint pain following chikungunya virus infections. The report above provides the results of a quantitative study of arthralgia, lasting 20 or more months following infection in a quarter of the study group. A follow up study of 36 pregnant women hospitalized in Colombia in 2015, 1 year after acute viremia, reported arthralgia in 2 or more joints in 13 patients. Despite disease severity, pregnant women with chikungunya should be treated in high-complexity obstetric units to rule out adverse outcomes. These women should also be followed up to treat potential relapses (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/11/17-0480_article). - Mod.TY]\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nAtl\u00e1ntico, Colombia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31670]\n\n******\n[4] Brazil: mortality\nDate: Mon 13 Nov 2017\nSource: PLoS (Public Library of Science) Currents Outbreaks journal [edited]\nhttp://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/excess-mortality-related-to-chikungunya-epidemics-in-the-context-of-co-circulation-of-other-arboviruses-in-brazil/\n\n\nFreitas ARR, Cavalcanti L, Von Zuben AP, Donalisio MR.

Studies in the Indian Ocean and India suggest that passive surveillance systems cannot recognize many of deaths associated with chikungunya, which can be inferred by an increase in the overall mortality observed during chikungunya epidemics.\nObjective\nWe assess the mortality associated with chikungunya epidemics in the most affected states in Brazil, from 2015 and 2016.\nMethods\nWe studied the monthly mortality by age group, comparing a period without epidemics to a chikungunya epidemic period, which we defined arbitrarily as consecutive months with incidences of more than 50 cases/100 000 persons.\nResults\nWe obtained official data from the National System of Reported Diseases (SINAN) and the Mortality Information System (SIM), both maintained by the Ministry of Health. We identified a significant increase in the all-cause mortality rate during chikungunya epidemics, while there was no similar mortality in the previous years, even during dengue epidemics. We estimated an excess of 4505 deaths in Pernambuco during the chikungunya epidemics (47.9 per 100 000 persons).

Role of monkeys in the sylvatic cycle of chikungunya virus in Senegal. bioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/079046\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose the greatest risk of spillover into humans of any class of pathogens. Such spillover may occur as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a 2-step jump from the reservoir to a different amplification host species and thence to humans. Despite the widespread havoc wreaked by emerging arboviruses, little is known about their transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we used serosurveillance and mathematical modeling to elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Over 3 years, 219 African green monkeys, 78 patas monkeys, and 440 Guinea baboons were captured in the region surrounding Kedougou, Senegal. The age of each animal was determined by anthropometry and dentition, and exposure to CHIKV was determined by detection of neutralizing antibodies. We estimate age-specific CHIKV seroprevalence, force of infection (FoI), and basic reproductive number (R0) in each species. Among the different species, CHIKV FoI ranged from 0.13 to 1.12 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.81-2.28) and R0 ranged from 1.5 (CI 1.3-1.9) to 6.6 (CI 5.1-10.4). CHIKV infection of infant monkeys was detected even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of primatophilic mosquitoes and when population seropositivity, and therefore immunity, was too high for monkeys themselves to support continuous CHIKV transmission. We therefore conclude that monkeys in this region serve primarily as amplification rather than reservoir hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other vertebrate hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that a comprehensive serosurvey of other vertebrate animals will be undertaken in the areas where the positive monkeys were found, followed by laboratory tests of susceptibility to determine the amplitude and duration of viremia (if any) in the positive species. Similar studies are needed in the tropical Americas to determine is spill-back from humans to wild vertebrates, and especially non-human primates, has occurred there. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nKedougou, Senegal: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38299]\n\n******\n[3] Colombia: persistent arthralgia\nDate: Wed 20 Dec 2017\nSource: Arthritis and Rheumatology journal [edited]\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40384/abstract\n\n\nref: Chang AY, Encinales L, Porras A, et al.

Baseline and follow-up (20 months) symptoms were evaluated in serologically confirmed cases.\nResults\nAmong 500 patients enrolled, 485 cases were serologically confirmed with chikungunya [virus infections]. Patients were predominantly adults (age 49 +/- 16 years), female, had a high school or less level of education, and were of mestizo ethnicity. The most commonly affected joints were the small joints including the wrists, ankles, and fingers. The initial joint pain lasted a median of 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-8); 16 per cent of participants reported missing a median of 4 days (IQR 2-7) of school or work. After 20-months, 1/4 of the participants had persistent joint pain. A multivariable analysis indicated that significant predictors of persistent joint pain included college graduate status, initial symptoms of headache or knee pain, missed work, normal activities affected, 4 or more days of initial symptoms, and 4 or more weeks of initial pain.\nConclusions\nThis is the 1st report to describe the frequency of chikungunya-related arthritis in the Americas after a 20 month follow-up. The high frequency of chronic disease highlights the importance of development of prevention and treatment interventions.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are many anecdotal accounts of persistent and sometimes disabling persistent joint pain following chikungunya virus infections. The report above provides the results of a quantitative study of arthralgia, lasting 20 or more months following infection in a quarter of the study group. A follow up study of 36 pregnant women hospitalized in Colombia in 2015, 1 year after acute viremia, reported arthralgia in 2 or more joints in 13 patients. Despite disease severity, pregnant women with chikungunya should be treated in high-complexity obstetric units to rule out adverse outcomes.

Studies in the Indian Ocean and India suggest that passive surveillance systems cannot recognize many of deaths associated with chikungunya, which can be inferred by an increase in the overall mortality observed during chikungunya epidemics.\nObjective\nWe assess the mortality associated with chikungunya epidemics in the most affected states in Brazil, from 2015 and 2016.\nMethods\nWe studied the monthly mortality by age group, comparing a period without epidemics to a chikungunya epidemic period, which we defined arbitrarily as consecutive months with incidences of more than 50 cases/100 000 persons.\nResults\nWe obtained official data from the National System of Reported Diseases (SINAN) and the Mortality Information System (SIM), both maintained by the Ministry of Health. We identified a significant increase in the all-cause mortality rate during chikungunya epidemics, while there was no similar mortality in the previous years, even during dengue epidemics. We estimated an excess of 4505 deaths in Pernambuco during the chikungunya epidemics (47.9 per 100 000 persons). The most affected age groups were the elderly and those under 1 year of age, and the same pattern occurred in all the states.\nDiscussion\nFurther studies at other sites are needed to confirm the association between increased mortality and chikungunya epidemics in different age groups. If these findings are confirmed, it will be necessary to revise the guidelines to recognize the actual mortality associated with chikungunya and to improve therapeutic approaches and protective measures in the most vulnerable groups.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although the case fatality rate has been very low, there have been sporadic deaths due to

Role of monkeys in the sylvatic cycle of chikungunya virus in Senegal. bioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/079046\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose the greatest risk of spillover into humans of any class of pathogens. Such spillover may occur as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a 2-step jump from the reservoir to a different amplification host species and thence to humans. Despite the widespread havoc wreaked by emerging arboviruses, little is known about their transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we used serosurveillance and mathematical modeling to elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Over 3 years, 219 African green monkeys, 78 patas monkeys, and 440 Guinea baboons were captured in the region surrounding Kedougou, Senegal. The age of each animal was determined by anthropometry and dentition, and exposure to CHIKV was determined by detection of neutralizing antibodies. We estimate age-specific CHIKV seroprevalence, force of infection (FoI), and basic reproductive number (R0) in each species. Among the different species, CHIKV FoI ranged from 0.13 to 1.12 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.81-2.28) and R0 ranged from 1.5 (CI 1.3-1.9) to 6.6 (CI 5.1-10.4). CHIKV infection of infant monkeys was detected even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of primatophilic mosquitoes and when population seropositivity, and therefore immunity, was too high for monkeys themselves to support continuous CHIKV transmission. We therefore conclude that monkeys in this region serve primarily as amplification rather than reservoir hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other vertebrate hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that a comprehensive serosurvey of other vertebrate animals will be undertaken in the areas where the positive monkeys were found, followed by laboratory tests of susceptibility to determine the amplitude and duration of viremia (if any) in the positive species. Similar studies are needed in the tropical Americas to determine is spill-back from humans to wild vertebrates, and especially non-human primates, has occurred there. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nKedougou, Senegal: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38299]\n\n******\n[3] Colombia: persistent arthralgia\nDate: Wed 20 Dec 2017\nSource: Arthritis and Rheumatology journal [edited]\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40384/abstract\n\n\nref: Chang AY, Encinales L, Porras A, et al.

Baseline and follow-up (20 months) symptoms were evaluated in serologically confirmed cases.\nResults\nAmong 500 patients enrolled, 485 cases were serologically confirmed with chikungunya [virus infections]. Patients were predominantly adults (age 49 +/- 16 years), female, had a high school or less level of education, and were of mestizo ethnicity. The most commonly affected joints were the small joints including the wrists, ankles, and fingers. The initial joint pain lasted a median of 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-8); 16 per cent of participants reported missing a median of 4 days (IQR 2-7) of school or work. After 20-months, 1/4 of the participants had persistent joint pain. A multivariable analysis indicated that significant predictors of persistent joint pain included college graduate status, initial symptoms of headache or knee pain, missed work, normal activities affected, 4 or more days of initial symptoms, and 4 or more weeks of initial pain.\nConclusions\nThis is the 1st report to describe the frequency of chikungunya-related arthritis in the Americas after a 20 month follow-up. The high frequency of chronic disease highlights the importance of development of prevention and treatment interventions.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are many anecdotal accounts of persistent and sometimes disabling persistent joint pain following chikungunya virus infections. The report above provides the results of a quantitative study of arthralgia, lasting 20 or more months following infection in a quarter of the study group. A follow up study of 36 pregnant women hospitalized in Colombia in 2015, 1 year after acute viremia, reported arthralgia in 2 or more joints in 13 patients. Despite disease severity, pregnant women with chikungunya should be treated in high-complexity obstetric units to rule out adverse outcomes. These women should also be followed up to treat potential relapses (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/11/17-0480_article). - Mod.TY]\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nAtl\u00e1ntico, Colombia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31670]\n\n******\n[4] Brazil: mortality\nDate: Mon 13 Nov 2017\nSource: PLoS (Public Library of Science) Currents Outbreaks journal [edited]\nhttp://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/excess-mortality-related-to-chikungunya-epidemics-in-the-context-of-co-circulation-of-other-arboviruses-in-brazil/\n\n\nFreitas ARR, Cavalcanti L, Von Zuben AP, Donalisio MR.

Studies in the Indian Ocean and India suggest that passive surveillance systems cannot recognize many of deaths associated with chikungunya, which can be inferred by an increase in the overall mortality observed during chikungunya epidemics.\nObjective\nWe assess the mortality associated with chikungunya epidemics in the most affected states in Brazil, from 2015 and 2016.\nMethods\nWe studied the monthly mortality by age group, comparing a period without epidemics to a chikungunya epidemic period, which we defined arbitrarily as consecutive months with incidences of more than 50 cases/100 000 persons.\nResults\nWe obtained official data from the National System of Reported Diseases (SINAN) and the Mortality Information System (SIM), both maintained by the Ministry of Health. We identified a significant increase in the all-cause mortality rate during chikungunya epidemics, while there was no similar mortality in the previous years, even during dengue epidemics. We estimated an excess of 4505 deaths in Pernambuco during the chikungunya epidemics (47.9 per 100 000 persons). The most affected age groups were the elderly and those under 1 year of age, and the same pattern occurred in all the states.\nDiscussion\nFurther studies at other sites are needed to confirm the association between increased mortality and chikungunya epidemics in different age groups. If these findings are confirmed, it will be necessary to revise the guidelines to recognize the actual mortality associated with chikungunya and to improve therapeutic approaches and protective measures in the most vulnerable groups.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although the case fatality rate has been very low, there have been sporadic deaths due to

Role of monkeys in the sylvatic cycle of chikungunya virus in Senegal. bioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/079046\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose the greatest risk of spillover into humans of any class of pathogens. Such spillover may occur as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a 2-step jump from the reservoir to a different amplification host species and thence to humans. Despite the widespread havoc wreaked by emerging arboviruses, little is known about their transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we used serosurveillance and mathematical modeling to elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Over 3 years, 219 African green monkeys, 78 patas monkeys, and 440 Guinea baboons were captured in the region surrounding Kedougou, Senegal. The age of each animal was determined by anthropometry and dentition, and exposure to CHIKV was determined by detection of neutralizing antibodies. We estimate age-specific CHIKV seroprevalence, force of infection (FoI), and basic reproductive number (R0) in each species. Among the different species, CHIKV FoI ranged from 0.13 to 1.12 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.81-2.28) and R0 ranged from 1.5 (CI 1.3-1.9) to 6.6 (CI 5.1-10.4). CHIKV infection of infant monkeys was detected even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of primatophilic mosquitoes and when population seropositivity, and therefore immunity, was too high for monkeys themselves to support continuous CHIKV transmission. We therefore conclude that monkeys in this region serve primarily as amplification rather than reservoir hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other vertebrate hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that a comprehensive serosurvey of other vertebrate animals will be undertaken in the areas where the positive monkeys were found, followed by laboratory tests of susceptibility to determine the amplitude and duration of viremia (if any) in the positive species. Similar studies are needed in the tropical Americas to determine is spill-back from humans to wild vertebrates, and especially non-human primates, has occurred there. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nKedougou, Senegal: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38299]\n\n******\n[3] Colombia: persistent arthralgia\nDate: Wed 20 Dec 2017\nSource: Arthritis and Rheumatology journal [edited]\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40384/abstract\n\n\nref: Chang AY, Encinales L, Porras A, et al.

[Epub ahead of print]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nObjective\nTo estimate the frequency of chronic joint pain after infection with chikungunya virus in a Latin American cohort.\nMethods\nA cross sectional follow-up of a prospective cohort of 500 chikungunya patients from Atl\u00e1ntico department, Colombia clinically diagnosed with chikungunya during the 2014-2015 Colombian epidemic. Baseline and follow-up (20 months) symptoms were evaluated in serologically confirmed cases.\nResults\nAmong 500 patients enrolled, 485 cases were serologically confirmed with chikungunya [virus infections]. Patients were predominantly adults (age 49 +/- 16 years), female, had a high school or less level of education, and were of mestizo ethnicity. The most commonly affected joints were the small joints including the wrists, ankles, and fingers. The initial joint pain lasted a median of 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-8); 16 per cent of participants reported missing a median of 4 days (IQR 2-7) of school or work. After 20-months, 1/4 of the participants had persistent joint pain. A multivariable analysis indicated that significant predictors of persistent joint pain included college graduate status, initial symptoms of headache or knee pain, missed work, normal activities affected, 4 or more days of initial symptoms, and 4 or more weeks of initial pain.\nConclusions\nThis is the 1st report to describe the frequency of chikungunya-related arthritis in the Americas after a 20 month follow-up. The high frequency of chronic disease highlights the importance of development of prevention and treatment interventions.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are many anecdotal accounts of persistent and sometimes disabling persistent joint pain following chikungunya virus infections. The report above provides the results of a quantitative study of arthralgia, lasting 20 or more months following infection in a quarter of the study group. A follow up study of 36 pregnant women hospitalized in Colombia in 2015, 1 year after acute viremia, reported arthralgia in 2 or more joints in 13 patients. Despite disease severity, pregnant women with chikungunya should be treated in high-complexity obstetric units to rule out adverse outcomes. These women should also be followed up to treat potential relapses (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/11/17-0480_article). - Mod.TY]\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nAtl\u00e1ntico, Colombia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31670]\n\n******\n[4] Brazil: mortality\nDate: Mon 13 Nov 2017\nSource: PLoS (Public Library of Science) Currents Outbreaks journal [edited]\nhttp://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/excess-mortality-related-to-chikungunya-epidemics-in-the-context-of-co-circulation-of-other-arboviruses-in-brazil/\n\n\nFreitas ARR, Cavalcanti L, Von Zuben AP, Donalisio MR.

Studies in the Indian Ocean and India suggest that passive surveillance systems cannot recognize many of deaths associated with chikungunya, which can be inferred by an increase in the overall mortality observed during chikungunya epidemics.\nObjective\nWe assess the mortality associated with chikungunya epidemics in the most affected states in Brazil, from 2015 and 2016.\nMethods\nWe studied the monthly mortality by age group, comparing a period without epidemics to a chikungunya epidemic period, which we defined arbitrarily as consecutive months with incidences of more than 50 cases/100 000 persons.\nResults\nWe obtained official data from the National System of Reported Diseases (SINAN) and the Mortality Information System (SIM), both maintained by the Ministry of Health. We identified a significant increase in the all-cause mortality rate during chikungunya epidemics, while there was no similar mortality in the previous years, even during dengue epidemics. We estimated an excess of 4505 deaths in Pernambuco during the chikungunya epidemics (47.9 per 100 000 persons). The most affected age groups were the elderly and those under 1 year of age, and the same pattern occurred in all the states.\nDiscussion\nFurther studies at other sites are needed to confirm the association between increased mortality and chikungunya epidemics in different age groups. If these findings are confirmed, it will be necessary to revise the guidelines to recognize the actual mortality associated with chikungunya and to improve therapeutic approaches and protective measures in the most vulnerable groups.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although the case fatality rate has been very low, there have been sporadic deaths due to

Role of monkeys in the sylvatic cycle of chikungunya virus in Senegal. bioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/079046\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose the greatest risk of spillover into humans of any class of pathogens. Such spillover may occur as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a 2-step jump from the reservoir to a different amplification host species and thence to humans. Despite the widespread havoc wreaked by emerging arboviruses, little is known about their transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we used serosurveillance and mathematical modeling to elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Over 3 years, 219 African green monkeys, 78 patas monkeys, and 440 Guinea baboons were captured in the region surrounding Kedougou, Senegal. The age of each animal was determined by anthropometry and dentition, and exposure to CHIKV was determined by detection of neutralizing antibodies. We estimate age-specific CHIKV seroprevalence, force of infection (FoI), and basic reproductive number (R0) in each species. Among the different species, CHIKV FoI ranged from 0.13 to 1.12 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.81-2.28) and R0 ranged from 1.5 (CI 1.3-1.9) to 6.6 (CI 5.1-10.4). CHIKV infection of infant monkeys was detected even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of primatophilic mosquitoes and when population seropositivity, and therefore immunity, was too high for monkeys themselves to support continuous CHIKV transmission. We therefore conclude that monkeys in this region serve primarily as amplification rather than reservoir hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other vertebrate hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that a comprehensive serosurvey of other vertebrate animals will be undertaken in the areas where the positive monkeys were found, followed by laboratory tests of susceptibility to determine the amplitude and duration of viremia (if any) in the positive species. Similar studies are needed in the tropical Americas to determine is spill-back from humans to wild vertebrates, and especially non-human primates, has occurred there. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nKedougou, Senegal: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38299]\n\n******\n[3] Colombia: persistent arthralgia\nDate: Wed 20 Dec 2017\nSource: Arthritis and Rheumatology journal [edited]\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40384/abstract\n\n\nref: Chang AY, Encinales L, Porras A, et al.

[Epub ahead of print]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nObjective\nTo estimate the frequency of chronic joint pain after infection with chikungunya virus in a Latin American cohort.\nMethods\nA cross sectional follow-up of a prospective cohort of 500 chikungunya patients from Atl\u00e1ntico department, Colombia clinically diagnosed with chikungunya during the 2014-2015 Colombian epidemic. Baseline and follow-up (20 months) symptoms were evaluated in serologically confirmed cases.\nResults\nAmong 500 patients enrolled, 485 cases were serologically confirmed with chikungunya [virus infections]. Patients were predominantly adults (age 49 +/- 16 years), female, had a high school or less level of education, and were of mestizo ethnicity. The most commonly affected joints were the small joints including the wrists, ankles, and fingers. The initial joint pain lasted a median of 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-8); 16 per cent of participants reported missing a median of 4 days (IQR 2-7) of school or work. After 20-months, 1/4 of the participants had persistent joint pain. A multivariable analysis indicated that significant predictors of persistent joint pain included college graduate status, initial symptoms of headache or knee pain, missed work, normal activities affected, 4 or more days of initial symptoms, and 4 or more weeks of initial pain.\nConclusions\nThis is the 1st report to describe the frequency of chikungunya-related arthritis in the Americas after a 20 month follow-up. The high frequency of chronic disease highlights the importance of development of prevention and treatment interventions.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are many anecdotal accounts of persistent and sometimes disabling persistent joint pain following chikungunya virus infections. The report above provides the results of a quantitative study of arthralgia, lasting 20 or more months following infection in a quarter of the study group. A follow up study of 36 pregnant women hospitalized in Colombia in 2015, 1 year after acute viremia, reported arthralgia in 2 or more joints in 13 patients. Despite disease severity, pregnant women with chikungunya should be treated in high-complexity obstetric units to rule out adverse outcomes. These women should also be followed up to treat potential relapses (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/11/17-0480_article). - Mod.TY]\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nAtl\u00e1ntico, Colombia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31670]\n\n******\n[4] Brazil: mortality\nDate: Mon 13 Nov 2017\nSource: PLoS (Public Library of Science) Currents Outbreaks journal [edited]\nhttp://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/excess-mortality-related-to-chikungunya-epidemics-in-the-context-of-co-circulation-of-other-arboviruses-in-brazil/\n\n\nFreitas ARR, Cavalcanti L, Von Zuben AP, Donalisio MR.

Studies in the Indian Ocean and India suggest that passive surveillance systems cannot recognize many of deaths associated with chikungunya, which can be inferred by an increase in the overall mortality observed during chikungunya epidemics.\nObjective\nWe assess the mortality associated with chikungunya epidemics in the most affected states in Brazil, from 2015 and 2016.\nMethods\nWe studied the monthly mortality by age group, comparing a period without epidemics to a chikungunya epidemic period, which we defined arbitrarily as consecutive months with incidences of more than 50 cases/100 000 persons.\nResults\nWe obtained official data from the National System of Reported Diseases (SINAN) and the Mortality Information System (SIM), both maintained by the Ministry of Health. We identified a significant increase in the all-cause mortality rate during chikungunya epidemics, while there was no similar mortality in the previous years, even during dengue epidemics. We estimated an excess of 4505 deaths in Pernambuco during the chikungunya epidemics (47.9 per 100 000 persons). The most affected age groups were the elderly and those under 1 year of age, and the same pattern occurred in all the states.\nDiscussion\nFurther studies at other sites are needed to confirm the association between increased mortality and chikungunya epidemics in different age groups. If these findings are confirmed, it will be necessary to revise the guidelines to recognize the actual mortality associated with chikungunya and to improve therapeutic approaches and protective measures in the most vulnerable groups.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although the case fatality rate has been very low, there have been sporadic deaths due to

Role of monkeys in the sylvatic cycle of chikungunya virus in Senegal. bioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/079046\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose the greatest risk of spillover into humans of any class of pathogens. Such spillover may occur as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a 2-step jump from the reservoir to a different amplification host species and thence to humans. Despite the widespread havoc wreaked by emerging arboviruses, little is known about their transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we used serosurveillance and mathematical modeling to elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Over 3 years, 219 African green monkeys, 78 patas monkeys, and 440 Guinea baboons were captured in the region surrounding Kedougou, Senegal. The age of each animal was determined by anthropometry and dentition, and exposure to CHIKV was determined by detection of neutralizing antibodies. We estimate age-specific CHIKV seroprevalence, force of infection (FoI), and basic reproductive number (R0) in each species. Among the different species, CHIKV FoI ranged from 0.13 to 1.12 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.81-2.28) and R0 ranged from 1.5 (CI 1.3-1.9) to 6.6 (CI 5.1-10.4). CHIKV infection of infant monkeys was detected even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of primatophilic mosquitoes and when population seropositivity, and therefore immunity, was too high for monkeys themselves to support continuous CHIKV transmission. We therefore conclude that monkeys in this region serve primarily as amplification rather than reservoir hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other vertebrate hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One hopes that a comprehensive serosurvey of other vertebrate animals will be undertaken in the areas where the positive monkeys were found, followed by laboratory tests of susceptibility to determine the amplitude and duration of viremia (if any) in the positive species. Similar studies are needed in the tropical Americas to determine is spill-back from humans to wild vertebrates, and especially non-human primates, has occurred there. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nKedougou, Senegal: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38299]\n\n******\n[3] Colombia: persistent arthralgia\nDate: Wed 20 Dec 2017\nSource: Arthritis and Rheumatology journal [edited]\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40384/abstract\n\n\nref: Chang AY, Encinales L, Porras A, et al.

Baseline and follow-up (20 months) symptoms were evaluated in serologically confirmed cases.\nResults\nAmong 500 patients enrolled, 485 cases were serologically confirmed with chikungunya [virus infections]. Patients were predominantly adults (age 49 +/- 16 years), female, had a high school or less level of education, and were of mestizo ethnicity. The most commonly affected joints were the small joints including the wrists, ankles, and fingers. The initial joint pain lasted a median of 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-8); 16 per cent of participants reported missing a median of 4 days (IQR 2-7) of school or work. After 20-months, 1/4 of the participants had persistent joint pain. A multivariable analysis indicated that significant predictors of persistent joint pain included college graduate status, initial symptoms of headache or knee pain, missed work, normal activities affected, 4 or more days of initial symptoms, and 4 or more weeks of initial pain.\nConclusions\nThis is the 1st report to describe the frequency of chikungunya-related arthritis in the Americas after a 20 month follow-up. The high frequency of chronic disease highlights the importance of development of prevention and treatment interventions.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are many anecdotal accounts of persistent and sometimes disabling persistent joint pain following chikungunya virus infections. The report above provides the results of a quantitative study of arthralgia, lasting 20 or more months following infection in a quarter of the study group. A follow up study of 36 pregnant women hospitalized in Colombia in 2015, 1 year after acute viremia, reported arthralgia in 2 or more joints in 13 patients. Despite disease severity, pregnant women with chikungunya should be treated in high-complexity obstetric units to rule out adverse outcomes. These women should also be followed up to treat potential relapses (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/11/17-0480_article). - Mod.TY]\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nAtl\u00e1ntico, Colombia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31670]\n\n******\n[4] Brazil: mortality\nDate: Mon 13 Nov 2017\nSource: PLoS (Public Library of Science) Currents Outbreaks journal [edited]\nhttp://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/excess-mortality-related-to-chikungunya-epidemics-in-the-context-of-co-circulation-of-other-arboviruses-in-brazil/\n\n\nFreitas ARR, Cavalcanti L, Von Zuben AP, Donalisio MR.

Studies in the Indian Ocean and India suggest that passive surveillance systems cannot recognize many of deaths associated with chikungunya, which can be inferred by an increase in the overall mortality observed during chikungunya epidemics.\nObjective\nWe assess the mortality associated with chikungunya epidemics in the most affected states in Brazil, from 2015 and 2016.\nMethods\nWe studied the monthly mortality by age group, comparing a period without epidemics to a chikungunya epidemic period, which we defined arbitrarily as consecutive months with incidences of more than 50 cases/100 000 persons.\nResults\nWe obtained official data from the National System of Reported Diseases (SINAN) and the Mortality Information System (SIM), both maintained by the Ministry of Health. We identified a significant increase in the all-cause mortality rate during chikungunya epidemics, while there was no similar mortality in the previous years, even during dengue epidemics. We estimated an excess of 4505 deaths in Pernambuco during the chikungunya epidemics (47.9 per 100 000 persons). The most affected age groups were the elderly and those under 1 year of age, and the same pattern occurred in all the states.\nDiscussion\nFurther studies at other sites are needed to confirm the association between increased mortality and chikungunya epidemics in different age groups. If these findings are confirmed, it will be necessary to revise the guidelines to recognize the actual mortality associated with chikungunya and to improve therapeutic approaches and protective measures in the most vulnerable groups.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although the case fatality rate has been very low, there have been sporadic deaths due to

infected mosquitoes, and its symptoms include high fever, joint pains, joint swellings, rashes, headaches, muscle pains, nausea and fatigue. Chikungunya is rarely fatal, with the death rate of those afflicted at less than one percent.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Currently, Sindh province is also reporting dengue cases from various districts including Karachi. The key to control of vector borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya is intensive vector management, not only when the epidemic or outbreak situation arises, but particularly during the low activity season. Use of personal protective measures must be propagated for prevention of mosquito bites, such as wearing clothing to minimize skin exposure to the day-biting mosquito, application of repellents to exposed skin or clothing, use of screens in rooms, use of mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers and use of mosquito nets or insecticide-treated mosquito nets during daytime sleeping, particularly of young children or sick or older individuals.

Furthermore, intensive efforts for community involvement in the control measures through education and participation of the religious and social members can make considerable impact. - Mod.UBA\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140.]\nSee Also\nChikungunya - Pakistan (42): (SD) Karachi 20171022.5395560\nChikungunya (41): Pakistan (NW) 20171015.5381619\nChikungunya (37): Pakistan 20171001.5352966\nChikungunya (32): Asia (Pakistan) 20170919.5323363\nChikungunya (31): Asia (Pakistan) 20170916.5320238\nChikungunya (29): Asia (Pakistan) 20170910.5306378\nChikungunya (28): Asia (Pakistan) 20170824.5268630\nChikungunya (27): Americas, Europe, Asia 20170823.5268087\nChikungunya (26): Asia (Pakistan) comment, RFI 20170811.5240010\nChikungunya (25): Asia (Pakistan) 20170809.5235254\nChikungunya (24): Asia (Pakistan) 20170726.5205157\nChikungunya (23): Asia (Bangladesh), case numbers 20170711.5165290\nChikungunya (22): Americas, Asia 20170704.5149989\nChikungunya (21): Americas, Asia, observations, research 20170626.5132080\nChikungunya (20): Asia (Pakistan) 20170623.5127317\nChikungunya (19): Americas, Asia, observations, research 20170610.5096983\nChikungunya (06): Americas, Asia, research 20170206.4817959\n.................................................sb/lxl/uba/msp/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "chikungunya", "dengue"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2044-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-01-01 00:00:00", "2017-10-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2042-03-15 00:00:00", "2037-03-15 00:00:00", "2032-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-31 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "2021-03-28 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Pakistan", "country": "Pakistan"}, {"location": "Bangladesh", "country": "Bangladesh"}, {"location": "Chikungunya", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Karachi", "country": "Pakistan"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5452235", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Chikungunya (46): Asia (Pakistan)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5452235", "date": "2017-10-29 13:05:31", "main_text": "CHIKUNGUNYA (44): PAKISTAN\n**************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 28 Oct 2017\nSource: Pakistan Today [edited]\nhttps://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/10/28/number-of-suspected-chikungunya-cases-on-the-rise/\n\n\nThe number of suspected chikungunya cases rose in Karachi as 12 more patients were admitted to hospitals, taking the total number of patients up to 243 since 1 Oct 2017.\n\nAccording to a report issued by the Sindh Health Department, a total 4602 chikungunya suspected cases have been reported across the province since 1 Jan 2017.\n\nThe number of suspected chikungunya cases during October 2017 has reached 254 across Sindh, of which 243 cases have been reported from Karachi.\n\nIn 2016, the number of suspected chikungunya cases reported from Karachi was 405.\n\nChikungunya is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, and its symptoms include high fever, joint pains, joint swellings, rashes, headaches, muscle pains, nausea and fatigue.

Symptoms had started while they were on holiday near the coastal town of Anzio, in the province of Rome, Lazio region (ca 58 km [36 miles] from Rome). The dates of symptom onset were 5 and 11 Aug and 2 Sep [2017], respectively. The patients lived in the same home, and none had travelled to chikungunya, dengue or Zika [virus] endemic areas in the 2 weeks before symptom onset. The 2 patients who developed symptoms at the beginning of August were chikungunya IgM positive, and the infection was confirmed through a neutralisation test (PRNT). The 3rd patient, who was symptomatic at the time of sample collection, was IgM positive and PRNT borderline (PRNT 1:10). Chikungunya virus was detected by RT-PCR followed by nested PCR in both serum and urine and was isolated from urine.\n\nThe regional health authorities immediately implemented measures around this initial cluster, which are described in the national plan for chikungunya surveillance and control [1]. The 3 patients had referred to other individuals in their neighbourhood who had developed similar symptoms since the beginning of August 2017. Epidemiological surveillance was enhanced to identify additional cases (case finding trough general practitioners (GPs), paediatricians, emergency rooms and hospitals). As of 20 Sep 2017, 86 confirmed autochthonous cases of chikungunya were reported to the regional surveillance system; the investigation is ongoing. These were found among people living in Anzio, or people who had travelled there 15 days before symptom onset. Cases from Rome were also identified, with either travel history to Anzio or to other endemic areas. The primary viraemic case who imported the virus into the region has not been identified so far.\n\nEntomological investigation\n-------------------------------\nOn 7 and 8 Sep 2017, adult mosquitoes were collected in the Anzio municipality by using BG Sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure (Biogents, Regensburg, Germany) and captured directly using handheld electric aspirators on vegetation or on exposed skin. Larval collections were performed using dippers or droppers by inspecting artificial containers (removable or non-removable), as potential larval breeding sites. Adults and larvae of _Aedes albopictus_ (tiger mosquito) and _Culex pipiens_ were found in the Anzio municipality area. Mosquito adults were sorted into 12 pools to determine the species, distinguish males from females and to test for chikungunya virus. The number of specimens in each pool ranged from 1 to 13. Among 53 mosquitoes, one pool of 12 _Ae. albopictus_ females which had been collected near the house of the 1st 3 cases identified in Anzio was found to be chikungunya virus positive by PCR. The virus was isolated.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of patient and mosquito sequences\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nSequences of the PCR amplicons of the virus envelope (E)1 gene from the patient (GenBank numbers: LT908477 and LT908478) and from the mosquitoes were identical (GenBank number: LT908476), and also showed a 100 percent similarity with the sequence of a chikungunya East Central South African (ECSA) strain involved in an ongoing epidemic in Pakistan, which does not carry the A226V mutation. In a phylogenetic analysis, the Italian sequences also clustered with ESCA strain sequences obtained from different parts of the world (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis of sequences derived from chikungunya virus positive samples obtained in this study, Italy, August-September 2017 [Interested readers can access this figure at the above URL].\n\nHighlighted in the figure are 2 clusters. The 1st, identifiable as 'ESCA genotype', indicates sequences of the ESCA genotype. The 2nd cluster, identifiable as 'E1 A226V', includes all sequences with the A226V mutation in the envelope (E)1 gene, a mutation, which is involved in the increased susceptibility of _Aedes albopictus_ for infection and transmission of chikungunya virus.\n\nControl measures\n--------------------\nOn 8 Sep [2017] Italy launched a 1st alert through the Early Warning Response System (EWRS) in order to alert other European Union countries about the ongoing outbreak. In the affected municipality, vector control activities against larvae and adult mosquitoes were performed and the population was advised to take measures to avoid mosquito bites and to remove all potential breeding sites from their gardens. Moreover, measures such as clinical evaluation of blood donors, gathering post-donation information for donors residing in the Lazio region, and application of 28 days deferral of donors who visited the municipality of Anzio since 1 Aug 2017 were reinforced.\n\nBackground\n--------------\nChikungunya is a self-limiting mosquito-borne viral disease characterised by arthralgia/arthritis primarily of the wrists, knees, ankles and small joints of the extremities lasting from days to months. Between 1/3rd and one half of the patients develop a generally non-pruritic maculopapular rash primarily of the trunk and limbs 1-12 days after the onset of arthritis that resolves in 7-10 days. Myalgia, fatigue, fever and lymphadenopathy are common. Complications are rare; however, chikungunya [virus infection] leads to (self-perceived) long-term sequelae in a considerable proportion of patients. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 10 days (average 3 days).\n\nThe aetiological agent is a single strand, positive sense RNA virus of the Alphavirus genus, Togaviridae family of which 3 main genotypes have been identified: Asian, West African and ECSA [8]. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the _Aedes spp._ primarily _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_. Transmission through transfusion/transplantation has been demonstrated in animal models.\n\nChikungunya [virus] is endemic in Africa, southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Pacific region and in tropical regions of the Americas (since 2013). In Europe, autochthonous cases, which were linked to imported cases, were detected in France in the Var department, in September 2010 and in the city of Montpellier, Hrault department, in October 2014. In August 2017, a cluster of locally acquired cases consisting of 4 confirmed and one probable case was also described in the Var department.\n\nDiscussion\n------------\nThe outbreak described here is the 2nd autochthonous chikungunya outbreak detected in Italy. The 1st outbreak, with more than 200 reported cases, occurred between July and September 2007 in the northeast of the country, near the Adriatic coast, in the province of Ravenna. Subsequent to it, Italy set up a national plan for the surveillance and control of the disease. The aim of this surveillance system is to monitor imported cases and local transmission, identify outbreaks in a timely fashion, and to prevent transmission from substances of human origin (SoHO). The surveillance is enhanced during the high vector activity season (1 Jun-31 Oct). The competent vector, _Ae. albopictus_, which was 1st detected in north-western Italy in 1990, is now widely established throughout the country, including the Lazio region. Overall between 2014 and 2016, a total of 128 possible/probable/confirmed imported cases of chikungunya [virus infection] have been notified to the Italian health authorities (mean: 43 cases/year; range: 25 cases in 2015 and 70 cases in 2014). Most cases had a travel history to Central and South America.\n\nAnzio, one of the locations where autochonous chikungunya cases were currently detected, is a holiday resort less than one hour drive away from Rome. Many families visit the area until the beginning of the school year, which in 2017 was on 14 Sep 2017. During the summer, the population density increases in the area owing to the easy commute from Rome. Viraemic individuals exposed in August 2017 are likely to have travelled around resulting in new introductions in receptive areas and challenging the implementation of control measures. The delayed identification of the autochthonous cases in Anzio, a coastal recreational area close to the capital towards the end of summer may have triggered the local transmission in Rome. This suggests an extension of the outbreak and the presence of secondary multifocal transmission chains.\n\nThe lack of access to closed summer houses after mid-September may hamper vector control activities. Summer 2017 has been characterised by particularly high temperatures and by an unusual dry period from May to August, factors that would normally prevent high mosquito density. However, other concomitant factors favoured the activity and abundance of the tiger mosquito including the presence of numerous peridomestic 'man-made' breeding sites within constantly irrigated private gardens.\n\nThe identification of the viral strain involved in the current Italian outbreak as one very close to the ECSA strain involved in the ongoing epidemic in Pakistan is not surprising, even if this virus it is not carrying the A226V mutation, which has been involved in the increased susceptibility of _Ae. albopictus_ for infection and transmission of chikungunya virus. Other yet undefined mutations might be responsible for the vector competence of _Ae. albopictus_, allowing it to sustain the present outbreak. The fact that we found chikungunya RNA in a small size mosquito pool, suggests a high level of virus circulation in the area. The investigation is still ongoing and, due to enhanced surveillance and testing, further cases have been identified, with as of 22 Sep [2017], 102 laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The count has now increased to 102 reported cases. There are 10 new cases. Of these 10 new cases: 5 concern individuals who had resided in the municipality of Anzio within 15 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The remaining 5 new cases concern people resident in the municipality of Rome and have no links with Anzio (http://www.regione.lazio.it/rl_main/?vw=newsDettaglio&id=4128 in Italian). Chikungunya virus transmission remains active in this area and will likely remain so until the onset of freezing temperatures unless vector control measures are effective.

Symptoms had started while they were on holiday near the coastal town of Anzio, in the province of Rome, Lazio region (ca 58 km [36 miles] from Rome). The dates of symptom onset were 5 and 11 Aug and 2 Sep [2017], respectively. The patients lived in the same home, and none had travelled to chikungunya, dengue or Zika [virus] endemic areas in the 2 weeks before symptom onset. The 2 patients who developed symptoms at the beginning of August were chikungunya IgM positive, and the infection was confirmed through a neutralisation test (PRNT). The 3rd patient, who was symptomatic at the time of sample collection, was IgM positive and PRNT borderline (PRNT 1:10). Chikungunya virus was detected by RT-PCR followed by nested PCR in both serum and urine and was isolated from urine.\n\nThe regional health authorities immediately implemented measures around this initial cluster, which are described in the national plan for chikungunya surveillance and control [1]. The 3 patients had referred to other individuals in their neighbourhood who had developed similar symptoms since the beginning of August 2017. Epidemiological surveillance was enhanced to identify additional cases (case finding trough general practitioners (GPs), paediatricians, emergency rooms and hospitals). As of 20 Sep 2017, 86 confirmed autochthonous cases of chikungunya were reported to the regional surveillance system; the investigation is ongoing. These were found among people living in Anzio, or people who had travelled there 15 days before symptom onset. Cases from Rome were also identified, with either travel history to Anzio or to other endemic areas. The primary viraemic case who imported the virus into the region has not been identified so far.\n\nEntomological investigation\n-------------------------------\nOn 7 and 8 Sep 2017, adult mosquitoes were collected in the Anzio municipality by using BG Sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure (Biogents, Regensburg, Germany) and captured directly using handheld electric aspirators on vegetation or on exposed skin. Larval collections were performed using dippers or droppers by inspecting artificial containers (removable or non-removable), as potential larval breeding sites. Adults and larvae of _Aedes albopictus_ (tiger mosquito) and _Culex pipiens_ were found in the Anzio municipality area. Mosquito adults were sorted into 12 pools to determine the species, distinguish males from females and to test for chikungunya virus. The number of specimens in each pool ranged from 1 to 13. Among 53 mosquitoes, one pool of 12 _Ae. albopictus_ females which had been collected near the house of the 1st 3 cases identified in Anzio was found to be chikungunya virus positive by PCR. The virus was isolated.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of patient and mosquito sequences\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nSequences of the PCR amplicons of the virus envelope (E)1 gene from the patient (GenBank numbers: LT908477 and LT908478) and from the mosquitoes were identical (GenBank number: LT908476), and also showed a 100 percent similarity with the sequence of a chikungunya East Central South African (ECSA) strain involved in an ongoing epidemic in Pakistan, which does not carry the A226V mutation. In a phylogenetic analysis, the Italian sequences also clustered with ESCA strain sequences obtained from different parts of the world (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis of sequences derived from chikungunya virus positive samples obtained in this study, Italy, August-September 2017 [Interested readers can access this figure at the above URL].\n\nHighlighted in the figure are 2 clusters. The 1st, identifiable as 'ESCA genotype', indicates sequences of the ESCA genotype. The 2nd cluster, identifiable as 'E1 A226V', includes all sequences with the A226V mutation in the envelope (E)1 gene, a mutation, which is involved in the increased susceptibility of _Aedes albopictus_ for infection and transmission of chikungunya virus.\n\nControl measures\n--------------------\nOn 8 Sep [2017] Italy launched a 1st alert through the Early Warning Response System (EWRS) in order to alert other European Union countries about the ongoing outbreak. In the affected municipality, vector control activities against larvae and adult mosquitoes were performed and the population was advised to take measures to avoid mosquito bites and to remove all potential breeding sites from their gardens.

The competent vector, _Ae. albopictus_, which was 1st detected in north-western Italy in 1990, is now widely established throughout the country, including the Lazio region. Overall between 2014 and 2016, a total of 128 possible/probable/confirmed imported cases of chikungunya [virus infection] have been notified to the Italian health authorities (mean: 43 cases/year; range: 25 cases in 2015 and 70 cases in 2014). Most cases had a travel history to Central and South America.\n\nAnzio, one of the locations where autochonous chikungunya cases were currently detected, is a holiday resort less than one hour drive away from Rome. Many families visit the area until the beginning of the school year, which in 2017 was on 14 Sep 2017. During the summer, the population density increases in the area owing to the easy commute from Rome. Viraemic individuals exposed in August 2017 are likely to have travelled around resulting in new introductions in receptive areas and challenging the implementation of control measures. The delayed identification of the autochthonous cases in Anzio, a coastal recreational area close to the capital towards the end of summer may have triggered the local transmission in Rome. This suggests an extension of the outbreak and the presence of secondary multifocal transmission chains.\n\nThe lack of access to closed summer houses after mid-September may hamper vector control activities. Summer 2017 has been characterised by particularly high temperatures and by an unusual dry period from May to August, factors that would normally prevent high mosquito density. However, other concomitant factors favoured the activity and abundance of the tiger mosquito including the presence of numerous peridomestic 'man-made' breeding sites within constantly irrigated private gardens.\n\nThe identification of the viral strain involved in the current Italian outbreak as one very close to the ECSA strain involved in the ongoing epidemic in Pakistan is not surprising, even if this virus it is not carrying the A226V mutation, which has been involved in the increased susceptibility of _Ae. albopictus_ for infection and transmission of chikungunya virus. Other yet undefined mutations might be responsible for the vector competence of _Ae. albopictus_, allowing it to sustain the present outbreak. The fact that we found chikungunya RNA in a small size mosquito pool, suggests a high level of virus circulation in the area. The investigation is still ongoing and, due to enhanced surveillance and testing, further cases have been identified, with as of 22 Sep [2017], 102 laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The count has now increased to 102 reported cases. There are 10 new cases. Of these 10 new cases: 5 concern individuals who had resided in the municipality of Anzio within 15 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The remaining 5 new cases concern people resident in the municipality of Rome and have no links with Anzio (http://www.regione.lazio.it/rl_main/?vw=newsDettaglio&id=4128 in Italian).

Symptoms had started while they were on holiday near the coastal town of Anzio, in the province of Rome, Lazio region (ca 58 km [36 miles] from Rome). The dates of symptom onset were 5 and 11 Aug and 2 Sep [2017], respectively. The patients lived in the same home, and none had travelled to chikungunya, dengue or Zika [virus] endemic areas in the 2 weeks before symptom onset. The 2 patients who developed symptoms at the beginning of August were chikungunya IgM positive, and the infection was confirmed through a neutralisation test (PRNT). The 3rd patient, who was symptomatic at the time of sample collection, was IgM positive and PRNT borderline (PRNT 1:10). Chikungunya virus was detected by RT-PCR followed by nested PCR in both serum and urine and was isolated from urine.\n\nThe regional health authorities immediately implemented measures around this initial cluster, which are described in the national plan for chikungunya surveillance and control [1]. The 3 patients had referred to other individuals in their neighbourhood who had developed similar symptoms since the beginning of August 2017. Epidemiological surveillance was enhanced to identify additional cases (case finding trough general practitioners (GPs), paediatricians, emergency rooms and hospitals). As of 20 Sep 2017, 86 confirmed autochthonous cases of chikungunya were reported to the regional surveillance system; the investigation is ongoing. These were found among people living in Anzio, or people who had travelled there 15 days before symptom onset. Cases from Rome were also identified, with either travel history to Anzio or to other endemic areas. The primary viraemic case who imported the virus into the region has not been identified so far.\n\nEntomological investigation\n-------------------------------\nOn 7 and 8 Sep 2017, adult mosquitoes were collected in the Anzio municipality by using BG Sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure (Biogents, Regensburg, Germany) and captured directly using handheld electric aspirators on vegetation or on exposed skin. Larval collections were performed using dippers or droppers by inspecting artificial containers (removable or non-removable), as potential larval breeding sites. Adults and larvae of _Aedes albopictus_ (tiger mosquito) and _Culex pipiens_ were found in the Anzio municipality area. Mosquito adults were sorted into 12 pools to determine the species, distinguish males from females and to test for chikungunya virus. The number of specimens in each pool ranged from 1 to 13. Among 53 mosquitoes, one pool of 12 _Ae. albopictus_ females which had been collected near the house of the 1st 3 cases identified in Anzio was found to be chikungunya virus positive by PCR. The virus was isolated.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of patient and mosquito sequences\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nSequences of the PCR amplicons of the virus envelope (E)1 gene from the patient (GenBank numbers: LT908477 and LT908478) and from the mosquitoes were identical (GenBank number: LT908476), and also showed a 100 percent similarity with the sequence of a chikungunya East Central South African (ECSA) strain involved in an ongoing epidemic in Pakistan, which does not carry the A226V mutation. In a phylogenetic analysis, the Italian sequences also clustered with ESCA strain sequences obtained from different parts of the world (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis of sequences derived from chikungunya virus positive samples obtained in this study, Italy, August-September 2017 [Interested readers can access this figure at the above URL].\n\nHighlighted in the figure are 2 clusters. The 1st, identifiable as 'ESCA genotype', indicates sequences of the ESCA genotype. The 2nd cluster, identifiable as 'E1 A226V', includes all sequences with the A226V mutation in the envelope (E)1 gene, a mutation, which is involved in the increased susceptibility of _Aedes albopictus_ for infection and transmission of chikungunya virus.\n\nControl measures\n--------------------\nOn 8 Sep [2017] Italy launched a 1st alert through the Early Warning Response System (EWRS) in order to alert other European Union countries about the ongoing outbreak. In the affected municipality, vector control activities against larvae and adult mosquitoes were performed and the population was advised to take measures to avoid mosquito bites and to remove all potential breeding sites from their gardens. Moreover, measures such as clinical evaluation of blood donors, gathering post-donation information for donors residing in the Lazio region, and application of 28 days deferral of donors who visited the municipality of Anzio since 1 Aug 2017 were reinforced.\n\nBackground\n--------------\nChikungunya is a self-limiting mosquito-borne viral disease characterised by arthralgia/arthritis primarily of the wrists, knees, ankles and small joints of the extremities lasting from days to months. Between 1/3rd and one half of the patients develop a generally non-pruritic maculopapular rash primarily of the trunk and limbs 1-12 days after the onset of arthritis that resolves in 7-10 days. Myalgia, fatigue, fever and lymphadenopathy are common. Complications are rare; however, chikungunya [virus infection] leads to (self-perceived) long-term sequelae in a considerable proportion of patients. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 10 days (average 3 days).\n\nThe aetiological agent is a single strand, positive sense RNA virus of the Alphavirus genus, Togaviridae family of which 3 main genotypes have been identified: Asian, West African and ECSA [8]. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the _Aedes spp._ primarily _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_. Transmission through transfusion/transplantation has been demonstrated in animal models.\n\nChikungunya [virus] is endemic in Africa, southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Pacific region and in tropical regions of the Americas (since 2013). In Europe, autochthonous cases, which were linked to imported cases, were detected in France in the Var department, in September 2010 and in the city of Montpellier, Hrault department, in October 2014. In August 2017, a cluster of locally acquired cases consisting of 4 confirmed and one probable case was also described in the Var department.\n\nDiscussion\n------------\nThe outbreak described here is the 2nd autochthonous chikungunya outbreak detected in Italy. The 1st outbreak, with more than 200 reported cases, occurred between July and September 2007 in the northeast of the country, near the Adriatic coast, in the province of Ravenna. Subsequent to it, Italy set up a national plan for the surveillance and control of the disease. The aim of this surveillance system is to monitor imported cases and local transmission, identify outbreaks in a timely fashion, and to prevent transmission from substances of human origin (SoHO).

Symptoms had started while they were on holiday near the coastal town of Anzio, in the province of Rome, Lazio region (ca 58 km [36 miles] from Rome). The dates of symptom onset were 5 and 11 Aug and 2 Sep [2017], respectively. The patients lived in the same home, and none had travelled to chikungunya, dengue or Zika [virus] endemic areas in the 2 weeks before symptom onset. The 2 patients who developed symptoms at the beginning of August were chikungunya IgM positive, and the infection was confirmed through a neutralisation test (PRNT). The 3rd patient, who was symptomatic at the time of sample collection, was IgM positive and PRNT borderline (PRNT 1:10). Chikungunya virus was detected by RT-PCR followed by nested PCR in both serum and urine and was isolated from urine.\n\nThe regional health authorities immediately implemented measures around this initial cluster, which are described in the national plan for chikungunya surveillance and control [1]. The 3 patients had referred to other individuals in their neighbourhood who had developed similar symptoms since the beginning of August 2017. Epidemiological surveillance was enhanced to identify additional cases (case finding trough general practitioners (GPs), paediatricians, emergency rooms and hospitals). As of 20 Sep 2017, 86 confirmed autochthonous cases of chikungunya were reported to the regional surveillance system; the investigation is ongoing. These were found among people living in Anzio, or people who had travelled there 15 days before symptom onset. Cases from Rome were also identified, with either travel history to Anzio or to other endemic areas. The primary viraemic case who imported the virus into the region has not been identified so far.\n\nEntomological investigation\n-------------------------------\nOn 7 and 8 Sep 2017, adult mosquitoes were collected in the Anzio municipality by using BG Sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure (Biogents, Regensburg, Germany) and captured directly using handheld electric aspirators on vegetation or on exposed skin. Larval collections were performed using dippers or droppers by inspecting artificial containers (removable or non-removable), as potential larval breeding sites. Adults and larvae of _Aedes albopictus_ (tiger mosquito) and _Culex pipiens_ were found in the Anzio municipality area. Mosquito adults were sorted into 12 pools to determine the species, distinguish males from females and to test for chikungunya virus. The number of specimens in each pool ranged from 1 to 13. Among 53 mosquitoes, one pool of 12 _Ae. albopictus_ females which had been collected near the house of the 1st 3 cases identified in Anzio was found to be chikungunya virus positive by PCR. The virus was isolated.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of patient and mosquito sequences\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nSequences of the PCR amplicons of the virus envelope (E)1 gene from the patient (GenBank numbers: LT908477 and LT908478) and from the mosquitoes were identical (GenBank number: LT908476), and also showed a 100 percent similarity with the sequence of a chikungunya East Central South African (ECSA) strain involved in an ongoing epidemic in Pakistan, which does not carry the A226V mutation. In a phylogenetic analysis, the Italian sequences also clustered with ESCA strain sequences obtained from different parts of the world (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis of sequences derived from chikungunya virus positive samples obtained in this study, Italy, August-September 2017 [Interested readers can access this figure at the above URL].\n\nHighlighted in the figure are 2 clusters. The 1st, identifiable as 'ESCA genotype', indicates sequences of the ESCA genotype. The 2nd cluster, identifiable as 'E1 A226V', includes all sequences with the A226V mutation in the envelope (E)1 gene, a mutation, which is involved in the increased susceptibility of _Aedes albopictus_ for infection and transmission of chikungunya virus.\n\nControl measures\n--------------------\nOn 8 Sep [2017] Italy launched a 1st alert through the Early Warning Response System (EWRS) in order to alert other European Union countries about the ongoing outbreak. In the affected municipality, vector control activities against larvae and adult mosquitoes were performed and the population was advised to take measures to avoid mosquito bites and to remove all potential breeding sites from their gardens. Moreover, measures such as clinical evaluation of blood donors, gathering post-donation information for donors residing in the Lazio region, and application of 28 days deferral of donors who visited the municipality of Anzio since 1 Aug 2017 were reinforced.\n\nBackground\n--------------\nChikungunya is a self-limiting mosquito-borne viral disease characterised by arthralgia/arthritis primarily of the wrists, knees, ankles and small joints of the extremities lasting from days to months. Between 1/3rd and one half of the patients develop a generally non-pruritic maculopapular rash primarily of the trunk and limbs 1-12 days after the onset of arthritis that resolves in 7-10 days. Myalgia, fatigue, fever and lymphadenopathy are common. Complications are rare; however, chikungunya [virus infection] leads to (self-perceived) long-term sequelae in a considerable proportion of patients. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 10 days (average 3 days).\n\nThe aetiological agent is a single strand, positive sense RNA virus of the Alphavirus genus, Togaviridae family of which 3 main genotypes have been identified: Asian, West African and ECSA [8]. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the _Aedes spp._ primarily _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_. Transmission through transfusion/transplantation has been demonstrated in animal models.\n\nChikungunya [virus] is endemic in Africa, southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Pacific region and in tropical regions of the Americas (since 2013). In Europe, autochthonous cases, which were linked to imported cases, were detected in France in the Var department, in September 2010 and in the city of Montpellier, Hrault department, in October 2014. In August 2017, a cluster of locally acquired cases consisting of 4 confirmed and one probable case was also described in the Var department.\n\nDiscussion\n------------\nThe outbreak described here is the 2nd autochthonous chikungunya outbreak detected in Italy. The 1st outbreak, with more than 200 reported cases, occurred between July and September 2007 in the northeast of the country, near the Adriatic coast, in the province of Ravenna. Subsequent to it, Italy set up a national plan for the surveillance and control of the disease. The aim of this surveillance system is to monitor imported cases and local transmission, identify outbreaks in a timely fashion, and to prevent transmission from substances of human origin (SoHO). The surveillance is enhanced during the high vector activity season (1 Jun-31 Oct). The competent vector, _Ae. albopictus_, which was 1st detected in north-western Italy in 1990, is now widely established throughout the country, including the Lazio region. Overall between 2014 and 2016, a total of 128 possible/probable/confirmed imported cases of chikungunya [virus infection] have been notified to the Italian health authorities (mean: 43 cases/year; range: 25 cases in 2015 and 70 cases in 2014). Most cases had a travel history to Central and South America.\n\nAnzio, one of the locations where autochonous chikungunya cases were currently detected, is a holiday resort less than one hour drive away from Rome. Many families visit the area until the beginning of the school year, which in 2017 was on 14 Sep 2017. During the summer, the population density increases in the area owing to the easy commute from Rome. Viraemic individuals exposed in August 2017 are likely to have travelled around resulting in new introductions in receptive areas and challenging the implementation of control measures. The delayed identification of the autochthonous cases in Anzio, a coastal recreational area close to the capital towards the end of summer may have triggered the local transmission in Rome. This suggests an extension of the outbreak and the presence of secondary multifocal transmission chains.\n\nThe lack of access to closed summer houses after mid-September may hamper vector control activities. Summer 2017 has been characterised by particularly high temperatures and by an unusual dry period from May to August, factors that would normally prevent high mosquito density. However, other concomitant factors favoured the activity and abundance of the tiger mosquito including the presence of numerous peridomestic 'man-made' breeding sites within constantly irrigated private gardens.\n\nThe identification of the viral strain involved in the current Italian outbreak as one very close to the ECSA strain involved in the ongoing epidemic in Pakistan is not surprising, even if this virus it is not carrying the A226V mutation, which has been involved in the increased susceptibility of _Ae. albopictus_ for infection and transmission of chikungunya virus. Other yet undefined mutations might be responsible for the vector competence of _Ae. albopictus_, allowing it to sustain the present outbreak.

Symptoms had started while they were on holiday near the coastal town of Anzio, in the province of Rome, Lazio region (ca 58 km [36 miles] from Rome). The dates of symptom onset were 5 and 11 Aug and 2 Sep [2017], respectively. The patients lived in the same home, and none had travelled to chikungunya, dengue or Zika [virus] endemic areas in the 2 weeks before symptom onset. The 2 patients who developed symptoms at the beginning of August were chikungunya IgM positive, and the infection was confirmed through a neutralisation test (PRNT). The 3rd patient, who was symptomatic at the time of sample collection, was IgM positive and PRNT borderline (PRNT 1:10). Chikungunya virus was detected by RT-PCR followed by nested PCR in both serum and urine and was isolated from urine.\n\nThe regional health authorities immediately implemented measures around this initial cluster, which are described in the national plan for chikungunya surveillance and control [1]. The 3 patients had referred to other individuals in their neighbourhood who had developed similar symptoms since the beginning of August 2017. Epidemiological surveillance was enhanced to identify additional cases (case finding trough general practitioners (GPs), paediatricians, emergency rooms and hospitals). As of 20 Sep 2017, 86 confirmed autochthonous cases of chikungunya were reported to the regional surveillance system; the investigation is ongoing. These were found among people living in Anzio, or people who had travelled there 15 days before symptom onset. Cases from Rome were also identified, with either travel history to Anzio or to other endemic areas. The primary viraemic case who imported the virus into the region has not been identified so far.\n\nEntomological investigation\n-------------------------------\nOn 7 and 8 Sep 2017, adult mosquitoes were collected in the Anzio municipality by using BG Sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure (Biogents, Regensburg, Germany) and captured directly using handheld electric aspirators on vegetation or on exposed skin. Larval collections were performed using dippers or droppers by inspecting artificial containers (removable or non-removable), as potential larval breeding sites. Adults and larvae of _Aedes albopictus_ (tiger mosquito) and _Culex pipiens_ were found in the Anzio municipality area. Mosquito adults were sorted into 12 pools to determine the species, distinguish males from females and to test for chikungunya virus. The number of specimens in each pool ranged from 1 to 13. Among 53 mosquitoes, one pool of 12 _Ae. albopictus_ females which had been collected near the house of the 1st 3 cases identified in Anzio was found to be chikungunya virus positive by PCR. The virus was isolated.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of patient and mosquito sequences\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nSequences of the PCR amplicons of the virus envelope (E)1 gene from the patient (GenBank numbers: LT908477 and LT908478) and from the mosquitoes were identical (GenBank number: LT908476), and also showed a 100 percent similarity with the sequence of a chikungunya East Central South African (ECSA) strain involved in an ongoing epidemic in Pakistan, which does not carry the A226V mutation. In a phylogenetic analysis, the Italian sequences also clustered with ESCA strain sequences obtained from different parts of the world (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis of sequences derived from chikungunya virus positive samples obtained in this study, Italy, August-September 2017 [Interested readers can access this figure at the above URL].\n\nHighlighted in the figure are 2 clusters. The 1st, identifiable as 'ESCA genotype', indicates sequences of the ESCA genotype. The 2nd cluster, identifiable as 'E1 A226V', includes all sequences with the A226V mutation in the envelope (E)1 gene, a mutation, which is involved in the increased susceptibility of _Aedes albopictus_ for infection and transmission of chikungunya virus.\n\nControl measures\n--------------------\nOn 8 Sep [2017] Italy launched a 1st alert through the Early Warning Response System (EWRS) in order to alert other European Union countries about the ongoing outbreak. In the affected municipality, vector control activities against larvae and adult mosquitoes were performed and the population was advised to take measures to avoid mosquito bites and to remove all potential breeding sites from their gardens. Moreover, measures such as clinical evaluation of blood donors, gathering post-donation information for donors residing in the Lazio region, and application of 28 days deferral of donors who visited the municipality of Anzio since 1 Aug 2017 were reinforced.\n\nBackground\n--------------\nChikungunya is a self-limiting mosquito-borne viral disease characterised by arthralgia/arthritis primarily of the wrists, knees, ankles and small joints of the extremities lasting from days to months. Between 1/3rd and one half of the patients develop a generally non-pruritic maculopapular rash primarily of the trunk and limbs 1-12 days after the onset of arthritis that resolves in 7-10 days. Myalgia, fatigue, fever and lymphadenopathy are common. Complications are rare; however, chikungunya [virus infection] leads to (self-perceived) long-term sequelae in a considerable proportion of patients. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 10 days (average 3 days).\n\nThe aetiological agent is a single strand, positive sense RNA virus of the Alphavirus genus, Togaviridae family of which 3 main genotypes have been identified: Asian, West African and ECSA [8]. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the _Aedes spp._ primarily _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_. Transmission through transfusion/transplantation has been demonstrated in animal models.\n\nChikungunya [virus] is endemic in Africa, southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Pacific region and in tropical regions of the Americas (since 2013). In Europe, autochthonous cases, which were linked to imported cases, were detected in France in the Var department, in September 2010 and in the city of Montpellier, Hrault department, in October 2014. In August 2017, a cluster of locally acquired cases consisting of 4 confirmed and one probable case was also described in the Var department.\n\nDiscussion\n------------\nThe outbreak described here is the 2nd autochthonous chikungunya outbreak detected in Italy. The 1st outbreak, with more than 200 reported cases, occurred between July and September 2007 in the northeast of the country, near the Adriatic coast, in the province of Ravenna. Subsequent to it, Italy set up a national plan for the surveillance and control of the disease. The aim of this surveillance system is to monitor imported cases and local transmission, identify outbreaks in a timely fashion, and to prevent transmission from substances of human origin (SoHO). The surveillance is enhanced during the high vector activity season (1 Jun-31 Oct). The competent vector, _Ae. albopictus_, which was 1st detected in north-western Italy in 1990, is now widely established throughout the country, including the Lazio region. Overall between 2014 and 2016, a total of 128 possible/probable/confirmed imported cases of chikungunya [virus infection] have been notified to the Italian health authorities (mean: 43 cases/year; range: 25 cases in 2015 and 70 cases in 2014). Most cases had a travel history to Central and South America.\n\nAnzio, one of the locations where autochonous chikungunya cases were currently detected, is a holiday resort less than one hour drive away from Rome. Many families visit the area until the beginning of the school year, which in 2017 was on 14 Sep 2017. During the summer, the population density increases in the area owing to the easy commute from Rome. Viraemic individuals exposed in August 2017 are likely to have travelled around resulting in new introductions in receptive areas and challenging the implementation of control measures. The delayed identification of the autochthonous cases in Anzio, a coastal recreational area close to the capital towards the end of summer may have triggered the local transmission in Rome. This suggests an extension of the outbreak and the presence of secondary multifocal transmission chains.\n\nThe lack of access to closed summer houses after mid-September may hamper vector control activities. Summer 2017 has been characterised by particularly high temperatures and by an unusual dry period from May to August, factors that would normally prevent high mosquito density. However, other concomitant factors favoured the activity and abundance of the tiger mosquito including the presence of numerous peridomestic 'man-made' breeding sites within constantly irrigated private gardens.\n\nThe identification of the viral strain involved in the current Italian outbreak as one very close to the ECSA strain involved in the ongoing epidemic in Pakistan is not surprising, even if this virus it is not carrying the A226V mutation, which has been involved in the increased susceptibility of _Ae. albopictus_ for infection and transmission of chikungunya virus. Other yet undefined mutations might be responsible for the vector competence of _Ae. albopictus_, allowing it to sustain the present outbreak. The fact that we found chikungunya RNA in a small size mosquito pool, suggests a high level of virus circulation in the area. The investigation is still ongoing and, due to enhanced surveillance and testing, further cases have been identified, with as of 22 Sep [2017], 102 laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The count has now increased to 102 reported cases. There are 10 new cases. Of these 10 new cases: 5 concern individuals who had resided in the municipality of Anzio within 15 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The remaining 5 new cases concern people resident in the municipality of Rome and have no links with Anzio (http://www.regione.lazio.it/rl_main/?vw=newsDettaglio&id=4128 in Italian).

Spread of chikungunya virus East/Central/South African genotype in Northeast Brazil. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017 [date cited]. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2310.170307\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe investigated an outbreak of exanthematous illness in Maceio by using molecular surveillance; 76 percent of samples tested positive for chikungunya virus. Genetic analysis of 23 newly generated genomes identified the East/Central/South African [ECSA] genotype, suggesting that this lineage has persisted since mid-2014 in Brazil and may spread in the Americas and beyond.\n\n[Approach]\n----------\nAnalyzed samples were from patients who were on average 37 years of age (range 1-86 years); 175 (64 percent) were female, and 198 (73 percent) resided in Maceio municipality. Diagnostic tests for DENV [dengue virus], ZIKV [Zika virus], and CHIKV [chikungunya virus] confirmed that 208 (76 percent) were positive for CHIKV RNA. In addition, 36 (13.2 percent) were co-infected with CHIKV and ZIKV, consistent with Zika virus circulation in Northeast Brazil in mid-2016. We detected no DENV infections. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for CHIKV RNA-positive samples were lower (average Ct = 24.6) than those for ZIKV (average Ct = 33.5).\n\nWe applied a metagenomics next-generation sequencing protocol to 38 randomly chosen CHIKV RNA-positive samples. We recovered 23 CHIKV genomes (greater than 4000 bp) by using the MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA); mean genome coverage was 72x and mean depth coverage 207x. We also included 2 CHIKV RNA-positive samples from Joao Pessoa, Para\u00edba state.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017 [date cited]. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2310.170307\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe investigated an outbreak of exanthematous illness in Maceio by using molecular surveillance; 76 percent of samples tested positive for chikungunya virus. Genetic analysis of 23 newly generated genomes identified the East/Central/South African [ECSA] genotype, suggesting that this lineage has persisted since mid-2014 in Brazil and may spread in the Americas and beyond.\n\n[Approach]\n----------\nAnalyzed samples were from patients who were on average 37 years of age (range 1-86 years); 175 (64 percent) were female, and 198 (73 percent) resided in Maceio municipality. Diagnostic tests for DENV [dengue virus], ZIKV [Zika virus], and CHIKV [chikungunya virus] confirmed that 208 (76 percent) were positive for CHIKV RNA. In addition, 36 (13.2 percent) were co-infected with CHIKV and ZIKV, consistent with Zika virus circulation in Northeast Brazil in mid-2016. We detected no DENV infections. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for CHIKV RNA-positive samples were lower (average Ct = 24.6) than those for ZIKV (average Ct = 33.5).\n\nWe applied a metagenomics next-generation sequencing protocol to 38 randomly chosen CHIKV RNA-positive samples. We recovered 23 CHIKV genomes (greater than 4000 bp) by using the MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA); mean genome coverage was 72x and mean depth coverage 207x. We also included 2 CHIKV RNA-positive samples from Joao Pessoa, Para\u00edba state. We did not detect the E1-A226V adaptive mutation associated with large outbreaks in Asia in the strains we analyzed. We then appended sequences to publicly available data (659 CHIKV isolates) and used maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to identify the origins of the outbreak.\n\n[Results and conclusion]\n------------------------\nOn the basis of available sequences of isolates from the Americas, the Maceio sequences we analyzed fell within a single strongly supported monophyletic clade (bootstrap support = 99 percent, posterior support = 1.00) that belongs to the ECSA.

We recovered 23 CHIKV genomes (greater than 4000 bp) by using the MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA); mean genome coverage was 72x and mean depth coverage 207x. We also included 2 CHIKV RNA-positive samples from Joao Pessoa, Para\u00edba state. We did not detect the E1-A226V adaptive mutation associated with large outbreaks in Asia in the strains we analyzed. We then appended sequences to publicly available data (659 CHIKV isolates) and used maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to identify the origins of the outbreak.\n\n[Results and conclusion]\n------------------------\nOn the basis of available sequences of isolates from the Americas, the Maceio sequences we analyzed fell within a single strongly supported monophyletic clade (bootstrap support = 99 percent, posterior support = 1.00) that belongs to the ECSA.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017 [date cited]. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2310.170307\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe investigated an outbreak of exanthematous illness in Maceio by using molecular surveillance; 76 percent of samples tested positive for chikungunya virus. Genetic analysis of 23 newly generated genomes identified the East/Central/South African [ECSA] genotype, suggesting that this lineage has persisted since mid-2014 in Brazil and may spread in the Americas and beyond.\n\n[Approach]\n----------\nAnalyzed samples were from patients who were on average 37 years of age (range 1-86 years); 175 (64 percent) were female, and 198 (73 percent) resided in Maceio municipality. Diagnostic tests for DENV [dengue virus], ZIKV [Zika virus], and CHIKV [chikungunya virus] confirmed that 208 (76 percent) were positive for CHIKV RNA. In addition, 36 (13.2 percent) were co-infected with CHIKV and ZIKV, consistent with Zika virus circulation in Northeast Brazil in mid-2016. We detected no DENV infections. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for CHIKV RNA-positive samples were lower (average Ct = 24.6) than those for ZIKV (average Ct = 33.5).\n\nWe applied a metagenomics next-generation sequencing protocol to 38 randomly chosen CHIKV RNA-positive samples.

Genetic analysis of 23 newly generated genomes identified the East/Central/South African [ECSA] genotype, suggesting that this lineage has persisted since mid-2014 in Brazil and may spread in the Americas and beyond.\n\n[Approach]\n----------\nAnalyzed samples were from patients who were on average 37 years of age (range 1-86 years); 175 (64 percent) were female, and 198 (73 percent) resided in Maceio municipality. Diagnostic tests for DENV [dengue virus], ZIKV [Zika virus], and CHIKV [chikungunya virus] confirmed that 208 (76 percent) were positive for CHIKV RNA. In addition, 36 (13.2 percent) were co-infected with CHIKV and ZIKV, consistent with Zika virus circulation in Northeast Brazil in mid-2016. We detected no DENV infections. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for CHIKV RNA-positive samples were lower (average Ct = 24.6) than those for ZIKV (average Ct = 33.5).\n\nWe applied a metagenomics next-generation sequencing protocol to 38 randomly chosen CHIKV RNA-positive samples. We recovered 23 CHIKV genomes (greater than 4000 bp) by using the MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA); mean genome coverage was 72x and mean depth coverage 207x. We also included 2 CHIKV RNA-positive samples from Joao Pessoa, Para\u00edba state. We did not detect the E1-A226V adaptive mutation associated with large outbreaks in Asia in the strains we analyzed. We then appended sequences to publicly available data (659 CHIKV isolates) and used maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to identify the origins of the outbreak.\n\n[Results and conclusion]\n------------------------\nOn the basis of available sequences of isolates from the Americas, the Maceio sequences we analyzed fell within a single strongly supported monophyletic clade (bootstrap support = 99 percent, posterior support = 1.00) that belongs to the ECSA. Genetic analysis suggests the outbreak most likely originated from transmission cycles not previously identified in northeast Brazil and not from a separate introduction into the Americas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Given active dengue virus transmission in this area at the time that samples for this study were collected, it is likely that the earliest cases of chikungunya virus infection were misdiagnosed as dengue fever. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (29): Asia (Pakistan) 20170910.5306378\nChikungunya (28): Asia (Pakistan) 20170824.5268630\nChikungunya (27): Americas, Europe, Asia 20170823.5268087\nChikungunya (26): Asia (Pakistan) comment, RFI 20170811.5240010\nChikungunya (25): Asia (Pakistan) 20170809.5235254\nChikungunya (24): Asia (Pakistan) 20170726.5205157\nChikungunya (23): Asia (Bangladesh), case numbers 20170711.5165290\nChikungunya (22): Americas, Asia 20170704.5149989\nChikungunya (21): Americas, Asia, observations, research 20170626.5132080\nChikungunya (20): Asia (Pakistan) 20170623.5127317\nChikungunya (19): Americas, Asia, observations, research 20170610.5096983\nChikungunya (06): Americas, Asia, research 20170206.4817959\nand other items in the archives\n.................................................sb/sh/mpp/ty/mj/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "chikungunya", "dengue", "zika"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2007-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-10-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "2021-03-28 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Northeast Brazil", "country": "Brazil"}, {"location": "Costa Rica", "country": "Costa Rica"}, {"location": "Costa AC", "country": "Ivory Coast"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "Brazil"}, {"location": "Puerto Rico", "country": "Puerto Rico"}, {"location": "Chikungunya", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "El Salvador", "country": "El Salvador"}, {"location": "Belgium", "country": "Belgium"}, {"location": "Panama City", "country": "Panama"}, {"location": "Bolivia", "country": "Bolivia"}, {"location": "Panama", "country": "Panama"}, {"location": "Italy", "country": "Italy"}, {"location": "Delhi", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Para\u00edba", "country": "Brazil"}, {"location": "San Diego", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Pakistan", "country": "Pakistan"}, {"location": "San Miguelito", "country": "Panama"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Nicaragua", "country": "Nicaragua"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "France"}, {"location": "Colombia", "country": "Colombia"}, {"location": "Brussels", "country": "Belgium"}, {"location": "Bangladesh", "country": "Bangladesh"}, {"location": "Peru", "country": "Peru"}, {"location": "Santa Cruz", "country": "Bolivia"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5310090", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Chikungunya (30): Americas, Europe, Asia, research", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5310090", "date": "2017-09-12 21:29:13", "main_text": "CHIKUNGUNYA (30): AMERICAS, EUROPE, ASIA, RESEARCH\n**************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Cases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n---\nAmericas\n---\nRegional summary\nWHO/PAHO report\n\nCentral America\n---\nPanama (San Miguelito district, Panama City)\n\nSouth America\n---\nBolivia (Santa Cruz department)\n\nEurope\n---\nItaly (Anzio, Lazio region)\nFrance (Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur): WHO\n\nAsia\n---\nIndia (national)\n\n[2] Brazil: genomic analysis\n\n******\nCases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n---\nAmericas\n---\nWHO/PAHO report\n8 Sep 2017\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=rdmore&cid=8975&Itemid=40931\n\n\nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory - 2017 to EW 36 [week ending (w/e) 1 Sep 2017].

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017 [date cited]. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2310.170307\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe investigated an outbreak of exanthematous illness in Maceio by using molecular surveillance; 76 percent of samples tested positive for chikungunya virus. Genetic analysis of 23 newly generated genomes identified the East/Central/South African [ECSA] genotype, suggesting that this lineage has persisted since mid-2014 in Brazil and may spread in the Americas and beyond.\n\n[Approach]\n----------\nAnalyzed samples were from patients who were on average 37 years of age (range 1-86 years); 175 (64 percent) were female, and 198 (73 percent) resided in Maceio municipality. Diagnostic tests for DENV [dengue virus], ZIKV [Zika virus], and CHIKV [chikungunya virus] confirmed that 208 (76 percent) were positive for CHIKV RNA. In addition, 36 (13.2 percent) were co-infected with CHIKV and ZIKV, consistent with Zika virus circulation in Northeast Brazil in mid-2016. We detected no DENV infections. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for CHIKV RNA-positive samples were lower (average Ct = 24.6) than those for ZIKV (average Ct = 33.5).\n\nWe applied a metagenomics next-generation sequencing protocol to 38 randomly chosen CHIKV RNA-positive samples. We recovered 23 CHIKV genomes (greater than 4000 bp) by using the MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA); mean genome coverage was 72x and mean depth coverage 207x. We also included 2 CHIKV RNA-positive samples from Joao Pessoa, Para\u00edba state. We did not detect the E1-A226V adaptive mutation associated with large outbreaks in Asia in the strains we analyzed. We then appended sequences to publicly available data (659 CHIKV isolates) and used maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to identify the origins of the outbreak.\n\n[Results and conclusion]\n------------------------\nOn the basis of available sequences of isolates from the Americas, the Maceio sequences we analyzed fell within a single strongly supported monophyletic clade (bootstrap support = 99 percent, posterior support = 1.00) that belongs to the ECSA.

It pointed out that the report might have been picked up from an incomplete telephone-based survey of the IEDCR. It had conducted a telephone-based survey among 4775 people. Of them, 357 gave the information that they were suffering from fever and joint pain, the symptoms of chikungunya.\n\nBut they were not tested later for the confirmation of the disease. The IEDCR said the survey was still ongoing and data compilation and analysis incomplete. Based on that survey, none should come to any conclusion, the disease monitoring agency said.\n\nIt does not provide any information regarding the number of chikungunya patients but gives an idea about the presence of the disease, said the statement.\n\nChikungunya has struck so much fear into the people that a lawyer has even filed a writ petition in the court demanding proper actions.\n\nThe High Court on [Sun 9 Jul 2017] issued a rule asking why it will not order authorities to compensate patients diagnosed with chikungunya.\n\nHowever, IEDCR had advised the people from the beginning not to trouble themselves with running tests for the disease since it does not have any treatment.\n\nBoth dengue and chikungunya show some common symptoms such as fever and pain. But in chikungunya the pain is so severe that people cannot move. It involves all the joints, doctors say. It can be misdiagnosed, but both of them have no specific treatment. Treatment is mainly focused on relieving the symptoms. Paracetamol is the drug of choice for relieving both fever and pain. So there is no need to wait for testing, experts say.\n\nGeneral awareness is important as the Aedes mosquito usually breeds in a small collection of clean water in and around houses, such as inside a flower vase. Intermittent rains cause a proliferation of the breeding when water accumulates in different containers around homes.\n\nThe IEDCR advises removal of all open containers with stagnant water in and around the houses on a regular basis - flower plates and pots, used tires, tree holes and rock pools.\n\nHowever, the institute could not explain the reports of widespread fever in the capital.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 1st identified chikungunya outbreak occurred in Bangladesh in 2008.

It pointed out that the report might have been picked up from an incomplete telephone-based survey of the IEDCR. It had conducted a telephone-based survey among 4775 people. Of them, 357 gave the information that they were suffering from fever and joint pain, the symptoms of chikungunya.\n\nBut they were not tested later for the confirmation of the disease. The IEDCR said the survey was still ongoing and data compilation and analysis incomplete. Based on that survey, none should come to any conclusion, the disease monitoring agency said.\n\nIt does not provide any information regarding the number of chikungunya patients but gives an idea about the presence of the disease, said the statement.\n\nChikungunya has struck so much fear into the people that a lawyer has even filed a writ petition in the court demanding proper actions.\n\nThe High Court on [Sun 9 Jul 2017] issued a rule asking why it will not order authorities to compensate patients diagnosed with chikungunya.\n\nHowever, IEDCR had advised the people from the beginning not to trouble themselves with running tests for the disease since it does not have any treatment.\n\nBoth dengue and chikungunya show some common symptoms such as fever and pain. But in chikungunya the pain is so severe that people cannot move. It involves all the joints, doctors say. It can be misdiagnosed, but both of them have no specific treatment. Treatment is mainly focused on relieving the symptoms. Paracetamol is the drug of choice for relieving both fever and pain. So there is no need to wait for testing, experts say.\n\nGeneral awareness is important as the Aedes mosquito usually breeds in a small collection of clean water in and around houses, such as inside a flower vase. Intermittent rains cause a proliferation of the breeding when water accumulates in different containers around homes.\n\nThe IEDCR advises removal of all open containers with stagnant water in and around the houses on a regular basis - flower plates and pots, used tires, tree holes and rock pools.\n\nHowever, the institute could not explain the reports of widespread fever in the capital.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 1st identified chikungunya outbreak occurred in Bangladesh in 2008.

The hospital in question is located in Khokhorapar No. 2.\n\nProgamme manager of dengue prevention and control Dr. Masood Solangi said that the medical superintendent of Al Mustafa Welfare Society hospital had informed him that his hospital had received some chikungunya cases. \"I asked him about this, since the hospital doesn't have the facilities to diagnose chikungunya,\" he explained, adding that symptoms of high-grade fever and acute joint pain might have led doctors to believe that patients had contracted chikungunya.\n\n\"However, we will investigate these cases on Monday [19 Dec 2016] with the help of experts arriving from Islamabad. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, for instance high-grade fever, body aches and rash, and can be misdiagnosed.\"\n\nThe disease, Dr. Solangi pointed out, was rarely fatal, and no other health facility in the city had reported a similar complaint with the surveillance centre. \"If cases were found positive, they will be the 1st cases of chikungunya in the country,\" he added.\n\nAccording to him, the city immediately needs vector control strategies, especially fumigation and waste disposal measures, to prevent outbreaks of diseases like malaria, typhoid and dengue.\n\n\"A decade ago, no dengue case was ever reported in winter, but now we have them. This shows that the virus has successfully adapted itself to the filthy conditions prevailing in the city. The theory that the dengue vector (a female mosquito) breeds only in clean water is no longer true, since we have found its larvae in dirty water, too.\"\n\nThe city, he said, hadn't seen a single fumigation drive this year [2016]. Upon contact, staff at the Al Mustafa hospital said that hundreds of patients with complaints of high-grade fever and body aches had reported at the facility since last month [November 2016].\n\n\"We don't know what exactly they have since we can't afford to test each and every case in the laboratory. Most patients are advised [to take] general medicines to alleviate pain and fever,\" a doctor said on condition of anonymity.\n\nSome patients were found to have dengue, others typhoid or malaria when their diagnosis was made, he added.\n\nCurrently, the facility to diagnose chikungunya in the city only exists at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), health department sources say.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's (WHO) website, chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain.\n\nOther symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration. There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya.\n\nThe disease occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. In recent decades, mosquito vectors of chikungunya have spread to Europe and the Americas. In 2007, disease transmission was reported for the 1st time in a localised outbreak in northeastern Italy.\n\nOutbreaks have since been recorded in France and Croatia. Most patients recover fully in 2-3 weeks, but in some cases, joint pain may persist for several months, or even years.\n\nOccasional cases of eye, neurological and heart complications have been reported, as well as gastrointestinal complaints, the website says. Serious complications are not common, but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death.\n\nOften, symptoms in infected individuals are mild, and the infection may go unrecognised, or be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue occurs.\n\nThe name chikungunya derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, meaning \"to become contorted,\" and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Pakistan is one of the countries where dengue fever is now endemic, and chikungunya is also transmitted by the same mosquito vectors, _Aedes aegypti_, and _Aedes albopictus_. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of acute febrile viral illness may also include chikungunya as well.\n\nHowever, the report also states that the suspected cases are based on clinical picture and not on laboratory confirmation. A laboratory testing facility is currently available at the national public health laboratory at National Institute of Health, Islamabad.\n\nThe most common symptoms of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection are fever and joint pain.

The hospital in question is located in Khokhorapar No. 2.\n\nProgamme manager of dengue prevention and control Dr. Masood Solangi said that the medical superintendent of Al Mustafa Welfare Society hospital had informed him that his hospital had received some chikungunya cases. \"I asked him about this, since the hospital doesn't have the facilities to diagnose chikungunya,\" he explained, adding that symptoms of high-grade fever and acute joint pain might have led doctors to believe that patients had contracted chikungunya.\n\n\"However, we will investigate these cases on Monday [19 Dec 2016] with the help of experts arriving from Islamabad. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, for instance high-grade fever, body aches and rash, and can be misdiagnosed.\"\n\nThe disease, Dr. Solangi pointed out, was rarely fatal, and no other health facility in the city had reported a similar complaint with the surveillance centre. \"If cases were found positive, they will be the 1st cases of chikungunya in the country,\" he added.\n\nAccording to him, the city immediately needs vector control strategies, especially fumigation and waste disposal measures, to prevent outbreaks of diseases like malaria, typhoid and dengue.\n\n\"A decade ago, no dengue case was ever reported in winter, but now we have them. This shows that the virus has successfully adapted itself to the filthy conditions prevailing in the city. The theory that the dengue vector (a female mosquito) breeds only in clean water is no longer true, since we have found its larvae in dirty water, too.\"\n\nThe city, he said, hadn't seen a single fumigation drive this year [2016]. Upon contact, staff at the Al Mustafa hospital said that hundreds of patients with complaints of high-grade fever and body aches had reported at the facility since last month [November 2016].\n\n\"We don't know what exactly they have since we can't afford to test each and every case in the laboratory. Most patients are advised [to take] general medicines to alleviate pain and fever,\" a doctor said on condition of anonymity.\n\nSome patients were found to have dengue, others typhoid or malaria when their diagnosis was made, he added.\n\nCurrently, the facility to diagnose chikungunya in the city only exists at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), health department sources say.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's (WHO) website, chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain.\n\nOther symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration. There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya.\n\nThe disease occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. In recent decades, mosquito vectors of chikungunya have spread to Europe and the Americas. In 2007, disease transmission was reported for the 1st time in a localised outbreak in northeastern Italy.\n\nOutbreaks have since been recorded in France and Croatia. Most patients recover fully in 2-3 weeks, but in some cases, joint pain may persist for several months, or even years.\n\nOccasional cases of eye, neurological and heart complications have been reported, as well as gastrointestinal complaints, the website says. Serious complications are not common, but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death.\n\nOften, symptoms in infected individuals are mild, and the infection may go unrecognised, or be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue occurs.\n\nThe name chikungunya derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, meaning \"to become contorted,\" and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Pakistan is one of the countries where dengue fever is now endemic, and chikungunya is also transmitted by the same mosquito vectors, _Aedes aegypti_, and _Aedes albopictus_. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of acute febrile viral illness may also include chikungunya as well.\n\nHowever, the report also states that the suspected cases are based on clinical picture and not on laboratory confirmation.

The hospital in question is located in Khokhorapar No. 2.\n\nProgamme manager of dengue prevention and control Dr. Masood Solangi said that the medical superintendent of Al Mustafa Welfare Society hospital had informed him that his hospital had received some chikungunya cases. \"I asked him about this, since the hospital doesn't have the facilities to diagnose chikungunya,\" he explained, adding that symptoms of high-grade fever and acute joint pain might have led doctors to believe that patients had contracted chikungunya.\n\n\"However, we will investigate these cases on Monday [19 Dec 2016] with the help of experts arriving from Islamabad. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, for instance high-grade fever, body aches and rash, and can be misdiagnosed.\"\n\nThe disease, Dr. Solangi pointed out, was rarely fatal, and no other health facility in the city had reported a similar complaint with the surveillance centre. \"If cases were found positive, they will be the 1st cases of chikungunya in the country,\" he added.\n\nAccording to him, the city immediately needs vector control strategies, especially fumigation and waste disposal measures, to prevent outbreaks of diseases like malaria, typhoid and dengue.\n\n\"A decade ago, no dengue case was ever reported in winter, but now we have them. This shows that the virus has successfully adapted itself to the filthy conditions prevailing in the city. The theory that the dengue vector (a female mosquito) breeds only in clean water is no longer true, since we have found its larvae in dirty water, too.\"\n\nThe city, he said, hadn't seen a single fumigation drive this year [2016]. Upon contact, staff at the Al Mustafa hospital said that hundreds of patients with complaints of high-grade fever and body aches had reported at the facility since last month [November 2016].\n\n\"We don't know what exactly they have since we can't afford to test each and every case in the laboratory. Most patients are advised [to take] general medicines to alleviate pain and fever,\" a doctor said on condition of anonymity.\n\nSome patients were found to have dengue, others typhoid or malaria when their diagnosis was made, he added.\n\nCurrently, the facility to diagnose chikungunya in the city only exists at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), health department sources say.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's (WHO) website, chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain.\n\nOther symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration. There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya.\n\nThe disease occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. In recent decades, mosquito vectors of chikungunya have spread to Europe and the Americas. In 2007, disease transmission was reported for the 1st time in a localised outbreak in northeastern Italy.\n\nOutbreaks have since been recorded in France and Croatia. Most patients recover fully in 2-3 weeks, but in some cases, joint pain may persist for several months, or even years.\n\nOccasional cases of eye, neurological and heart complications have been reported, as well as gastrointestinal complaints, the website says. Serious complications are not common, but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death.\n\nOften, symptoms in infected individuals are mild, and the infection may go unrecognised, or be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue occurs.\n\nThe name chikungunya derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, meaning \"to become contorted,\" and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Pakistan is one of the countries where dengue fever is now endemic, and chikungunya is also transmitted by the same mosquito vectors, _Aedes aegypti_, and _Aedes albopictus_. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of acute febrile viral illness may also include chikungunya as well.\n\nHowever, the report also states that the suspected cases are based on clinical picture and not on laboratory confirmation. A laboratory testing facility is currently available at the national public health laboratory at National Institute of Health, Islamabad.\n\nThe most common symptoms of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection are fever and joint pain.

The hospital in question is located in Khokhorapar No. 2.\n\nProgamme manager of dengue prevention and control Dr. Masood Solangi said that the medical superintendent of Al Mustafa Welfare Society hospital had informed him that his hospital had received some chikungunya cases. \"I asked him about this, since the hospital doesn't have the facilities to diagnose chikungunya,\" he explained, adding that symptoms of high-grade fever and acute joint pain might have led doctors to believe that patients had contracted chikungunya.\n\n\"However, we will investigate these cases on Monday [19 Dec 2016] with the help of experts arriving from Islamabad. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, for instance high-grade fever, body aches and rash, and can be misdiagnosed.\"\n\nThe disease, Dr. Solangi pointed out, was rarely fatal, and no other health facility in the city had reported a similar complaint with the surveillance centre. \"If cases were found positive, they will be the 1st cases of chikungunya in the country,\" he added.\n\nAccording to him, the city immediately needs vector control strategies, especially fumigation and waste disposal measures, to prevent outbreaks of diseases like malaria, typhoid and dengue.\n\n\"A decade ago, no dengue case was ever reported in winter, but now we have them. This shows that the virus has successfully adapted itself to the filthy conditions prevailing in the city. The theory that the dengue vector (a female mosquito) breeds only in clean water is no longer true, since we have found its larvae in dirty water, too.\"\n\nThe city, he said, hadn't seen a single fumigation drive this year [2016]. Upon contact, staff at the Al Mustafa hospital said that hundreds of patients with complaints of high-grade fever and body aches had reported at the facility since last month [November 2016].\n\n\"We don't know what exactly they have since we can't afford to test each and every case in the laboratory. Most patients are advised [to take] general medicines to alleviate pain and fever,\" a doctor said on condition of anonymity.\n\nSome patients were found to have dengue, others typhoid or malaria when their diagnosis was made, he added.\n\nCurrently, the facility to diagnose chikungunya in the city only exists at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), health department sources say.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's (WHO) website, chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain.\n\nOther symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration. There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya.\n\nThe disease occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. In recent decades, mosquito vectors of chikungunya have spread to Europe and the Americas. In 2007, disease transmission was reported for the 1st time in a localised outbreak in northeastern Italy.\n\nOutbreaks have since been recorded in France and Croatia. Most patients recover fully in 2-3 weeks, but in some cases, joint pain may persist for several months, or even years.\n\nOccasional cases of eye, neurological and heart complications have been reported, as well as gastrointestinal complaints, the website says. Serious complications are not common, but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death.\n\nOften, symptoms in infected individuals are mild, and the infection may go unrecognised, or be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue occurs.\n\nThe name chikungunya derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, meaning \"to become contorted,\" and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Pakistan is one of the countries where dengue fever is now endemic, and chikungunya is also transmitted by the same mosquito vectors, _Aedes aegypti_, and _Aedes albopictus_. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of acute febrile viral illness may also include chikungunya as well.\n\nHowever, the report also states that the suspected cases are based on clinical picture and not on laboratory confirmation. A laboratory testing facility is currently available at the national public health laboratory at National Institute of Health, Islamabad.\n\nThe most common symptoms of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. Chikungunya outbreaks have been reported from neighboring countries like India and Nepal and other countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

Jaramillo, MD]\n\nAsia\n---\nJapan ex Cuba. 21 Mar 2016. We describe a case of a chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-infected patient returning from Cuba, where no autochthonous transmission case has been reported, and the number of tourists has been increasing after the normalization between Cuba and the United States.\n\nA previously healthy 27-year-old Japanese man presented to our clinic with fever and rash at the end of February 2016. He had visited Habana and Santiago de Cuba in Cuba, via Toronto in Canada, for sightseeing and stayed for 11 days starting mid-February 2016. He complained of 1-day history of high-grade fever (39.8 C [103 F]), retro-orbital pain, malaise, congested bulbar conjunctivas, and rash on his anterior chest from the return date. He had also had mild arthralgia on his knee and ankle joints for a few days at presentation.\n\nOn examination, body temperature was 38.7 C [101 F], and he had congested bulbar conjunctivas, cervical lymphadenopathy, and maculopapular rash on his face, trunk, and extremities at presentation. CHIKV RNA was detected in serum samples using real-time RT-PCR performed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan. He was diagnosed with CHIK fever.\n\nAt the next day of the 1st visit to our clinic, rash on his extremities was getting worse and slightly itchy, and pain in the wrists and metacapophalangeal joints of hand followed by cervical pain and slight rigidity on distal and proximal interphalangeal joints of hand newly appeared, although congested bulbar conjunctivas and rash on his trunk was getting better. Shortly after that, all the symptoms were resolved.\n\nThe 1st autochthonous Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Cuba was also reported in March 2016. CHIK fever, as well as dengue fever and ZIKV infection, should be considered as a differential diagnosis of febrile travellers with rash returning from Cuba.\n\n[This report was provided by Motoyuki Tsuboi, Satoshi Kutsuna , Yasuyuki Kato, Yuichi Katanami, Kei Yamamoto, Nozomi Takeshita, Kayoko Hayakaw, Shuzo Kanagawa, Norio Ohmagari, Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Japan.

Perhaps the outbreak is declining in the Americas, or the focus on Zika virus infections has overshadowed case reporting. There is the risk that febrile cases diagnosed clinically as Zika or dengue virus infections are in some cases really chikungunya virus infections, since symptoms caused by these infections are similar. Laboratory confirmation is needed to be sure of the diagnosis. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (07): Americas 20160320.4106646\nChikungunya (06): Americas 20160302.4062712\nChikungunya (05): Americas 20160223.4044850\nChikungunya (04): Americas 20160217.4027484\nChikungunya (03) - Americas, Asia 20160206.3998786\nChikungunya (02): Americas 20160126.3968082\nChikungunya (01): Americas, Asia 20160108.3920697\n2015\n----\nChikungunya (38): Americas 20151231.3902281\nChikungunya (37): Americas, Asia 20151220.3877539\nChikungunya (36): Americas 20151209.3851811\nChikungunya (35): Americas 20151202.3835246\nChikungunya (34): Americas, Asia 20151124.3816889\nChikungunya (33): Americas, Asia 20151118.3799623\nChikungunya (32): Americas, Asia 20151109.3778428\nChikungunya (31): Americas, Africa 20151026.3745528\nChikungunya (30): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20151012.3710882\nChikungunya (29): Americas, Asia 20151005.3693195\nChikungunya (28): Americas, Asia, Africa 20150926.3671932\n.................................................sb/sh/ty/msp/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["chikungunya", "dengue", "zika"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-02-26 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "1935-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2038-03-15 00:00:00", "2037-03-15 00:00:00", "2036-03-15 00:00:00", "2035-03-15 00:00:00", "2034-03-15 00:00:00", "2033-03-15 00:00:00", "2032-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-31 00:00:00", "2021-03-30 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "2021-03-28 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Mexico", "country": "Mexico"}, {"location": "Yuichi Katanami", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ecuador", "country": "Ecuador"}, {"location": "El Salvador /", "country": "El Salvador"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "Belgium", "country": "Belgium"}, {"location": "Venezuela", "country": "Venezuela"}, {"location": "Colombia", "country": "Colombia"}, {"location": "Brussels", "country": "Belgium"}, {"location": "Cuba", "country": "Cuba"}, {"location": "Chikungunya", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "Japan"}, {"location": "Toronto", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4539231", "headline": "PRO> Zika & chikungunya viruses: comparative transmission", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4539231", "date": "2016-03-30 20:50:54", "main_text": "CHIKUNGUNYA (08): AMERICAS, ASIA\n********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\nCases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n---\nAmericas\n---\nRegional summary\nWHO/PAHO report\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case numbers.\n\nCentral America\n---\nPanama\n\nSouth America\n---\nColombia\n\nAsia\n---\nJapan ex Cuba\n\n******\nCases in various countries:\nRegional summaries\n---\nAmericas\n---\nWHO/PAHO report\n18 Mar 2016\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=rdmore&cid=8379&Itemid=40931&lang=en\nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory - 2016 to EW 11 [week ending 18 Mar 2016].

We describe a case of a chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-infected patient returning from Cuba, where no autochthonous transmission case has been reported, and the number of tourists has been increasing after the normalization between Cuba and the United States.\n\nA previously healthy 27-year-old Japanese man presented to our clinic with fever and rash at the end of February 2016. He had visited Habana and Santiago de Cuba in Cuba, via Toronto in Canada, for sightseeing and stayed for 11 days starting mid-February 2016. He complained of 1-day history of high-grade fever (39.8 C [103 F]), retro-orbital pain, malaise, congested bulbar conjunctivas, and rash on his anterior chest from the return date. He had also had mild arthralgia on his knee and ankle joints for a few days at presentation.\n\nOn examination, body temperature was 38.7 C [101 F], and he had congested bulbar conjunctivas, cervical lymphadenopathy, and maculopapular rash on his face, trunk, and extremities at presentation. CHIKV RNA was detected in serum samples using real-time RT-PCR performed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan. He was diagnosed with CHIK fever.\n\nAt the next day of the 1st visit to our clinic, rash on his extremities was getting worse and slightly itchy, and pain in the wrists and metacapophalangeal joints of hand followed by cervical pain and slight rigidity on distal and proximal interphalangeal joints of hand newly appeared, although congested bulbar conjunctivas and rash on his trunk was getting better. Shortly after that, all the symptoms were resolved.\n\nThe 1st autochthonous Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Cuba was also reported in March 2016. CHIK fever, as well as dengue fever and ZIKV infection, should be considered as a differential diagnosis of febrile travellers with rash returning from Cuba.\n\n[This report was provided by Motoyuki Tsuboi, Satoshi Kutsuna , Yasuyuki Kato, Yuichi Katanami, Kei Yamamoto, Nozomi Takeshita, Kayoko Hayakaw, Shuzo Kanagawa, Norio Ohmagari, Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Japan.

We describe a case of a chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-infected patient returning from Cuba, where no autochthonous transmission case has been reported, and the number of tourists has been increasing after the normalization between Cuba and the United States.\n\nA previously healthy 27-year-old Japanese man presented to our clinic with fever and rash at the end of February 2016. He had visited Habana and Santiago de Cuba in Cuba, via Toronto in Canada, for sightseeing and stayed for 11 days starting mid-February 2016. He complained of 1-day history of high-grade fever (39.8 C [103 F]), retro-orbital pain, malaise, congested bulbar conjunctivas, and rash on his anterior chest from the return date. He had also had mild arthralgia on his knee and ankle joints for a few days at presentation.\n\nOn examination, body temperature was 38.7 C [101 F], and he had congested bulbar conjunctivas, cervical lymphadenopathy, and maculopapular rash on his face, trunk, and extremities at presentation. CHIKV RNA was detected in serum samples using real-time RT-PCR performed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan. He was diagnosed with CHIK fever.\n\nAt the next day of the 1st visit to our clinic, rash on his extremities was getting worse and slightly itchy, and pain in the wrists and metacapophalangeal joints of hand followed by cervical pain and slight rigidity on distal and proximal interphalangeal joints of hand newly appeared, although congested bulbar conjunctivas and rash on his trunk was getting better. Shortly after that, all the symptoms were resolved.\n\nThe 1st autochthonous Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Cuba was also reported in March 2016. CHIK fever, as well as dengue fever and ZIKV infection, should be considered as a differential diagnosis of febrile travellers with rash returning from Cuba.\n\n[This report was provided by Motoyuki Tsuboi, Satoshi Kutsuna , Yasuyuki Kato, Yuichi Katanami, Kei Yamamoto, Nozomi Takeshita, Kayoko Hayakaw, Shuzo Kanagawa, Norio Ohmagari, Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Japan.

We describe a case of a chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-infected patient returning from Cuba, where no autochthonous transmission case has been reported, and the number of tourists has been increasing after the normalization between Cuba and the United States.\n\nA previously healthy 27-year-old Japanese man presented to our clinic with fever and rash at the end of February 2016. He had visited Habana and Santiago de Cuba in Cuba, via Toronto in Canada, for sightseeing and stayed for 11 days starting mid-February 2016. He complained of 1-day history of high-grade fever (39.8 C [103 F]), retro-orbital pain, malaise, congested bulbar conjunctivas, and rash on his anterior chest from the return date. He had also had mild arthralgia on his knee and ankle joints for a few days at presentation.\n\nOn examination, body temperature was 38.7 C [101 F], and he had congested bulbar conjunctivas, cervical lymphadenopathy, and maculopapular rash on his face, trunk, and extremities at presentation. CHIKV RNA was detected in serum samples using real-time RT-PCR performed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan. He was diagnosed with CHIK fever.\n\nAt the next day of the 1st visit to our clinic, rash on his extremities was getting worse and slightly itchy, and pain in the wrists and metacapophalangeal joints of hand followed by cervical pain and slight rigidity on distal and proximal interphalangeal joints of hand newly appeared, although congested bulbar conjunctivas and rash on his trunk was getting better. Shortly after that, all the symptoms were resolved.\n\nThe 1st autochthonous Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Cuba was also reported in March 2016. CHIK fever, as well as dengue fever and ZIKV infection, should be considered as a differential diagnosis of febrile travellers with rash returning from Cuba.\n\n[This report was provided by Motoyuki Tsuboi, Satoshi Kutsuna , Yasuyuki Kato, Yuichi Katanami, Kei Yamamoto, Nozomi Takeshita, Kayoko Hayakaw, Shuzo Kanagawa, Norio Ohmagari, Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Japan.

Infectious chikungunya virus in the saliva of mice, monkeys and humans. PLoS ONE 10(10): e0139481. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139481\n\nAbstract\nChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging, ordinarily mosquito-transmitted, alphavirus that occasionally produces hemorrhagic manifestations, such as nose bleed and bleeding gums, in human patients. Interferon response factor 3 and 7 deficient (IRF3/7-/-) mice, which are deficient for interferon alpha/Beta responses, reliably develop hemorrhagic manifestations after CHIKV infection. Here we show that infectious virus was present in the oral cavity of CHIKV infected IRF3/7-/- mice, likely due to hemorrhagic lesions in the olfactory epithelium that allow egress of infected blood into the nasal, and subsequently, oral cavities. In addition, IRF3/7-/- mice were more susceptible to infection with CHIKV via intranasal and oral routes, with IRF3/7-/- mice also able to transmit virus mouse-to-mouse without an arthropod vector. Cynomolgus macaques often show bleeding gums after CHIKV infection, and analysis of saliva from several infected monkeys also revealed the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Furthermore, saliva samples collected from several acute CHIKV patients with hemorrhagic manifestations were found to contain viral RNA and infectious virus. Oral fluids can, therefore, be infectious during acute CHIKV infections, likely due to hemorrhagic manifestations in the oral/nasal cavities.\n\nBackground (summarized)\nAlthough the primary disease manifestations of CHIKV infections in humans are acute fever and rash and acute and chronic polyarthralgia/polyarthritis, hemorrhagic manifestations are occasionally seen (in around 2-4 percent of patients) in both infected children and adults. Clinical signs of hemorrhage in CHIKV patients include purpura (bruising), hematemesis (vomiting blood), melena (pathognomonic of upper gastrointestinal bleeding), epistaxis (nose bleed), petechiae (small red or purple spots on the skin), hematuria (blood in urine), and gingivorrhagia (bleeding gums). The latter was reported in around one percent of adults; however, in CHIKV-infected dental patients, an Indian study showed the incidence can be much higher (over 50 per cent).\n\nDiscussion (summarized)\nTo our knowledge, this study represents the 1st report showing that oral fluids/saliva from CHIKV infected animals and humans can contain infectious CHIKV. The presence of infectious virus in oral fluids of IRF3/7-/- mice was associated with high viraemia and overt hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal cavities. In cynomolgus monkeys, CHIKV was isolated from saliva on or near the peak viraemia, with gingival bleeding noted previously in 50 percent of infected animals. The presence of infectious CHIKV in the saliva of several acute human patients with hemorrhagic manifestations provides further support for the contention that CHIKV in saliva is associated with hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal/oral cavities during the viraemic period. The safety implications of infectious saliva are perhaps most relevant for dentistry. Bites from CHIKV infected individuals with hemorrhagic manifestations might also be considered potentially infectious; however, for mice, this appears to be restricted to mice deficient in IFNalpha/Beta responses [6], with saliva from wild-type mice testing negative.\n\nOne might, nevertheless, speculate that individuals with a diminished capacity to mount IFNalpha/Beta responses might be at increased risk of infection via mucosal surfaces. Such individuals include the elderly, neonates, HIV patients, asthmatics and perhaps diabetics.\n\nAlthough the studies herein are hardly exhaustive, the lack of mouse-to-mouse transmission via aerosol is perhaps not surprising. Aerosol transmission of CHIKV has not been formally reported in the publically available literature. Suspected aerosol infections have been reported for CHIKV in humans; however, the circumstances were not described.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The epidemiological significance of CHIK virus in saliva or nasal secretions is not clear. The hundreds of instances of imported cases of CHIK virus into countries where vector mosquitoes are not present have not resulted in documented instances of ongoing transmission in the absence of those vectors (excluding transfusion of blood products). Risk of aerosol transmission apparently is low. This moderator knows firsthand of an example of a case of apparent aerosol transmission in a research laboratory 50 years ago, before negative pressure laminar flow hoods became available. -

Infectious chikungunya virus in the saliva of mice, monkeys and humans. PLoS ONE 10(10): e0139481. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139481\n\nAbstract\nChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging, ordinarily mosquito-transmitted, alphavirus that occasionally produces hemorrhagic manifestations, such as nose bleed and bleeding gums, in human patients. Interferon response factor 3 and 7 deficient (IRF3/7-/-) mice, which are deficient for interferon alpha/Beta responses, reliably develop hemorrhagic manifestations after CHIKV infection. Here we show that infectious virus was present in the oral cavity of CHIKV infected IRF3/7-/- mice, likely due to hemorrhagic lesions in the olfactory epithelium that allow egress of infected blood into the nasal, and subsequently, oral cavities. In addition, IRF3/7-/- mice were more susceptible to infection with CHIKV via intranasal and oral routes, with IRF3/7-/- mice also able to transmit virus mouse-to-mouse without an arthropod vector. Cynomolgus macaques often show bleeding gums after CHIKV infection, and analysis of saliva from several infected monkeys also revealed the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Furthermore, saliva samples collected from several acute CHIKV patients with hemorrhagic manifestations were found to contain viral RNA and infectious virus. Oral fluids can, therefore, be infectious during acute CHIKV infections, likely due to hemorrhagic manifestations in the oral/nasal cavities.\n\nBackground (summarized)\nAlthough the primary disease manifestations of CHIKV infections in humans are acute fever and rash and acute and chronic polyarthralgia/polyarthritis, hemorrhagic manifestations are occasionally seen (in around 2-4 percent of patients) in both infected children and adults. Clinical signs of hemorrhage in CHIKV patients include purpura (bruising), hematemesis (vomiting blood), melena (pathognomonic of upper gastrointestinal bleeding), epistaxis (nose bleed), petechiae (small red or purple spots on the skin), hematuria (blood in urine), and gingivorrhagia (bleeding gums). The latter was reported in around one percent of adults; however, in CHIKV-infected dental patients, an Indian study showed the incidence can be much higher (over 50 per cent).\n\nDiscussion (summarized)\nTo our knowledge, this study represents the 1st report showing that oral fluids/saliva from CHIKV infected animals and humans can contain infectious CHIKV. The presence of infectious virus in oral fluids of IRF3/7-/- mice was associated with high viraemia and overt hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal cavities. In cynomolgus monkeys, CHIKV was isolated from saliva on or near the peak viraemia, with gingival bleeding noted previously in 50 percent of infected animals. The presence of infectious CHIKV in the saliva of several acute human patients with hemorrhagic manifestations provides further support for the contention that CHIKV in saliva is associated with hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal/oral cavities during the viraemic period. The safety implications of infectious saliva are perhaps most relevant for dentistry. Bites from CHIKV infected individuals with hemorrhagic manifestations might also be considered potentially infectious; however, for mice, this appears to be restricted to mice deficient in IFNalpha/Beta responses [6], with saliva from wild-type mice testing negative.\n\nOne might, nevertheless, speculate that individuals with a diminished capacity to mount IFNalpha/Beta responses might be at increased risk of infection via mucosal surfaces. Such individuals include the elderly, neonates, HIV patients, asthmatics and perhaps diabetics.\n\nAlthough the studies herein are hardly exhaustive, the lack of mouse-to-mouse transmission via aerosol is perhaps not surprising. Aerosol transmission of CHIKV has not been formally reported in the publically available literature. Suspected aerosol infections have been reported for CHIKV in humans; however, the circumstances were not described.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The epidemiological significance of CHIK virus in saliva or nasal secretions is not clear. The hundreds of instances of imported cases of CHIK virus into countries where vector mosquitoes are not present have not resulted in documented instances of ongoing transmission in the absence of those vectors (excluding transfusion of blood products). Risk of aerosol transmission apparently is low. This moderator knows firsthand of an example of a case of apparent aerosol transmission in a research laboratory 50 years ago, before negative pressure laminar flow hoods became available. -

Infectious chikungunya virus in the saliva of mice, monkeys and humans. PLoS ONE 10(10): e0139481. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139481\n\nAbstract\nChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging, ordinarily mosquito-transmitted, alphavirus that occasionally produces hemorrhagic manifestations, such as nose bleed and bleeding gums, in human patients. Interferon response factor 3 and 7 deficient (IRF3/7-/-) mice, which are deficient for interferon alpha/Beta responses, reliably develop hemorrhagic manifestations after CHIKV infection. Here we show that infectious virus was present in the oral cavity of CHIKV infected IRF3/7-/- mice, likely due to hemorrhagic lesions in the olfactory epithelium that allow egress of infected blood into the nasal, and subsequently, oral cavities. In addition, IRF3/7-/- mice were more susceptible to infection with CHIKV via intranasal and oral routes, with IRF3/7-/- mice also able to transmit virus mouse-to-mouse without an arthropod vector. Cynomolgus macaques often show bleeding gums after CHIKV infection, and analysis of saliva from several infected monkeys also revealed the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Furthermore, saliva samples collected from several acute CHIKV patients with hemorrhagic manifestations were found to contain viral RNA and infectious virus. Oral fluids can, therefore, be infectious during acute CHIKV infections, likely due to hemorrhagic manifestations in the oral/nasal cavities.\n\nBackground (summarized)\nAlthough the primary disease manifestations of CHIKV infections in humans are acute fever and rash and acute and chronic polyarthralgia/polyarthritis, hemorrhagic manifestations are occasionally seen (in around 2-4 percent of patients) in both infected children and adults. Clinical signs of hemorrhage in CHIKV patients include purpura (bruising), hematemesis (vomiting blood), melena (pathognomonic of upper gastrointestinal bleeding), epistaxis (nose bleed), petechiae (small red or purple spots on the skin), hematuria (blood in urine), and gingivorrhagia (bleeding gums). The latter was reported in around one percent of adults; however, in CHIKV-infected dental patients, an Indian study showed the incidence can be much higher (over 50 per cent).\n\nDiscussion (summarized)\nTo our knowledge, this study represents the 1st report showing that oral fluids/saliva from CHIKV infected animals and humans can contain infectious CHIKV. The presence of infectious virus in oral fluids of IRF3/7-/- mice was associated with high viraemia and overt hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal cavities. In cynomolgus monkeys, CHIKV was isolated from saliva on or near the peak viraemia, with gingival bleeding noted previously in 50 percent of infected animals. The presence of infectious CHIKV in the saliva of several acute human patients with hemorrhagic manifestations provides further support for the contention that CHIKV in saliva is associated with hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal/oral cavities during the viraemic period. The safety implications of infectious saliva are perhaps most relevant for dentistry. Bites from CHIKV infected individuals with hemorrhagic manifestations might also be considered potentially infectious; however, for mice, this appears to be restricted to mice deficient in IFNalpha/Beta responses [6], with saliva from wild-type mice testing negative.\n\nOne might, nevertheless, speculate that individuals with a diminished capacity to mount IFNalpha/Beta responses might be at increased risk of infection via mucosal surfaces. Such individuals include the elderly, neonates, HIV patients, asthmatics and perhaps diabetics.\n\nAlthough the studies herein are hardly exhaustive, the lack of mouse-to-mouse transmission via aerosol is perhaps not surprising. Aerosol transmission of CHIKV has not been formally reported in the publically available literature. Suspected aerosol infections have been reported for CHIKV in humans; however, the circumstances were not described.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The epidemiological significance of CHIK virus in saliva or nasal secretions is not clear. The hundreds of instances of imported cases of CHIK virus into countries where vector mosquitoes are not present have not resulted in documented instances of ongoing transmission in the absence of those vectors (excluding transfusion of blood products). Risk of aerosol transmission apparently is low. This moderator knows firsthand of an example of a case of apparent aerosol transmission in a research laboratory 50 years ago, before negative pressure laminar flow hoods became available. -

The latter was reported in around one percent of adults; however, in CHIKV-infected dental patients, an Indian study showed the incidence can be much higher (over 50 per cent).\n\nDiscussion (summarized)\nTo our knowledge, this study represents the 1st report showing that oral fluids/saliva from CHIKV infected animals and humans can contain infectious CHIKV. The presence of infectious virus in oral fluids of IRF3/7-/- mice was associated with high viraemia and overt hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal cavities. In cynomolgus monkeys, CHIKV was isolated from saliva on or near the peak viraemia, with gingival bleeding noted previously in 50 percent of infected animals. The presence of infectious CHIKV in the saliva of several acute human patients with hemorrhagic manifestations provides further support for the contention that CHIKV in saliva is associated with hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal/oral cavities during the viraemic period. The safety implications of infectious saliva are perhaps most relevant for dentistry. Bites from CHIKV infected individuals with hemorrhagic manifestations might also be considered potentially infectious; however, for mice, this appears to be restricted to mice deficient in IFNalpha/Beta responses [6], with saliva from wild-type mice testing negative.\n\nOne might, nevertheless, speculate that individuals with a diminished capacity to mount IFNalpha/Beta responses might be at increased risk of infection via mucosal surfaces. Such individuals include the elderly, neonates, HIV patients, asthmatics and perhaps diabetics.\n\nAlthough the studies herein are hardly exhaustive, the lack of mouse-to-mouse transmission via aerosol is perhaps not surprising. Aerosol transmission of CHIKV has not been formally reported in the publically available literature. Suspected aerosol infections have been reported for CHIKV in humans; however, the circumstances were not described.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The epidemiological significance of CHIK virus in saliva or nasal secretions is not clear.

Infectious chikungunya virus in the saliva of mice, monkeys and humans. PLoS ONE 10(10): e0139481. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139481\n\nAbstract\nChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging, ordinarily mosquito-transmitted, alphavirus that occasionally produces hemorrhagic manifestations, such as nose bleed and bleeding gums, in human patients. Interferon response factor 3 and 7 deficient (IRF3/7-/-) mice, which are deficient for interferon alpha/Beta responses, reliably develop hemorrhagic manifestations after CHIKV infection. Here we show that infectious virus was present in the oral cavity of CHIKV infected IRF3/7-/- mice, likely due to hemorrhagic lesions in the olfactory epithelium that allow egress of infected blood into the nasal, and subsequently, oral cavities. In addition, IRF3/7-/- mice were more susceptible to infection with CHIKV via intranasal and oral routes, with IRF3/7-/- mice also able to transmit virus mouse-to-mouse without an arthropod vector. Cynomolgus macaques often show bleeding gums after CHIKV infection, and analysis of saliva from several infected monkeys also revealed the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Furthermore, saliva samples collected from several acute CHIKV patients with hemorrhagic manifestations were found to contain viral RNA and infectious virus. Oral fluids can, therefore, be infectious during acute CHIKV infections, likely due to hemorrhagic manifestations in the oral/nasal cavities.\n\nBackground (summarized)\nAlthough the primary disease manifestations of CHIKV infections in humans are acute fever and rash and acute and chronic polyarthralgia/polyarthritis, hemorrhagic manifestations are occasionally seen (in around 2-4 percent of patients) in both infected children and adults. Clinical signs of hemorrhage in CHIKV patients include purpura (bruising), hematemesis (vomiting blood), melena (pathognomonic of upper gastrointestinal bleeding), epistaxis (nose bleed), petechiae (small red or purple spots on the skin), hematuria (blood in urine), and gingivorrhagia (bleeding gums). The latter was reported in around one percent of adults; however, in CHIKV-infected dental patients, an Indian study showed the incidence can be much higher (over 50 per cent).\n\nDiscussion (summarized)\nTo our knowledge, this study represents the 1st report showing that oral fluids/saliva from CHIKV infected animals and humans can contain infectious CHIKV. The presence of infectious virus in oral fluids of IRF3/7-/- mice was associated with high viraemia and overt hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal cavities. In cynomolgus monkeys, CHIKV was isolated from saliva on or near the peak viraemia, with gingival bleeding noted previously in 50 percent of infected animals. The presence of infectious CHIKV in the saliva of several acute human patients with hemorrhagic manifestations provides further support for the contention that CHIKV in saliva is associated with hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal/oral cavities during the viraemic period.

Infectious chikungunya virus in the saliva of mice, monkeys and humans. PLoS ONE 10(10): e0139481. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139481\n\nAbstract\nChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging, ordinarily mosquito-transmitted, alphavirus that occasionally produces hemorrhagic manifestations, such as nose bleed and bleeding gums, in human patients. Interferon response factor 3 and 7 deficient (IRF3/7-/-) mice, which are deficient for interferon alpha/Beta responses, reliably develop hemorrhagic manifestations after CHIKV infection. Here we show that infectious virus was present in the oral cavity of CHIKV infected IRF3/7-/- mice, likely due to hemorrhagic lesions in the olfactory epithelium that allow egress of infected blood into the nasal, and subsequently, oral cavities. In addition, IRF3/7-/- mice were more susceptible to infection with CHIKV via intranasal and oral routes, with IRF3/7-/- mice also able to transmit virus mouse-to-mouse without an arthropod vector. Cynomolgus macaques often show bleeding gums after CHIKV infection, and analysis of saliva from several infected monkeys also revealed the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Furthermore, saliva samples collected from several acute CHIKV patients with hemorrhagic manifestations were found to contain viral RNA and infectious virus. Oral fluids can, therefore, be infectious during acute CHIKV infections, likely due to hemorrhagic manifestations in the oral/nasal cavities.\n\nBackground (summarized)\nAlthough the primary disease manifestations of CHIKV infections in humans are acute fever and rash and acute and chronic polyarthralgia/polyarthritis, hemorrhagic manifestations are occasionally seen (in around 2-4 percent of patients) in both infected children and adults. Clinical signs of hemorrhage in CHIKV patients include purpura (bruising), hematemesis (vomiting blood), melena (pathognomonic of upper gastrointestinal bleeding), epistaxis (nose bleed), petechiae (small red or purple spots on the skin), hematuria (blood in urine), and gingivorrhagia (bleeding gums). The latter was reported in around one percent of adults; however, in CHIKV-infected dental patients, an Indian study showed the incidence can be much higher (over 50 per cent).\n\nDiscussion (summarized)\nTo our knowledge, this study represents the 1st report showing that oral fluids/saliva from CHIKV infected animals and humans can contain infectious CHIKV. The presence of infectious virus in oral fluids of IRF3/7-/- mice was associated with high viraemia and overt hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal cavities. In cynomolgus monkeys, CHIKV was isolated from saliva on or near the peak viraemia, with gingival bleeding noted previously in 50 percent of infected animals. The presence of infectious CHIKV in the saliva of several acute human patients with hemorrhagic manifestations provides further support for the contention that CHIKV in saliva is associated with hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal/oral cavities during the viraemic period. The safety implications of infectious saliva are perhaps most relevant for dentistry. Bites from CHIKV infected individuals with hemorrhagic manifestations might also be considered potentially infectious; however, for mice, this appears to be restricted to mice deficient in IFNalpha/Beta responses [6], with saliva from wild-type mice testing negative.\n\nOne might, nevertheless, speculate that individuals with a diminished capacity to mount IFNalpha/Beta responses might be at increased risk of infection via mucosal surfaces. Such individuals include the elderly, neonates, HIV patients, asthmatics and perhaps diabetics.\n\nAlthough the studies herein are hardly exhaustive, the lack of mouse-to-mouse transmission via aerosol is perhaps not surprising. Aerosol transmission of CHIKV has not been formally reported in the publically available literature. Suspected aerosol infections have been reported for CHIKV in humans; however, the circumstances were not described.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The epidemiological significance of CHIK virus in saliva or nasal secretions is not clear. The hundreds of instances of imported cases of CHIK virus into countries where vector mosquitoes are not present have not resulted in documented instances of ongoing transmission in the absence of those vectors (excluding transfusion of blood products). Risk of aerosol transmission apparently is low. This moderator knows firsthand of an example of a case of apparent aerosol transmission in a research laboratory 50 years ago, before negative pressure laminar flow hoods became available. -

Infectious chikungunya virus in the saliva of mice, monkeys and humans. PLoS ONE 10(10): e0139481. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139481\n\nAbstract\nChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging, ordinarily mosquito-transmitted, alphavirus that occasionally produces hemorrhagic manifestations, such as nose bleed and bleeding gums, in human patients. Interferon response factor 3 and 7 deficient (IRF3/7-/-) mice, which are deficient for interferon alpha/Beta responses, reliably develop hemorrhagic manifestations after CHIKV infection. Here we show that infectious virus was present in the oral cavity of CHIKV infected IRF3/7-/- mice, likely due to hemorrhagic lesions in the olfactory epithelium that allow egress of infected blood into the nasal, and subsequently, oral cavities. In addition, IRF3/7-/- mice were more susceptible to infection with CHIKV via intranasal and oral routes, with IRF3/7-/- mice also able to transmit virus mouse-to-mouse without an arthropod vector. Cynomolgus macaques often show bleeding gums after CHIKV infection, and analysis of saliva from several infected monkeys also revealed the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Furthermore, saliva samples collected from several acute CHIKV patients with hemorrhagic manifestations were found to contain viral RNA and infectious virus. Oral fluids can, therefore, be infectious during acute CHIKV infections, likely due to hemorrhagic manifestations in the oral/nasal cavities.\n\nBackground (summarized)\nAlthough the primary disease manifestations of CHIKV infections in humans are acute fever and rash and acute and chronic polyarthralgia/polyarthritis, hemorrhagic manifestations are occasionally seen (in around 2-4 percent of patients) in both infected children and adults. Clinical signs of hemorrhage in CHIKV patients include purpura (bruising), hematemesis (vomiting blood), melena (pathognomonic of upper gastrointestinal bleeding), epistaxis (nose bleed), petechiae (small red or purple spots on the skin), hematuria (blood in urine), and gingivorrhagia (bleeding gums). The latter was reported in around one percent of adults; however, in CHIKV-infected dental patients, an Indian study showed the incidence can be much higher (over 50 per cent).\n\nDiscussion (summarized)\nTo our knowledge, this study represents the 1st report showing that oral fluids/saliva from CHIKV infected animals and humans can contain infectious CHIKV. The presence of infectious virus in oral fluids of IRF3/7-/- mice was associated with high viraemia and overt hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal cavities. In cynomolgus monkeys, CHIKV was isolated from saliva on or near the peak viraemia, with gingival bleeding noted previously in 50 percent of infected animals. The presence of infectious CHIKV in the saliva of several acute human patients with hemorrhagic manifestations provides further support for the contention that CHIKV in saliva is associated with hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal/oral cavities during the viraemic period. The safety implications of infectious saliva are perhaps most relevant for dentistry. Bites from CHIKV infected individuals with hemorrhagic manifestations might also be considered potentially infectious; however, for mice, this appears to be restricted to mice deficient in IFNalpha/Beta responses [6], with saliva from wild-type mice testing negative.\n\nOne might, nevertheless, speculate that individuals with a diminished capacity to mount IFNalpha/Beta responses might be at increased risk of infection via mucosal surfaces. Such individuals include the elderly, neonates, HIV patients, asthmatics and perhaps diabetics.\n\nAlthough the studies herein are hardly exhaustive, the lack of mouse-to-mouse transmission via aerosol is perhaps not surprising. Aerosol transmission of CHIKV has not been formally reported in the publically available literature. Suspected aerosol infections have been reported for CHIKV in humans; however, the circumstances were not described.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The epidemiological significance of CHIK virus in saliva or nasal secretions is not clear. The hundreds of instances of imported cases of CHIK virus into countries where vector mosquitoes are not present have not resulted in documented instances of ongoing transmission in the absence of those vectors (excluding transfusion of blood products). Risk of aerosol transmission apparently is low. This moderator knows firsthand of an example of a case of apparent aerosol transmission in a research laboratory 50 years ago, before negative pressure laminar flow hoods became available. -

Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21(4)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nAfter an absence of about 200 years, chikungunya returned to the American tropics in 2013. The virus is maintained in a complex African zoonotic cycle but escapes into an urban cycle at 40- to 50-year intervals, causing global pandemics. In 1823, classical chikungunya, a viral exanthem in humans, occurred on Zanzibar, and in 1827, it arrived in the Caribbean and spread to North and South America. In Zanzibar, the disease was known as kidenga pepo, Swahili for a sudden cramp-like seizure caused by an evil spirit; in Cuba, it was known as dengue, a Spanish homonym of denga. During the eighteenth century, dengue (present-day chikungunya) was distinguished from breakbone fever (present-day dengue), another febrile exanthem. In the 20th century, experiments resulted in the recovery and naming of present-day dengue viruses. In 1952, chikungunya virus was recovered during an outbreak in Tanzania, but by then, the virus had lost its original name to present-day dengue viruses.\n\n[This is a fascinating history of chikungunya with its previous appearance in the Americas, and the confusion due to its relationship clinically, to dengue fever. Given the widespread and continuing outbreak of chikungunya in the Americas, this report will be of interest to many ProMED-mail subscribers. - Mod.TY]\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n13 Feb 2015\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=343&Itemid=40931\n\n\nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory with autochthonous transmission -- 2013-2015 to EW 09 (cumulative, updated 6 Mar 2015, reports earlier than week 06 of 2015 are not reported but are available in earlier reports)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCases by Country / Week / Local Susp. / Local Conf./ Imported Conf. / Deaths\nNorth America:\nMexico / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 355 / 20 / 0\nUSA /week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 11 / 2524 / 0\n\nCentral America\nCosta Rica / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 233 / 89 / 0\nEl Salvador / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 143 346 / 157 / 0 / 0\nHonduras / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 6894 / 9 / 5 / 0\n\nLatin Caribbean\n---\nFrench Guiana / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 12 957 / 6191 / 0 / 1\nPuerto Rico / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 26 811 / 4323 / 31 / 15\nSt Berthelemy / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 1690 / 142 / 0 / 0\nSt Martin / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 5280 / 793 / 0 / 3\n\nNon-Latin Caribbean\nAnguilla / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 67 / 52 / 2 / 0\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1428 / 18 / 0 / 0\nBahamas / week 07 [week ending 20 fib 2014/ / 0 / 99 / 6 / 0\nCayman Islands / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 223 / 44 / 3 / 0\nJamaica / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1667 / 87 / 2 / 0\nMontserrat / week 04 [week ending 30 Jan 2015] / 117 / 14 / 0 / 0\nTrinidad and Tobago / week 03 [week ending 23 Jan 2015] / 0 / 303 / 3 / 0\n\nAndean Area\nBolivia / week 09 / week ending 16 Mar 2015] / 0 / 74 / 5 / 0\nColombia / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 183 718 / 1317 / 26 / 3\nEcuador / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 213 / 26 / 0\nPeru / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 34 / 0\n\nSouthern Cone\nArgentina / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 53 / 0\nBrazil / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 3867 / 149 / 100 / 0\nParaguay / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 129 / 130 / 7 / 0\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries mentioned above and below can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/images/maps/CHIK_Caribbean_Map-060214.jpg\nand http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455; and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCases in CARPHA (Caribbean Public Health Agency) member states with numbers from week 06-09 [ending 9 Mar 2015] but different from those in the PAHO report above.\nhttp://carpha.org/What-We-Do/Public-Health-Activities/Chikungunya\nWeek / Confirmed / Suspected\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 18 / 1442\nBarbados / week 8 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 122 / 1897\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 175 / 1223\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case numbers\n\nCaribbean locally acquired\n---\nDominica (national). 26 Feb 2015.

The moderator TY commented on it: \"One case is anecdotal but interesting, but will be of limited value until a statistically valid clinical trial is carried out.\" We totally agree with him about this kind of experimentation. To date, there is no drug available to heal all chikungunya [virus]-infected patients. Many drugs (vitamin C, phytotherapy, allopathy) have been tested in few regular trials and many empirical field experiments, unsuccessfully.\n\nHowever, physicians must always do their best to provide relief for their patients without adverse effects. We want to stress that it is possible to help most patients with appropriate use of some well-known drugs and physiotherapy.\n\nTo avoid such uncontrolled experiments due to the lack of knowledge, the Direction Generale de la Sante of the French Ministry of Health asked the Societe de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Francaise (the French Infectious Diseases Society) to produce guidelines for the case management of chikungunya [virus]-infected patients (acute stage and persisting forms). We directed a group of about 20 French experts (infectiologists, rheumatologists, GPs, reeducators, from mainland France, Reunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana) who worked on the topic for months. After having analysed the literature and debated their clinical experience, we produced a consensus among experts that is available online (free access) in French at http://www.infectiologie.com/site/medias/Recos/2014-Chikungunya-recommandations.pdf. We have answered the most frequently asked questions from GPs and listed the adequate practices for acute, post-acute, and chronic stages; some inefficient and/or potentially deleterious treatments are also mentioned.\n\nWe think that promoting this information about these French guidelines (English version coming soon) by ProMED could bring significant help for the patients and their physicians.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDr Fabrice Simon, MD, PhD, and Dr Emilie Javelle, MD\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Laveran Military Teaching Hospital\nMarseille, France\n<simon-f@wanadoo.fr>\n\n[ProMED thanks Drs Simon and Javelle for this comment. The guidelines put together by this group of medical specialists will be very helpful. A version in English is awaited, and one hopes that in addition to French it will also become available in Spanish and Portuguese, because most of the cases in the Americas have occurred in the countries where those are the main languages spoken. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (05): Americas, Pacific 20150227.3195783\nChikungunya (04): Americas 20150210.3156702\nChikungunya (03): Americas

Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21(4)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nAfter an absence of about 200 years, chikungunya returned to the American tropics in 2013. The virus is maintained in a complex African zoonotic cycle but escapes into an urban cycle at 40- to 50-year intervals, causing global pandemics. In 1823, classical chikungunya, a viral exanthem in humans, occurred on Zanzibar, and in 1827, it arrived in the Caribbean and spread to North and South America. In Zanzibar, the disease was known as kidenga pepo, Swahili for a sudden cramp-like seizure caused by an evil spirit; in Cuba, it was known as dengue, a Spanish homonym of denga. During the eighteenth century, dengue (present-day chikungunya) was distinguished from breakbone fever (present-day dengue), another febrile exanthem. In the 20th century, experiments resulted in the recovery and naming of present-day dengue viruses. In 1952, chikungunya virus was recovered during an outbreak in Tanzania, but by then, the virus had lost its original name to present-day dengue viruses.\n\n[This is a fascinating history of chikungunya with its previous appearance in the Americas, and the confusion due to its relationship clinically, to dengue fever. Given the widespread and continuing outbreak of chikungunya in the Americas, this report will be of interest to many ProMED-mail subscribers. - Mod.TY]\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n13 Feb 2015\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=343&Itemid=40931\n\n\nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory with autochthonous transmission -- 2013-2015 to EW 09 (cumulative, updated 6 Mar 2015, reports earlier than week 06 of 2015 are not reported but are available in earlier reports)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCases by Country / Week / Local Susp. / Local Conf./ Imported Conf. / Deaths\nNorth America:\nMexico / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 355 / 20 / 0\nUSA /week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 11 / 2524 / 0\n\nCentral America\nCosta Rica / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 233 / 89 / 0\nEl Salvador / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 143 346 / 157 / 0 / 0\nHonduras / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 6894 / 9 / 5 / 0\n\nLatin Caribbean\n---\nFrench Guiana / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 12 957 / 6191 / 0 / 1\nPuerto Rico / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 26 811 / 4323 / 31 / 15\nSt Berthelemy / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 1690 / 142 / 0 / 0\nSt Martin / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 5280 / 793 / 0 / 3\n\nNon-Latin Caribbean\nAnguilla / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 67 / 52 / 2 / 0\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1428 / 18 / 0 / 0\nBahamas / week 07 [week ending 20 fib 2014/ / 0 / 99 / 6 / 0\nCayman Islands / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 223 / 44 / 3 / 0\nJamaica / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1667 / 87 / 2 / 0\nMontserrat / week 04 [week ending 30 Jan 2015] / 117 / 14 / 0 / 0\nTrinidad and Tobago / week 03 [week ending 23 Jan 2015] / 0 / 303 / 3 / 0\n\nAndean Area\nBolivia / week 09 / week ending 16 Mar 2015] / 0 / 74 / 5 / 0\nColombia / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 183 718 / 1317 / 26 / 3\nEcuador / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 213 / 26 / 0\nPeru / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 34 / 0\n\nSouthern Cone\nArgentina / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 53 / 0\nBrazil / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 3867 / 149 / 100 / 0\nParaguay / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 129 / 130 / 7 / 0\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries mentioned above and below can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/images/maps/CHIK_Caribbean_Map-060214.jpg\nand http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455; and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCases in CARPHA (Caribbean Public Health Agency) member states with numbers from week 06-09 [ending 9 Mar 2015] but different from those in the PAHO report above.\nhttp://carpha.org/What-We-Do/Public-Health-Activities/Chikungunya\nWeek / Confirmed / Suspected\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 18 / 1442\nBarbados / week 8 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 122 / 1897\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 175 / 1223\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case numbers\n\nCaribbean locally acquired\n---\nDominica (national). 26 Feb 2015.

The moderator TY commented on it: \"One case is anecdotal but interesting, but will be of limited value until a statistically valid clinical trial is carried out.\" We totally agree with him about this kind of experimentation. To date, there is no drug available to heal all chikungunya [virus]-infected patients. Many drugs (vitamin C, phytotherapy, allopathy) have been tested in few regular trials and many empirical field experiments, unsuccessfully.\n\nHowever, physicians must always do their best to provide relief for their patients without adverse effects. We want to stress that it is possible to help most patients with appropriate use of some well-known drugs and physiotherapy.\n\nTo avoid such uncontrolled experiments due to the lack of knowledge, the Direction Generale de la Sante of the French Ministry of Health asked the Societe de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Francaise (the French Infectious Diseases Society) to produce guidelines for the case management of chikungunya [virus]-infected patients (acute stage and persisting forms). We directed a group of about 20 French experts (infectiologists, rheumatologists, GPs, reeducators, from mainland France, Reunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana) who worked on the topic for months. After having analysed the literature and debated their clinical experience, we produced a consensus among experts that is available online (free access) in French at http://www.infectiologie.com/site/medias/Recos/2014-Chikungunya-recommandations.pdf. We have answered the most frequently asked questions from GPs and listed the adequate practices for acute, post-acute, and chronic stages; some inefficient and/or potentially deleterious treatments are also mentioned.\n\nWe think that promoting this information about these French guidelines (English version coming soon) by ProMED could bring significant help for the patients and their physicians.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDr Fabrice Simon, MD, PhD, and Dr Emilie Javelle, MD\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Laveran Military Teaching Hospital\nMarseille, France\n<simon-f@wanadoo.fr>\n\n[ProMED thanks Drs Simon and Javelle for this comment. The guidelines put together by this group of medical specialists will be very helpful. A version in English is awaited, and one hopes that in addition to French it will also become available in Spanish and Portuguese, because most of the cases in the Americas have occurred in the countries where those are the main languages spoken. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (05): Americas, Pacific 20150227.3195783\nChikungunya (04): Americas 20150210.3156702\nChikungunya (03): Americas

chikungunya, formerly called dengue, in the Americas. Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21(4)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nAfter an absence of about 200 years, chikungunya returned to the American tropics in 2013. The virus is maintained in a complex African zoonotic cycle but escapes into an urban cycle at 40- to 50-year intervals, causing global pandemics. In 1823, classical chikungunya, a viral exanthem in humans, occurred on Zanzibar, and in 1827, it arrived in the Caribbean and spread to North and South America. In Zanzibar, the disease was known as kidenga pepo, Swahili for a sudden cramp-like seizure caused by an evil spirit; in Cuba, it was known as dengue, a Spanish homonym of denga. During the eighteenth century, dengue (present-day chikungunya) was distinguished from breakbone fever (present-day dengue), another febrile exanthem. In the 20th century, experiments resulted in the recovery and naming of present-day dengue viruses. In 1952, chikungunya virus was recovered during an outbreak in Tanzania, but by then, the virus had lost its original name to present-day dengue viruses.\n\n[This is a fascinating history of chikungunya with its previous appearance in the Americas, and the confusion due to its relationship clinically, to dengue fever. Given the widespread and continuing outbreak of chikungunya in the Americas, this report will be of interest to many ProMED-mail subscribers. - Mod.TY]\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n13 Feb 2015\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=343&Itemid=40931\n\n\nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory with autochthonous transmission -- 2013-2015 to EW 09 (cumulative, updated 6 Mar 2015, reports earlier than week 06 of 2015 are not reported but are available in earlier reports)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCases by Country / Week / Local Susp. / Local Conf./ Imported Conf. / Deaths\nNorth America:\nMexico / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 355 / 20 / 0\nUSA /week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 11 / 2524 / 0\n\nCentral America\nCosta Rica / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 233 / 89 / 0\nEl Salvador / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 143 346 / 157 / 0 / 0\nHonduras / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 6894 / 9 / 5 / 0\n\nLatin Caribbean\n---\nFrench Guiana / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 12 957 / 6191 / 0 / 1\nPuerto Rico / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 26 811 / 4323 / 31 / 15\nSt Berthelemy / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 1690 / 142 / 0 / 0\nSt Martin / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 5280 / 793 / 0 / 3\n\nNon-Latin Caribbean\nAnguilla / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 67 / 52 / 2 / 0\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1428 / 18 / 0 / 0\nBahamas / week 07 [week ending 20 fib 2014/ / 0 / 99 / 6 / 0\nCayman Islands / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 223 / 44 / 3 / 0\nJamaica / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1667 / 87 / 2 / 0\nMontserrat / week 04 [week ending 30 Jan 2015] / 117 / 14 / 0 / 0\nTrinidad and Tobago / week 03 [week ending 23 Jan 2015] / 0 / 303 / 3 / 0\n\nAndean Area\nBolivia / week 09 / week ending 16 Mar 2015] / 0 / 74 / 5 / 0\nColombia / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 183 718 / 1317 / 26 / 3\nEcuador / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 213 / 26 / 0\nPeru / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 34 / 0\n\nSouthern Cone\nArgentina / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 53 / 0\nBrazil / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 3867 / 149 / 100 / 0\nParaguay / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 129 / 130 / 7 / 0\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries mentioned above and below can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/images/maps/CHIK_Caribbean_Map-060214.jpg\nand http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455; and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCases in CARPHA (Caribbean Public Health Agency) member states with numbers from week 06-09 [ending 9 Mar 2015] but different from those in the PAHO report above.\nhttp://carpha.org/What-We-Do/Public-Health-Activities/Chikungunya\nWeek / Confirmed / Suspected\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 18 / 1442\nBarbados / week 8 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 122 / 1897\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 175 / 1223\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case numbers\n\nCaribbean locally acquired\n---\nDominica (national). 26 Feb 2015.

The moderator TY commented on it: \"One case is anecdotal but interesting, but will be of limited value until a statistically valid clinical trial is carried out.\" We totally agree with him about this kind of experimentation. To date, there is no drug available to heal all chikungunya [virus]-infected patients. Many drugs (vitamin C, phytotherapy, allopathy) have been tested in few regular trials and many empirical field experiments, unsuccessfully.\n\nHowever, physicians must always do their best to provide relief for their patients without adverse effects. We want to stress that it is possible to help most patients with appropriate use of some well-known drugs and physiotherapy.\n\nTo avoid such uncontrolled experiments due to the lack of knowledge, the Direction Generale de la Sante of the French Ministry of Health asked the Societe de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Francaise (the French Infectious Diseases Society) to produce guidelines for the case management of chikungunya [virus]-infected patients (acute stage and persisting forms). We directed a group of about 20 French experts (infectiologists, rheumatologists, GPs, reeducators, from mainland France, Reunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana) who worked on the topic for months. After having analysed the literature and debated their clinical experience, we produced a consensus among experts that is available online (free access) in French at http://www.infectiologie.com/site/medias/Recos/2014-Chikungunya-recommandations.pdf. We have answered the most frequently asked questions from GPs and listed the adequate practices for acute, post-acute, and chronic stages; some inefficient and/or potentially deleterious treatments are also mentioned.\n\nWe think that promoting this information about these French guidelines (English version coming soon) by ProMED could bring significant help for the patients and their physicians.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDr Fabrice Simon, MD, PhD, and Dr Emilie Javelle, MD\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Laveran Military Teaching Hospital\nMarseille, France\n<simon-f@wanadoo.fr>\n\n[ProMED thanks Drs Simon and Javelle for this comment. The guidelines put together by this group of medical specialists will be very helpful. A version in English is awaited, and one hopes that in addition to French it will also become available in Spanish and Portuguese, because most of the cases in the Americas have occurred in the countries where those are the main languages spoken. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (05): Americas, Pacific 20150227.3195783\nChikungunya (04): Americas 20150210.3156702\nChikungunya (03): Americas

chikungunya, formerly called dengue, in the Americas. Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21(4)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nAfter an absence of about 200 years, chikungunya returned to the American tropics in 2013. The virus is maintained in a complex African zoonotic cycle but escapes into an urban cycle at 40- to 50-year intervals, causing global pandemics. In 1823, classical chikungunya, a viral exanthem in humans, occurred on Zanzibar, and in 1827, it arrived in the Caribbean and spread to North and South America. In Zanzibar, the disease was known as kidenga pepo, Swahili for a sudden cramp-like seizure caused by an evil spirit; in Cuba, it was known as dengue, a Spanish homonym of denga. During the eighteenth century, dengue (present-day chikungunya) was distinguished from breakbone fever (present-day dengue), another febrile exanthem. In the 20th century, experiments resulted in the recovery and naming of present-day dengue viruses. In 1952, chikungunya virus was recovered during an outbreak in Tanzania, but by then, the virus had lost its original name to present-day dengue viruses.\n\n[This is a fascinating history of chikungunya with its previous appearance in the Americas, and the confusion due to its relationship clinically, to dengue fever. Given the widespread and continuing outbreak of chikungunya in the Americas, this report will be of interest to many ProMED-mail subscribers. - Mod.TY]\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n13 Feb 2015\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=343&Itemid=40931\n\n\nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory with autochthonous transmission -- 2013-2015 to EW 09 (cumulative, updated 6 Mar 2015, reports earlier than week 06 of 2015 are not reported but are available in earlier reports)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCases by Country / Week / Local Susp. / Local Conf./ Imported Conf. / Deaths\nNorth America:\nMexico / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 355 / 20 / 0\nUSA /week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 11 / 2524 / 0\n\nCentral America\nCosta Rica / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 233 / 89 / 0\nEl Salvador / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 143 346 / 157 / 0 / 0\nHonduras / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 6894 / 9 / 5 / 0\n\nLatin Caribbean\n---\nFrench Guiana / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 12 957 / 6191 / 0 / 1\nPuerto Rico / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 26 811 / 4323 / 31 / 15\nSt Berthelemy / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 1690 / 142 / 0 / 0\nSt Martin / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 5280 / 793 / 0 / 3\n\nNon-Latin Caribbean\nAnguilla / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 67 / 52 / 2 / 0\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1428 / 18 / 0 / 0\nBahamas / week 07 [week ending 20 fib 2014/ / 0 / 99 / 6 / 0\nCayman Islands / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 223 / 44 / 3 / 0\nJamaica / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1667 / 87 / 2 / 0\nMontserrat / week 04 [week ending 30 Jan 2015] / 117 / 14 / 0 / 0\nTrinidad and Tobago / week 03 [week ending 23 Jan 2015] / 0 / 303 / 3 / 0\n\nAndean Area\nBolivia / week 09 / week ending 16 Mar 2015] / 0 / 74 / 5 / 0\nColombia / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 183 718 / 1317 / 26 / 3\nEcuador / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 213 / 26 / 0\nPeru / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 34 / 0\n\nSouthern Cone\nArgentina / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 53 / 0\nBrazil / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 3867 / 149 / 100 / 0\nParaguay / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 129 / 130 / 7 / 0\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries mentioned above and below can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/images/maps/CHIK_Caribbean_Map-060214.jpg\nand http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455; and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCases in CARPHA (Caribbean Public Health Agency) member states with numbers from week 06-09 [ending 9 Mar 2015] but different from those in the PAHO report above.\nhttp://carpha.org/What-We-Do/Public-Health-Activities/Chikungunya\nWeek / Confirmed / Suspected\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 18 / 1442\nBarbados / week 8 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 122 / 1897\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 175 / 1223\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case numbers\n\nCaribbean locally acquired\n---\nDominica (national). 26 Feb 2015.

The moderator TY commented on it: \"One case is anecdotal but interesting, but will be of limited value until a statistically valid clinical trial is carried out.\" We totally agree with him about this kind of experimentation. To date, there is no drug available to heal all chikungunya [virus]-infected patients. Many drugs (vitamin C, phytotherapy, allopathy) have been tested in few regular trials and many empirical field experiments, unsuccessfully.\n\nHowever, physicians must always do their best to provide relief for their patients without adverse effects. We want to stress that it is possible to help most patients with appropriate use of some well-known drugs and physiotherapy.\n\nTo avoid such uncontrolled experiments due to the lack of knowledge, the Direction Generale de la Sante of the French Ministry of Health asked the Societe de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Francaise (the French Infectious Diseases Society) to produce guidelines for the case management of chikungunya [virus]-infected patients (acute stage and persisting forms). We directed a group of about 20 French experts (infectiologists, rheumatologists, GPs, reeducators, from mainland France, Reunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana) who worked on the topic for months. After having analysed the literature and debated their clinical experience, we produced a consensus among experts that is available online (free access) in French at http://www.infectiologie.com/site/medias/Recos/2014-Chikungunya-recommandations.pdf. We have answered the most frequently asked questions from GPs and listed the adequate practices for acute, post-acute, and chronic stages; some inefficient and/or potentially deleterious treatments are also mentioned.\n\nWe think that promoting this information about these French guidelines (English version coming soon) by ProMED could bring significant help for the patients and their physicians.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDr Fabrice Simon, MD, PhD, and Dr Emilie Javelle, MD\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Laveran Military Teaching Hospital\nMarseille, France\n<simon-f@wanadoo.fr>\n\n[ProMED thanks Drs Simon and Javelle for this comment. The guidelines put together by this group of medical specialists will be very helpful. A version in English is awaited, and one hopes that in addition to French it will also become available in Spanish and Portuguese, because most of the cases in the Americas have occurred in the countries where those are the main languages spoken. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (05): Americas, Pacific 20150227.3195783\nChikungunya (04): Americas 20150210.3156702\nChikungunya (03): Americas

chikungunya, formerly called dengue, in the Americas. Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21(4)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nAfter an absence of about 200 years, chikungunya returned to the American tropics in 2013. The virus is maintained in a complex African zoonotic cycle but escapes into an urban cycle at 40- to 50-year intervals, causing global pandemics. In 1823, classical chikungunya, a viral exanthem in humans, occurred on Zanzibar, and in 1827, it arrived in the Caribbean and spread to North and South America. In Zanzibar, the disease was known as kidenga pepo, Swahili for a sudden cramp-like seizure caused by an evil spirit; in Cuba, it was known as dengue, a Spanish homonym of denga. During the eighteenth century, dengue (present-day chikungunya) was distinguished from breakbone fever (present-day dengue), another febrile exanthem. In the 20th century, experiments resulted in the recovery and naming of present-day dengue viruses. In 1952, chikungunya virus was recovered during an outbreak in Tanzania, but by then, the virus had lost its original name to present-day dengue viruses.\n\n[This is a fascinating history of chikungunya with its previous appearance in the Americas, and the confusion due to its relationship clinically, to dengue fever. Given the widespread and continuing outbreak of chikungunya in the Americas, this report will be of interest to many ProMED-mail subscribers. - Mod.TY]\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n13 Feb 2015\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=343&Itemid=40931\n\n\nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory with autochthonous transmission -- 2013-2015 to EW 09 (cumulative, updated 6 Mar 2015, reports earlier than week 06 of 2015 are not reported but are available in earlier reports)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCases by Country / Week / Local Susp. / Local Conf./ Imported Conf. / Deaths\nNorth America:\nMexico / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 355 / 20 / 0\nUSA /week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 11 / 2524 / 0\n\nCentral America\nCosta Rica / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 233 / 89 / 0\nEl Salvador / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 143 346 / 157 / 0 / 0\nHonduras / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 6894 / 9 / 5 / 0\n\nLatin Caribbean\n---\nFrench Guiana / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 12 957 / 6191 / 0 / 1\nPuerto Rico / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 26 811 / 4323 / 31 / 15\nSt Berthelemy / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 1690 / 142 / 0 / 0\nSt Martin / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 5280 / 793 / 0 / 3\n\nNon-Latin Caribbean\nAnguilla / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 67 / 52 / 2 / 0\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1428 / 18 / 0 / 0\nBahamas / week 07 [week ending 20 fib 2014/ / 0 / 99 / 6 / 0\nCayman Islands / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 223 / 44 / 3 / 0\nJamaica / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1667 / 87 / 2 / 0\nMontserrat / week 04 [week ending 30 Jan 2015] / 117 / 14 / 0 / 0\nTrinidad and Tobago / week 03 [week ending 23 Jan 2015] / 0 / 303 / 3 / 0\n\nAndean Area\nBolivia / week 09 / week ending 16 Mar 2015] / 0 / 74 / 5 / 0\nColombia / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 183 718 / 1317 / 26 / 3\nEcuador / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 213 / 26 / 0\nPeru / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 34 / 0\n\nSouthern Cone\nArgentina / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 53 / 0\nBrazil / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 3867 / 149 / 100 / 0\nParaguay / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 129 / 130 / 7 / 0\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries mentioned above and below can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/images/maps/CHIK_Caribbean_Map-060214.jpg\nand http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455; and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCases in CARPHA (Caribbean Public Health Agency) member states with numbers from week 06-09 [ending 9 Mar 2015] but different from those in the PAHO report above.\nhttp://carpha.org/What-We-Do/Public-Health-Activities/Chikungunya\nWeek / Confirmed / Suspected\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 18 / 1442\nBarbados / week 8 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 122 / 1897\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 175 / 1223\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case numbers\n\nCaribbean locally acquired\n---\nDominica (national). 26 Feb 2015.

The moderator TY commented on it: \"One case is anecdotal but interesting, but will be of limited value until a statistically valid clinical trial is carried out.\" We totally agree with him about this kind of experimentation. To date, there is no drug available to heal all chikungunya [virus]-infected patients. Many drugs (vitamin C, phytotherapy, allopathy) have been tested in few regular trials and many empirical field experiments, unsuccessfully.\n\nHowever, physicians must always do their best to provide relief for their patients without adverse effects. We want to stress that it is possible to help most patients with appropriate use of some well-known drugs and physiotherapy.\n\nTo avoid such uncontrolled experiments due to the lack of knowledge, the Direction Generale de la Sante of the French Ministry of Health asked the Societe de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Francaise (the French Infectious Diseases Society) to produce guidelines for the case management of chikungunya [virus]-infected patients (acute stage and persisting forms). We directed a group of about 20 French experts (infectiologists, rheumatologists, GPs, reeducators, from mainland France, Reunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana) who worked on the topic for months. After having analysed the literature and debated their clinical experience, we produced a consensus among experts that is available online (free access) in French at http://www.infectiologie.com/site/medias/Recos/2014-Chikungunya-recommandations.pdf. We have answered the most frequently asked questions from GPs and listed the adequate practices for acute, post-acute, and chronic stages; some inefficient and/or potentially deleterious treatments are also mentioned.\n\nWe think that promoting this information about these French guidelines (English version coming soon) by ProMED could bring significant help for the patients and their physicians.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDr Fabrice Simon, MD, PhD, and Dr Emilie Javelle, MD\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Laveran Military Teaching Hospital\nMarseille, France\n<simon-f@wanadoo.fr>\n\n[ProMED thanks Drs Simon and Javelle for this comment. The guidelines put together by this group of medical specialists will be very helpful. A version in English is awaited, and one hopes that in addition to French it will also become available in Spanish and Portuguese, because most of the cases in the Americas have occurred in the countries where those are the main languages spoken. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (05): Americas, Pacific 20150227.3195783\nChikungunya (04): Americas 20150210.3156702\nChikungunya (03): Americas

chikungunya, formerly called dengue, in the Americas. Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21(4)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nAfter an absence of about 200 years, chikungunya returned to the American tropics in 2013. The virus is maintained in a complex African zoonotic cycle but escapes into an urban cycle at 40- to 50-year intervals, causing global pandemics. In 1823, classical chikungunya, a viral exanthem in humans, occurred on Zanzibar, and in 1827, it arrived in the Caribbean and spread to North and South America. In Zanzibar, the disease was known as kidenga pepo, Swahili for a sudden cramp-like seizure caused by an evil spirit; in Cuba, it was known as dengue, a Spanish homonym of denga. During the eighteenth century, dengue (present-day chikungunya) was distinguished from breakbone fever (present-day dengue), another febrile exanthem. In the 20th century, experiments resulted in the recovery and naming of present-day dengue viruses. In 1952, chikungunya virus was recovered during an outbreak in Tanzania, but by then, the virus had lost its original name to present-day dengue viruses.\n\n[This is a fascinating history of chikungunya with its previous appearance in the Americas, and the confusion due to its relationship clinically, to dengue fever. Given the widespread and continuing outbreak of chikungunya in the Americas, this report will be of interest to many ProMED-mail subscribers. - Mod.TY]\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n13 Feb 2015\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=343&Itemid=40931\n\n\nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory with autochthonous transmission -- 2013-2015 to EW 09 (cumulative, updated 6 Mar 2015, reports earlier than week 06 of 2015 are not reported but are available in earlier reports)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCases by Country / Week / Local Susp. / Local Conf./ Imported Conf. / Deaths\nNorth America:\nMexico / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 355 / 20 / 0\nUSA /week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 11 / 2524 / 0\n\nCentral America\nCosta Rica / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 233 / 89 / 0\nEl Salvador / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 143 346 / 157 / 0 / 0\nHonduras / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 6894 / 9 / 5 / 0\n\nLatin Caribbean\n---\nFrench Guiana / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 12 957 / 6191 / 0 / 1\nPuerto Rico / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 26 811 / 4323 / 31 / 15\nSt Berthelemy / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 1690 / 142 / 0 / 0\nSt Martin / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 5280 / 793 / 0 / 3\n\nNon-Latin Caribbean\nAnguilla / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 67 / 52 / 2 / 0\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1428 / 18 / 0 / 0\nBahamas / week 07 [week ending 20 fib 2014/ / 0 / 99 / 6 / 0\nCayman Islands / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 223 / 44 / 3 / 0\nJamaica / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1667 / 87 / 2 / 0\nMontserrat / week 04 [week ending 30 Jan 2015] / 117 / 14 / 0 / 0\nTrinidad and Tobago / week 03 [week ending 23 Jan 2015] / 0 / 303 / 3 / 0\n\nAndean Area\nBolivia / week 09 / week ending 16 Mar 2015] / 0 / 74 / 5 / 0\nColombia / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 183 718 / 1317 / 26 / 3\nEcuador / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 213 / 26 / 0\nPeru / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 34 / 0\n\nSouthern Cone\nArgentina / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 53 / 0\nBrazil / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 3867 / 149 / 100 / 0\nParaguay / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 129 / 130 / 7 / 0\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries mentioned above and below can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/images/maps/CHIK_Caribbean_Map-060214.jpg\nand http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455; and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCases in CARPHA (Caribbean Public Health Agency) member states with numbers from week 06-09 [ending 9 Mar 2015] but different from those in the PAHO report above.\nhttp://carpha.org/What-We-Do/Public-Health-Activities/Chikungunya\nWeek / Confirmed / Suspected\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 18 / 1442\nBarbados / week 8 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 122 / 1897\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 175 / 1223\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case numbers\n\nCaribbean locally acquired\n---\nDominica (national). 26 Feb 2015.

The moderator TY commented on it: \"One case is anecdotal but interesting, but will be of limited value until a statistically valid clinical trial is carried out.\" We totally agree with him about this kind of experimentation. To date, there is no drug available to heal all chikungunya [virus]-infected patients. Many drugs (vitamin C, phytotherapy, allopathy) have been tested in few regular trials and many empirical field experiments, unsuccessfully.\n\nHowever, physicians must always do their best to provide relief for their patients without adverse effects. We want to stress that it is possible to help most patients with appropriate use of some well-known drugs and physiotherapy.\n\nTo avoid such uncontrolled experiments due to the lack of knowledge, the Direction Generale de la Sante of the French Ministry of Health asked the Societe de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Francaise (the French Infectious Diseases Society) to produce guidelines for the case management of chikungunya [virus]-infected patients (acute stage and persisting forms). We directed a group of about 20 French experts (infectiologists, rheumatologists, GPs, reeducators, from mainland France, Reunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana) who worked on the topic for months. After having analysed the literature and debated their clinical experience, we produced a consensus among experts that is available online (free access) in French at http://www.infectiologie.com/site/medias/Recos/2014-Chikungunya-recommandations.pdf. We have answered the most frequently asked questions from GPs and listed the adequate practices for acute, post-acute, and chronic stages; some inefficient and/or potentially deleterious treatments are also mentioned.\n\nWe think that promoting this information about these French guidelines (English version coming soon) by ProMED could bring significant help for the patients and their physicians.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDr Fabrice Simon, MD, PhD, and Dr Emilie Javelle, MD\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Laveran Military Teaching Hospital\nMarseille, France\n<simon-f@wanadoo.fr>\n\n[ProMED thanks Drs Simon and Javelle for this comment. The guidelines put together by this group of medical specialists will be very helpful. A version in English is awaited, and one hopes that in addition to French it will also become available in Spanish and Portuguese, because most of the cases in the Americas have occurred in the countries where those are the main languages spoken. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (05): Americas, Pacific 20150227.3195783\nChikungunya (04): Americas 20150210.3156702\nChikungunya (03): Americas

chikungunya, formerly called dengue, in the Americas. Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21(4)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nAfter an absence of about 200 years, chikungunya returned to the American tropics in 2013. The virus is maintained in a complex African zoonotic cycle but escapes into an urban cycle at 40- to 50-year intervals, causing global pandemics. In 1823, classical chikungunya, a viral exanthem in humans, occurred on Zanzibar, and in 1827, it arrived in the Caribbean and spread to North and South America. In Zanzibar, the disease was known as kidenga pepo, Swahili for a sudden cramp-like seizure caused by an evil spirit; in Cuba, it was known as dengue, a Spanish homonym of denga. During the eighteenth century, dengue (present-day chikungunya) was distinguished from breakbone fever (present-day dengue), another febrile exanthem. In the 20th century, experiments resulted in the recovery and naming of present-day dengue viruses. In 1952, chikungunya virus was recovered during an outbreak in Tanzania, but by then, the virus had lost its original name to present-day dengue viruses.\n\n[This is a fascinating history of chikungunya with its previous appearance in the Americas, and the confusion due to its relationship clinically, to dengue fever. Given the widespread and continuing outbreak of chikungunya in the Americas, this report will be of interest to many ProMED-mail subscribers. - Mod.TY]\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n13 Feb 2015\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=343&Itemid=40931\n\n\nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory with autochthonous transmission -- 2013-2015 to EW 09 (cumulative, updated 6 Mar 2015, reports earlier than week 06 of 2015 are not reported but are available in earlier reports)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCases by Country / Week / Local Susp. / Local Conf./ Imported Conf. / Deaths\nNorth America:\nMexico / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 355 / 20 / 0\nUSA /week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 11 / 2524 / 0\n\nCentral America\nCosta Rica / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 233 / 89 / 0\nEl Salvador / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 143 346 / 157 / 0 / 0\nHonduras / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 6894 / 9 / 5 / 0\n\nLatin Caribbean\n---\nFrench Guiana / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 12 957 / 6191 / 0 / 1\nPuerto Rico / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 26 811 / 4323 / 31 / 15\nSt Berthelemy / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 1690 / 142 / 0 / 0\nSt Martin / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 5280 / 793 / 0 / 3\n\nNon-Latin Caribbean\nAnguilla / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 67 / 52 / 2 / 0\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1428 / 18 / 0 / 0\nBahamas / week 07 [week ending 20 fib 2014/ / 0 / 99 / 6 / 0\nCayman Islands / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 223 / 44 / 3 / 0\nJamaica / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1667 / 87 / 2 / 0\nMontserrat / week 04 [week ending 30 Jan 2015] / 117 / 14 / 0 / 0\nTrinidad and Tobago / week 03 [week ending 23 Jan 2015] / 0 / 303 / 3 / 0\n\nAndean Area\nBolivia / week 09 / week ending 16 Mar 2015] / 0 / 74 / 5 / 0\nColombia / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 183 718 / 1317 / 26 / 3\nEcuador / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 213 / 26 / 0\nPeru / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 34 / 0\n\nSouthern Cone\nArgentina / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 53 / 0\nBrazil / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 3867 / 149 / 100 / 0\nParaguay / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 129 / 130 / 7 / 0\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries mentioned above and below can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/images/maps/CHIK_Caribbean_Map-060214.jpg\nand http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455; and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCases in CARPHA (Caribbean Public Health Agency) member states with numbers from week 06-09 [ending 9 Mar 2015] but different from those in the PAHO report above.\nhttp://carpha.org/What-We-Do/Public-Health-Activities/Chikungunya\nWeek / Confirmed / Suspected\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 18 / 1442\nBarbados / week 8 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 122 / 1897\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 175 / 1223\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case numbers\n\nCaribbean locally acquired\n---\nDominica (national). 26 Feb 2015.

The moderator TY commented on it: \"One case is anecdotal but interesting, but will be of limited value until a statistically valid clinical trial is carried out.\" We totally agree with him about this kind of experimentation. To date, there is no drug available to heal all chikungunya [virus]-infected patients. Many drugs (vitamin C, phytotherapy, allopathy) have been tested in few regular trials and many empirical field experiments, unsuccessfully.\n\nHowever, physicians must always do their best to provide relief for their patients without adverse effects. We want to stress that it is possible to help most patients with appropriate use of some well-known drugs and physiotherapy.\n\nTo avoid such uncontrolled experiments due to the lack of knowledge, the Direction Generale de la Sante of the French Ministry of Health asked the Societe de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Francaise (the French Infectious Diseases Society) to produce guidelines for the case management of chikungunya [virus]-infected patients (acute stage and persisting forms). We directed a group of about 20 French experts (infectiologists, rheumatologists, GPs, reeducators, from mainland France, Reunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana) who worked on the topic for months. After having analysed the literature and debated their clinical experience, we produced a consensus among experts that is available online (free access) in French at http://www.infectiologie.com/site/medias/Recos/2014-Chikungunya-recommandations.pdf. We have answered the most frequently asked questions from GPs and listed the adequate practices for acute, post-acute, and chronic stages; some inefficient and/or potentially deleterious treatments are also mentioned.\n\nWe think that promoting this information about these French guidelines (English version coming soon) by ProMED could bring significant help for the patients and their physicians.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDr Fabrice Simon, MD, PhD, and Dr Emilie Javelle, MD\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Laveran Military Teaching Hospital\nMarseille, France\n<simon-f@wanadoo.fr>\n\n[ProMED thanks Drs Simon and Javelle for this comment. The guidelines put together by this group of medical specialists will be very helpful. A version in English is awaited, and one hopes that in addition to French it will also become available in Spanish and Portuguese, because most of the cases in the Americas have occurred in the countries where those are the main languages spoken. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (05): Americas, Pacific 20150227.3195783\nChikungunya (04): Americas 20150210.3156702\nChikungunya (03): Americas

chikungunya, formerly called dengue, in the Americas. Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21(4)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nAfter an absence of about 200 years, chikungunya returned to the American tropics in 2013. The virus is maintained in a complex African zoonotic cycle but escapes into an urban cycle at 40- to 50-year intervals, causing global pandemics. In 1823, classical chikungunya, a viral exanthem in humans, occurred on Zanzibar, and in 1827, it arrived in the Caribbean and spread to North and South America. In Zanzibar, the disease was known as kidenga pepo, Swahili for a sudden cramp-like seizure caused by an evil spirit; in Cuba, it was known as dengue, a Spanish homonym of denga. During the eighteenth century, dengue (present-day chikungunya) was distinguished from breakbone fever (present-day dengue), another febrile exanthem. In the 20th century, experiments resulted in the recovery and naming of present-day dengue viruses. In 1952, chikungunya virus was recovered during an outbreak in Tanzania, but by then, the virus had lost its original name to present-day dengue viruses.\n\n[This is a fascinating history of chikungunya with its previous appearance in the Americas, and the confusion due to its relationship clinically, to dengue fever. Given the widespread and continuing outbreak of chikungunya in the Americas, this report will be of interest to many ProMED-mail subscribers. - Mod.TY]\n\nWHO/PAHO report\n13 Feb 2015\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=343&Itemid=40931\n\n\nReported cases of chikungunya fever in the Americas, by country or territory with autochthonous transmission -- 2013-2015 to EW 09 (cumulative, updated 6 Mar 2015, reports earlier than week 06 of 2015 are not reported but are available in earlier reports)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCases by Country / Week / Local Susp. / Local Conf./ Imported Conf. / Deaths\nNorth America:\nMexico / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 355 / 20 / 0\nUSA /week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 11 / 2524 / 0\n\nCentral America\nCosta Rica / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 233 / 89 / 0\nEl Salvador / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 143 346 / 157 / 0 / 0\nHonduras / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 6894 / 9 / 5 / 0\n\nLatin Caribbean\n---\nFrench Guiana / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 12 957 / 6191 / 0 / 1\nPuerto Rico / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 26 811 / 4323 / 31 / 15\nSt Berthelemy / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 1690 / 142 / 0 / 0\nSt Martin / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 5280 / 793 / 0 / 3\n\nNon-Latin Caribbean\nAnguilla / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 67 / 52 / 2 / 0\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1428 / 18 / 0 / 0\nBahamas / week 07 [week ending 20 fib 2014/ / 0 / 99 / 6 / 0\nCayman Islands / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 223 / 44 / 3 / 0\nJamaica / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 1667 / 87 / 2 / 0\nMontserrat / week 04 [week ending 30 Jan 2015] / 117 / 14 / 0 / 0\nTrinidad and Tobago / week 03 [week ending 23 Jan 2015] / 0 / 303 / 3 / 0\n\nAndean Area\nBolivia / week 09 / week ending 16 Mar 2015] / 0 / 74 / 5 / 0\nColombia / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 183 718 / 1317 / 26 / 3\nEcuador / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 0 / 213 / 26 / 0\nPeru / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 34 / 0\n\nSouthern Cone\nArgentina / week 07 [week ending 20 Feb 2015] / 0 / 0 / 53 / 0\nBrazil / week 06 [week ending 13 Feb 2015] / 3867 / 149 / 100 / 0\nParaguay / week 09 [week ending 6 Mar 2015] / 129 / 130 / 7 / 0\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries mentioned above and below can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/images/maps/CHIK_Caribbean_Map-060214.jpg\nand http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455; and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCases in CARPHA (Caribbean Public Health Agency) member states with numbers from week 06-09 [ending 9 Mar 2015] but different from those in the PAHO report above.\nhttp://carpha.org/What-We-Do/Public-Health-Activities/Chikungunya\nWeek / Confirmed / Suspected\nAntigua and Barbuda / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 18 / 1442\nBarbados / week 8 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 122 / 1897\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines / week 08 [week ending 27 Feb 2015] / 175 / 1223\n\nCases in various countries not mentioned above or more recent case numbers\n\nCaribbean locally acquired\n---\nDominica (national). 26 Feb 2015.

The moderator TY commented on it: \"One case is anecdotal but interesting, but will be of limited value until a statistically valid clinical trial is carried out.\" We totally agree with him about this kind of experimentation. To date, there is no drug available to heal all chikungunya [virus]-infected patients. Many drugs (vitamin C, phytotherapy, allopathy) have been tested in few regular trials and many empirical field experiments, unsuccessfully.\n\nHowever, physicians must always do their best to provide relief for their patients without adverse effects. We want to stress that it is possible to help most patients with appropriate use of some well-known drugs and physiotherapy.\n\nTo avoid such uncontrolled experiments due to the lack of knowledge, the Direction Generale de la Sante of the French Ministry of Health asked the Societe de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Francaise (the French Infectious Diseases Society) to produce guidelines for the case management of chikungunya [virus]-infected patients (acute stage and persisting forms). We directed a group of about 20 French experts (infectiologists, rheumatologists, GPs, reeducators, from mainland France, Reunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana) who worked on the topic for months. After having analysed the literature and debated their clinical experience, we produced a consensus among experts that is available online (free access) in French at http://www.infectiologie.com/site/medias/Recos/2014-Chikungunya-recommandations.pdf. We have answered the most frequently asked questions from GPs and listed the adequate practices for acute, post-acute, and chronic stages; some inefficient and/or potentially deleterious treatments are also mentioned.\n\nWe think that promoting this information about these French guidelines (English version coming soon) by ProMED could bring significant help for the patients and their physicians.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDr Fabrice Simon, MD, PhD, and Dr Emilie Javelle, MD\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Laveran Military Teaching Hospital\nMarseille, France\n<simon-f@wanadoo.fr>\n\n[ProMED thanks Drs Simon and Javelle for this comment. The guidelines put together by this group of medical specialists will be very helpful. A version in English is awaited, and one hopes that in addition to French it will also become available in Spanish and Portuguese, because most of the cases in the Americas have occurred in the countries where those are the main languages spoken. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nChikungunya (05): Americas, Pacific 20150227.3195783\nChikungunya (04): Americas 20150210.3156702\nChikungunya (03): Americas

Symptoms usually begin 10 days after infection. In severe cases, it can result in liver damage, jaundice, kidney failure, and internal bleeding.\n\nLeptospirosis should be treated with antibiotics. \"The disease can lead to life-threatening complications like renal failure, hypotension, and hemorrhage.

Anbumani also took part in the medical camp and gave treatment to the patients.\n\n\"More than 200 people at Jambukarankottai are suffering from dengue, chikungunya, and rat fever. We have confirmed this by testing blood samples of [febrile patients],\" Anbumani told TOI.\n\nHe said rat fever or leptospirosis would attack people just before the onset of the monsoon. \"The zoonotic disease is caused largely by rats that are natural carriers of the disease-causing bacterium [_Leptospira interrogans_]. Human beings contract the disease through water and soil which [is contaminated by] the urine of infected animals,\" he said.\n\n\"People those who are affected with rat fever will have symptoms like high fever, headache, chills and nausea. More than 40 people with serious health conditions were rushed to Dharmapuri Government Medical College Hospital,\" Anbumani said.\n\n\"Leptospirosis or rat fever is a potentially serious bacterial infection that can affect many parts of the body. It is caused by _Leptospira interrogans_, a corkscrew-shaped bacterium. Since rats are the most common source of human infection by the bacteria, the disease is also called rat fever. It does not spread from person to person,\" said a medical officer who is part of the medical team.\n\nLeptospirosis bacteria can enter the body through wounds and mucous membranes, or when a person swallows contaminated food or water. Symptoms usually begin 10 days after infection. In severe cases, it can result in liver damage, jaundice, kidney failure, and internal bleeding.\n\nLeptospirosis should be treated with antibiotics. \"The disease can lead to life-threatening complications like renal failure, hypotension, and hemorrhage. Severe or untreated leptospirosis can lead to damage of the organs and, in rare cases, even death,\" he added.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Jambukarankottai is a village in the Dharmapuri district located in the northwestern portion of Tamil Nadu, India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmapuri). Tamil Nadu, one of the 29 states of India, is located in the southernmost part of the Indian Peninsula (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu).\n\nLeptospirosis occurs worldwide and outbreaks frequently follow flooding after heavy rains. _Leptospira_ survive for weeks to months in warm, fresh water, or soil flooded with fresh water. After exposure to floodwater contaminated by infected animal urine, the bacteria can enter the body through skin or mucous membranes, especially if the skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection.\n\nTamil Nadu experiences heavy rain during the South West monsoon starting in June to September and during the North East monsoon from October to December; the dry season is from January to May. (The news report above confusingly says, \"leptospirosis would attack people just before the onset of the monsoon.\")\n\nBecause of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation and the exact number of patients with leptospirosis is not given in the news report above.

We have not had currently another outbreak like the one in San Cristobal,\" said Freddy Hidalgo.\n\nHe indicated that isolated chikungunya cases have appeared in Puerto Plata ad San Pedro, because these cities have people who have come from Nigua in San Crisobal [province]. \"We expect that the virus can continue to move, but we continue working with the people in prevention tasks,\" he added. Freddy Hidalgo explained that to the extent that people move from one city to another, the virus can too, \"but we are alert to contain new outbreaks.\" The official explained that when a person has become infected with the virus and goes from one place to another, there is risk that the person will be bitten by a mosquito that will then bite another person and infect them.\n\n\"The mosquito is present in different localities to which one might move, and because of this, we are working to avoid dissemination of the virus, that [in turn], moves with the [infected] people. We are not immune, nor is there a vaccine, so we are susceptible to being affected by the virus,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed to the public that water stored on the patios of their houses should be in containers previously treated with bleach. He also asked for general collaboration by the populace for the elimination of water catchments that could contain clean water from their patios.\n\n[Byline: Adriana Peguero]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[New cases are appearing in various parts of the Dominican Republic, especially on the south coast.

However, the 25 Apr 2014 edition of Sierra Vision (http://sierravision.com.do/alcanza-a-4-provincias-virus-de-chikungunya/) indicated that there are outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in 4 provinces. The localities with the most cases are: San Pedro, Nigua, Haina and Boca Chica (which had 76 cases in the past 72 hours). The 25 Apr 2014 edition of Dominican Today (http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2014/4/25/51271/Public-Healths-cavalry-battles-chikungunya-fever-at-Boca-Chica) stated that the Public Health Ministry has deployed as of Friday [25 Apr 2014] its entire \"cavalry\" to fumigate Boca Chica, as the rising cases of chikungunya fever have panicked the resort town's population. Fumigation will have limited effect on transmission unless vector mosquito breeding sites are treated or eliminated. Barahona province has also had \"dozens of suspected cases,\" according to a 26 Apr 2014 report in Al Momento (http://www.almomento.net/articulo/161688/BARAHONA-Casos-sospechosos-de-fiebre-Chikungunya), although the occurrence of suspected cases in Barahona is denied in another report (http://www.resumendesalud.com/do/index.php/categoria-infectologia/7893-en-algunas-localidades-no-se-han-registrado-casos-de-chikungunya).

The Ministry of Health announced the 1st and only confirmed case of the disease earlier this month [April 2014].\n\nChief Epidemiologist Nahum Jn Baptiste told Saint Lucia News Online (SNO) in an interview that as of today, 23 Apr 2014, 10 suspected cases have surfaced -- one as recent as yesterday -- involving a foreigner, but none have been confirmed.\n\nA 63-year-old fisherman, who was the 1st individual confirmed to have contracted the virus, has been treated and is fully recovered. He is now back on the job, Jn Baptiste said.\n\n\"So far, we have done the investigations. We have not yet confirmed any other case that has been transmitted from that imported case. We also have another suspected case of a foreigner, someone who started to present signs and symptoms yesterday [22 Apr 2014],\" he said.\n\nJn Baptiste said the ministry continues to strengthen its surveillance system and will continue to send samples to the Caribbean Public Health Agency for testing every week.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the 1st confirmed case of chikungunya [virus infection] a few weeks ago, the Ministry of Health said it had intensified mosquito-control efforts to lessen the impact of a chikungunya outbreak on the island. Officials say the impact of the disease all depends on whether suitable conditions exist for _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes to breed, since they transmit the disease [virus].\n\nPeople suffering with the illness will mainly feel chronic pain in the joints, and although it will not require being admitted to a hospital, there will be prolonged pain or swelling in the joints.\n\n\"As long as we have an infected person and the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is around and they can bite this infected person whereupon they get infected themselves and then bite someone else, there is possibility for transmission.

We have not had currently another outbreak like the one in San Cristobal,\" said Freddy Hidalgo.\n\nHe indicated that isolated chikungunya cases have appeared in Puerto Plata ad San Pedro, because these cities have people who have come from Nigua in San Crisobal [province]. \"We expect that the virus can continue to move, but we continue working with the people in prevention tasks,\" he added. Freddy Hidalgo explained that to the extent that people move from one city to another, the virus can too, \"but we are alert to contain new outbreaks.\" The official explained that when a person has become infected with the virus and goes from one place to another, there is risk that the person will be bitten by a mosquito that will then bite another person and infect them.\n\n\"The mosquito is present in different localities to which one might move, and because of this, we are working to avoid dissemination of the virus, that [in turn], moves with the [infected] people. We are not immune, nor is there a vaccine, so we are susceptible to being affected by the virus,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed to the public that water stored on the patios of their houses should be in containers previously treated with bleach. He also asked for general collaboration by the populace for the elimination of water catchments that could contain clean water from their patios.\n\n[Byline: Adriana Peguero]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[New cases are appearing in various parts of the Dominican Republic, especially on the south coast.

However, the 25 Apr 2014 edition of Sierra Vision (http://sierravision.com.do/alcanza-a-4-provincias-virus-de-chikungunya/) indicated that there are outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in 4 provinces. The localities with the most cases are: San Pedro, Nigua, Haina and Boca Chica (which had 76 cases in the past 72 hours). The 25 Apr 2014 edition of Dominican Today (http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2014/4/25/51271/Public-Healths-cavalry-battles-chikungunya-fever-at-Boca-Chica) stated that the Public Health Ministry has deployed as of Friday [25 Apr 2014] its entire \"cavalry\" to fumigate Boca Chica, as the rising cases of chikungunya fever have panicked the resort town's population. Fumigation will have limited effect on transmission unless vector mosquito breeding sites are treated or eliminated. Barahona province has also had \"dozens of suspected cases,\" according to a 26 Apr 2014 report in Al Momento (http://www.almomento.net/articulo/161688/BARAHONA-Casos-sospechosos-de-fiebre-Chikungunya), although the occurrence of suspected cases in Barahona is denied in another report (http://www.resumendesalud.com/do/index.php/categoria-infectologia/7893-en-algunas-localidades-no-se-han-registrado-casos-de-chikungunya).

Antigua and Barbuda health officials on Friday [25 Apr 2014] held a news conference to confirm that an individual in his mid 60s had become the island's 1st case.\n\nMedical Officer of Health Dr Orita Zachariah told reporters that the case had been detected on 22 Apr [2014], and the victim, between the ages of 60 and 65, works in the capital, St John's.\n\nThe health authorities say they are also awaiting results of 4 other suspected cases from the Trinidad-based Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) [laboratories].\n\nDr Zachariah said that persons should remain home if they suspect they have the disease, while Chief health Inspector Lionel Michael said the Department of Health would increase vector control in a bid to prevent a spread of the disease.\n\nOn Thu 24 Apr 2014, the Ministry of Health in St Vincent and the Grenadines declared an outbreak of the virus after 3 cases were confirmed on the northern Grenadine island of Bequia.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The 24 Apr 2014 edition of I-Witness News (http://www.iwnsvg.com/2014/04/24/update-health-minister-declares-outbreak-of-chikungunya-in-st-vincent/) indicated that cases of chikungunya on Bequia were 1st suspected last week, Mon 14 Apr 2014.

The Ministry of Health announced the 1st and only confirmed case of the disease earlier this month [April 2014].\n\nChief Epidemiologist Nahum Jn Baptiste told Saint Lucia News Online (SNO) in an interview that as of today, 23 Apr 2014, 10 suspected cases have surfaced -- one as recent as yesterday -- involving a foreigner, but none have been confirmed.\n\nA 63-year-old fisherman, who was the 1st individual confirmed to have contracted the virus, has been treated and is fully recovered. He is now back on the job, Jn Baptiste said.\n\n\"So far, we have done the investigations. We have not yet confirmed any other case that has been transmitted from that imported case. We also have another suspected case of a foreigner, someone who started to present signs and symptoms yesterday [22 Apr 2014],\" he said.\n\nJn Baptiste said the ministry continues to strengthen its surveillance system and will continue to send samples to the Caribbean Public Health Agency for testing every week.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the 1st confirmed case of chikungunya [virus infection] a few weeks ago, the Ministry of Health said it had intensified mosquito-control efforts to lessen the impact of a chikungunya outbreak on the island. Officials say the impact of the disease all depends on whether suitable conditions exist for _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes to breed, since they transmit the disease [virus].\n\nPeople suffering with the illness will mainly feel chronic pain in the joints, and although it will not require being admitted to a hospital, there will be prolonged pain or swelling in the joints.\n\n\"As long as we have an infected person and the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is around and they can bite this infected person whereupon they get infected themselves and then bite someone else, there is possibility for transmission. We of course are zooming in on our index case and looking at his surroundings and the persons in his household and places he frequents to ensure we have some focus intervention there as well,\" Chief Medical Officer Dr. Merlene Fredericks said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[A map showing the location of St. Lucia can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] PAHO/WHO report\nDate: Fri 25 Apr 2014\nSource: PAHO/WHO [edited]\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=25294&Itemid=\u3008=en\n\n\nCountry / Week / Suspected cases / Confirmed cases / Deaths\nLatin Caribbean\nDominican Republic / 14 / 3015 / 17 / 0\nFrench Guiana / 16 / 0 / 52 / 0\nGuadeloupe / 16 / 6000 / 1328 / 1\nMartinique / 16 / 17 630 / 1515 / 2\nSt Barthelemy / 16 / 480 / 135 / 0\nSt Martin / 16 / 3030 / 793 / 3\n\nNon-Latin Caribbean\nAnguilla / 13 / 0 / 33 / 0\nAruba / 6 / 0 / 1 / 0\nDominica / 16 / 1252 / 105 / 0\nSt Kitts and Nevis / 8 / 0 / 1 / 0\nSt Lucia 13 / 0 / 1 / 0\nSt Vincent & the Grenadines 17 / 24 / 3 / 0\nSt Maarten / 12 / 0 / 123 / 0\nBritish Virgin Islands / 11 / 0 / 9 / 0\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands can be accessed at http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/caribnew.gif, and at http://healthmap.org/promed/?p=35575. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] French Antilles and Guiana\nDate: 14-20 Apr 2014\nSource: InVS Point Epidemiologique No. 15 [in French, trans.

Freddy Hidalgo explained that to the extent that people move from one city to another, the virus can too, \"but we are alert to contain new outbreaks.\" The official explained that when a person has become infected with the virus and goes from one place to another, there is risk that the person will be bitten by a mosquito that will then bite another person and infect them.\n\n\"The mosquito is present in different localities to which one might move, and because of this, we are working to avoid dissemination of the virus, that [in turn], moves with the [infected] people. We are not immune, nor is there a vaccine, so we are susceptible to being affected by the virus,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed to the public that water stored on the patios of their houses should be in containers previously treated with bleach. He also asked for general collaboration by the populace for the elimination of water catchments that could contain clean water from their patios.\n\n[Byline: Adriana Peguero]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[New cases are appearing in various parts of the Dominican Republic, especially on the south coast.

The Ministry of Health announced the 1st and only confirmed case of the disease earlier this month [April 2014].\n\nChief Epidemiologist Nahum Jn Baptiste told Saint Lucia News Online (SNO) in an interview that as of today, 23 Apr 2014, 10 suspected cases have surfaced -- one as recent as yesterday -- involving a foreigner, but none have been confirmed.\n\nA 63-year-old fisherman, who was the 1st individual confirmed to have contracted the virus, has been treated and is fully recovered.

We also have another suspected case of a foreigner, someone who started to present signs and symptoms yesterday [22 Apr 2014],\" he said.\n\nJn Baptiste said the ministry continues to strengthen its surveillance system and will continue to send samples to the Caribbean Public Health Agency for testing every week.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the 1st confirmed case of chikungunya [virus infection] a few weeks ago, the Ministry of Health said it had intensified mosquito-control efforts to lessen the impact of a chikungunya outbreak on the island. Officials say the impact of the disease all depends on whether suitable conditions exist for _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes to breed, since they transmit the disease [virus].\n\nPeople suffering with the illness will mainly feel chronic pain in the joints, and although it will not require being admitted to a hospital, there will be prolonged pain or swelling in the joints.\n\n\"As long as we have an infected person and the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is around and they can bite this infected person whereupon they get infected themselves and then bite someone else, there is possibility for transmission.

We have not had currently another outbreak like the one in San Cristobal,\" said Freddy Hidalgo.\n\nHe indicated that isolated chikungunya cases have appeared in Puerto Plata ad San Pedro, because these cities have people who have come from Nigua in San Crisobal [province]. \"We expect that the virus can continue to move, but we continue working with the people in prevention tasks,\" he added. Freddy Hidalgo explained that to the extent that people move from one city to another, the virus can too, \"but we are alert to contain new outbreaks.\" The official explained that when a person has become infected with the virus and goes from one place to another, there is risk that the person will be bitten by a mosquito that will then bite another person and infect them.\n\n\"The mosquito is present in different localities to which one might move, and because of this, we are working to avoid dissemination of the virus, that [in turn], moves with the [infected] people. We are not immune, nor is there a vaccine, so we are susceptible to being affected by the virus,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed to the public that water stored on the patios of their houses should be in containers previously treated with bleach. He also asked for general collaboration by the populace for the elimination of water catchments that could contain clean water from their patios.\n\n[Byline: Adriana Peguero]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[New cases are appearing in various parts of the Dominican Republic, especially on the south coast.

However, the 25 Apr 2014 edition of Sierra Vision (http://sierravision.com.do/alcanza-a-4-provincias-virus-de-chikungunya/) indicated that there are outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in 4 provinces. The localities with the most cases are: San Pedro, Nigua, Haina and Boca Chica (which had 76 cases in the past 72 hours). The 25 Apr 2014 edition of Dominican Today (http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2014/4/25/51271/Public-Healths-cavalry-battles-chikungunya-fever-at-Boca-Chica) stated that the Public Health Ministry has deployed as of Friday [25 Apr 2014] its entire \"cavalry\" to fumigate Boca Chica, as the rising cases of chikungunya fever have panicked the resort town's population. Fumigation will have limited effect on transmission unless vector mosquito breeding sites are treated or eliminated. Barahona province has also had \"dozens of suspected cases,\" according to a 26 Apr 2014 report in Al Momento (http://www.almomento.net/articulo/161688/BARAHONA-Casos-sospechosos-de-fiebre-Chikungunya), although the occurrence of suspected cases in Barahona is denied in another report (http://www.resumendesalud.com/do/index.php/categoria-infectologia/7893-en-algunas-localidades-no-se-han-registrado-casos-de-chikungunya).

He is now back on the job, Jn Baptiste said.\n\n\"So far, we have done the investigations. We have not yet confirmed any other case that has been transmitted from that imported case. We also have another suspected case of a foreigner, someone who started to present signs and symptoms yesterday [22 Apr 2014],\" he said.\n\nJn Baptiste said the ministry continues to strengthen its surveillance system and will continue to send samples to the Caribbean Public Health Agency for testing every week.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the 1st confirmed case of chikungunya [virus infection] a few weeks ago, the Ministry of Health said it had intensified mosquito-control efforts to lessen the impact of a chikungunya outbreak on the island.

Antigua and Barbuda health officials on Friday [25 Apr 2014] held a news conference to confirm that an individual in his mid 60s had become the island's 1st case.\n\nMedical Officer of Health Dr Orita Zachariah told reporters that the case had been detected on 22 Apr [2014], and the victim, between the ages of 60 and 65, works in the capital, St John's.\n\nThe health authorities say they are also awaiting results of 4 other suspected cases from the Trinidad-based Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) [laboratories].\n\nDr Zachariah said that persons should remain home if they suspect they have the disease, while Chief health Inspector Lionel Michael said the Department of Health would increase vector control in a bid to prevent a spread of the disease.\n\nOn Thu 24 Apr 2014, the Ministry of Health in St Vincent and the Grenadines declared an outbreak of the virus after 3 cases were confirmed on the northern Grenadine island of Bequia.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[The 24 Apr 2014 edition of I-Witness News (http://www.iwnsvg.com/2014/04/24/update-health-minister-declares-outbreak-of-chikungunya-in-st-vincent/) indicated that cases of chikungunya on Bequia were 1st suspected last week, Mon 14 Apr 2014.

The Ministry of Health announced the 1st and only confirmed case of the disease earlier this month [April 2014].\n\nChief Epidemiologist Nahum Jn Baptiste told Saint Lucia News Online (SNO) in an interview that as of today, 23 Apr 2014, 10 suspected cases have surfaced -- one as recent as yesterday -- involving a foreigner, but none have been confirmed.\n\nA 63-year-old fisherman, who was the 1st individual confirmed to have contracted the virus, has been treated and is fully recovered. He is now back on the job, Jn Baptiste said.\n\n\"So far, we have done the investigations. We have not yet confirmed any other case that has been transmitted from that imported case. We also have another suspected case of a foreigner, someone who started to present signs and symptoms yesterday [22 Apr 2014],\" he said.\n\nJn Baptiste said the ministry continues to strengthen its surveillance system and will continue to send samples to the Caribbean Public Health Agency for testing every week.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the 1st confirmed case of chikungunya [virus infection] a few weeks ago, the Ministry of Health said it had intensified mosquito-control efforts to lessen the impact of a chikungunya outbreak on the island. Officials say the impact of the disease all depends on whether suitable conditions exist for _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes to breed, since they transmit the disease [virus].\n\nPeople suffering with the illness will mainly feel chronic pain in the joints, and although it will not require being admitted to a hospital, there will be prolonged pain or swelling in the joints.\n\n\"As long as we have an infected person and the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is around and they can bite this infected person whereupon they get infected themselves and then bite someone else, there is possibility for transmission. We of course are zooming in on our index case and looking at his surroundings and the persons in his household and places he frequents to ensure we have some focus intervention there as well,\" Chief Medical Officer Dr. Merlene Fredericks said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[A map showing the location of St. Lucia can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] PAHO/WHO report\nDate: Fri 25 Apr 2014\nSource: PAHO/WHO [edited]\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=25294&Itemid=\u3008=en\n\n\nCountry / Week / Suspected cases / Confirmed cases / Deaths\nLatin Caribbean\nDominican Republic / 14 / 3015 / 17 / 0\nFrench Guiana / 16 / 0 / 52 / 0\nGuadeloupe / 16 / 6000 / 1328 / 1\nMartinique / 16 / 17 630 / 1515 / 2\nSt Barthelemy / 16 / 480 / 135 / 0\nSt Martin / 16 / 3030 / 793 / 3\n\nNon-Latin Caribbean\nAnguilla / 13 / 0 / 33 / 0\nAruba / 6 / 0 / 1 / 0\nDominica / 16 / 1252 / 105 / 0\nSt Kitts and Nevis / 8 / 0 / 1 / 0\nSt Lucia 13 / 0 / 1 / 0\nSt Vincent & the Grenadines 17 / 24 / 3 / 0\nSt Maarten / 12 / 0 / 123 / 0\nBritish Virgin Islands / 11 / 0 / 9 / 0\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands can be accessed at http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/caribnew.gif, and at http://healthmap.org/promed/?p=35575. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] French Antilles and Guiana\nDate: 14-20 Apr 2014\nSource: InVS Point Epidemiologique No. 15 [in French, trans.

The Ministry of Health announced the 1st and only confirmed case of the disease earlier this month [April 2014].\n\nChief Epidemiologist Nahum Jn Baptiste told Saint Lucia News Online (SNO) in an interview that as of today, 23 Apr 2014, 10 suspected cases have surfaced -- one as recent as yesterday -- involving a foreigner, but none have been confirmed.\n\nA 63-year-old fisherman, who was the 1st individual confirmed to have contracted the virus, has been treated and is fully recovered. He is now back on the job, Jn Baptiste said.\n\n\"So far, we have done the investigations. We have not yet confirmed any other case that has been transmitted from that imported case. We also have another suspected case of a foreigner, someone who started to present signs and symptoms yesterday [22 Apr 2014],\" he said.\n\nJn Baptiste said the ministry continues to strengthen its surveillance system and will continue to send samples to the Caribbean Public Health Agency for testing every week.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the 1st confirmed case of chikungunya [virus infection] a few weeks ago, the Ministry of Health said it had intensified mosquito-control efforts to lessen the impact of a chikungunya outbreak on the island. Officials say the impact of the disease all depends on whether suitable conditions exist for _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes to breed, since they transmit the disease [virus].\n\nPeople suffering with the illness will mainly feel chronic pain in the joints, and although it will not require being admitted to a hospital, there will be prolonged pain or swelling in the joints.\n\n\"As long as we have an infected person and the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is around and they can bite this infected person whereupon they get infected themselves and then bite someone else, there is possibility for transmission. We of course are zooming in on our index case and looking at his surroundings and the persons in his household and places he frequents to ensure we have some focus intervention there as well,\" Chief Medical Officer Dr. Merlene Fredericks said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[A map showing the location of St. Lucia can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] PAHO/WHO report\nDate: Fri 25 Apr 2014\nSource: PAHO/WHO [edited]\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=25294&Itemid=\u3008=en\n\n\nCountry / Week / Suspected cases / Confirmed cases / Deaths\nLatin Caribbean\nDominican Republic / 14 / 3015 / 17 / 0\nFrench Guiana / 16 / 0 / 52 / 0\nGuadeloupe / 16 / 6000 / 1328 / 1\nMartinique / 16 / 17 630 / 1515 / 2\nSt Barthelemy / 16 / 480 / 135 / 0\nSt Martin / 16 / 3030 / 793 / 3\n\nNon-Latin Caribbean\nAnguilla / 13 / 0 / 33 / 0\nAruba / 6 / 0 / 1 / 0\nDominica / 16 / 1252 / 105 / 0\nSt Kitts and Nevis / 8 / 0 / 1 / 0\nSt Lucia 13 / 0 / 1 / 0\nSt Vincent & the Grenadines 17 / 24 / 3 / 0\nSt Maarten / 12 / 0 / 123 / 0\nBritish Virgin Islands / 11 / 0 / 9 / 0\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands can be accessed at http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/caribnew.gif, and at http://healthmap.org/promed/?p=35575. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] French Antilles and Guiana\nDate: 14-20 Apr 2014\nSource: InVS Point Epidemiologique No. 15 [in French, trans.

We have not had currently another outbreak like the one in San Cristobal,\" said Freddy Hidalgo.\n\nHe indicated that isolated chikungunya cases have appeared in Puerto Plata ad San Pedro, because these cities have people who have come from Nigua in San Crisobal [province]. \"We expect that the virus can continue to move, but we continue working with the people in prevention tasks,\" he added. Freddy Hidalgo explained that to the extent that people move from one city to another, the virus can too, \"but we are alert to contain new outbreaks.\" The official explained that when a person has become infected with the virus and goes from one place to another, there is risk that the person will be bitten by a mosquito that will then bite another person and infect them.\n\n\"The mosquito is present in different localities to which one might move, and because of this, we are working to avoid dissemination of the virus, that [in turn], moves with the [infected] people. We are not immune, nor is there a vaccine, so we are susceptible to being affected by the virus,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed to the public that water stored on the patios of their houses should be in containers previously treated with bleach. He also asked for general collaboration by the populace for the elimination of water catchments that could contain clean water from their patios.\n\n[Byline: Adriana Peguero]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[New cases are appearing in various parts of the Dominican Republic, especially on the south coast.

Dengue virus serotype 4 and chikungunya virus coinfection in a traveller returning from Luanda, Angola, January 2014. Euro Surveill. 2014;19(10):pii=20730\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSummary:\nA concurrent dengue virus [DENV] serotype 4 and chikungunya virus [CHIKV] infection was detected in a woman in her early 50s returning to Portugal from Luanda, Angola, in January 2014. The clinical, laboratory and molecular findings, involving phylogenetic analyses of partial viral genomic sequences amplified by RT-PCR, are described. Although the circulation of both dengue and chikungunya viruses in Angola has been previously reported, to our knowledge this is the 1st time coinfection with both viruses has been detected there.\n\nBackground [summarized]:\nAlthough CHIKV/DENV coinfections were 1st reported in India in 1967 [13] and later confirmed in Sri Lanka (2008), Malaysia (2010) and Gabon (2007) [14-16], these coinfections are rarely notified.\n\nDiscussion:\nSerological reports from the 1960s, the detection of DENV in travellers returning from Angola in the 1980s, and the detection of DENV1 and DENV2 in travellers in the 1980s and in 1999-2002 suggest endemic DENV activity in Angola. As far as CHIKV is concerned, the situation is a lot less clear. However, serological studies from the 1960s not only identified the presence of anti-CHIKV neutralising antibodies in the north of the country, but also allowed the isolation of 2 strains from a viraemic individual and wild-caught mosquitoes during an outbreak of Katolu Tolu (Kimbundu dialect for 'break-bone disease'), a dengue-like disease caused by the CHIKV, which occurred in Luanda in 1970.\n\nThe detection of DENV4 in the recent traveller is of interest, given that on 1 Apr 2013, the Angolan health authorities reported a dengue outbreak in the country, which was later shown to have been caused by DENV1, and the current description of DENV4 in Luanda may indicate the circulation of multiple DENV subtypes in the country.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The occurrence of dual DENV and CHIKV infections in an individual is clearly a rare event. With the infected woman's return to Portugal in January, a time of no vector activity, there was little chance of her being a virus source for ongoing transmission. Had either or both infections occurred during the warm season, the consequences might have been different had the infected individual landed in a locality where _Aedes_ mosquitoes were abundant and active, as happened with the introduction of dengue virus into Madeira Island in 2013 (see ProMED-mail archives cited below).\n\nMaps of Angola can be accessed at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf and http://healthmap.org/r/1iGj. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\n2013\n----\nDengue/DHF update (64): Asia, Africa 20130805.1863726\nDengue/DHF update (54): Asia, Africa 20130701.1800463\nDengue/DHF update (52): Asia, Indian Ocean, Africa 20130624.1788185\nDengue/DHF update (46): Asia, Africa 20130603.1751357\nDengue/DHF update (44): Asia, Africa 20130527.1739445\nDengue/DHF update (40): Asia, Africa 20130521.1727082\nDengue/DHF update (38): Asia, Africa, Middle East, Pacific 20130512.1707139\nDengue/DHF update (31): Asia, Africa, Pacific 20130420.1660193\nDengue/DHF update (30): Asia, Africa, Pacific 20130415.1645892\n.................................................mpp/ty/je/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["chikungunya", "dengue"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2014-01-15 00:00:00", "2014-01-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "1967-03-15 00:00:00", "2010-03-15 00:00:00", "2007-03-15 00:00:00", "1970-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-01-15 00:00:00", "2013-03-15 00:00:00", "2064-03-15 00:00:00", "2054-03-15 00:00:00", "2052-03-15 00:00:00", "2046-03-15 00:00:00", "2044-03-15 00:00:00", "2040-03-15 00:00:00", "2038-03-15 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Angolan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Portugal", "country": "Portugal"}, {"location": "Angola", "country": "Angola"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "Malaysia"}, {"location": "Luanda", "country": "Angola"}, {"location": "Sri Lanka", "country": "Sri Lanka"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2409660", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Chikungunya (27): Tonga, New Caledonia ex Tonga", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2409660", "date": "2014-03-17 20:09:13", "main_text": "DENGUE & CHIKUNGUNYA CO-INFECTION - PORTUGAL ex ANGOLA\n******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 13 Mar 2014\nSource: Eurosurveillance Volume 19, Issue 10 [summ., edited]\nhttp://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20730\n\n\nParreira R, Centeno-Lima S, Lopes A, Portugal-Calisto D, Constantino A, Nina J.

Dengue virus serotype 4 and chikungunya virus coinfection in a traveller returning from Luanda, Angola, January 2014. Euro Surveill. 2014;19(10):pii=20730\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSummary:\nA concurrent dengue virus [DENV] serotype 4 and chikungunya virus [CHIKV] infection was detected in a woman in her early 50s returning to Portugal from Luanda, Angola, in January 2014. The clinical, laboratory and molecular findings, involving phylogenetic analyses of partial viral genomic sequences amplified by RT-PCR, are described. Although the circulation of both dengue and chikungunya viruses in Angola has been previously reported, to our knowledge this is the 1st time coinfection with both viruses has been detected there.\n\nBackground [summarized]:\nAlthough CHIKV/DENV coinfections were 1st reported in India in 1967 [13] and later confirmed in Sri Lanka (2008), Malaysia (2010) and Gabon (2007) [14-16], these coinfections are rarely notified.\n\nDiscussion:\nSerological reports from the 1960s, the detection of DENV in travellers returning from Angola in the 1980s, and the detection of DENV1 and DENV2 in travellers in the 1980s and in 1999-2002 suggest endemic DENV activity in Angola. As far as CHIKV is concerned, the situation is a lot less clear. However, serological studies from the 1960s not only identified the presence of anti-CHIKV neutralising antibodies in the north of the country, but also allowed the isolation of 2 strains from a viraemic individual and wild-caught mosquitoes during an outbreak of Katolu Tolu (Kimbundu dialect for 'break-bone disease'), a dengue-like disease caused by the CHIKV, which occurred in Luanda in 1970.\n\nThe detection of DENV4 in the recent traveller is of interest, given that on 1 Apr 2013, the Angolan health authorities reported a dengue outbreak in the country, which was later shown to have been caused by DENV1, and the current description of DENV4 in Luanda may indicate the circulation of multiple DENV subtypes in the country.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The occurrence of dual DENV and CHIKV infections in an individual is clearly a rare event.

On 20 Dec 2013, about 50 confirmed cases were reported with additional evidence for autochthonous transmission on Martinique island. In January 2014, autochthonous cases have been reported also from Guadeloupe, Saint Barthelemy, Dominica, and the British Virgin Islands.\n\n_Aedes aegypti_ is the unique potential vector locally. The full-length viral RNA genome was characterised directly from the serum of 2 viraemic patients using next-generation sequencing methods. The virus does not belong to the ECSA genotype but to the Asian genotype, identified in late 1950s in southeast Asian countries. It is phylogenetically related to strains recently identified in Asia (in Indonesia in 2007, in China in 2012, and in the Philippines in 2013), most of them sharing a specific 4-amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene. The virus is only distantly related to the Asian genotype virus that recently circulated in New Caledonia, which harbours different amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene.\n\nThis episode represents the 1st evidence for the emergence of autochthonous chikungunya cases in the Americas. It is likely that the chikungunya epidemic will extend to other Caribbean islands, and it also has substantial potential for spreading from this region visited yearly by millions of tourists to the American mainland where _A. aegypti_ is endemic. Assuming that this strain will be transmitted efficiently by _A. albopictus_ mosquitoes, its persistence in the Caribbean would also represent, as a consequence of seasonal synchronicity, a great threat for southern European countries where the mosquito has recently dispersed.

On 20 Dec 2013, about 50 confirmed cases were reported with additional evidence for autochthonous transmission on Martinique island. In January 2014, autochthonous cases have been reported also from Guadeloupe, Saint Barthelemy, Dominica, and the British Virgin Islands.\n\n_Aedes aegypti_ is the unique potential vector locally. The full-length viral RNA genome was characterised directly from the serum of 2 viraemic patients using next-generation sequencing methods. The virus does not belong to the ECSA genotype but to the Asian genotype, identified in late 1950s in southeast Asian countries. It is phylogenetically related to strains recently identified in Asia (in Indonesia in 2007, in China in 2012, and in the Philippines in 2013), most of them sharing a specific 4-amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene. The virus is only distantly related to the Asian genotype virus that recently circulated in New Caledonia, which harbours different amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene.\n\nThis episode represents the 1st evidence for the emergence of autochthonous chikungunya cases in the Americas. It is likely that the chikungunya epidemic will extend to other Caribbean islands, and it also has substantial potential for spreading from this region visited yearly by millions of tourists to the American mainland where _A. aegypti_ is endemic. Assuming that this strain will be transmitted efficiently by _A. albopictus_ mosquitoes, its persistence in the Caribbean would also represent, as a consequence of seasonal synchronicity, a great threat for southern European countries where the mosquito has recently dispersed.

On 20 Dec 2013, about 50 confirmed cases were reported with additional evidence for autochthonous transmission on Martinique island. In January 2014, autochthonous cases have been reported also from Guadeloupe, Saint Barthelemy, Dominica, and the British Virgin Islands.\n\n_Aedes aegypti_ is the unique potential vector locally. The full-length viral RNA genome was characterised directly from the serum of 2 viraemic patients using next-generation sequencing methods. The virus does not belong to the ECSA genotype but to the Asian genotype, identified in late 1950s in southeast Asian countries. It is phylogenetically related to strains recently identified in Asia (in Indonesia in 2007, in China in 2012, and in the Philippines in 2013), most of them sharing a specific 4-amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene. The virus is only distantly related to the Asian genotype virus that recently circulated in New Caledonia, which harbours different amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene.\n\nThis episode represents the 1st evidence for the emergence of autochthonous chikungunya cases in the Americas. It is likely that the chikungunya epidemic will extend to other Caribbean islands, and it also has substantial potential for spreading from this region visited yearly by millions of tourists to the American mainland where _A. aegypti_ is endemic. Assuming that this strain will be transmitted efficiently by _A. albopictus_ mosquitoes, its persistence in the Caribbean would also represent, as a consequence of seasonal synchronicity, a great threat for southern European countries where the mosquito has recently dispersed.

On 20 Dec 2013, about 50 confirmed cases were reported with additional evidence for autochthonous transmission on Martinique island. In January 2014, autochthonous cases have been reported also from Guadeloupe, Saint Barthelemy, Dominica, and the British Virgin Islands.\n\n_Aedes aegypti_ is the unique potential vector locally. The full-length viral RNA genome was characterised directly from the serum of 2 viraemic patients using next-generation sequencing methods. The virus does not belong to the ECSA genotype but to the Asian genotype, identified in late 1950s in southeast Asian countries. It is phylogenetically related to strains recently identified in Asia (in Indonesia in 2007, in China in 2012, and in the Philippines in 2013), most of them sharing a specific 4-amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene. The virus is only distantly related to the Asian genotype virus that recently circulated in New Caledonia, which harbours different amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene.\n\nThis episode represents the 1st evidence for the emergence of autochthonous chikungunya cases in the Americas. It is likely that the chikungunya epidemic will extend to other Caribbean islands, and it also has substantial potential for spreading from this region visited yearly by millions of tourists to the American mainland where _A. aegypti_ is endemic. Assuming that this strain will be transmitted efficiently by _A. albopictus_ mosquitoes, its persistence in the Caribbean would also represent, as a consequence of seasonal synchronicity, a great threat for southern European countries where the mosquito has recently dispersed. This situation warrants reinforced epidemiological surveillance and specific preparedness.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n******\n[2] Dominica\nDate: Fri 7 Feb 2014\nSource: Dominica News [edited]\nhttp://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/health/thirteen-cases-chikungunya-dominica/\n\n\nThere are now a total of 13 confirmed cases of the mosquitoborne [virus] disease, chikungunya, in Dominica. Senior environmental health officer, Sylvester St Ville, made the announcement on state-owned DBS Radio on Friday [7 Feb 2014] and said the matter is disturbing. \"It's a major concern for the health care system, but it's something that we are trying to manage,\" he said. \"As of our latest report, there are 13 confirmed cases.\" He said the cases are mainly in the Woodfordhill and Bath Estate areas. \"They are confined to those 2 communities,\" he remarked.\n\nSt Ville pointed out that the environmental health department is currently undertaking preventative measures to reduce the spread the disease. \"Presently we are in Bath Estate doing some source reduction and vector control activities ... this evening (Friday [7 Feb 2014]) we will be doing some fogging operations to reduce the population of adults in these communities,\" he pointed out.\n\nHe said the department will also be removing discarded white goods [stoves, fridges, washing machines and other household appliances] in the Bath Estate area since they provide breeding areas for mosquitos. St Ville is calling on residents to play their part by covering water sources, emptying water containers, among other things, in efforts to control the breeding of mosquitos.\n\nChikungunya is a viral disease, carried mainly by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, that causes a dengue-like sickness. Symptoms include a sudden high fever, severe pain in the wrists, ankles or knuckles, muscle pain, headache, nausea and rash.

It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common.\n\nThere is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms.\n\nThe proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya [virus infections].\n\nThe disease occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. In recent decades mosquito vectors of chikungunya have spread to Europe and the Americas.

From the blood sample, dengue NS-1 antigen was detected by immunochromatographic test [Bio-Rad Dengue NS1 Antigen Strip test] and virus specific gene by RT-PCR (TaqMan; both types 1 and 4 dengue virus).

The areas around the joints become swollen and painful to touch, a Center for Health Development - Western Visayas advisory said.\n\nSuch prolonged joint pain and fatigue associated with chikungunya fever are not typical of dengue. A rash may sometimes occur but hemorrhaging is rare, it added.\n\nTime from the infected bite to the onset of illness can be 2 to 12 days, but usually it is 3 to 7 days, the advisory said.\n\nIf you have chikungunya fever symptoms, see a doctor, it advised.\n\nCurrently, there is no specific drug treatment against chikungunya fever but proper and early treatment with bed rest and sufficient intake of fluids is recommended, the advisory said. Aspirin and ibuprofen should be avoided as they are known to increase the risk of bleeding, while paracetamol can be given on medical advice, the advisory added.\n\nTo avoid mosquito bites, one should wear full-sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbs, and use repellants, but care should be taken in using them on small children and the elderly, it added.\n\nIt also advised the use of mosquito nets to protect babies and old people, who may rest during the day.\n\nMosquito nets and coils will effectively prevent mosquitoes from biting sick people and help stop the spread of chikungunya fever [virus], the advisory also said.\n\nTumimbang reiterated the call for the public to remove possible mosquito breeding places such as containers with stagnant water to prevent the spread of dengue and Chikungunya.\n\n[Byline: Carla Gomez]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Camarines Norte province\nDate: Sat 20 Jul 2013\nSources: Balita [edited]\nhttp://balita.ph/2013/07/20/doh-warns-public-on-chikungunya-dengue-this-rainy-season/\n\nThe Department of Health (DOH) regional office in Bicol has warned the public against chikungunya and dengue diseases.\n\nDOH Regional Director Gloria Balboa issued the warning after an outbreak of chikungunya occurred in Sta.

The areas around the joints become swollen and painful to touch, a Center for Health Development - Western Visayas advisory said.\n\nSuch prolonged joint pain and fatigue associated with chikungunya fever are not typical of dengue. A rash may sometimes occur but hemorrhaging is rare, it added.\n\nTime from the infected bite to the onset of illness can be 2 to 12 days, but usually it is 3 to 7 days, the advisory said.\n\nIf you have chikungunya fever symptoms, see a doctor, it advised.\n\nCurrently, there is no specific drug treatment against chikungunya fever but proper and early treatment with bed rest and sufficient intake of fluids is recommended, the advisory said. Aspirin and ibuprofen should be avoided as they are known to increase the risk of bleeding, while paracetamol can be given on medical advice, the advisory added.\n\nTo avoid mosquito bites, one should wear full-sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbs, and use repellants, but care should be taken in using them on small children and the elderly, it added.\n\nIt also advised the use of mosquito nets to protect babies and old people, who may rest during the day.\n\nMosquito nets and coils will effectively prevent mosquitoes from biting sick people and help stop the spread of chikungunya fever [virus], the advisory also said.\n\nTumimbang reiterated the call for the public to remove possible mosquito breeding places such as containers with stagnant water to prevent the spread of dengue and Chikungunya.\n\n[Byline: Carla Gomez]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Camarines Norte province\nDate: Sat 20 Jul 2013\nSources: Balita [edited]\nhttp://balita.ph/2013/07/20/doh-warns-public-on-chikungunya-dengue-this-rainy-season/\n\nThe Department of Health (DOH) regional office in Bicol has warned the public against chikungunya and dengue diseases.\n\nDOH Regional Director Gloria Balboa issued the warning after an outbreak of chikungunya occurred in Sta. Elena, Camarines Norte, with a total of 300 infected persons brought to hospitals.\n\n\"We have already deployed our surveillance team in the areas believed to be with high number of chikungunya cases to conduct an assessment and evaluation,\" Balboa said.\n\nShe urged the public to observe cleanliness, especially this rainy season, and remove all potential mosquito breeding sites.\n\nThe DOH official advised the public to consult doctors or bring their patients to a clinic or hospital if they observe symptoms of chikungunya. \"It is a viral disease which is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes -- including _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Symptoms appear between 4 and 7 days after the patient has been bitten by the infected mosquito,\" Balboa explained.\n\nShe urged barangay and school officials to conduct a massive clean-up drive. \"This is the immediate counter-measure to prevent possible chikungunya outbreak,\" Balboa added.\n\nAccording to her, chikungunya [virus infection] symptoms are generally self-limiting and last for 2-3 days. The virus remains in the human system for 5-7 days and mosquitoes feeding on an infected person during this period can also become infected, Balboa said.\n\nChikungunya shares some clinical signs with dengue and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common. Dengue is also another threat to public this rainy season, Balboa said. \"Both dengue and chikungunya are fatal, and we need a strong counter-measure to prevent the spread of these diseases brought by mosquitoes,\" she stressed.

Most patients recover fully, but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months, or even years,\" the article continues.\n\n\"The name 'chikungunya' derives from a root verb in the Kimakonde language, meaning 'to become contorted,' and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pains.\"\n\nAturdido said that although the responsibility to address this concern rests primarily on the local government unit of Tampakan, the IPHO is ready to extend help.\n\nHe emphasized, however, that since the disease's source and means of transmission is similar to dengue, prevention of its spread is also largely dependent on community efforts.\n\n\"What is required is to strictly follow the 4S strategy,\" Aturdido said.\n\n4S anti-dengue strategy consists of the following: Search and destroy; Self-protection measures; Seek early consultation; and Say no to indiscriminate fogging.\n\nIn January this year [2013], Department of Health (DOH) 12 reported that 57 cases were clinically diagnosed from Sarangani Province. The number consisted of 35 cases from Kiamba and 22 from Maitum.\n\nAccording to DOH, Chikungunya cases have also been reported in Metro Manila, Laguna, Pangasinan and other parts of Mindanao.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Chikungunya virus is endemic in the Philippines, so this type of small outbreak, and the one below, are not surprising.

Another person was bitten by a mosquito in Indonesia before flying to Queensland.\n\nThe majority of the 11 affected are Australian citizens but almost half of them live outside far north Queensland.\n\nTropical Public Health Services director Dr Richard Gair says the PNG outbreak is recent and could lead to an outbreak in far north Queensland.\n\nHe says this is because the same type of mosquitoes that carry the virus live in both areas.\n\n\"Every import is a potential outbreak,\" he said. \"If you get bitten when you're still infectious, that mosquito can go and bite someone else.\"\n\nNo one has been infected by chikungunya [virus] while in Australia.\n\nThose who have chikungunya [virus infections] experience the same symptoms as [those with] dengue fever, and both diseases are spread by the same mosquitoes.\n\n\"The difference between them is that with chikungunya we might well see the transmission happening quite a bit faster,\" Mr Gair said. \"There is less time between cases so it is harder to control.\"\n\nSince January [2013] there have been about 170 cases of dengue in the Cairns region.\n\nChikungunya [virus] was 1st found in East Africa about 50 years ago but has only recently spread to countries close to Australia.\n\nMr Gair says the best way to eliminate both chikungunya and dengue is to get rid of mosquito breeding sites, such as pots of water around properties.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There is a very real risk of ongoing chikungunya virus transmission in northern Queensland. As the above report mentions, the mosquito vectors of the virus are present there and transmitting dengue virus.\n\nImportation of chikungunya virus into Australia is not surprising. There is an ongoing chikungunya virus outbreak on Papua New Guinea this year (2013) and there was a significant outbreak on the main island of Papua New Guinea last year (2012). From June to October 2012, a total of 633 patients suspected of having symptoms of chikungunya were reported from Vanimo hospital. The outbreak was localized to the town vicinity and its satellite communities (see ProMED-mail archive no 20121010.1335814).\n\nThe above report does not indicate where in Indonesia the single chikungunya virus infection was acquired.

Cerro, DoH-8 regional sentinel nurse, said 235 people in Barangay Banquil and 28 in Guintarcan Island in Samar showed symptoms of the disease.\n\n\"The disease was reported by the municipal health office in November [2012]. They raised an alarm over the quick spread of the disease in December last year [2012] and early this month [January 2013],\" he said.\n\nHe said 12 of the 28 cases reported in Guintarcan Island were confirmed to be chikungunya [virus infections] based on laboratory results from the Regional Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).\n\nChikungunya, a dengue-like disease, has also been reported in Northern Mindanao, Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, National Capital Region, Calabarzon, Bicol, Western Visayas, Davao and Caraga.\n\nMr. Cerro said chikungunya causes fever and a skin rash similar to dengue and mostly affects adults. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), chikungunya is a viral disease spread by mosquitoes that causes fever and severe joint pain. Its symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rashes.\n\nSigns and symptoms include an abrupt onset of fever, frequently accompanied by joint pain. Illness usually occurs 4-8 days after a mosquito bite and can range from 2-12 days.\n\n\"There is no cure for the disease, and treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. Although it is not as deadly as dengue, patients are advised to seek immediate medical help,\" Mr. Cerro said.\n\n[Byline: Reyan L.

Among those 312 persons, 173 (55.4 per cent) took leave from school or work. One death during that period was identified retrospectively in a woman aged 33 years with no known underlying disease. The woman had fever and intense joint pain, developed neurologic signs, and died within 2 hours of hospital admission. No samples were available for testing. Her 2 children were symptomatic, CHIKV IgM-positive, and seronegative for dengue and JEV.\n\nMAC-ELISA tests identified CHIKV IgM in 188 (44.2 per cent) of the 425 persons. Of the 6 febrile persons, venous blood samples could be analyzed from 4: 2 had positive PCR results for CHIKV, bringing the total that were laboratory confirmed to 190 (44.7 per cent) CHIKV-positives. One person with fever and joint pains was positive for DENV-4. PCR results found traces of _Plasmodium_ spp. nucleic acid indicative of incubating or recent malaria in one afebrile person. Of the 190 CHIKV-positive persons identified, 10 (5.3 per cent) reported having none of the 3 defining symptoms.\n\nThe onset of the epidemic was protracted. Among 140 persons with self-reported fever who recalled an onset date and who had positive results for CHIKV (IgM or PCR), most reported onset occurring approximately 3-5 weeks after a 2-day period of rain. The epidemic curve suggested that the CHIKV outbreak began 3 weeks after the rains, lasted about 3 weeks, and was on the verge of ending when this serosurvey was conducted on 26 Mar 2012.\n\nLaboratory results were analyzed by age group. The analysis revealed a 40 per cent IgM seroprevalence among persons aged 5 years and under; for persons aged 6-45 years, IgM seroprevalence was approximately 50 per cent, declining sharply for each age group after that. Circulation of at least 2 other viruses was identified, including 11 cases of DENV, 7 cases of JEV, and 15 cases of undistinguishable flaviviruses (among these, 10, 4, and 8 cases, respectively, occurred among CHIKV-positive cases).\n\n[Reported by: Sowath Ly, PhD, Sopheak Sorn, MA, Arnaud Tarantola, MD, Epidemiology and Public Health Unit; Lydie Canier, MSc, Molecular Epidemiology and Malariology Unit; Philippe Buchy, PhD, Veasna Duong, PhD, Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

It is the 1st CHIKV serosurvey in Cambodia since the initial isolation of CHIKV in 1961 and the 1st known serosurvey conducted during a chikungunya outbreak in Southeast Asia. The experience of at least one symptom since the rains arrived was reported by 73.4 per cent of interviewees. CHIKV prevalence was 44.7 per cent, and the prevalence of asymptomatic CHIKV infection was 5.3 per cent. A temporal association was noted between an unusually large rainfall on 13-14 Feb [2012] and the subsequent outbreak of cases of CHIKV beginning 3 weeks later and lasting for 3 weeks.\n\nMost persons who were CHIKV-positive cases had clinical signs and symptoms consistent with chikungunya. The level of seroprevalence in this outbreak is consistent with levels from CHIKV serosurveys conducted during outbreaks on Reunion Island (35 per cent) and Mayotte (38-45 per cent), but lower than that of Lamu Island, Kenya (75 per cent). Seroprevalence was lower in persons aged 45 years or older. This might be the result of immunity acquired when the CHIKV Asian strain circulated in Cambodia in the 1960s. The only other published CHIKV serologic study from the Mekong region was conducted in the Bangkok area in 1998-1999, before the emergence of the East/Central/South African genotype. In that study, the prevalence in mothers (using cord blood) was 31.6 percent and 45 percent in women aged over 35 years. This new genotype, which emerged in Africa in 2004 and is emerging in Cambodia, is well known to have an E226V mutation that is more efficiently transmitted by _Ae. albopictus_.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. First, co-circulating arboviruses (i.e., dengue and JEV) share the same vector and cause similar symptoms. Some symptoms might have been caused by dengue or JEV infection. Some of the clinical cases, therefore, could have been caused by undetected viruses other than CHIKV, and this could explain why clinical cases outnumbered laboratory-confirmed cases. Second, CHIKV IgM seroprevalence might have been underestimated because of suboptimal sensitivity of tests performed on dried blood spots. Third, IgM screening might miss infection still in the incubation period. Finally, the presence of a large team of medical investigators in a rural village might have stimulated over-reporting of symptoms. These also might account for the difference between the clinical attack rate and CHIKV IgM-positive prevalence (approximately 30 per cent).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There was an earlier chikungunya epidemic reported in Cambodia this year (2012), but the locations of cases in the country were not specified (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120519.1138336).

Among those 312 persons, 173 (55.4 per cent) took leave from school or work. One death during that period was identified retrospectively in a woman aged 33 years with no known underlying disease. The woman had fever and intense joint pain, developed neurologic signs, and died within 2 hours of hospital admission. No samples were available for testing. Her 2 children were symptomatic, CHIKV IgM-positive, and seronegative for dengue and JEV.\n\nMAC-ELISA tests identified CHIKV IgM in 188 (44.2 per cent) of the 425 persons. Of the 6 febrile persons, venous blood samples could be analyzed from 4: 2 had positive PCR results for CHIKV, bringing the total that were laboratory confirmed to 190 (44.7 per cent) CHIKV-positives. One person with fever and joint pains was positive for DENV-4. PCR results found traces of _Plasmodium_ spp. nucleic acid indicative of incubating or recent malaria in one afebrile person. Of the 190 CHIKV-positive persons identified, 10 (5.3 per cent) reported having none of the 3 defining symptoms.\n\nThe onset of the epidemic was protracted. Among 140 persons with self-reported fever who recalled an onset date and who had positive results for CHIKV (IgM or PCR), most reported onset occurring approximately 3-5 weeks after a 2-day period of rain. The epidemic curve suggested that the CHIKV outbreak began 3 weeks after the rains, lasted about 3 weeks, and was on the verge of ending when this serosurvey was conducted on 26 Mar 2012.\n\nLaboratory results were analyzed by age group. The analysis revealed a 40 per cent IgM seroprevalence among persons aged 5 years and under; for persons aged 6-45 years, IgM seroprevalence was approximately 50 per cent, declining sharply for each age group after that. Circulation of at least 2 other viruses was identified, including 11 cases of DENV, 7 cases of JEV, and 15 cases of undistinguishable flaviviruses (among these, 10, 4, and 8 cases, respectively, occurred among CHIKV-positive cases).\n\n[Reported by: Sowath Ly, PhD, Sopheak Sorn, MA, Arnaud Tarantola, MD, Epidemiology and Public Health Unit; Lydie Canier, MSc, Molecular Epidemiology and Malariology Unit; Philippe Buchy, PhD, Veasna Duong, PhD, Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

It is the 1st CHIKV serosurvey in Cambodia since the initial isolation of CHIKV in 1961 and the 1st known serosurvey conducted during a chikungunya outbreak in Southeast Asia. The experience of at least one symptom since the rains arrived was reported by 73.4 per cent of interviewees. CHIKV prevalence was 44.7 per cent, and the prevalence of asymptomatic CHIKV infection was 5.3 per cent. A temporal association was noted between an unusually large rainfall on 13-14 Feb [2012] and the subsequent outbreak of cases of CHIKV beginning 3 weeks later and lasting for 3 weeks.\n\nMost persons who were CHIKV-positive cases had clinical signs and symptoms consistent with chikungunya. The level of seroprevalence in this outbreak is consistent with levels from CHIKV serosurveys conducted during outbreaks on Reunion Island (35 per cent) and Mayotte (38-45 per cent), but lower than that of Lamu Island, Kenya (75 per cent). Seroprevalence was lower in persons aged 45 years or older. This might be the result of immunity acquired when the CHIKV Asian strain circulated in Cambodia in the 1960s. The only other published CHIKV serologic study from the Mekong region was conducted in the Bangkok area in 1998-1999, before the emergence of the East/Central/South African genotype. In that study, the prevalence in mothers (using cord blood) was 31.6 percent and 45 percent in women aged over 35 years. This new genotype, which emerged in Africa in 2004 and is emerging in Cambodia, is well known to have an E226V mutation that is more efficiently transmitted by _Ae. albopictus_.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. First, co-circulating arboviruses (i.e., dengue and JEV) share the same vector and cause similar symptoms. Some symptoms might have been caused by dengue or JEV infection. Some of the clinical cases, therefore, could have been caused by undetected viruses other than CHIKV, and this could explain why clinical cases outnumbered laboratory-confirmed cases. Second, CHIKV IgM seroprevalence might have been underestimated because of suboptimal sensitivity of tests performed on dried blood spots. Third, IgM screening might miss infection still in the incubation period. Finally, the presence of a large team of medical investigators in a rural village might have stimulated over-reporting of symptoms. These also might account for the difference between the clinical attack rate and CHIKV IgM-positive prevalence (approximately 30 per cent).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There was an earlier chikungunya epidemic reported in Cambodia this year (2012), but the locations of cases in the country were not specified (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120519.1138336).

Of the 6 febrile persons, venous blood samples could be analyzed from 4: 2 had positive PCR results for CHIKV, bringing the total that were laboratory confirmed to 190 (44.7 per cent) CHIKV-positives. One person with fever and joint pains was positive for DENV-4. PCR results found traces of _Plasmodium_ spp. nucleic acid indicative of incubating or recent malaria in one afebrile person. Of the 190 CHIKV-positive persons identified, 10 (5.3 per cent) reported having none of the 3 defining symptoms.\n\nThe onset of the epidemic was protracted. Among 140 persons with self-reported fever who recalled an onset date and who had positive results for CHIKV (IgM or PCR), most reported onset occurring approximately 3-5 weeks after a 2-day period of rain. The epidemic curve suggested that the CHIKV outbreak began 3 weeks after the rains, lasted about 3 weeks, and was on the verge of ending when this serosurvey was conducted on 26 Mar 2012.\n\nLaboratory results were analyzed by age group. The analysis revealed a 40 per cent IgM seroprevalence among persons aged 5 years and under; for persons aged 6-45 years, IgM seroprevalence was approximately 50 per cent, declining sharply for each age group after that. Circulation of at least 2 other viruses was identified, including 11 cases of DENV, 7 cases of JEV, and 15 cases of undistinguishable flaviviruses (among these, 10, 4, and 8 cases, respectively, occurred among CHIKV-positive cases).\n\n[Reported by: Sowath Ly, PhD, Sopheak Sorn, MA, Arnaud Tarantola, MD, Epidemiology and Public Health Unit; Lydie Canier, MSc, Molecular Epidemiology and Malariology Unit; Philippe Buchy, PhD, Veasna Duong, PhD, Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

It is the 1st CHIKV serosurvey in Cambodia since the initial isolation of CHIKV in 1961 and the 1st known serosurvey conducted during a chikungunya outbreak in Southeast Asia. The experience of at least one symptom since the rains arrived was reported by 73.4 per cent of interviewees. CHIKV prevalence was 44.7 per cent, and the prevalence of asymptomatic CHIKV infection was 5.3 per cent. A temporal association was noted between an unusually large rainfall on 13-14 Feb [2012] and the subsequent outbreak of cases of CHIKV beginning 3 weeks later and lasting for 3 weeks.\n\nMost persons who were CHIKV-positive cases had clinical signs and symptoms consistent with chikungunya. The level of seroprevalence in this outbreak is consistent with levels from CHIKV serosurveys conducted during outbreaks on Reunion Island (35 per cent) and Mayotte (38-45 per cent), but lower than that of Lamu Island, Kenya (75 per cent). Seroprevalence was lower in persons aged 45 years or older. This might be the result of immunity acquired when the CHIKV Asian strain circulated in Cambodia in the 1960s. The only other published CHIKV serologic study from the Mekong region was conducted in the Bangkok area in 1998-1999, before the emergence of the East/Central/South African genotype. In that study, the prevalence in mothers (using cord blood) was 31.6 percent and 45 percent in women aged over 35 years. This new genotype, which emerged in Africa in 2004 and is emerging in Cambodia, is well known to have an E226V mutation that is more efficiently transmitted by _Ae. albopictus_.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. First, co-circulating arboviruses (i.e., dengue and JEV) share the same vector and cause similar symptoms. Some symptoms might have been caused by dengue or JEV infection. Some of the clinical cases, therefore, could have been caused by undetected viruses other than CHIKV, and this could explain why clinical cases outnumbered laboratory-confirmed cases. Second, CHIKV IgM seroprevalence might have been underestimated because of suboptimal sensitivity of tests performed on dried blood spots. Third, IgM screening might miss infection still in the incubation period. Finally, the presence of a large team of medical investigators in a rural village might have stimulated over-reporting of symptoms. These also might account for the difference between the clinical attack rate and CHIKV IgM-positive prevalence (approximately 30 per cent).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There was an earlier chikungunya epidemic reported in Cambodia this year (2012), but the locations of cases in the country were not specified (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120519.1138336).

About 3 per cent of dengue-chikungunya cases fall under the co-infection category, with the patient suffering from both the diseases at the same time.\n\nIncidentally, the same _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito transmits both the dengue and the chikunguniya virus; chances of co-infection are higher if the mosquito carries the viruses of both the diseases. A detailed analysis of dengue and chikungunya cases by the department of microbiology, Sri Venkate-swara Institute of Medical Sciences, Tirupati has revealed that the problem of co-infection is more pronounced in areas where both viruses co-circulate.\n\nWhere co-infection strikes, doctors find it hard to diagnose the problem. Though symptoms of these diseases are common, their outcome differs. Tests for both dengue and chikungunya [virus infections] will help in finding whether a patient is suffering from one disease or both of them. Chikungunya is non-fatal, while dengue may lead to severe complications including death. The common symptoms of both the diseases include fever, joint and bone pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue [However, acute joint pain that may persist for weeks or months is more characteristic of chikungunya virus infections. - Mod.TY].\n\nA team of researchers comprising Usha Kalawat, Krishna K. Sharma and G. Satishkumar Reddy analysed 331 samples for dengue and 170 samples for chikungunya [antibodies]. About 12 per cent of dengue samples and 20 per cent of chikungunya samples were positive. The team tested 72 samples for the presence of both dengue and chikungunya antibodies. About 3 per cent of these samples tested positive for both the diseases [virus infections].\n\n\"Areas affected by the chikungunya virus overlap with dengue fever-endemic areas and provide opportunities for mosquitoes to become infected with both the viruses,\" the team pointed out. They added that missing out signs of one disease is always plausible if diagnostic tests for both are not performed, and the presence of one does not rule out the other.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It would not be surprising if individuals residing in areas where both dengue and chikungunya outbreaks are occurring were infected with both viruses as the authors of this study indicate. However, this study is based on the results of tests with commercial kits that measure IgM antibodies (see original article cited below).\n\nFirstly, it is necessary to show that the serological reactions observed were specific for dengue and chikungunya viruses. Serological tests with ELISA kits alone, without demonstration of virus presence by isolation or RT-PCR or confirmation by other, more specific serological tests, should be interpreted with caution. Serological cross reactions among different flaviviruses such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus and others can further complicate interpretation of results. The USA CDC always confirms these types of positive serological test results with more virus-specific, 90 per cent plaque-reduction neutralization tests, which were not done in the above study.\n\nSecondly, IgM can persist for months or even beyond a year in some individuals following an acute dengue or chikungunya virus infection. The authors presume that because IgM was detected that reacted with both dengue and chikungunya virus antigens, those individuals were simultaneously infected with both viruses. That may not necessarily have been the case in all or even most of them. It is possible that some of these individuals in the above study were, in fact, infected with both dengue and chikungunya viruses but serially, not simultaneously. The authors of the study are correct in that both viruses should be considered when the clinical picture that they mention is observed. Mixed outbreaks can and do occur.\n\nReference for the original above report:\nKalawat U, Sharma KK, Reddy SG. Prevalence of dengue and chickungunya fever and their co-infection.

About 3 per cent of dengue-chikungunya cases fall under the co-infection category, with the patient suffering from both the diseases at the same time.\n\nIncidentally, the same _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito transmits both the dengue and the chikunguniya virus; chances of co-infection are higher if the mosquito carries the viruses of both the diseases. A detailed analysis of dengue and chikungunya cases by the department of microbiology, Sri Venkate-swara Institute of Medical Sciences, Tirupati has revealed that the problem of co-infection is more pronounced in areas where both viruses co-circulate.\n\nWhere co-infection strikes, doctors find it hard to diagnose the problem. Though symptoms of these diseases are common, their outcome differs. Tests for both dengue and chikungunya [virus infections] will help in finding whether a patient is suffering from one disease or both of them. Chikungunya is non-fatal, while dengue may lead to severe complications including death. The common symptoms of both the diseases include fever, joint and bone pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue [However, acute joint pain that may persist for weeks or months is more characteristic of chikungunya virus infections. - Mod.TY].\n\nA team of researchers comprising Usha Kalawat, Krishna K. Sharma and G. Satishkumar Reddy analysed 331 samples for dengue and 170 samples for chikungunya [antibodies]. About 12 per cent of dengue samples and 20 per cent of chikungunya samples were positive. The team tested 72 samples for the presence of both dengue and chikungunya antibodies. About 3 per cent of these samples tested positive for both the diseases [virus infections].\n\n\"Areas affected by the chikungunya virus overlap with dengue fever-endemic areas and provide opportunities for mosquitoes to become infected with both the viruses,\" the team pointed out. They added that missing out signs of one disease is always plausible if diagnostic tests for both are not performed, and the presence of one does not rule out the other.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It would not be surprising if individuals residing in areas where both dengue and chikungunya outbreaks are occurring were infected with both viruses as the authors of this study indicate. However, this study is based on the results of tests with commercial kits that measure IgM antibodies (see original article cited below).\n\nFirstly, it is necessary to show that the serological reactions observed were specific for dengue and chikungunya viruses. Serological tests with ELISA kits alone, without demonstration of virus presence by isolation or RT-PCR or confirmation by other, more specific serological tests, should be interpreted with caution. Serological cross reactions among different flaviviruses such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus and others can further complicate interpretation of results. The USA CDC always confirms these types of positive serological test results with more virus-specific, 90 per cent plaque-reduction neutralization tests, which were not done in the above study.\n\nSecondly, IgM can persist for months or even beyond a year in some individuals following an acute dengue or chikungunya virus infection. The authors presume that because IgM was detected that reacted with both dengue and chikungunya virus antigens, those individuals were simultaneously infected with both viruses. That may not necessarily have been the case in all or even most of them. It is possible that some of these individuals in the above study were, in fact, infected with both dengue and chikungunya viruses but serially, not simultaneously. The authors of the study are correct in that both viruses should be considered when the clinical picture that they mention is observed.

About 3 per cent of dengue-chikungunya cases fall under the co-infection category, with the patient suffering from both the diseases at the same time.\n\nIncidentally, the same _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito transmits both the dengue and the chikunguniya virus; chances of co-infection are higher if the mosquito carries the viruses of both the diseases. A detailed analysis of dengue and chikungunya cases by the department of microbiology, Sri Venkate-swara Institute of Medical Sciences, Tirupati has revealed that the problem of co-infection is more pronounced in areas where both viruses co-circulate.\n\nWhere co-infection strikes, doctors find it hard to diagnose the problem. Though symptoms of these diseases are common, their outcome differs. Tests for both dengue and chikungunya [virus infections] will help in finding whether a patient is suffering from one disease or both of them. Chikungunya is non-fatal, while dengue may lead to severe complications including death. The common symptoms of both the diseases include fever, joint and bone pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue [However, acute joint pain that may persist for weeks or months is more characteristic of chikungunya virus infections. - Mod.TY].\n\nA team of researchers comprising Usha Kalawat, Krishna K. Sharma and G. Satishkumar Reddy analysed 331 samples for dengue and 170 samples for chikungunya [antibodies]. About 12 per cent of dengue samples and 20 per cent of chikungunya samples were positive. The team tested 72 samples for the presence of both dengue and chikungunya antibodies. About 3 per cent of these samples tested positive for both the diseases [virus infections].\n\n\"Areas affected by the chikungunya virus overlap with dengue fever-endemic areas and provide opportunities for mosquitoes to become infected with both the viruses,\" the team pointed out. They added that missing out signs of one disease is always plausible if diagnostic tests for both are not performed, and the presence of one does not rule out the other.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It would not be surprising if individuals residing in areas where both dengue and chikungunya outbreaks are occurring were infected with both viruses as the authors of this study indicate. However, this study is based on the results of tests with commercial kits that measure IgM antibodies (see original article cited below).\n\nFirstly, it is necessary to show that the serological reactions observed were specific for dengue and chikungunya viruses. Serological tests with ELISA kits alone, without demonstration of virus presence by isolation or RT-PCR or confirmation by other, more specific serological tests, should be interpreted with caution. Serological cross reactions among different flaviviruses such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus and others can further complicate interpretation of results. The USA CDC always confirms these types of positive serological test results with more virus-specific, 90 per cent plaque-reduction neutralization tests, which were not done in the above study.\n\nSecondly, IgM can persist for months or even beyond a year in some individuals following an acute dengue or chikungunya virus infection. The authors presume that because IgM was detected that reacted with both dengue and chikungunya virus antigens, those individuals were simultaneously infected with both viruses. That may not necessarily have been the case in all or even most of them. It is possible that some of these individuals in the above study were, in fact, infected with both dengue and chikungunya viruses but serially, not simultaneously. The authors of the study are correct in that both viruses should be considered when the clinical picture that they mention is observed. Mixed outbreaks can and do occur.\n\nReference for the original above report:\nKalawat U, Sharma KK, Reddy SG. Prevalence of dengue and chickungunya fever and their co-infection.

As of the date of this news release [11 Nov 2011], there\nare 2 people who suffer from this disease in the area immediately\nadjacent to the City of Bukittinggi. \"But thanks to the infected\nindividuals having been rapidly brought to Achmad Mochtar Hospital\n(RSAM) Bukittinggi, the threat of paralysis had been anticipated.\nReportedly the victim is recovering,\" said Pakoan Youth Chairman, Jon\nSutan Longhouse, to Padang Express, yesterday (10 Nov 2011). He said\nthe Agam District Health Office went to the field to conduct spraying\nfogging last Tuesday (8 Nov 2011).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There was an apparent (but later not confirmed), significant focal\noutbreak of chikungunya virus infection in Central Java province. Not\nsurprisingly, no fatalities are reported in that outbreak or in the\none above, as is the case in nearly all chikungunya outbreaks.\nMorbidity may be significant, and incapacitating arthralgia may\npersist for weeks or months in convalescent individuals. Reports of\nchikungunya infections often indicate that the patient is paralyzed.\nIn reality, rather than paralysis, the patient may have arthralgia so\nsevere that they are reluctant to move because of this joint pain. The\noriginal report above indicated that this area is having a mixed\noutbreak involving both dengue and chikungunya viruses.\n\nAgam is a regency of West Sumatra, Indonesia. It has an area of\n2232.30 sq km (862 sq mi) and a population of approximately 419 800\npeople. Tilatang Kamang is one of 15 subdistricts in this regency.

The hospital's\ntropical medicine experts explained that these\ncases were diagnosed in people who had traveled\nto the Mauritius Islands, Equatorial Guinea,\nCameroon and India, where they had been infected\nby the bite of infected mosquitoes. This series\nof [chikungunya] cases being studied by [medical\npersonnel] in the hospital is the most extensive ever registered in Spain.\nThe specialists advise that persons intending to\ntravel to tropical areas should consult travel\nmedicine specialists, such as those at the Carlos\nIII Hospital, at least a month before departure.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This is the 1st report ProMED has seen this year\n[2006] of CHIK infection occurring in West Africa\n(Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon). The literature\nrecords that up to 1978 CHIK infection had not\nbeen recorded in West Africa other than Nigeria\nand Senegal, Sierra Leone and Liberia (by\nserology) -- ref: A W Woodruff, E T Bowen, & G S\nPlatt 1978 Viral infections in travellers from\ntropical Africa. Br Med J. 1978 April 15;\n1(6118): 956\ufffd958 (full text accessible\nonline). A later paper reported CHIK positive\nserology in Namibia -- ref: Joubert JJ, et al.\n1983 Prevalence of hepatitis virus and some\narbovirus infections in Kavango, northern\nSWA/Namibia.

It is suspected that more than 5000 people have\nbeen infected with the virus, now at epidemic levels.\nSri Lankan Health authorities have called on the public to clean up\nareas where mosquitoes breed in an effort to prevent the spread of\nthe disease.\nThe symptoms of the disease -- high fever, joint and muscular pain,\nsevere headaches, body aches and rash -- are similar to those caused\nby dengue fever, another mosquito-borne illness.\nThe disease has now spread rapidly in Kalmunai, Mannar, Batticaloa,\nPuttalam and parts of Colombo.\nThe closure of the main highway to the northern peninsula because of\nheavy fighting in August 2006 has resulted in a shortage of food and\nmedical supplies in the north, and Dr. Nihal Abeysinghe, director of\nthe state Epidemiology Department, said pockets of the fever had now\nalso been detected in Sri Lanka's northwest, south and east.\nThe outbreak has coincided with an outbreak of dengue fever cases, as\nmonsoon rains create breeding conditions for the mosquitoes that\ncarry the diseases, and health workers are struggling to cope.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that\nwhile the disease is painful, no deaths from chikungunya have been\ndocumented in the scientific literature. [True, but there is a recent\nevaluation by French epidemiologists that points strongly to\nfatalities due to chikungunya virus infections [see archive number\n20061014.2953].

Bertrand said that was\n20 000 more than a week ago.\nAround one in 6 inhabitants has now been affected on Reunion, which\nhas a total population of some 775 000 people.\n\"The last numbers ... refer to 77 deaths, directly or indirectly\nattributable to the epidemic for the month of January 2006,\" Bertrand\nsaid. \"(This is) a radically new situation, which was not expected\nbecause scientific research showed that chikungunya did not kill,\" he\nsaid.\nThe illness, which has also travelled to the nearby Indian Ocean islands of\nthe Seychelles and Mauritius [and Mayotte. - Mod.JW], is marked by high fever\nand severe [joint pains and]rashes. Most people recover although it is\nextremely painful.\nFirst recognized in East Africa in 1952, it also leaves the immune\nsystem weak, [providing] opportunities for other diseases to set in.\nThe name chikungunya comes from the Swahili for stooped walk,\nreferring to the posture of those afflicted.\nFrench Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, who is to travel to\nReunion on Sunday, said the entire island should be ridden of\nmosquitoes to stop the disease from spreading.\nVillepin said it was still safe to visit the island, which is a\npopular tourist destination for European travellers. The Reunion\nCommittee on Tourism has reported tour cancellations but has not\nprovided figures for costs incurred.\n\"You can certainly go there. The proof is that I'm going there,\"\nVillepin told Canal Plus television. \"You have to take some\nprecautions and use (certain) products,\" he said.\nAuthorities say people should remove stagnant water, use mosquito\nrepellents and bed nets and spray bedrooms at night.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri, 24 Feb 2006 05:07:38 -0500 (EST)\nFrom: A-Lan Banks <a-Lan.Banks@thomson.com>\nSource: New Scientist, 24 Feb 2006 [edited]\n<http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8765>\n\nA team of 4 experts from the World Health Organization has left for\nthe Indian Ocean island of Reunion to investigate a massive outbreak\nof a debilitating mosquito-borne disease which causes its victims to\ndouble over.\nThe largest-ever epidemic of the chikungunya virus among people in\nReunion started in February 2005, but has gathered pace since\nDecember 2005, spreading to neighbouring countries.\nReports and estimates suggest that 110 000 of the island's 800 000 population\nhas been afflicted by the stooping disease, says WHO, although official\nfigures, from a voluntary sentinel system on the island, suggest just 1700\ncases. During the first week of February 2006, Mauritius reported 206 cases\nand the Seychelles reported 1255 cases. [110 000 is an estimate, based on\nextrapolating the number detected by the sentinel physicians to the entire\npopulation. - Mod.JW]\nThe WHO experts will assess the current actions being taken to fight\nthe chikungunya virus's spread, which include educating people about\nhow to protect themselves against the disease and bolstering\nepidemiological surveillance.\nPeople infected by the virus can also experience recurring episodes\nof pain, even after the virus appears to have cleared from their\nbodies, says Robert Tesh, an expert on mosquito-borne viruses at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, USA. He says that\nthese returning arthritic pains may be caused by an immune system\nresponse.\nTesh explains that no quick treatment exists for chikungunya disease. Doctors\nprimarily help to alleviate the symptoms, such as fever and\ndehydration. \"There isn't much else you can do,\" he says, adding that\nhe knows of no approved vaccine against the virus.\nChikungunya is typically found in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical regions of\nAsia as far away as Indonesia. As for why such a large outbreak would occur in\nthe southwest Indian Ocean, Tesh says that this may have something to do\nwith \"herd immunity\". This describes the phenomenon in which populations\ninfected by the virus recover and gain immunity against it. When there are\nenough people in one location who boast immunity to chikungunya, the virus\ncannot easily pass from one host to another and cause an outbreak. Conversely,\nif there has been no outbreak for a long time, herd immunity falls as fewer\npeople have encountered the disease before, allowing the virus to spread more\neffectively.\n\"Weather can also play a role as it affects the abundance and\nactivity of the mosquitoes that transmit the virus,\" Tesh adds. Wet\nconditions, for example, can cause an upsurge in mosquito populations.\n[Byline: Roxanne Khamsi]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[A safe and highly immunogenic live vaccine has been evaluated\nthrough phase II clinical trial since 2000.

This describes the phenomenon in which populations\ninfected by the virus recover and gain immunity against it. When there are\nenough people in one location who boast immunity to chikungunya, the virus\ncannot easily pass from one host to another and cause an outbreak. Conversely,\nif there has been no outbreak for a long time, herd immunity falls as fewer\npeople have encountered the disease before, allowing the virus to spread more\neffectively.\n\"Weather can also play a role as it affects the abundance and\nactivity of the mosquitoes that transmit the virus,\" Tesh adds.

The Ministry of Health is requesting all hotels and all\nmedical practitioners in private practice to notify any suspect case.\nPersonal comment:\nIn Mauritius, the peak of the Chikungunya outbreak occurred in May\n[2005] when several hundred cases were reported per week. The number\nof cases started to fall in June and by September, only occasional\ncases were reported. Most cases reported in January [2006] occurred\nin people who had a history of recent travel to Reunion Island.\nHowever, in the [last] 10 days, some cases in people without history\nof travel have been reported. Some have been confirmed by virus\nisolation in tissue culture from blood samples. With the exception of\nthe cluster in Mahebourg, the other cases live in different regions\nof Mauritius.\nUp to now, the situation with Chikungunya virus has been much less\ndramatic than in Reunion Island. However, this may change. December\n[2005] was very dry in Mauritius, and heavy summer rainfall did not\noccur until 23 Jan 2006.\n--\nDr. M. I. Issack\nPathologist (Microbiology)\nCentral Health Laboratory\nMauritius\n<missack@intnet.mu>\n[ProMED is grateful for the timely information and comment given by\nDr. M. I. Issack from Mauritius.
