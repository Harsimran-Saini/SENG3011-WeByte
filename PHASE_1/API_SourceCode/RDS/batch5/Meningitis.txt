There are nearly 1/3 more cases of meningitis since the beginning of the year [2019] than the previous year [2018]. The state has allocated another BGN 2 million [USD 1 783 680] to deal with mosquitoes.\n\nThe disease is not typical for Bulgaria's latitudes, but has started to manifest itself with climate change, said Prof. Dr. Tatyana Chervenyakova of the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Bulgaria. The infection is transmitted through mosquitoes, and if there are complications, hospitalisation may be needed. However, the complications are only about 1% of the cases, said Prof. Chervenyakova.\n\nMost of the cases pass the disease slightly - with fever and general malaise. It usually goes away after 2-3 days.\n\n'It is very difficult to control the mosquitoes in these rainfalls. After every rainfall it must be sprayed. We shouldn't think that all mosquitoes are infected with the virus. The individual protection is the availability of repellents, the other is within the reach of the state ' Dr. Tatiana Chervenyakova, said in an interview for Bulgaria ON ON AIR.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report deals with mosquito-borne virus infections, but does not indicate which one, nor is the number of cases to date given.

The 2 cases are not linked. These are the 1st reported cases of invasive meningococcal disease in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, 11 meningococcal cases were reported in WA; 5 were serogroup W, 3 were serogroup Y, 2 were serogroup B, and 1 was a serogroup C. There was also one death related to meningococcal disease in 2020.\n\nMeningococcal disease is an uncommon, life-threatening illness caused by a bacterial infection of the blood and/or the membranes that line the spinal cord and brain, and occasionally of other sites, such as the throat, lungs, or large joints.\n\nThere are 2 types of meningococcal vaccines available: one protects against 4 serogroups of the meningococcal disease (serogroups A, C, W, and Y) and the other protects against serogroup B. The MenACWY vaccine is offered free to all children at 12 months of age. In addition, the MenACWY vaccine is offered to all Year 10 students, with a free catch-up program for 15-19 year-olds.\n\nDue to a higher rate of meningococcal disease in Aboriginal children in WA, the MenACWY vaccine is offered free to Aboriginal children from age 6 weeks to 12 months of age. The menB vaccine is free for all Aboriginal children aged up to 2 years of age. Both these vaccines are also free for people of all ages with certain medical risk conditions.\n\nMeningococcal bacteria are not easily spread from person-to-person. The bacterium is present in droplets discharged from the nose and throat when coughing or sneezing, but is not spread by saliva and does not survive more than a few seconds in the environment. Meningococcal bacteria are carried harmlessly in the back of the nose and throat by about 10-20 per cent of the population at any one time. Very rarely, the bacteria invade the bloodstream or tissues and cause serious infections.\n\nSometimes -- but not always -- symptoms may be accompanied by the appearance of a spotty red-purple rash that looks like small bleeding points beneath the skin or bruises. Symptoms of invasive meningococcal disease may include high fever, chills, headache, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, and severe muscle and joint pains. Young children may not complain of symptoms, so fever, pale or blotchy complexion, vomiting, lethargy (inactivity), poor feeding, and rash are important signs.\n\nAlthough treatable with antibiotics, meningococcal infection can progress very rapidly, so it is important that anyone experiencing these symptoms seeks medical attention promptly. With appropriate treatment, most people with the disease recover, although around 5 to 10 per cent will die, and around 15 per cent may experience complications such as hearing loss, or gangrene requiring skin grafts or amputations.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of meningococcal disease, infects only humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10% of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.\n\nAlthough there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W is most common.\n\nImmunity following use of a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W), either alone or conjugated to protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens because group B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.\n\nFollowing the mass introduction into the population of a meningococcal vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, e.g., serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African Meningitis Belt following A vaccine, only to be replaced by emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups.\n\nIn Australia, following the introduction of the conjugate meningococcal C vaccine in 2003, there has been a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases from 34% of cases in 2003 to 5.7% in 2012, accompanied by an increase in serogroup B from 60% in 2003 to 83% in 2012 (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf). ProMED reported in 2016 that serogroup W, rather than B, had become predominant in Western Australia (Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (03): (WA) sg W 20160925.4513543).\n\nIn Australia, as of July 2018, a single funded dose of MenACWY vaccine (Nimenrix) is scheduled at 12 months of age. As of 1 Apr 2019, a single dose of MenACWY vaccine (Nimenrix) is also provided for adolescents through a school-based program (14- to 16-year-olds); those aged 15-19 years who did not receive the vaccine at school can receive it from their GP. MenACWY vaccine is also strongly recommended (but not funded) for infants younger than 12 months of age, adolescents and young adults aged 20-24 years who live in close quarters or who are current smokers, and travelers to areas where meningococcal disease is more common (http://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2019-05/Childhood-schedule-table_May_2019_Final.pdf). However, some Australian states provide free vaccine to additional age groups. Western Australia (WA) funds MenACWY vaccine for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 6 weeks to 4 years (https://healthywa.wa.gov.au/Articles/J_M/Meningococcal-vaccine).\n\nMenB vaccine is recommended for all people 6 months of age and older (but not funded) for infants and young children under 2 years of age, adolescents aged 15-19 years, and adolescents and young adults aged 15-24 years who live in close quarters or who are current smokers (http://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2019-05/Childhood-schedule-table_May_2019_Final.pdf).

Both the MenACWY AND MenB vaccines are also free for people of all ages with certain medical risk conditions (https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Media-releases/2020/Meningococcal-disease-in-an-adult-case-9).\n\nInvasive meningococcal disease is more common in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/meningococcal-vaccines-in-australia-a-2019-update). In 2019, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had a 10-fold increased incidence of meningococcal disease than the non-indigenous across some age groups.

'Tragically, the baby has died in hospital,' a statement said.\n\nMultiple people were in contact with the child, with 7 told to take clearance antibiotics.\n\nMedical experts are yet to identify the exact strain of meningococcus that infected the newborn baby.\n\nA total of 5 cases of invasive meningococcal disease have been reported in SA this year [2020], well down from the 25 to the same time in 2019. Of those 5 cases, 2 were serogroup B, 2 serogroup Y, and 1 is awaiting typing. There were 27 invasive meningococcal cases reported statewide in 2019, with 19 from serogroup B and 4 apiece from serogroup W and Y.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Meningitis in infants and young children can be caused by a variety of bacteria. In infants aged less than 2 months, group B _Streptococcus_ causes most cases in the United States; _Listeria monocytogenes_ is also seen in this age group. With routine use of _Hemophilus influenzae_ type b and pneumococcal vaccines for infants and children in the United States, incidence of these pathogens has been reduced, leaving _Neisseria meningitidis_ as one of the most important causes of bacterial meningitis in infants and young children. The age-specific incidence rate of _N. meningitidis_ meningitis is highest among infants aged less than 1 year (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4803024/).\n\n_N. meningitidis_ infects only humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10% of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.\n\nAlthough there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W is most common. In the US, serogroup B was responsible for 64%, C for 12%, and Y for 16% of cases of meningococcal meningitis in infants.\n\nImmunity following the use of a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W), either alone or conjugated to a protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat, and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens because group B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.\n\nFollowing the mass introduction into the population of a meningococcal vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically. In Australia, following the introduction of the conjugate meningococcal C vaccine in 2003, there was a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf).\n\nIn Australia, a single funded dose of conjugated meningococcal ACWY vaccine (MenACWY) is scheduled at 12 months of age. A single dose of conjugated MenACWY vaccine is also given to adolescents through a school-based program (14-to 16-year-olds) (https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule#national-immunisation-program-schedule-from-1-july-2020).\n\nFor all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (MenB) is given at 2 and 4 months (can be given from 6 weeks of age) (https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule#national-immunisation-program-schedule-from-1-july-2020). Additional doses of MenB and MenACWY is given for children with specified medical risk conditions, such as splenia/hyposplenia, complement deficiency, and those undergoing treatment with eculizumab (https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule#national-immunisation-program-schedule-from-1-july-2020).\n\nInvasive meningococcal disease is more common in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/meningococcal-vaccines-in-australia-a-2019-update).

Because antimicrobial treatment for invasive meningococcal disease with a 3rd-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime and ceftriaxone) is the widely accepted standard recommendation (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/39/9/1267/402080), resistance of _N. meningitidis_ to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone is very worrisome.\n\nThe news report above says that 2 patients in Costa Rica were infected with _N. meningitidis_ serogroup Y resistant to penicillin and 2 3rd generation cephalosporins, one of which was cefotaxime. The other 3rd generation cephalosporin is not specified, but is perhaps ceftriaxone, the other 3rd generation cephalosporin usually used to treat this disease. We are also not told in the news report above if the 2 patients were epidemiologically linked, nor are we told the extent (that is, MICs [minimum inhibitory concentration] of penicillin or cefotaxime), the mechanisms of resistance, or resistance to any of the other antimicrobial drugs used to prevent or treat this disease.

For example, despite the decrease in susceptibility to penicillin G in 33% of 2888 isolates of _N. meningitidis_, all isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone in Brazil from 2009 to 2016 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29717974-surveillance-of-antimicrobial-resistance-in-neisseria-meningitidis-strains-isolated-from-invasive-cases-in-brazil-from-2009-to-2016/). Similar data have been reported for the US (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1169190/). However, one previous study reported 8 clinical isolates _N. meningitidis_ in Delhi, India in 2006 that were resistant to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, with most also resistant to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1698303/).

A type of bacterial meningitis called MenA (meningococcal group A) has seen huge declines, but now meningococcal groups W, X, and C have risen as major causes of meningitis in the African region known as the meningitis belt [Ref. 1].\n\nThe meningitis belt countries of sub-Saharan Africa have been repeatedly devastated by meningitis epidemics since the early 1900s. Fortunately, since the introduction of the vaccine MenAfriVac in 2010, over 300 million 1-29-year-olds living in the meningitis belt countries have been vaccinated against MenA, and there has been a dramatic decline in cases of MenA. However, meningitis caused by other types of meningococcal bacteria are rising, and the disease remains a major public health threat.\n\nIn a new study, researchers from the 3 World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Meningitis, in collaboration with the national laboratories in Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, and Mali, as well as with the Agence de Medecine Preventive, have provided further evidence about the different meningococcal strains that are now causing disease in sub-Saharan Africa, revealing how these bacteria travel between countries.\n\nProfessor Dominique Caugant from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, who led the study, said, 'We used cutting-edge sequencing technology to study the genetic makeup of over 700 samples of meningococcal bacteria collected from patients with meningitis in the meningitis belt from 2011 to 2016. We've identified that previously circulating strains of MenX, MenW, as well as MenC strains have evolved to become major causes of meningococcal meningitis and are continuing to expand. The new strain of MenC that caused massive epidemics in Niger and Nigeria in 2015 and again in 2017 is continuing to evolve and expand into other countries. Interestingly, this research also revealed that, for some meningococcal strains, there is a geographical split, with 'families' of bacteria causing disease in western Africa forming clusters distinct from those in central Africa. These bacteria are evolving locally and new, and potentially more virulent strains may emerge in a region of the world that has been hit the hardest by meningitis.'\n\nLinda Glennie, director of research at Meningitis Research Foundation said, 'This research is crucial because we need to understand how these strains evolve and spread to inform how future prevention strategies should best be targeted. It illustrates how whole-genome sequencing methods have revolutionised meningitis surveillance, helping to monitor and predict epidemics, informing vaccine decision-making, and enabling valuable country comparisons to be made. The 1st vaccine expected to protect against 5 types of meningococcal disease -- meningococcal A, C, W, Y, and X -- is currently in development, and, if affordable, this could be key to protecting against all major types of meningococcal meningitis prevalent in the meningitis belt.\n\n'We have always stressed the importance of defeating meningitis and septicaemia around the world, as the disease passes from human to human without respect for national borders.

Historically, the major cause of meningococcal epidemics in the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa has been _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A (NmA), but the incidence has been substantially reduced since the introduction of a serogroup A conjugate vaccine starting in 2010. We performed whole-genome sequencing on isolates collected post-2010 to assess their phylogenetic relationships and inter-country transmission.\n\n'Methods. A total of 716 invasive meningococcal isolates collected between 2011 and 2016 from 11 meningitis belt countries were whole-genome sequenced for molecular characterization by the 3 WHO Collaborating Centers for Meningitis.\n\n'Findings. We identified 3 previously reported clonal complexes (CC): CC11 (n\u202f=\u202f434), CC181 (n\u202f=\u202f62), and CC5 (n\u202f=\u202f90) primarily associated with NmW, NmX, and NmA, respectively, and an emerging CC10217 (n\u202f=\u202f126) associated with NmC. CC11 expanded throughout the meningitis belt independent of the 2000 Hajj outbreak strain, with isolates from Central African countries forming a distinct sub-lineage within this expansion. Two major sub-lineages were identified for CC181 isolates, one mainly expanding in West African countries, and the other found in Chad. CC10217 isolates from the large outbreaks in Nigeria and Niger were more closely related than those from the few cases in Mali and Burkina Faso.\n\n'Interpretations. Whole-genome-based phylogenies revealed geographically distinct strain circulation as well as inter-country transmission events. Our results stress the importance of continued meningococcal molecular surveillance in the region, as well as the development of an affordable vaccine targeting these strains.'\n\nThe 'African meningitis belt' is the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June.

However, since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt beginning in 2010, WHO has noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the prior 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, having been replaced by other serogroups, notably serogroup C, which require a change in meningococcal vaccine strategy. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nAfrica: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6075]", "summary": "However, since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt beginning in 2010, WHO has noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the prior 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, having been replaced by other serogroups, notably serogroup C, which require a change in meningococcal vaccine strategy.

Two presented with conjunctivitis just days after returning from a pilgrimage. The 3rd person, who was a close contact of one case but had not travelled to Mecca, developed invasive meningococcal disease (1). _Neisseria meningitidis_ isolates from all 3 individuals had the same phenotype (NG;NT;P1.15); they were resistant to ciprofloxacin and had only intermediate susceptibility to penicillin. Meningococcal conjunctivitis is known to carry a high risk of invasive disease (1-3) and requires immediate treatment, along with antibiotic prophylaxis for close contacts.\n\nCiprofloxacin is the recommended chemoprophylaxis in both the UK and Saudi Arabia. The identification of resistant meningococcal conjunctivitis in people returning from Mecca highlights the urgent need to review currently recommended prophylactic measures for Hajj pilgrims, how best to prevent spread of _N. meningitidis_ between people attending mass gatherings, and how to protect contacts on return (4-6).\n\nOver 2.2 million pilgrims (25\u2009000 from the UK) travelled from over 180 countries to Mecca, Saudi Arabia for the 2019 Hajj pilgrimage, which took place from 9 to 14 Aug [2019]. Pilgrims will make their way home over the next few weeks, and health services in destination countries need to be on heightened alert for imported pathogens with epidemic potential, including ciprofloxacillin [sic; ciprofloxacin-] resistant _N meningitidis_ (6). Continued global surveillance for meningococcal disease and antibiotic resistance, along with both epidemiological and molecular research, are essential to improve case detection, predict trends, and inform evolving prevention and control strategies (5).\n\nThe annual Hajj pilgrimage has been associated with repeated outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease. The largest occurred in 1974 (2673 cases), 1988 (1618 cases), 2000 (338 cases), and 2001 (316 cases) (7). Since 2001, the Saudi authorities have strictly enforced a visa requirement for pilgrims, mandating vaccination with a single dose quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (A,C,W-135, and Y). Adherence is 98%, and no further major outbreaks have occurred (8).\n\nHowever, meningococcal disease remains a priority public health threat at the Hajj because of the evolving nature of invasive disease, emergence of antibiotic resistance, diverse and varying geographical trends in serotypes other than A, C, W-135, and Y, fluctuations in incidence, and shifts in serogroups and genotypes which may increase epidemic potential (5).\n\nEvery year, the Saudi Ministry of Health updates immunisation and antibiotic prophylaxis requirements for pilgrims, and meningococcal vaccination remains compulsory (8). However, concerns have been raised about vaccine availability, and it has been suggested that adherence might have been compromised among pilgrims attending the 2019 Hajj (9). Furthermore, even vaccinated pilgrims remain susceptible to disease caused by serogroups B and X, which are not covered by the quadrivalent vaccine (10).\n\nThe high risk of meningococcal meningitis outbreaks, increasing incidence of serogroup B disease, and emergence of serogroup X in the African meningitis belt (5), from which a large number of pilgrims originate, are of particular concern. The Saudi Ministry of Health, therefore, mandates ciprofloxacin prophylaxis for pilgrims from meningitis belt countries (8). Over the past decade, 1.5 million doses of prophylactic ciprofloxacin have been administered to pilgrims at port of entry, and this has probably contributed to the emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant _N meningitidis_ (11).\n\nAuthors of a recent large study of Hajj pilgrims (5) recommended reconsidering use of ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis and including serogroup B vaccines in pre-travel requirements since more than 60% of _N. meningitidis_ isolates from participants were B type. The current preventive measures for Hajj and other mass gatherings (12) require urgent review and should be regularly updated in accordance with changes in the epidemiology of meningococcal disease, including resistance, and the availability of new vaccines.\n\nMeanwhile, as the 2.5 million pilgrims from the 2019 Hajj return home and an expected 7 million pilgrims travel to Saudi Arabia for the Umrah mini pilgrimage over the next 12 months, questions remain about how best to protect them and their contacts from meningococcal disease. There is no room for complacency. Measures should include proactive clinical surveillance, education of 1st contact health professionals on the importance of taking a travel history, and a high index of suspicion for meningococcal infection among pilgrims who become ill on return. Public Health England has alerted NHS professionals of this need and provided management guidelines (13). Health authorities should do the same in all 180 home countries for Hajj pilgrims.\n\n[Reference:\n1.

Two of the cases developed symptoms within days of returning from Mecca; the 3rd case was in a member of the same local community as one of the other cases. All 3 isolates have identical phenotypes (NG;NT;P1.15) and intermediate penicillin susceptibility.\n\nMeningococcal infection of the conjunctiva is considered an indication for public health action (i.e. treatment for the case and antibiotic prophylaxis for close contacts) because of the high immediate risk of invasive disease. Vaccination is not usually indicated in cases or contacts of cases of meningococcal conjunctivitis due to the absence of ongoing risk.\n\nCases and outbreaks of meningococcal group A and group W infection associated with travel to Mecca as part of Hajj or Umrah have been observed in the past, most recently in 2000/2001 where over 40 serogroup W cases were observed in UK pilgrims and their contacts (1). Since then, all pilgrims have been required to have received MenACWY vaccine as part of the Hajj/Umrah visa. Approximate dates for the 2019 Hajj are 9 to 14 August [2019] (2), and, therefore, travel from the UK, together with the number of close contacts of pilgrims, is likely to increase over the next few weeks.\n\nInfection due to non-groupable strains of meningococci is highly unusual in the UK, and such non-encapsulated strains rarely cause invasive disease (meningitis and/or septicaemia) in healthy individuals. Invasive disease caused by non-groupable meningococci may, therefore, indicate underlying immunodeficiency. In addition to inherited complement deficiencies, some medical conditions and treatments (in particular Eculizumab (Soliris; Alexion)), can lead to acquired or secondary complement deficiency, which can increase susceptibility to invasive meningococcal disease. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is recommended for close contacts of invasive meningococcal disease cases to eliminate established carriage from the close contact group, thereby reducing the likelihood of invasive disease and, importantly, onward transmission. Vaccination is not indicated following a case of non-groupable invasive meningococcal disease.\n\nPlease refer to UK guidance for further background information and public health advice (3).\n\nImplications and recommendation for PHE Health Protection Teams\n- Public Health action should not be delayed until antibiotic resistance testing results are available. Public Health management following reported cases of invasive meningococcal disease or conjunctival infection remains unchanged and in line with national guidelines (3).\n- 1st line clinical treatment should continue to be 3rd generation cephalosporins (5), and cases treated with intravenous or intramuscular cephalosporins (for example ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) do not require antibiotic chemoprophylaxis (3). If the case (including conjunctivitis cases) has been treated with any other antibiotic, chemoprophylaxis should be offered.\n- It is important that recent travel history, including place and dates of travel, are established for all cases of invasive meningococcal disease and meningococcal infection of the conjunctiva reported to PHE Health Protection Teams and that this information is recorded on HPZone.\n- Features which may be consistent with the implicated strain include cases with recent travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia or with close links to recent pilgrims. Due to the high likelihood of ciprofloxacin resistance, rifampicin [rifampin] should be considered for 1st-line prophylaxis in close contacts of both invasive disease and conjunctivitis cases with these features. Rifampicin should also be offered for such cases not treated with cephalosporins. If ciprofloxacin has already been given, then HPTs should determine the antibiotic susceptibilities available from the NHS laboratory (4) and ensure the strain is referred to PHE Meningococcal Reference Unit, Manchester promptly. If the strain is confirmed as being due to a non-groupable meningococcus and/or if ciprofloxacin resistance is identified, close contacts of both invasive disease and conjunctivitis should receive prophylaxis with rifampicin.\n\nFor further advice, please contact the duty doctor at PHE Colindale (020 8200 4400) or the PHE Meningococcal Reference Unit (0161 276 6757).\n\nThe PHE Meningococcal Reference Unit and Immunisation Team will continue to monitor the situation in England and is actively liaising with international contacts and the Saudi authorities. The Immunisation Team will follow up any further cases of related invasive meningococcal disease that are reported in apparently healthy individuals to prompt appropriate referral for investigation of possible underlying immunodeficiency.\n\nIn line with national guidance, if invasive meningococcal disease or conjunctival infection are confirmed by a local diagnostic laboratory (including private laboratories), then the original sample, including extracts from PCRs, should be referred promptly to the PHE Meningococcal Reference Unit, Manchester to allow the capsular group to be confirmed or identified and for additional characterisation including whole genome sequencing and antibiotic resistance testing.\n\nLead public health microbiologists are requested to forward this briefing note to their local NHS laboratories/microbiologists who may be involved in the diagnosis and provision of advice on treatment of invasive meningococcal disease or meningococcal conjunctivitis.\n\n[The full PHE report, including rifampin dosing information and references, is available at the source URL. - Mod.ML]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Invasive meningococcal disease (bacteremia and meningitis) is a contagious bacterial infection caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the nasopharynx and is spread person-to-person by respiratory droplets.\n\nHousehold members and other close contacts who may be exposed to the index case's respiratory excretions have the highest documented risk for carriage and secondary invasive disease during the 1st 7 days after a case being detected. These contacts should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis as soon as possible to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ and prevent secondary invasive disease.\n\nInfection in the 3 individuals in the UK, linked to recent travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia for the Hajj, was due to a non-groupable strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ that is resistant to ciprofloxacin and has only intermediate susceptibility to penicillin.\n\nCiprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent, had been an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. However, sporadic isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococci began to appear in the Americas, Europe, Australia, China, and India. As a result, in 2008, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended ciprofloxacin should no longer be used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in communities where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains have been identified (for example, selected US counties in North Dakota and Minnesota). Bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones is usually due to accumulation of point mutations in the genes (for example, gyrA and parC genes) encoding DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, the targets for the fluoroquinolones.\n\nCeftriaxone and rifampin are alternative agents (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm). Azithromycin is also recommended in communities where ciprofloxacin resistance has been detected (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html).\n\nIntermediate resistance to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] 0.12 to 0.25 mcg/ml) has been infrequently reported due to decreased affinity of target penicillin-binding proteins for penicillin, and infection due to these strains has been reported to respond to penicillin therapy. Less commonly, high-level resistance to penicillin (MICs over 0.25 mcg/ml) has been reported due to production of a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase production (https://jcm.asm.org/content/46/10/3208).\n\nAlthough there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W is commonest. There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W), either alone or conjugated to protein. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.\n\nInfection due to non-groupable strains would not be expected to be prevented by vaccines in which the immunogenicity is based on a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide. The immunogenicity of these vaccines is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups or due to non-groupable strains that do not have the capsular polysaccharide present in the vaccine. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED maps available at:\nUnited Kingdom: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40\nSaudi Arabia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131]", "summary": "ML]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Invasive meningococcal disease (bacteremia and meningitis) is a contagious bacterial infection caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the nasopharynx and is spread person-to-person by respiratory droplets. -----------------------------------\nImmunisation and Countermeasures Division, National Infection Service\n\nBackground and Interpretation:\nThree non-groupable meningococcal isolates with ciprofloxacin resistance (which is highly unusual in the UK) have been identified in 2 cases of conjunctivitis and one case of invasive disease in England.

The Immunisation Team will follow up any further cases of related invasive meningococcal disease that are reported in apparently healthy individuals to prompt appropriate referral for investigation of possible underlying immunodeficiency. \n\nIntermediate resistance to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] 0.12 to 0.25 mcg/ml) has been infrequently reported due to decreased affinity of target penicillin-binding proteins for penicillin, and infection due to these strains has been reported to respond to penicillin therapy. \n\nEvery year, the Saudi Ministry of Health updates immunisation and antibiotic prophylaxis requirements for pilgrims, and meningococcal vaccination remains compulsory (8).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["1974-03-26 00:00:00", "1988-03-26 00:00:00", "2019-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-01-03 00:00:00", "2000-03-26 00:00:00", "2001-03-26 00:00:00", "2008-03-26 00:00:00", "2673-03-26 00:00:00", "1618-03-26 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "United Kingdom", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "Saudi Arabia", "country": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "ceftriaxone", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "North Dakota", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}, {"location": "England", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Minnesota", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Mecca", "country": "Saudi Arabia"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6325116", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: fatal, serogroup C, 2018-2019", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6325116", "date": "2019-02-19 12:41:54", "main_text": "MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - NIGERIA: FATAL, SEROGROUP C, 2018-2019\n******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 12 Feb 2019\nSource: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control Situation Report [edited]\nhttps://ncdc.gov.ng/themes/common/files/sitreps/079b73319c633bc29c2a3d0697ea850e.pdf\n\n\n2018/2019 Cerebrospinal meningitis [CSM] outbreak in Nigeria\n------------------------------------------------------------\nHighlights:\n- This is the 9th situation report for 2018/2019 season\n- The National Technical Working Group for Cerebrospinal Meningitis has been monitoring cases and ensuring preparedness and coordination of response across the states\n- States in the meningitis belt were formally placed on alert on the 8th of November 2018\n- As at epi week 6 [ending 9 Feb 2019], 3 new suspected cases [were] reported.\n- Beginning from 1 Oct 2018 to 12 Feb 2019, a total of 206 suspected cases have been reported from 13 states.\n- 20 samples [27%] were positive for bacterial meningitis [103 samples collected, 75 samples tested].\n- _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C (NmC) accounted for 35% (7) of the [20] positive cases.\n- So far, 16 deaths (CFR [case fatality rate] =7.8%) have been recorded among all suspected cases.\n- In the last 4 weeks (epi week 3 [ending 19 Jan 2019] to epi week 6 [ending 9 Feb 2019], no LGA [local government area] is in the alert threshold.\n- Media messages have been developed and disseminated via conventional and social media.

In a statement, the health ministry asked doctors to be vigilant over a 'counterfeit' version of a vaccine called Mencevax ACWY. The fake drug is marked as having been manufactured in December 2016, with an end-date for use by November 2021, it said.\n\nNiger launched a week-long campaign on 5 Mar [2019] to vaccinate 6 million children against meningitis, which killed nearly 200 people 2 years ago. The country lies in the so-called 'meningitis belt' stretching from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east, where outbreaks of the disease are a regular occurrence.\n\nThe vaccination programme is against meningitis A, one of the six groups of meningitis bacteria that can cause epidemics.\n\nThe ministry's spokesman told AFP the bogus drug had been discovered during a 'routine inspection' of a privately-owned pharmacy in the capital, Niamey. An investigation is under way to try to ascertain how many of the fake vaccines have been used, the spokesman said.\n\nHealth workers administering meningitis jabs are being asked to take special care about their supply source, and the public are being urged to scrutinise vaccines clearly, even if they buy them in 'licensed' pharmacies. Fake drugs -- medications that are outright counterfeits or whose active ingredients have been diluted -- are a major problem in West Africa. In the 2017 outbreak, and in an epidemic in 2015 in which nearly 500 people died, Niger sounded the alarm over purported vials of vaccine that just contained water.\n\nMeningitis is transmitted between people through coughs and sneezes, close contact and cramped living conditions. The illness causes acute inflammation of the outer layers of the brain and spinal cord, with the most common symptoms being fever, headache and neck stiffness.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 15 Mar 2019\nSource: Vax Before Travel [edited]\nhttps://www.vaxbeforetravel.com/mencevax-acwy-has-been-reported-niger-fake-meningitis-vaccine\n\n\nNiger health authorities said today [15 Mar 2019] that they had found a fake version of a meningitis vaccine after launching a vaccination campaign to inoculate 5 million children against the disease. The minister of public health, Dr Idi Illiassou Mainassara, said on 15 Mar 2019 that the bogus vaccine, Mencevax ACWY, had been discovered during a 'routine inspection' in the Niger capital city of Niamey. In a statement, Dr Mainassara asked doctors to be vigilant over this 'counterfeit' vaccine.\n\nIn December 2010, a new meningococcal A conjugate vaccine was introduced in Africa through mass campaigns targeting persons 1 to 29 years of age. As of November 2017, more than 280 million persons have been vaccinated in 21 African belt countries. The vaccine is remarkably safe and cheap. In addition, its thermostability allows its use under controlled temperature chain (CTC) conditions. Its impact on carriage and the reduction in disease and epidemics is significant: a 58% decline in meningitis incidence and a 60% decline in the risk of epidemics were described. It is now introduced into routine infant immunization.\n\nMaintaining high coverage is expected to eliminate meningococcal A epidemics from this region of Africa. However, other meningococcal serogroups such as W, X, and C still cause epidemics, and around 30 000 cases are reported each year in the meningitis belt.\n\nWHO is committed to eliminating meningococcal disease as a public health problem. Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial form of meningitis, a serious infection of the thin lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Meningococcal meningitis is associated with high fatality (up to 50% when untreated) and high frequency (more than 10%) of severe sequelae. Early antibiotic treatment is the most important measure to save lives and reduce complications.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news reports above say that a fake meningococcal vaccine, Mencevax ACWY, marked as having been manufactured in December 2016, with an end-date for use by November 2021, was being distributed in Niamey, the capital of Niger.

However, we are not told whether Mencevax ACWY is the intended vaccine and, if so, how to distinguish the fake Mencevax ACWY from the correct one.\n\nUse of fake vaccines will leave a substantial portion of the population susceptible to meningococcal disease and engender further loss of confidence in the utility of vaccines.

In recent years, a large number of outbreaks and severe cases have occurred. Several species of mollusk, such as snails and slugs, act as intermediate and paratenic hosts of _A. cantonensis_.\n\nIn this study, 2 cases of EM were found to have been caused by infection with _A. cantonensis_ due to consumption of raw centipedes. To survey the _A. cantonensis_ infections acquired through centipedes that the patients had bought at a vegetable market, we performed etiological examinations and polymerase chain reaction amplification of _A. cantonensis_ genes.\n\n3rd-instar [developmental stage] larvae of _A. cantonensis_ were detected in the centipedes, and specific genes from _A. cantonensis_ were detected in all the specimens. This indicates that the centipede may act as a competent host for the transmission of _A. cantonensis_.

There has also been an increase in [meningococcal] meningitis [serogroup] Y over the same period, up from 3 to 8 (See: http://www.hpsc.ie/news/newsarchive/2019newsarchive/title-18757-en.html).\n\nNeither strain is currently included in the vaccines to protect against meningitis [that] are commonly given to children.\n\nThe increase follows a similar trend in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, which has in turn led to the MenACWY vaccine now being offered by health services to teenagers and college and university students.\n\nNo such vaccination programme has been introduced here yet, but the rise in cases will have to be examined by the group of experts which advises the HSE [Health Service Executive] on what jabs should be given free to various groups of patients.\n\nLike other forms of the disease, it can be very serious if not treated quickly with antibiotics. Without emergency treatment, it can lead to life-threatening blood poisoning, and result in permanent brain or nerve damage.\n\nThe report [source?] from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the country's disease watchdog, said that during January [2019] there were 17 cases of different forms of meningitis. Four of these involved the W and Y strains. Two people died from meningitis during January [2019]. Overall, the incidence of meningitis in Ireland has fallen in the past 2 decades.\n\nIn the past, the meningitis B and C strains presented the highest risk, but the introduction of vaccines for both has led to a fall in circulation of both.\n\nThe report pointed out that in 2000, the meningitis C vaccine began to be routinely given to children, which went along with a catch-up programme for teenagers. Since the introduction of the meningitis C vaccine, the annual incidence of the strain has decreased substantially from 135 cases in 1999 to 20 last year [2018].\n\nA vaccine to protect against meningitis B was introduced in recent years, but only for children born after October 2016, leaving parents of older children to pay Euro 300 [USD 340] to have the jab privately. The annual incidence of meningitis B has also reduced considerably from 292 cases in 1999 to 46 cases in 2018.\n\nThe report said that changing trends in the incidence of the infection have been reported in other European countries in recent years. In Italy, the number of meningococcal W cases has been increasing since 2013. 'The Netherlands has also seen an increase in reported cases of meningococcal W cases, which had been very rare prior to 2015. Between 2010 and 2014, an average of 4 cases of meningococcal W were reported annually but increased substantially over the following years to 80 cases in 2017. 'This rapid upsurge in meningococcal W in the Netherlands has been attributed to a meningococcal W,' it added.\n\nThe report said that 17 cases and 2 related deaths were reported from 1-29 Jan this year [2019]. 'This was slightly less than in the same period last year when 19 cases -- and 2 related deaths -- were notified. 'Amongst the 17 cases notified from 1-29 Jan 2019, different strains were reported, and different age groups were affected.'\n\nThe report added that although meningitis notifications have been stable in the 1st 4 weeks of 2019 compared to the previous year [2018], ongoing monitoring of trends is needed 'to assess the circulation, distribution and evolution of specific control strategies, particularly preventive vaccination programmes, and to inform national vaccination policy.'\n\n[Byline: Eilish O'Regan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A recent (23 Jan 2019) report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) gives numbers of cases that are slightly different from the news report above for a similar period of time (http://www.hpsc.ie/news/newsarchive/2019newsarchive/title-18757-en.html):\n'Twenty meningococcal cases were notified to HPSC in Ireland between 24 Dec 2018 and 22 Jan 2019, compared with 19 cases in the same period last year [2018]. There is not an outbreak. Meningococcal disease is known to have increased incidence in winter and early spring. Among the 20 cases, different age groups were affected, different strains were reported (B,C,W,Y), different regions of the country reported the cases and there were no links found between the cases. Sadly, 3 of the cases have died; none was caused by meningococcal strains that are covered by the vaccines in the national childhood programme (the strains were not B or C).'\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_ only infects humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10 percent of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease.\n\nSeveral meningococcal vaccines are available. Immunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W are most common.\n\nThere are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W), either alone or conjugated to protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.\n\nFollowing the mass introduction into the population of a vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, e.g., serogroup C disease in several countries (e.g., UK, Netherlands, and Australia) following the introduction of conjugate C vaccine and serogroup A in the African Meningitis Belt following conjugate A vaccine, only to be followed by the emergence of a 'replacement' pathogen, e.g., serogroup W. in subsequent years.\n\nBecause of the continuing rapid increase in the UK in serogroup W disease, the UK replaced the adolescent meningococcal C conjugate vaccine for 13-14-year-olds with the quadrivalent ACWY conjugate vaccine in the autumn of 2015. In addition, catch up campaigns were set up to give the ACWY vaccine to all 13-18-year-olds and new university admissions during 2015 to 2017 (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf).\n\nNeither B nor ACWY vaccinations were included in the Dutch National Immunisation Programme. However, as of May 2018, the meningococcal ACWY vaccination replaced C vaccination at age 14 months and from October 2018, 13-14 year olds were offered ACWY vaccination (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915972/). A detailed discussion of these issues in the Netherlands appears in a publication 'Meningococcal disease in the Netherlands. Background information for the Health Council.

So far this year [2018], 57 people ended up in intensive care, and 11 people died because of this bacterium, according to figures AD [Algemeen Dagblad, a Dutch daily newspaper based in Rotterdam] received from the national institute for public health RIVM [Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment].\n\nThe number of meningitis deaths so far this year [2018] is already equal to the total of 2017. To make matters worse, there is a shortage of vaccines, according to the newspaper. Last year [2017], the government decided that babies aged 14 months and primary school pupils need to be vaccinated against this dangerous variant of meningitis. But due to the vaccine shortage, 14-year-olds now have to wait until October 2018 for their vaccine.\n\nAccording to AD, this variant of meningitis is rapidly advancing. No one died of meningococcal bacterium type [serogroup] W before 2015, and only about 4 people were infected each year. In the 1st 4 months of last year [2017], 27 people had to be hospitalized. In the same period of this year [2018], 50 people ended up in hospital due to this bacterium.\n\nThe 1st signs of a meningitis infection are cold- and flu-like symptoms. After that, things rapidly get worse. A clear sign of meningitis is a stiff neck. A person can die within 24 hours of being infected.\n\n[Byline: Janene Pieters]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Dutch National Immunisation Programme has included the conjugated meningococcal serogroup C vaccine (MenC) at 14 months of age since 2002. In 2002, all 1-18-year-olds were vaccinated in a large catch up campaign. Subsequently, serogroup C meningococcal disease virtually disappeared, but since the autumn of 2015, there has been a rapid increase in serogroup W meningococcal disease (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf).\n\nThe incidence of meningococcal serogroup W disease increased more than 10-fold from 0.02 per 100 000 per year in the period 2005-2014 to 0.29 per 100 000 in 2016 in the Netherlands; in the last quarter of 2016, the incidence increased to 0.40 per 100,000 (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf). The proportion of serogroup W increased from 2.4% (48/2076 cases) in 2003-2014 to 10% (9/90) in 2015, and to 33% (50/151 cases) in 2016. In 2016, the incidence of serogroup W disease was highest in persons of 65 years or older (0.68 per 100 000), followed by the 15-24-year-olds (0.53 per 100 000) and under-5-year-olds (0.34 per 100 000). Most of the patients presented with sepsis (41%, n=21), 10 with meningitis (20%), and 3 with sepsis and meningitis (6%) (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf). The other patients had atypical presentations (n=17, 33%) including pneumonia (n=9), septic arthritis (n=2) and mild meningococcemia (n=6). Six patients died (case fatality rate of 11%).\n\nNevertheless, serogroup B is the most common cause of meningococcal disease in the Netherlands contributing to 70-80% of all meningococcal cases from 2011 to 2015 (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf). In 2016, however, only 50% of all cases were caused by serogroup B because of the increase in serogroup W disease. Serogroup B affects, in particular, young children and, to a lesser extent, adolescents and young adults.\n\nThe case fatality rate for serogroup W disease (11% in NL, 12% in UK) and the percentage of patients with sepsis (41% in NL, 49% in UK) and an atypical presentation (33% in NL, 22% in UK) in the Netherlands and the UK are rather similar. Also, the age distribution, with most cases among the elderly and a high incidence in adolescents, is similar in the Netherlands and the UK. The serogroup W isolates in England in 2014-2015 were predominantly a hypervirulent genotype, PorB serotype 2a, a surrogate marker for clonal complex 11, and strongly related to finetype P1.5,2:F1-1, which is the finetype causing the majority of serogroup W cases in the Netherlands (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf). Clonal complex 11 is also responsible for the current serogroup W outbreaks in South America.\n\nBecause of the continuing rapid increase in the UK in serogroup W disease, the UK replaced the adolescent MenC conjugate vaccine for 13-14-year-olds with the quadrivalent MenACWY conjugate vaccine in the autumn of 2015. In addition, catch up campaigns were set up to give the MenACWY vaccine to all 13-18-year-olds and new university admissions during 2015 to 2017 (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf).\n\nNeither MenB nor MenACWY vaccination were included in the Dutch National Immunisation Programme, but were under consideration. However, as of May 2018, the MenACWY vaccination replaces MenC vaccination at age 14 months and from October 2018, 13-14 year-olds will be offered MenACWY vaccination (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915972/).

A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n However, as of May 2018, the MenACWY vaccination replaces MenC vaccination at age 14 months and from October 2018, 13-14 year-olds will be offered MenACWY vaccination (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915972/). \n\nThe case fatality rate for serogroup W disease (11% in NL, 12% in UK) and the percentage of patients with sepsis (41% in NL, 49% in UK) and an atypical presentation (33% in NL, 22% in UK) in the Netherlands and the UK are rather similar. Nevertheless, serogroup B is the most common cause of meningococcal disease in the Netherlands contributing to 70-80% of all meningococcal cases from 2011 to 2015 (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf). No one died of meningococcal bacterium type [serogroup] W before 2015, and only about 4 people were infected each year. In addition, catch up campaigns were set up to give the MenACWY vaccine to all 13-18-year-olds and new university admissions during 2015 to 2017 (https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2017-0031.pdf). The proportion of serogroup W increased from 2.4% (48/2076 cases) in 2003-2014 to 10% (9/90) in 2015, and to 33% (50/151 cases) in 2016. In 2016, however, only 50% of all cases were caused by serogroup B because of the increase in serogroup W disease.

Between 1 Jan 2017 and 31 Dec 2017, there were 12 cases of MenW reported, including 3 deaths. This number has doubled to date for 2018, with 24 cases reported so far (as of 5 Nov [2018]), including 6 deaths. Prior to 2017, 0 to 6 MenW cases were reported each year. The Northland region has been the most affected in 2018, with 7 of the 24 cases reported in this region, including 4 cases in September and October [2018].\n\nThis particular strain of MenW (sequence type ST11) affects all age groups and is associated with a high case-fatality rate. MenW can present with the classical signs of meningococcal disease but also atypically with gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as pneumonia, septic arthritis, endocarditis, or epi/supraglottitis. MenW was previously referred to as W135. Similar increases in MenW have been seen in other countries, including the UK and Australia.\n\nOverall, the annual number of meningococcal disease cases due to all serogroups has been increasing steadily since 2014, when there were 45 cases, to 112 cases in 2017. There [have] been 96 cases to date this year [2018] (as of 5 Nov [2018]). Group B remains the most prevalent serogroup, though this year [2018] the number of group B infections is lower (43 cases) than in 2017 (60 cases) at the same time of the year.\n\nKey messages\n-----\n- General practitioners and emergency departments should be aware that there has been an increase in meningococcal disease caused by serogroup W in New Zealand over the past 2 years. They should be aware that this strain presents atypically, and they should keep a high level of suspicion for the disease.\n- Because of the fulminant nature of meningococcal sepsis, antibiotics should be administered on suspicion of diagnosis before transferring the patient to the hospital.\n- GPs do not need to be concerned that administering antibiotics will obscure the diagnosis for hospital clinicians. Overtreatment is acceptable in this case, as failure to treat may be fatal.\n- The antibiotics recommended prior to transfer to hospital are as follows:\nAdults: Benzyl penicillin: 1.2 g (2 megaunits) IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 1-2 g IV (or IM)\nChildren: Benzyl penicillin: 25-50 mg/kg IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 50-100 mg/kg IV (or IM)\n- Antibiotics given prior to transfer should be clearly noted on the clinical information that accompanies the patient to the hospital.\n- Patients with a documented history of anaphylaxis to penicillin and who are suspected of suffering from meningococcal disease should be sent immediately to the hospital without pre-admission antibiotics.\n- A blood sample should be taken as soon as possible for laboratory testing but should not delay patient treatment or transfer.\n- If you are not sure if it is meningococcal disease, (1) advise parents/caregivers to check the sick person frequently (e.g., every hour). The sick person should not remain alone; (2) make sure the case seeks immediate medical attention if he or she deteriorates; and (3) reassess the case within 6 hours.\n- The quadrivalent MCV4-D vaccine (Menactra) protects against MenW and is available in New Zealand. It is recommended for high-risk groups and is funded for some of them (please refer to the meningococcal disease chapter in the immunisation handbook). Please make sure that high-risk patients for whom the vaccine is funded are protected.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Meningococci are classified into serogroups based on the antigenic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule. Six serogroups (A, B, C, W, and Y) cause almost all invasive disease globally. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), based on DNA sequence of 7 housekeeping genes, is used to classify meningococci into lineages (sequence types, ST). Closely related STs are termed 'clonal complex.'\n\nPrior to 2000, serogroup W was not a very common cause of meningococcal disease. However, in 2000 and 2001, serogroup W ST-11 strains caused an outbreak related to the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The outbreak spread internationally through pilgrims, with cases identified among Hajj pilgrims and their close contacts globally, including countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia, but following mandatory quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination for pilgrims in 2001, W ST-11 cases declined among Hajj pilgrims (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310207).\n\nNevertheless, both Hajj-related and non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains then continued to circulate, causing disease worldwide. Hajj-related W ST-11 strains have caused outbreaks in the African meningitis belt and South Africa. Non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains emerged in South America, and a descendant of this strain was responsible for the initial increase in invasive W ST-11 disease in the UK (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.24.30259) and other European countries (France, Netherlands, Sweden) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971218300201). Other W lineages persist in low numbers in Europe, North America, and the meningitis belt (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26876439).\n\nPatients with serogroup W ST-11 infection may present with more severe disease; unusual clinical presentations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, septic arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, pneumonia, and myopericarditis; and a high case-fatality ratio. Atypical clinical presentations may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment as well as delays in public health notification, contact tracing, and timely administration of antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to close contacts for prevention of secondary invasive meningococcal disease.\n\nIn some countries like the UK, the emergence of serogroup W disease has followed the near-elimination of serogroup C disease after the introduction of meningococcal C vaccine into the national childhood vaccine schedule (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - UK: emergence of serogroup W, changed vaccine policy 20150926.3673122). However, in New Zealand, meningococal vaccines are not included in the childhood immunization schedule (https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/immshandbook-national-immunisation-schedule-mar18.pdf). The conjugated quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) MCV4-D (Menactra) and the conjugated meningococcal serogroup C vaccine MenCCV (NeisVac-C) are available, but only publicly funded for the following high-risk groups (https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/immshandbook-12-meningococcal-disease-mar18-v2.pdf):\n\u2022 patients pre- or post-splenectomy or with functional asplenia;\n\u2022 patients with HIV, complement deficiency (acquired, including monoclonal antibody therapy against C5, or inherited) or pre- or post-solid organ transplant;\n\u2022 HSCT [human stem cell transplant] (bone marrow transplant) patients;\n\u2022 patients following immunosuppression; and\n\u2022 close contacts of meningococcal cases (of relevant serotype).\n\nThe news report above says that the Northland region has been the most affected by the emergence of serogroup W disease.

So far, none of the infections have been fatal, and officials stressed that declaring an outbreak was done out of an abundance of caution, not panic.\n\n'We truly understand how scary it is for our students and their parents to hear the word 'outbreak' ... It's not a time to be alarmed. It's a time to understand what you can do to protect yourself,' said Dr Cynthia Cornelius, medical director of student health services for the university.\n\nThe most recent case at SDSU came when a man who lived on campus started experiencing symptoms on [25 Sep 2018]. In early September, the county and the university announced that a female student who lived on campus had been hospitalized after becoming infected. And on [Fri 28 Sep 2018], the county also provided information on a 3rd previously unmentioned student who lived off campus and got sick in June [2018]. Unlike the 2 cases in September [2018], the 3rd student lived off campus. She did not attend classes while she was sick, officials said, because her illness occurred during summer break.\n\nDr Sayone Thihalolipavan, the county's deputy public health officer, did not say much about the health conditions of the 3 students but did indicated that they are not currently in critical danger. 'I will just say that they are OK,' Thihalolipavan said.\n\nThe county and university are recommending that all undergraduates younger than 24 [years old] be vaccinated against type B meningococcal disease. Why only that specific group and not all campus students, faculty, and staff? The physician said that other type B outbreaks on other campuses across the United States have never generated a case older than age 22. 'In general, it has been teens and young adults,' Thihalolipavan said.\n\nThough people in that age bracket routinely receive a vaccine that immunizes them against 4 different types of meningococcal infection, type B is not in the mix. A specific vaccine that just covers B type bacteria is necessary for immunity. San Diego State officials announced [Fri 28 Sep 2018] that they will hold an additional vaccination event on campus early next week [week of 1 Oct 2018] to offer shots to anyone who has not already been immunized.\n\nVaccination does not ward off infections that are already present, and a person whose nasal passages have been colonized by the bacteria may not get sick right away. About 10 percent of people carry meningococcal bacteria in their nasal passages but never get sick. But when the bacteria move from a person's respiratory tract to their bloodstream, infection can turn deadly very quickly.\n\nOfficials urged the entire campus population to keep their eyes open for symptoms of meningococcal disease including fever, intense headache, lethargy, stiff neck, and a rash that does not blanch under pressure.\n\nThe health department routinely traces all known contacts of anyone who comes down with a serious communicable disease. That work, Thihalolipavan said, has already been done for the 3 SDSU cases, and the county has already proactively dosed about 1800 people who could potentially have been exposed with antibiotics. Proactive antibiotics, if delivered quickly enough after exposure, can prevent meningococcal disease infection.\n\nHe said the county's investigation has not yet discovered any significant epidemiological link between the 3 [SDSU cases]. 'None of the cases are known to each other that we know of.

'We want the population of students under the age of 24 to get vaccinations so they're protected even though they haven't been exposed yet.'\n\nBy declaring an 'outbreak' the university and county health department receive access to additional resources from the state of California, including vaccines.\n\nNone of the students had prior contact with each other, SDSU officials said, though one in 10 people have the bacteria living inside their nasal passages without getting sick. 'We know there must be enough of a carriage rate, that's what we call it, that it's around this environment at SDSU currently,' Thihalolipavan said.\n\nThe university is planning to hold a mass vaccination event on campus with thousands of vaccines for students. Since the disease primarily affects young people, only undergraduate students under the age of 24 are being urged to get the vaccine.\n\nIn 2014, this rare form of meningitis killed one SDSU freshman and infected students at multiple colleges throughout the country.\n\nNational Foundation For Infectious Diseases estimates one in 10 people who get the meningococcal B [disease] will die, with 2 in 10 suffering serious complications including brain damage, kidney damage, and amputation of limbs. Bacterial meningitis is spread by sharing items such as cigarettes or drinking glasses or through intimate contact such as kissing. Meningococcal group B vaccines are recommended for people older than 10 years old who are considered high risk including those with certain medical conditions or those exposed during an outbreak.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Household and other close contacts of persons with invasive meningococcal disease have a higher risk for carriage and invasive disease, for which they should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _Neisseria meningitidis_ as soon as possible. Ciprofloxacin has been an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. However, sporadic isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococcal disease began to appear in the Americas, Europe, Australia, China, and India. As a result, in 2008, the US CDC recommended ciprofloxacin should no longer be used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in communities where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains have been identified (selected US counties in North Dakota and Minnesota). Ceftriaxone and rifampin are alternative agents (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm). Azithromycin is also recommended in communities where ciprofloxacin resistance has been detected (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html).\n\nAs pointed out by Kathleen Harriman, PhD, MPH, RN (Chief, Vaccine Preventable Diseases Epidemiology Section California Department of Public Health Richmond, California, <kathleen.harriman@cdph.ca.gov>), the CDC recently updated their meningococcal disease outbreak guidance and no longer recommends the use of an absolute outbreak threshold. The new guidance can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf. The relevant portion of the guidance is extracted below:\n\n8.3 Outbreak thresholds\n-----------------------\n'The purpose of declaring an outbreak is to determine when appropriate public health interventions should be considered. In contrast to previous guidance in which a threshold of 3 cases of the same serogroup with an attack rate of more than 10 cases per 100 000 population during a 3- month period was used to define both organization- and community-based outbreaks, the current guidance does not recommend the use of an absolute threshold. However, the following thresholds can be considered as guidance, with considerable flexibility to account for the unique nature of each meningococcal disease outbreak.\n\n'For organizations, 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within a 3-month period is considered to be an outbreak (Box 4 -- see below). In most situations, 2 cases within an organization constitute an outbreak. However, in some situations, such as an outbreak within a large university (for example one with more than 20 000 undergraduate students) where no identifiable subgroup at risk within the population can be identified, it may be reasonable to declare an outbreak after 3 cases.\n\n'For communities, an outbreak is defined as multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period (Box 4). Several strategies may be considered to determine whether incidence is above expected in a community. For instance, incidence during the current 3-month period can be compared with the incidence during a similar time period in previous years, or in the setting of very low or unstable monthly incidence, annual incidence in the 3-5 years prior. If community incidence has historically been very low or zero, comparisons against state or national incidence can be made. Additional supportive evidence of an outbreak should be solicited, such as similarity of the strains by molecular typing and common epidemiologic or social characteristics of cases. Consultation with CDC is encouraged if an outbreak is suspected.\n\n'Box 4. Outbreak thresholds\nThresholds by outbreak type\nOrganization-based: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period.\nCommunity-based: multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period.\n\n'Although an absolute outbreak threshold is no longer used, calculating an outbreak attack rate may still be useful in determining the magnitude of an outbreak and comparing against a historical baseline. An outbreak attack rate per 100 000 population is calculated as follows: [(number of outbreak-associated meningococcal disease cases during a 3-month period)/(population at risk)] x 100 000. The epidemiology of the cases should be used to determine the appropriate denominator for attack rate calculations and should include the population of the smallest geographic area that contains the cases and be limited to the sub-populations in which cases were reported (such as among certain age-groups or social networks). For some populations, such as MSM [men who have sex with men], determining the denominator can be very challenging. Results of local or statewide surveys (such as proportion of adult male population that is MSM, proportion of population with HIV) along with census data can be helpful in estimating population sizes.\n\n'Previous versions of the outbreak guidance do not define the term 'cluster' of meningococcal disease, though this term is used informally by public health officials. In this updated guidance, the term cluster can be used to describe a grouping of cases thought to be epidemiologically related that are still under investigation or that do not meet the definition of an outbreak.\n\n9. Vaccination\n--------------\n9.1 Decision to vaccinate\n'Vaccination is the preferred control measure for meningococcal disease outbreaks of all serogroups commonly seen in the United States (B, C, W, and Y). However, many factors should be taken into consideration when determining the need for vaccination. While the number of cases is important, other factors to consider include the population size, ability to define a target group for vaccination, whether ongoing transmission is likely, feasibility of a vaccination campaign, and timing of potential vaccination in relation to cases. In situations where ongoing transmission is unlikely (such as cases limited to household members, roommates, or boyfriend/girlfriend), a vaccination campaign is not necessarily indicated as long as antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts is implemented to prevent further transmission.\n\n'The guidance above suggests thresholds for considering vaccination, but decisions to vaccinate should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the local/state health department and CDC taking into account all circumstances and epidemiology specific to the outbreak.'\n\nThe CDC recommends vaccination with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine for all preteens and teens at 11 to 12 years old, with a booster dose at 16 years old. Teens and young adults (16 through 23 year olds) also may be vaccinated with a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine. In addition to a meningococcal conjugate vaccine, certain preteens and teens should get a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine if they: have a rare type of disorder (complement component deficiency); are taking the medicine called Soliris [eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and generalized myasthenia gravis in adults)]; have a damaged spleen or their spleen has been removed; or are part of a population identified to be at increased risk because of a serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreak (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/public/index.html).\n\nSan Diego State University (SDSU), with a student body of 34 688 in the fall of 2018, is a public research university in the 23-member California State University system in the city of San Diego, in southern California (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_State_University). - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of California, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/22466]", "summary": "\n\n'For communities, an outbreak is defined as multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period (Box 4).

'We have interviewed the patients and examined medical records to look for any common source of the infection. Further laboratory testing is also being carried out to identify which type of enterovirus has caused these illnesses.\n\n'All of the patients have now been discharged from hospital after making a full recovery.' Symptoms of viral meningitis can include fever, headache, sensitivity to light, lethargy or tiredness, stiff neck, nausea and vomiting. It is important that all people with symptoms of meningitis are seen by a doctor immediately. Viral meningitis can sometimes cause serious illness on its own and symptoms are very similar to those of bacterial meningitis, which requires urgent medical treatment.\n\nViral meningitis is the most common type of meningitis, which is an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. It is usually much less severe than bacterial meningitis, and most people get better without treatment within 7 to 10 days.\n\nEnteroviruses are spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, saliva, feces or contact with contaminated items or water.\n\nThe best means of protecting yourself from infection and stopping transmission is through effective hand washing and good hygiene practice. This is particularly important prior to eating, after using the toilet, changing a nappy or helping care for a sick person.

The Ministry, through the National Meningococcal Disease Taskforce, continues to coordinate the response to the outbreak, including strengthening surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, clinical management, public health interventions, and risk communications.\n\nSurveillance\n------------\nNational surveillance is coordinated by the Fiji Centre for Communicable Disease Control (FCCDC) through weekly indicator based surveillance for meningococcal disease via 34 EWARS [Early Warning, Alert and Response System] sites; EWARS event-based surveillance reporting of suspected cases; laboratory based surveillance for _Neisseria meningitidis_; and active case investigation reports.\n\nNational update (1 Jan-5 Apr 2018)\n----------------------------------\nMoHMS is reporting both confirmed and suspected cases. Therefore, there have been a total of 38 cases from [1 Jan-5 Apr 2018]. Of these, 22 cases are laboratory-confirmed, and 16 are either suspected or probable cases (WHO case definitions). There has been an average of 2.5 cases per week in the last 4 weeks.\n\nAs of [5 Apr 2018], all cases were in the 19 years or younger age group:\n- 39.5 percent of cases: younger than 5 years old\n- 18.4 percent of cases: 5-9 years old\n- 26.3 percent of cases: 10-14 years old\n- 15.8 percent of cases: 15-19 years old\n\nMales account for 63.2 percent of cases and females, 36.8 percent. 4 confirmed and 2 suspected meningococcal deaths.\n\nA cluster of 6 cases was reported from Navesau Adventist High School (boarding school) in Ra from [28 Feb to 28 Mar 2018]. No deaths reported.\n\n*The current national incidence for 2018 is 4.1 per 100 000 population (38 cases). The Central Division has the highest incidence of 6.0 per 100 000 (23 cases), followed by Western at 3.3/100 000 (12 cases), Eastern at 2.6/100 000 (1 case), and Northern at 1.5/100 000 (2 cases).\n\n*The 6 Navesau Adventist High School cases were reclassified from Central Division to Western Division in week 13 [week ending 30 Mar 2018].\n\nInterventions\n-------------\nClinical case management:\n- Clinicians have been alerted and have access to the new Meningococcal Public Health Management Guidelines.\n- A nationwide training on the guidelines from [9 Apr 2018] covering all 4 divisions.\n- Deployment of ceftriaxone to subdivisions completed.\n- Ensuring access to rifampicin for prophylaxis of high-risk contacts.\n\nPublic health response:\n- Nationwide training on use of the new guidelines to start [9 Apr 2018].\n- Case investigation, education, rifampicin prophylaxis, commenced from notification of 1st case from Navesau Adventist High School. Active case finding at the school daily.\n- Vaccination of students at Navesau Adventist School began [5 Apr 2018].\n- Strengthening of infection and prevention control measures has been emphasized to all divisional and subdivisional officers.\n- Involvement of the Infection Prevention and Control officers in the rollout of the guidelines.\n\nRisk communication:\nImplementation of the Meningococcal Disease Risk Communication plan, including dissemination of key messaging, mass media and school campaigns.

The new guidance can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf. The relevant portion of the guidance is extracted below:\n\n8.3 Outbreak thresholds\n-----------------------\n'The purpose of declaring an outbreak is to determine when appropriate public health interventions should be considered. In contrast to previous guidance in which a threshold of 3 cases of the same serogroup with an attack rate of more than 10 cases per 100 000 population during a 3- month period was used to define both organization- and community-based outbreaks, the current guidance does not recommend the use of an absolute threshold. However, the following thresholds can be considered as guidance, with considerable flexibility to account for the unique nature of each meningococcal disease outbreak.\n\nFor organizations, 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within a 3-month period is considered to be an outbreak (Box 4 -- see below). In most situations, 2 cases within an organization constitute an outbreak. However, in some situations, such as an outbreak within a large university (for example one with more than 20 000 undergraduate students) where no identifiable subgroup at risk within the population can be identified, it may be reasonable to declare an outbreak after 3 cases.\n\n'For communities, an outbreak is defined as multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period (Box 4). Several strategies may be considered to determine whether incidence is above expected in a community. For instance, incidence during the current 3-month period can be compared with the incidence during a similar time period in previous years, or in the setting of very low or unstable monthly incidence, annual incidence in the 3-5 years prior. If community incidence has historically been very low or zero, comparisons against state or national incidence can be made. Additional supportive evidence of an outbreak should be solicited, such as similarity of the strains by molecular typing and common epidemiologic or social characteristics of cases. Consultation with CDC is encouraged if an outbreak is suspected.\n\n'Box 4. Outbreak thresholds\nThresholds by outbreak type\nOrganization-based: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period.\nCommunity-based: multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period.\n\n'Although an absolute outbreak threshold is no longer used, calculating an outbreak attack rate may still be useful in determining the magnitude of an outbreak and comparing against a historical baseline. An outbreak attack rate per 100 000 population is calculated as follows: [(number of outbreak-associated meningococcal disease cases during a 3-month period) / (population at risk)] x 100 000. The epidemiology of the cases should be used to determine the appropriate denominator for attack rate calculations and should include the population of the smallest geographic area that contains the cases and be limited to the sub-populations in which cases were reported (such as among certain age-groups or social networks). For some populations, such as MSM [men who have sex with men], determining the denominator can be very challenging. Results of local or statewide surveys (such as proportion of adult male population that is MSM, proportion of population with HIV) along with census data can be helpful in estimating population sizes.\n\n'Previous versions of the outbreak guidance do not define the term 'cluster' of meningococcal disease, though this term is used informally by public health officials. In this updated guidance, the term cluster can be used to describe a grouping of cases thought to be epidemiologically related that are still under investigation or that do not meet the definition of an outbreak.\n\n9. Vaccination\n--------------\n9.1 Decision to vaccinate\n'Vaccination is the preferred control measure for meningococcal disease outbreaks of all serogroups commonly seen in the United States (B, C, W, and Y). However, many factors should be taken into consideration when determining the need for vaccination. While the number of cases is important, other factors to consider include the population size, ability to define a target group for vaccination, whether ongoing transmission is likely, feasibility of a vaccination campaign, and timing of potential vaccination in relation to cases. In situations where ongoing transmission is unlikely (such as cases limited to household members, roommates, or boyfriend/girlfriend), a vaccination campaign is not necessarily indicated as long as antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts is implemented to prevent further transmission.\n\n'The guidance above suggests thresholds for considering vaccination, but decisions to vaccinate should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the local/state health department and CDC taking into account all circumstances and epidemiology specific to the outbreak.'\n\nIn terms of an organization-based outbreak, a cluster of 6 cases was reported from Navesau Adventist High School (boarding school) from [28 Feb to 28 Mar 2018], that is, more than the CDC definition of an outbreak of 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period. Vaccination, presumably with a conjugate meningococcal vaccine that covers meningococcus serogroup C, of students at Navesau Adventist School began [5 Apr 2018].\n\nIn terms of a community-based outbreak, with a total of 38 cases in the 1st 3 months of 2018 and the population of Fiji being 920 938 (July 2017 est.) (https://www.indexmundi.com/fiji/demographics_profile.html), the national attack rate is 4.1/100 000, as reported above. However, all cases in 2018 were less than 19 years of age and almost 85 percent of cases (32 cases) were less than 15 years of age. This age group represents the population at greatest risk; with 27.7 percent of the Fiji population or about 255 100 people in this age group (https://www.indexmundi.com/fiji/demographics_profile.html), their attack rate is 32 cases/255 100 (that is, 12.5/100 000) in the 1st 3 months of 2018, which is much more than the only 1 to 10 cases, or 0.11 - 1.1 cases/100 000 reported annually in years prior to 2016 (see prior ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Fiji: fatal 20180321.5701022). However, we don't have a breakdown by age for cases before 2016; but, assuming all the cases (1 to 10 cases) were 14 years of age or less, with about 30 percent of the population being 14 years of age or less, or about 270 000 children, the annual attack rate for children 14 years of age or less would be 1 to 10/270 000 or 0.37 to 3.7/100 000.\n\nWe are told in the report above that Fiji's Central Division has the highest meningococcal meningitis incidence of 6.0/100 000 (23 cases/383 333 population). However, assuming 30 percent of the Central Division population is under 15 years of age, this group has an attack rate of 20/100 000 (23/115 000).\n\nNevertheless, no mention is made about vaccinating all Fiji children less than 15 years of age or vaccinating this age group in the Central Division. Also, genotyping of meningococcal isolated would help establish an outbreak strain.\n\nFiji is an island nation of more than 330 islands in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 miles) north east of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji).

After investigation, another 2 soldiers who served in the same base with the index case developed symptoms of meningitis and were reported subsequently. Blood cultures from all 3 cases yielded serogroup B _Neisseria meningitidis_ with indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. A total of 114 contacts received chemoprophylaxis with rifampin or ciprofloxacin. Nevertheless, the hospital laboratory found that the isolate from the index case was resistant to ciprofloxacin.

Over recent years Fiji has had an increase in cases of meningococcal disease. Prior to 2016, there were 1 to 10 cases per year reported. In 2016 there were 29 cases, and in 2017 there were 48 cases. In 2018, there have been 18 cases as of [21 Feb 2018].\n\nEven with the recent increase in cases, meningococcal disease remains uncommon in Fiji; however, this disease has a high death rate. According to WHO, without appropriate medical treatment, up to 5 per cent of people who get the disease will die. Most people who get the disease, and are treated appropriately, will recover fully; however 10-15 per cent will still die, and around 2 per cent will have permanent disabilities, including severe brain damage.\n\nIn 2017, 14.4 per cent of all people who had meningococcal disease in Fiji died. To put this in context, the death rate for dengue fever in Fiji is 0.4-0.6 per cent annually, even during outbreaks. This is why the Ministry of Health and Medical Services is taking nationwide action.\n\nThe meningococcal disease bacteria are not easily transmitted but are spread from person to person via transfer of saliva or spit. This can happen when a person with the bacteria coughs on an uninfected person, or deeply kisses an uninfected person on the mouth. It may also be spread through sharing of drinks from the same glass/cup, water bottle or bowl, such as kava or taki alcohol at a nightclub. Babies and children under the age of 5 frequently put things into their mouths, therefore they are also at risk of getting the bacteria.\n\n[byline: Akosita Talei]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above fails to characterize the patients with invasive meningococcal disease; for example, were they part of the population at increased risk for meningococcal disease because of age; a medical condition (complement component deficiencies), HIV infection, or absent spleen; travel or residence in countries in which the disease is common; or being a college student or military recruit living in a residence hall.

This region has been plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm). The meningitis outbreaks occur in the dry season (Dec to Apr) and end at the onset of the rainy season (May to Jun). Larger outbreaks occur every 8-12 years (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis have ranged from 100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as high as 1000 per 100 000 (http://www.bioline.org.br/request?ms03017).\n\nHowever, the epidemiology of meningitis in the African meningitis belt changed after preventive mass vaccination of the population with conjugate meningococcal meningitis serogroup A vaccine (MenA) was introduced in 2010. Prevention consisted of vaccinating all those aged one to 29 years in the African meningitis belt with the MenA conjugate vaccine. As of November 2017, more than 280 million people have been vaccinated in 21 African belt countries (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Subsequently, serogroup A meningococcus has been replaced by other meningococcal serogroups and other bacterial species. A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at http://www.medic8.com/images/map4-9.gif.\n\nDuring 2016, preventive campaigns with MenA were conducted for the first time in South Sudan, which covered 37 counties in 6 states (Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, Lakes, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap and Western Bahr el Ghazal) (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/254901/1/WER9213.pdf?ua=1).

They also have declined to give the student's age, grade or gender. However, a spokeswoman for the Corvallis School District said [Wed 17 Jan 2018] that the child is doing better. 'As of this morning, the student is recovering,' Brenda Downum told the Gazette-Times.\n\nFautin said parents should make sure their children have all age-appropriate vaccinations, including the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine that is recommended for young people between the ages of 11 and 21. Parents should seek immediate medical attention if their child shows signs of meningococcal disease, which can be fatal or cause life-altering complications including brain damage, loss of hearing or vision, and amputation of limbs.\n\nIn the case of the Linus Pauling student, Fautin said, 'that was an alert parent who saw a stiff neck and rash and got this kiddo into emergency care promptly.'\n\nWhile the disease can strike people of any age, it mainly afflicts young people between the ages of 18 and 24 and is relatively rare in children of middle school age. It is not highly contagious but can be spread through prolonged, face-to-face exposure to an infected person.\n\nThe disease spreads via body fluids and can be passed from one person to another by sharing eating and drinking utensils or smoking paraphernalia or through kissing, coughing or sneezing. People who may have been exposed can be treated with antibiotics as a precaution. County health workers are in the process of contacting people who may have been exposed to the infected student, Fautin said. The Corvallis School District sent an email to Linus Pauling parents about the situation on [Wed 17 Jan 2018] morning, Downum said, and is mailing letters to families who don't have email.\n\n'We are sharing information with all the families at the school to make sure they know the signs' of meningococcal disease, she said. 'We're just allowing the Health Department to do their work and reminding families to watch for signs.'\n\n[Byline: Bennett Hall]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHannah Carey, MPH\n<hannah.carey@valleyaidsinfo.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Hannah Carey for submission of the above news report.\n\n- In November 2016, ProMED-mail posted a report that 2 Oregon State University (OSU) students in Corvallis, Oregon were diagnosed with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine 20161123.4649319).\n- In March 2017, we posted a report of a 3rd student on the Corvallis campus was reported with IMD due to serogroup B meningitis (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine, RFI 20170305.4881298).\n- In October 2017, we posted a report of a 4th OSU student on the Corvallis campus with IMD that was subsequently confirmed to be also serogroup B (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college 20171030.5412497).\n- In November 2017, we posted a report of a 5th OSU student with IMD due to serogroup B (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (06): (OR) college, sg B 20171130.5473532); and - In Dec 2017, we posted a report of a 6th OSU student with IMD, that is now said in the news report above to be serogroup B (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (07): (OR) college, sg B 20171222.5520017).\n\nMany of these cases occurred despite campus-wide vaccination programs with a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine started in November 2016 and the requirement that incoming students at OSU be vaccinated against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y.

The infection came from a fungus, called _Cryptococcus_, that most people contract from inhaling contaminated dust or eating food that mouse feces have touched [sic, see below].\n\nMeningitis is the most common illness to develop from exposure to _Cryptococcus_, and causes potentially fatal inflammation in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nDr Bryan Shapiro, who treated the woman, says that cannabis smokers in California should be sure to know where their marijuana came from, especially if their immune systems are compromised in any way, as meningitis could be lethal for them.\n\nThe unnamed woman's sister brought her to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) in Los Angeles, California. She had 'strange symptoms,' Dr Shapiro said, including being dizzy, tired, struggling to recall even her own name, and behaving aggressively. In fact, her behavior had become so erratic that she was fired from her job as an administrative assistant before being admitted to the hospital.\n\nAt CSMC, the emergency room team could not figure out what was ailing the otherwise healthy patient. When she assaulted a nurse, the team called in the psychiatric department. 'We thought it might be catatonia [abnormal movement triggered by mental issues], and it took us some time to rule out a psychiatric illness,' Dr Shapiro said.\n\nStill unable to diagnose her, they took a sample of her brain fluid [cerebrospinal fluid or CSF], which tested positive for _Cryptococcus neoformans_, 'a rare fungal infection usually only seen in people with late stage HIV or transplant patients,' Dr Shapiro explained.\n\nBut the woman was otherwise in reasonably good health. The only things that stood out in her medical history were high blood pressure and a significant marijuana habit. 'She said she had smoked between 3 and 6 marijuana blunts about daily since her teenage years,' Shapiro said, 'I've never known a patient who smokes that heavily and wondered if there could be a link between her heavy cannabis use for a lifetime.'\n\nThey treated the woman for meningitis, but if they hadn't done so 'prudently...there is a strong possibility she would have died, she was very, very severe at the time we saw her,' he says.\n\nAs she was recovering, Dr Shapiro and his team investigated her favorite medical marijuana dispensary in Bakersfield where she always purchased one of the shop's cheaper strains, which was grown locally outdoors. DNA sequencing of 9 samples revealed small amounts of the rare fungus. 'That lent credibility to the idea that the _Cryptococcus_ in the cannabis may have caused the woman's systemic malfunction, and smoking might actually predispose someone to invasive fungal infection,' Dr Shapiro said.\n\nFungus spores are actually grown on cannabis quite commonly. A study conducted last year [2017] identified evidence of mold, pesticides, and other contaminants on much of the weed grown in the state [2]. More than 90 percent of the marijuana plants tested were contaminated with pesticides, and crops from 20 farms were positive for mold.\n\nThe soil in Bakersfield and the surrounding Central Valley area is known to be a breeding ground for another fungus called _Coccidioides immitis_, which is to blame for a slew of cases of an infection, dubbed 'valley fever' [aka, coccidioidomycosis].\n\nValley fever is a potentially severe lung infection and its symptoms can mirror those of the flu that has killed nearly 100 people in California since the start of the year [2017 ?]. The prevalence of the valley fever fungus -- which causes infection when it is inhaled -- in the area 'raised suspicions' for Dr Shapiro and his team that the soil could harbor _Cryptococcus_ as well. The spores of these fungi are very heat resistant, so they survive even as the weed they are attached to is smoked.\n\nEven so, it is rare for someone with an otherwise healthy immune system to get such an infection, and Dr Shapiro points to other research that has suggested that THC [tetrahydrocannabinol] -- the psychoactive component of weed -- may itself suppress the immune system. 'So, the more you smoke, the greater the exposure [to the fungus and] the more likely it is that your body is unable to fight off the infection,' he says.\n\nDr Shapiro was unable to disclose the name of the particular dispensary that the contaminated marijuana came from, but said that it is under investigation.\n\nThis case was the 1st of its kind that Dr Shapiro or his team had seen, so it's too early to make formal recommendations, he says, but advises: 'Make sure you know where your marijuana is coming from. 'I recommend buying indoor-grown strains and, for people who are immuno-compromised like those with HIV or other infections, I would recommend avoiding inhaled marijuana products,' he says. Edible products, on the other hand are probably safer for consumption.\n\n[Byline: Natalie Rahhal]\n\n[References\n-----------\n1. Shapiro BB, Hedrick R, Vanle BC, et al.

These 2 species have 5 serotypes based on antigenic specificity of the capsular polysaccharide; these include serotypes A, D, and AD (_C. neoformans_) and serotypes B and C (_C. gattii_). The ecologic niches for _C. neoformans_ and _C. gattii_ appear to be distinct. _C. gattii_ lives in the soil and areas on or around trees, such as the eucalyptus. _C. gattii_ is not associated with birds, whereas _C. neoformans_ is found in the accumulated droppings around roosting and nesting sites of birds, especially pigeons. Pigeons are not known to acquire symptomatic disease but can carry cryptococci on feathers, skin, in the crop and cloaca [common cavity into which the intestinal, genital, and urinary tracts open]. _Cryptococcus neoformans_ was the cryptococcal species isolated from the patient's cerebrospinal fluid in the above news report.\n\nCryptococci can become aerosolized when dried bird droppings or contaminated soil are stirred up. People can become infected when they inhale aerosolized cryptococci, which primarily infect the lung, but may subsequently spread systemically via the bloodstream, especially to the central nervous system where the organisms cause a basilar meningoencephalitis. Mice and their feces are not involved with this disease.\n\nA University of California (UC) Davis group had previously reported that one of their immunocompromised patients developed a fungal infection after using aerosolized marijuana (https://www.eastcountymagazine.org/tainted-marijuana-kills-california-man-contaminated-plants-found-statewide). The patient had been told by the dispensary that the marijuana product, which consisted of raw, blended marijuana that was inhaled as a mist, was a safer alternative to smoking (https://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/11791).

School officials did not detail how they would enforce the vaccination requirement but indicated they would have rules that could not be easily circumvented. 'If you are not vaccinated against this disease and you are a student on that campus, you are at risk for meningococcal infection,' said Dr Paul Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division. 'We do feel that now, because there is a break between classes, that this is the best time for students to get vaccinated.'\n\nMeningococcal disease is not a highly contagious disease, but it has a 100 percent fatality rate without antibiotic treatment. Even with antibiotics, some 15 percent of those infected will die. Another 15 to 20 percent will incur long-term consequences such as brain damage or the loss of fingers or limbs. 'This disease can progress from sort of feeling like you have the flu and feeling crummy to being catastrophic very quickly,' said Charlie Fautin, deputy director of the Benton County Health Department. 'We've been very fortunate in this outbreak. The 5 previous students all made full recoveries.'\n\nThe outbreak began in November 2016 when 2 students were hospitalized with meningococcal B disease in less than a week. A 3rd student was diagnosed in March [2017], prompting a formal declaration of an outbreak.\n\nSchool officials organized 2 mass vaccination clinics in the spring and 3 more this fall [2017]. Vaccination efforts mainly targeted students with frequent close contact, including those living in residences and group housing, and on athletic teams. The school already had a requirement to get a meningococcal vaccine that protects against the A, C, Y, and W strains of the disease. But that vaccine offers no protection against the B strain that is currently circulating on the Corvallis campus. The school revised its vaccination guidelines for the current school year, requiring all incoming freshmen and transfer students to be vaccinated specifically for meningococcal B disease by the 1st week of November [2017] in order to register for winter term classes.\n\nBut a 4th student was diagnosed in October and a 5th in November [2017] while home for Thanksgiving [23 Nov 2017] outside of Corvallis. The 6th case was a 21-year-old student hospitalized [17 Dec 2017] while visiting family. Testing to confirm the strain has not been completed.\n\n'We realize now, with this case which involves an older student not living in congregate housing, like residence halls or group living, that we need to up our requirements,' said Steve Clark, OSU vice president for university relations and marketing, who has spearheaded the school's response to the outbreak.\n\nThe standard approach with a single case of meningococcal disease is to provide antibiotics to those in close contact with the infected person. But as the outbreak spread across the campus, with no obvious link between the 6 cases, officials had to broaden the scope of their interventions. 'The problem is the cat's out of the bag. It's spread completely through the campus,' Cieslak said. 'It's not like it's in one dorm, one fraternity or one athletic team. Therefore the only way to protect people is to get them all immune.'\n\nMeningococcal disease can include meningitis, an infection of the fluids that line the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis symptoms can include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea and confusion. The bacteria can also cause a blood infection, known as meningococcemia, with symptoms such as fever, shaking chills, rash, fatigue, severe aches and pains and rapid breathing. The disease is spread when a healthy person comes in close contact with an infected person's nose or throat fluids, such as droplets from a sneeze, spit or saliva. It occurs most often among large groups of people living in close quarters, such as in university residences, group housing or fraternities or sororities. The bacteria are being spread from student to student on campus with most infections not causing recognizable symptoms. 'We don't know who they are, and we don't know who it's going to strike next,' Cieslak said.\n\nPublic health officials urged families and friends to be on the lookout for symptoms of meningococcal disease, and recommend that doctors have a low threshold for suspecting the condition, particularly in OSU students.\n\nIn 2015, the University of Oregon had a meningococcal B outbreak affecting 6 students, one of whom died. The university held 4 mass vaccination clinics with the goal of immunizing all undergraduate students, but according to public health officials, only an estimated 6 percent of students were fully vaccinated.\n\n'The best prevention is vaccination,' Fautin said. 'This is the proven way to disrupt these kinds of outbreaks and our uptake unfortunately has not been as great as we would like.' 2 brands of meningococcal vaccine are licensed for use in the United States from age 10 to 25. Bexsoro requires 2 doses given at least one month apart for full coverage. Trumemba requires 3 doses, with follow-up doses one month and 6 months after the 1st. Cieslak said a single dose of either vaccine is likely to provide only 40 to 60 percent effectiveness, compared to 80 to 90 percent effectiveness for the full series. The vaccines are not interchangeable so follow-up doses should be of the same brand.\n\nDoctors and county health officials in Central Oregon have been on alert for cases, particularly those involving college students. Deschutes County Health Services offers the vaccine and is compiling a list of pharmacies that offer it, including Rite Aid, Walgreens, Fred Meyer, and Safeway on Century Drive. St Charles Health System offers the vaccines in its family care and school-based clinics. The vaccine costs about USD 300 but is covered by insurance plans. Some university students, however, had trouble getting insurance coverage for the vaccine on campus because the providers were out-of-network. The Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3276 to address that issue during outbreaks, and the governor signs the bill into law in August [2017].\n\nThe holiday break, however, often brings students back to their familiar doctors and pharmacists, or back home where parents can ensure their children get vaccinated. Cieslak stressed the importance of prevention as well as timely treatment if symptoms arise. 'It's a nasty virulent bacterium that can affect even perfectly healthy people,' he said. 'And if you have it in your spinal fluid and you don't get antibiotics promptly, you are going to die.'\n\n[Byline: Markian Hawryluk]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In November 2016, ProMED-mail posted a report that 2 Oregon State University (OSU) students in Corvallis, Oregon were diagnosed with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine 20161123.4649319) and in March 2017, meningococcal serogroup B meningitis was reported in a 3rd student on the Corvallis campus (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine, RFI 20170305.4881298).\n\nIn October 2017, we posted a report of a 4th OSU student on the Corvallis campus with IMD; although we were not told at that time what the serogroup of the pathogen was, it apparently was also serogroup B (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college 20171030.5412497) and in Nov 2017 we were told of a 5th OSU student has developed IMD due to serogroup B (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (06): (OR) college, sg B 20171130.5473532).

The organism can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans. Most human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.\n\nContamination of food can occur in nature, e.g., raw vegetables contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk by infected cows, or contamination can occur following cooking or other processing.\n\nBecause _Listeria_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures listeriosis is commonly associated with ingestion of contaminated food that have been held at refrigeration temperatures and then eaten without further cooking, e.g. ready-to-eat deli meats and cole slaw. The sources of human infection can be pinpointed by DNA identification techniques matching _Listeria_ isolated from a possible source with isolates recovered from a patient.\n\nListeriosis affects mainly pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, and adults with impaired immune systems. Infection can cause diarrhea and in some patients invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth.

The event was detected on 30 Nov 2017 when a cluster of 13 cases of severe acute respiratory illness was reported from Kumasi Academy Senior High School. The initial cases developed illness on 29 Nov 2017 and 3 deaths were reported by 1 Dec 2017.\n\nThe case-patients presented with fever, cough, headache, joint and body pains, and abnormal chest auscultation. As of 9 Dec 2017, 77 cases with 4 deaths (case fatality rate 5.2 percent) have been the reported. The majority of the cases, 66 percent, were males and over 95 percent of the cases are teenagers. Thus far, the disease is still localized in the school as no cases have been reported among community members.\n\nLaboratory specimens, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and throat swabs were collected from the case-patients and sent to Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR), Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research (KCCR), and other public health laboratories. Test results from NMIMR (a national influenza centre) released on 6 Dec 2017 indicated that 12 out of 19 throat swabs were positive for influenza A H1N1 2009 pandemic strain using polymerase chain reaction.\n\nCorroborative test results from KCCR released on 7 Dec 2017 showed that seven out of 25 nasal and throat swabs were positive for influenza type A using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR).\n\n2 blood specimens tested negative for Ebola and Marburg virus diseases, Lassa fever, yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus. Specimens analyzed in other public health and research laboratories were negative for meningitis and encephalitis. Accordingly, the Ministry of Health has declared an outbreak of influenza A H1N1 pandemic strain as further epidemiological investigations are ongoing.\n\nKumasi Academy High School is a mixed sex school with total population of 3010 (2814 students including 541 day students, 127 teaching staff, and 73 non-teaching staff).\n\nPublic health actions\n---------------------\nThe Minister of Health and the WHO Representative held a press briefing to inform the public and provide updates on the outbreak.\n\nThe Ministry of Health deployed a multi-disciplinary rapid response team to Kumasi to conduct the outbreak investigation and support response actions. WHO provided technical and logistical support to the investigation mission.\n\nActive surveillance has been enhanced: a case definition was developed and active case search is being done among students and staff at the school and four healthcare facilities that treated the ill students. Suspected cases are being line listed.\n\nFour hospitals in Kumasi have been designated as isolation and treatment centres. Doctors have been assigned to the school Sick Bay to provide high-level pre-referral care to students.\n\nPublic health education and community sensitization are ongoing. The Public Health Directorate has granted media interviews to provide updates on the outbreak and actions being taken. Simple messages on infection prevention and control have been developed for education at the school.\n\nSituation interpretation\n------------------------\nThe influenza A H1N1 virus that caused the 2009 pandemic is now a regular human influenza virus circulating seasonally worldwide. However, seasonal influenza spreads easily, with rapid transmission in crowded areas including schools. This is the case for the event in Kumasi, Ghana. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets containing viruses (infectious droplets) are dispersed into the air and are spread to persons in close proximity who breathe these droplets in. The virus can also be spread by contamination of hands with influenza viruses, which are then deposited on fomites.\n\nGhana has a good influenza preparedness system. The National Influenza Centre at NMIMR is part of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN), coordinated by WHO since 1996. Furthermore, the country is benefiting from the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework for determination of influenza burden of disease. The PIP Framework facilitates sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits to improve global pandemic influenza preparedness and response. These capabilities enhanced the ability to detect the current outbreak in real time and initiate containment measures. Going forward, it is necessary to remain vigilant and continue active epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance for early detection of further transmission of the virus in the community.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Mon 11 Dec 2017\nFrom: Kwadwo Ansah Koram <KKoram@noguchi.ug.edu.gh> [edited]\n\n\nTo provide some information on the H1N1 outbreak in Kumasi Academy, the 19 samples received for testing at Noguchi Memorial Institute were nasopharyngeal swabs from some of the sick individuals on admission at the time.\n\n--\nDr Kwadwo Ansah Koram\nProfessor\nNMIMR [Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research]\nUniversity of Ghana\nLegon, Ghana\n<KKoram@noguchi.ug.edu.gh>\n\n[The diagnosis for the illness that affected a total of 77 Kumasi Academy students since the end of November 2017 has now been apparently confirmed to be influenza due to A/(H1N1)pdm09.

Addressing Parliament on Friday [8 Dec 2017], the Health Minister, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu, said efforts are already underway in this regard while disease surveillance measures are being strengthened.\n\nParents want public health prioritized. 'Mr. Speaker, going forward, the ministries of Health and Education, the Ghana Health Service, and the Ghana Education Service have recommended, and we are embarking upon that, that students should continue to remain [on the school's premises] to enable final conclusion and response actions,' the Minister said.\n\nInitially, the Kumasi Academy was set to close down today [Fri 8 Dec 2017] until it became clearer that the health crisis in the school was brought by the pandemic strain of influenza type A, H1N1 2009, also known as swine flu.\n\nThe government is thus looking for support from the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide influenza vaccines for the students and staff.\n\nThe health crisis at the school has claimed 4 lives and hospitalized at least 32. However, the outright cause of death of the 4 students of the school and the hospitalization of 32 has yet to be fully confirmed.\n\nMinister of Health, Kwaku Agyemang-Manu added on the floor of Parliament that the government was going to rely on antiviral agents. 'We have procured already, and we are in the process of procuring, antiviral agents for case management. So far, that is what has been used, and it looks like it has succeeded in containing and treating the disease. Aside from these, steps are also being taken to enhance school health at Kumasi Academy, and there will be strict adherence to infection prevention and control measures along with intensified sensitisation and public education,' Mr. Agyemang-Manu added.\n\n[Byline: Delali Adogla-Bessa]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Sun 10 Dec 2017\nSource: Ghana Web [edited]\nhttps://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/Kumasi-Academy-deaths-608240\n\n\nFinally, the health authorities have confirmed that there is an influenza outbreak at Kumasi Academy School.

How and where have these been monitored? Are there plans to provide them with chemoprophylaxis?\n\nIn March of this year [2017], 4 students of the same school were reported to have died of meningitis. If this report is accurate, what measures were taken before the students returned to school?\n\nIn an interaction with the press, the Minister of Health indicated that the president had been exposed. Who determined the exposure? If indeed the president was exposed, what steps have been taken to safeguard his health? Why was he permitted to go to the campus when there was an outbreak whose source had not been determined?

This is something that UMass trains for each year, but hasn't had to do in a real-world situation since the 2009 outbreak of Swine Flu.\n\nMeningitis is a potentially deadly bacterial infection. There are 2 confirmed cases at UMass and more may be carrying the bacteria. 'This bacteria exists as a carrier state mostly and it occasionally causes disease,' explained Dr. George Corey, the Executive Director of UMass University Health Services. 'So for every case there could be many carriers who will never become ill.'\n\nCDC testing shows the 2 sick students, who did not know each other, had the same genetic virus, which suggests that others who don't show symptoms may have the bacteria dormant in their body. That's why UMass is holding their 1st of 4 mass vaccination clinics [Thu 30 Nov 2017] inside the Student Union.\n\n'There's a good chance or a worrisome chance that someone else could get ill,' said UMass Public Health Nurse Ann Becker. 'The illness is severe enough that we really don't see any of our students get this, not one, one more is too many.' Becker recommends students avoid sharing food, drinks, and close contact, and to wash your hands. 'I am certainly worried. I've been paying attention to e-mails,' said UMass undergraduate student [MW]. 'I personally have not gotten the shot but a lot of my friends have so I think it's in everyone's minds across campus.'\n\nUMass wants you to know this vaccine is different than the meningitis vaccine you were required to get before you enrolled. UMass will bill your insurance, so there should be no out of pocket cost. So far, UMass has vaccinated 1500 students. Faculty and staff are not considered at risk.\n\nAs for the 2 students who already have meningitis, UMass health officials would only say they are getting positive updates.\n\n[Byline: Matt Caron]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A primary case is one that occurs in the absence of previous known close contact with another case-patient.\n\nAn outbreak is defined by the occurrence of at least 3 confirmed or probable primary cases of the same serogroup meningococcal disease during a period of 3 months or less, with a resulting primary attack rate of 10 or more cases per 100 000 population.

Over 40 students have been affected, with 19 currently on admission at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) Hospital and Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital.\n\nThe assurance comes as students and teachers undergo antibiotics medication supplied by the World Health Organization. They are expected to complete the 3-dose medication they started on [Tue 5 Dec 2017].\n\nNineteen students, 16 on admission at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Hospital and 3 at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital are said to be responding to treatment. Their high body temperatures are said to have normalised after taking azithromycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. With these actions taken, Dr Tinkorang is full of hope that no student will die again at Kumasi Academy. 'Every child will survive in this school. No child will die. I must assure you. Once you take the treatment, there would be no problem. Everybody will survive,' he assured.\n\nDr Tinkorang was speaking on [Tue 5 Dec 2017] during a meeting with parents, students, and teachers of KUMACA to begin the antibiotic medication. The Ministry of Education announced the school would be closed down to enable health officials to carry thorough investigations and surveillance in the school.\n\n[Byline: Ohemeng Tawiah]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 6 Dec 2017 11:12:16 AM GMT\nSource: Myjoyonline [edited]\nhttps://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2017/December-6th/strange-deaths-kumasi-academy-may-be-closed-down-thursday.php\n\n\nThe Health Minister, Kwaku Agyemang-Manu, has said the Kumasi Academy will not be closed down as stated earlier. The Ashanti Regional Minister, Simon Osei Mensah had told Luv News' Ohemeng Tawiah earlier that authorities were considering closing down the school on [Thu 30 Nov 2017].\n\nJoy News' Parliamentary Correspondent, Joseph Opoku Gapko, however, reports the Health Minister as saying adequate measures are being put in place to contain the situation, which has so far cost government GHS 100 000 [about USD 22 000]. Frantic efforts are being made to ascertain the cause of deaths at the school following the outbreak of an 'unknown' illness.\n\nSo far, 4 students -- 3 boys and a girl -- have lost their lives to the illness doctors at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital have described as the 1st of its kind in Ghana. Some 18 other students are on admission, while 6 have been treated and discharged.\n\nThe female student who died yesterday [5 Dec 2017] is reported to have had a high body temperature and died after she was rushed to the hospital.\n\nSchool and health authorities are undertaking a screening and treatment exercise for students. A number of students who left the school returned this morning [6 Dec 2017] to take part in the screening and treatment. They will, however, return to their various homes after school closes today and return tomorrow for teaching and learning to continue.\n\nAlready, most of the students have taken a broad-spectrum antibiotics being administered by health authorities. They suspect the cause of the deaths is a bacterial infection and they believe the antibiotics being administered will weaken it. Although the specific illness is still not known, health authorities expect each student to take the antibiotic before they go home to prevent the spread of the disease in case it is contagious. Tests are still being run and health authorities are hopeful that they will soon arrive at the real cause of the situation.\n\nOhemeng said the panic-stricken parents are cooperating with school and health authorities although they say there has been a lack of transparency on the issue.

The Minister is expected to meet with health officials and education authorities to explore ways to prevent more deaths in the school.\n\nThe death of a female student [Tue 5 Dec 2017] brings to 11 the total number of deaths recorded in KUMACA since March [2017]. She reportedly had increased body temperature but she died after she was rushed to a hospital.\n\nThere were reports meningitis was the cause of the deaths, but autopsy reports released on two of the bodies did not support that claim. Nhyira FM's Ohemeng Tawiah reported the examination conducted by a senior pathologist in Kumasi was not able to establish the cause of death, which further heightened the concerns of school authorities.\n\nAlready, parents and guardians have thronged the school to withdraw their wards.\n\nBut Asokore Mampong Municipal Chief Executive, Alidu Seidu, has said any parent who would want to take the ward will be required to sign a form to that effect. The situation has triggered concerns in Parliament, with lawmakers asking for Health Minister, Kwaku Agyeman Manu, to be summoned over the matter.\n\nAsawase Member of Parliament, Muntaka Mubarak Mohammed, said he has been inundated with calls over the health situation in the school. 'Fear and panic by students, by parents, and school authorities,' he told his colleagues in parliament, expressing worry that the release of students to their parents will jeopardize public safety. But the Health Minister who appeared before Parliament, later [Tue 5 Dec 2017] has pleaded for more time to ascertain the cause of deaths in the school.\n\n'As I speak the heads of public health are all in Kumasi... I will need a little bit of time to get the report,' he said, adding samples taken after the postmortem have been sent to the Noguchi Memorial Institute in Accra for further examination.

A map can be seen at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/pdf/yellowbook-2012-map3-13-frequent-epidemics-meningococcal-meningitis.pdf.\n\nHowever, several studies have emphasized that _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ may also cause outbreaks of bacterial meningitis in an epidemic pattern in the African meningitis belt during the dry season (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/192/2/192.abstract?ijkey=9d47813b96aa1d50880f62e9e7efbc4d32bfea9a&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha and http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.abstract?ijkey=7d2ca30004fffc8d1410102f6ec758a72efc1f82&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha).\n\nSome clarification would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources on the numbers of the affected Kumasi students and their exact diagnoses.\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nAshanti Region, Ghana: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2774. - Mod.ML]", "summary": "(Please see prior ProMED-mail post Meningitis - Ghana: (AH) fatal, high school students, RFI 20170407.4953952) and subsequent ProMED-mail post in Nov 2017 said, 'a thorough autopsy revealed that 4 students of Kumasi Academy Senior High in the Ashanti region died this year [2017] of the disease [pneumococcal meningitis].'

I have forwarded an e-mail sent out to the student body regarding the infection for your records [appended below].\n\n'Date: Sat, Nov 25, 2017 at 4:12 PM\n'Subject: [OSU-students-Corvallis] Urgent vaccinations urged; 5th meningococcal B case reported.\n\n'OSU Corvallis students,\n\n'We are urgently writing to inform you that yet another undergraduate student attending Oregon State University in Corvallis is being treated for meningococcal disease. This is the 5th OSU student to be treated for meningococcal disease in the past year [since November 2016].\n\n'It is important that you are aware of this latest case.\n\n'If you have not done so, we urge you immediately to be vaccinated for meningococcal B disease, which requires at least 2 doses to be effective. If you have started a vaccine series it is important that you compete the series in the requisite timeframe.\n\n'Please be aware that while meningococcal disease is uncommon, it is a serious disease. In 10 to 15 percent of all cases, death may result, as was the case with a University of Oregon student in February 2015. In 20 percent of cases, hearing loss, mental impairment, and limb loss can result. Those at highest risk include students aged 25 and younger who live in residence halls and in private cooperative group living units, or are members of -- or visit -- fraternal living groups associated with the university.\n\n'While extremely serious, meningococcal disease is not highly contagious and is transmitted through direct contact with droplets from an ill person coughing or sneezing; other discharges from the nose or throat; or by sharing of eating and drinking utensils, smoking devices; or intimate contact.\n\n'Health officials encourage everyone to monitor their own health and note the following symptoms specific to this disease: high fever, a rash, headache, stiff neck, exhaustion, nausea or vomiting. If these symptoms develop, seek prompt medical evaluation.\n\n'The best way to prevent meningococcal disease is by vaccination.\n\n'OSU Student Health Services (SHS) and the Student Health Pharmacy continue to provide students meningococcal B vaccines in Plageman Hall, 108 SW Memorial Place. Many other health care providers in the community have the meningococcal B vaccine available on request.\n\n'Before seeking to be vaccinated, students (or their family members) are encouraged to contact their private insurance provider to verify insurance coverage for the vaccine. When speaking with an insurance representative, it is important to mention that OSU Corvallis campus has been designated an 'outbreak' status by federal, state, and county public health officials.\n\n'For those receiving vaccines, SHS will bill students' insurance plans, including the Oregon Health Plan. Vaccines for domestic and international students on OSU's 2 sponsored plans (Aetna Student Health or Pacific Source) will be fully covered.\n\n'Many private insurance plans cover the cost of the meningococcal B vaccine, and SHS is working to ensure as many insurance plans as possible cover the vaccine when given at OSU. SHS will assist international students and others who have plans that do not cover the vaccine if provided at OSU to receive a vaccine at an alternate location. Students 18 or younger without insurance can receive the vaccination through benefits provided by the Oregon Health Plan.\n\n'Regardless of your insurance status, it is essential that students immediately take the time to be vaccinated.\n\n'Oregon State requires incoming students under the age of 22 to have the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (MCV4), which covers multiple strains of the disease but not the B strain. Starting this fall [2017], the university also began requiring incoming students aged 25 and under to receive the meningococcal B vaccine series due to 3 confirmed cases on campus during the last academic year.\n\n'For questions about insurance coverage, please contact the SHS Billing Office at 541-737-8370. Please be sure to bring insurance information to SHS or the OSU pharmacy.\n\n'More information on meningococcal disease is available by calling the OSU Student Health Services Nurse Advice line at 541-737-2724 or Benton County Health Department communicable disease nurses at 541-766-6835 or by visiting these websites:\nhttp://studenthealth.oregonstate.edu/infectious-diseases/meningococcal-disease and http://healthoregon.org/mening.\n\n'Sincerely,\nDan Larson.

In viral meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually visibly clear, but on laboratory examination, the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating. Usually, the CSF glucose level is normal (as compared to bacterial meningitis, where it is low), and the CSF protein level is mildly elevated (where in bacterial meningitis it is significantly elevated). As noted, the symptoms of viral meningitis usually last from 7 to 10 days, and the patient recovers completely.\n\nThe non-polio enteroviruses are the most common causes of viral meningitis, especially during the summer and fall months. Most people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person, through fecal contamination of water or food, or contact with contaminated inanimate objects.\n\nThe ECHO viruses (enteric cytopathic human orphan) viruses are part of the enterovirus species in the picornavirus family.

All gay and bisexual men and men who have sex with men in the state are being offered free quadrivalent ACWY vaccine against invasive meningococcal disease in order to respond to this outbreak.\n\nRisk assessment and descriptive epidemiology\n--------------------------------------------\nA confirmed outbreak case was defined as:\n- a confirmed case of IMD according to the national surveillance case definition (http://www.health.gov.au/casedefinitions); AND\n- where the isolate was typed by the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory in Victoria as _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C; AND\n- who was notified in Victoria during 2017 or was notified in another jurisdiction but is normally resident in Victoria.\n\nA total of 8 confirmed serogroup C cases were identified, with 2 cases becoming ill in May 2017, and 1 each in July, August, September, and October. Onset in the most recent 2 cases occurred in the last week of November. Whole genome sequencing on isolates has demonstrated marked relatedness in all confirmed outbreak cases.\n\nAll cases were hospitalised, and presentations ranged from meningitis (2 cases), sepsis (2 cases), meningitis and sepsis (3 cases), and pneumonia (1 case). The age range of cases was 28 to 43 years, and all cases were male, with almost all reporting MSM sexual activity. Local transmission appears likely with no identified links between cases and only 1 case reported overseas travel in the ten days preceding illness onset. None of the cases are known to be HIV positive.\n\nThe Department has estimated that the attack rate in MSM is high in this outbreak at around 9.8 to 13.3 per 100 000 MSM population, compared to a baseline annual notification rate of IMD in the Victorian population of 1.4 per 100 000.\n\nIn Victoria between 2012-2016 inclusive there were 3 confirmed cases of IMD caused by serogroup C. In 2016 there were a total of 3 serogroup C cases notified across Australia.\n\nPublic health response including control measures\n-------------------------------------------------\nA Chief Health Officer Alert was issued on 7 Dec 2017 (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/about/key-staff/chief-health-officer). This alert advised that gay and bisexual men and MSM who have not received a vaccine against meningococcal serogroup C in the previous 5 years are at increased risk in this outbreak. The Department is providing free 4vMenCV (Menactra) for all gay and bisexual men and MSM, from [Mon 11 Dec 2017 until 30 Jun 2018]. Health professionals were also reminded about other groups who are recommended for meningococcal vaccination under national guidelines (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home), which includes all children aged 12 months, travellers to sites of current overseas epidemics, and people with selected other specific medical conditions listed in that guidance.\n\nThe Department has also called on clinics to bulk-bill consultations when providing this vaccine, which means patients are not charged a consultation fee, as this may make the public health initiative more accessible for some patients recommended for vaccination.\n\nOn [30 Sep 2016] the Australian Government expanded an existing national immunisation register to become a whole of life immunisation register for all Australians, intending to capture all vaccines received across the life course. In the management of this outbreak, the Department is requesting all ACWY vaccinations provided to gay and bisexual men and other MSM to be recorded on this expanded Australian Immunisation Register (AIR), so that uptake can be estimated and the AIR can be as complete as possible.\n\nCommunication with health professionals and the public about the outbreak\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHealth professionals and health services in Victoria receive urgent public health advice through subscribing by email to Chief Health Officer Alerts and Advisories on the Department's website (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/about/key-staff/chief-health-officer).\n\nIn addition to recommending vaccination, the alert issued on [7 Dec 2017] advises health professionals to consider IMD in MSM who present with symptoms consistent with meningitis or septicaemia, and to notify the Department under the Public Health and Wellbeing Regulations 2009 without delay, and to provide immediate antibiotic treatment. Under those Regulations, suspected invasive meningococcal disease is a group A notifiable condition, meaning it must be called through immediately to the Department as the public health authority in the state of Victoria.\n\nFurther information has been made available, including frequently asked questions for MSM (https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/meningococcal-vaccine-for-men-who-have-sex-with-men) and for health professionals (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/immunisation/adults/meningococcal-acwy-vaccine-gbm-msm). The Department's online resource library known as the Better Health Channel (https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/) also contains other information on meningitis and meningococcal disease, as well as accessible health information across a range of other topics.\n\nFurther background on invasive meningococcal disease\n----------------------------------------------------\nFrom 2002 to 2015 the predominant invasive meningococcal disease serogroup in Australia was serogroup B. However, in 2016, serogroup W became the predominant meningococcal serogroup in Australia with a total of 109 cases reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).\n\nInfection with the causative bacteria _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C can cause syndromes including meningitis and sepsis that progress rapidly and can cause death in up to 10 per cent of cases, and permanent sequelae in up to 20 per cent of survivors. Quadrivalent (A, C, W, Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccine (4vMenCV) provides effective prevention for up to five years. Meningococcal bacteria are difficult to spread and are probably only passed from person to person by close, prolonged contact.\n\n--\nDr Finn Romanes, MBBS, MPHTM, FFPH, FAFPHM\nPublic Health Physician\nDepartment of Health and Human Services,\nVictoria State Government\nAustralia\n<finn.romanes@dhhs.vic.gov.au>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Finn Romanes for submitting the alert above.\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is usually transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions, mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. However, recent data suggest that meningococci can adapt to a urethral location (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28373547) and can be transmitted by sexual activity.\n\nUrogenital infections due to _N. meningitidis_ have been reported sporadically in the past, but in 2015, a marked increase in the incidence of meningococcal urethritis was noted in heterosexual men at 2 US sexual health clinics, one in Columbus, Ohio, and another in Oakland County, Michigan, as well as in clinics in Atlanta and Indianapolis. Oral sex was reported by almost all patients (see ProMED-mail post Urethritis, meningococcal - USA: (OH,MI) heterosex. men, oral sex trans, non-gr. 20160604.4265651.) The urethral isolates were nongroupable (nonencapsulated), ST-11 clonal complex 11 (cc11), ET-15, and clustered together phylogenetically. Urethral Nm isolates were similar by fine typing (PorA P1.5-1,10-8, PorB 2-2, FetA F3-6) and the strains grow well anaerobically (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28373547, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28481980, and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28098538).\n\nOutbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) have occurred in the past several years among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium, and France caused by a hypervirulent _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C strain (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf). Similar outbreaks among MSM caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C have also occurred in Canada and the US (see ProMED-mail posts listed below).\n\nMeningococci isolated in Germany and France from these MSM with IMD and from MSM with urethritis/proctitis were found to have the same genotype, (serogroup C, PorA type P1.5-1,10-8, FetA type F3-6, and cc11) (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20523 and http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21016). Genome sequencing analysis showed that isolates from MSM with IMD clustered with urethritis and proctitis isolates collected in the 2 countries, distinct from other cc11/ET-15 isolates.\n\nThe meningococcal isolates from both MSM with IMD and urethritis were able to grow anaerobically in the presence of nitrite, as do gonococci, unlike non-MSM/urethritis meningococcal isolates. Anaerobic growth was thought to allow meningococci to survive under anaerobic and acidic pH in the urethra or rectum, leading to the clinical manifestation of urethritis/proctitis as well as the capacity for direct sexual transmission.\n\nHowever, invasive isolates from MSM, but not urethritis isolates, expressed a protein that binds human factor H, a complement regulatory protein, which favors survival in the bloodstream.\n\nThese studies suggested that in the outbreak of IMD in MSM, meningococci were transmitted sexually and that reverted to a phenotype with enhanced bacterial survival in the blood, which facilitated meningococcemia and systemic dissemination.\n\nSimilar to the meningococcal vaccine program in Victoria. Australia, vaccination campaigns with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine directed against serogroup C that target MSM have been carried out in Europe and the US to control outbreaks of IMD in MSM (CDC.

'UHS continues to work in consultation with federal and state public health officials.'\n\nThe 1st UMass student to become ill with the disease was diagnosed [Tue Oct 24 2017] and was initially in critical condition. That student was diagnosed with the serogroup B strain. Three weeks later, the university announced on [Tue 14 Nov 2017] a 2nd person was ill, though it was unclear if student was also suffering from the serogroup B strain.\n\n'As a precaution, students may want to receive the serogroup B vaccine. The vaccine is available at UHS by appointment,' Corey wrote in his email. 'Please call 413-577-5101 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. to schedule an appointment.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says an outbreak occurs when multiple cases of the same strain happen in a short time period.\n\n'Depending on the population size and specific circumstances, health officials may declare an outbreak after just 2 cases,' the centers say. Outbreak control measures include vaccinating people at increased risk of contracting the disease and giving preventative antibiotics to those who were in close quarters with an infected person.

I have forwarded an e-mail sent out to the student body regarding the infection for your records [appended below]:\n\n'From: All Corvallis Student List <osu-students-corvallis@lists.oregonstate.edu>\nDate: Thu, Nov 2, 2017 at 2:30 PM\nSubject: [Osu-students-corvallis] Meningococcal disease results confirmed; vaccines clinics in November\nTo: 'osu-students-corvallis@lists.oregonstate.edu' <osu-students-corvallis@lists.oregonstate.edu>\n\nOSU Corvallis students,\n\nYou may be aware that an undergraduate student attending Oregon State University in Corvallis is being treated for meningococcal disease. We are writing to inform you that lab testing indicates that this infection is the B strain of meningococcal disease - the same type that infected three students on the Corvallis campus during the last academic year. At present, there is only one reported case this academic year.\n\nPlease be aware that meningococcal disease is uncommon, but it is a serious disease. Those at highest risk include students age 25 and younger who live in residence halls and in private cooperative group living units, or are members of - or visit - fraternal living groups associated with the university.\n\nMeningococcal disease is not highly contagious and is transmitted through direct contact with droplets from an ill person coughing or sneezing; other discharges from the nose or throat; or by sharing of eating and drinking utensils, smoking devices; or intimate contact.\n\nHealth officials encourage everyone to monitor their own health and note the following symptoms specific to this disease: high fever, a rash, headache, stiff neck, exhaustion, nausea or vomiting. If these symptoms develop, seek prompt medical evaluation.\n\nThe best way to prevent meningococcal disease is by vaccination. To promote good public health, the university will have two immunization clinics for students this month for meningitis as well as other vaccines:\n\nMeningococcal B Immunization Clinic\n\nWednesday, Nov. 8\n\nMU Multi-Purpose Room 13\n\n9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nImmunizations Offered: Meningococcal (MCV4) and Meningococcal B\n\nImmunization Clinic\n\nTuesday, Nov. 21\n\nMU Journey Room 104\n\n9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nImmunizations Offered: Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR), Varicella (Chickenpox), Hepatitis, Tetanus Diphtheria Pertussis (Tdap), Meningococcal (MCV4) and Meningococcal B.\n\nAdditionally, OSU Student Health Services (SHS) and the Student Health Pharmacy continue to provide students meningococcal B vaccines in Plageman Hall, 108 S.W. Memorial Place. Many other health care providers in the community have the meningococcal B vaccine available on request.\n\nSHS staff will be available to at the clinics to answer questions about individual vaccine needs as well as insurance coverage.\n\nImportant Insurance Information\n\nBefore attending the vaccination clinics, students (or their family members) are encouraged to contact their private insurance provider to verify insurance coverage for the vaccine. When speaking with an insurance representative, it is important to mention that OSU Corvallis campus has been designated an 'outbreak' status by federal, state and county public health officials.\n\nFor those receiving vaccines, SHS will bill students' insurance plans, including the Oregon Health Plan. Vaccines for domestic and international students on OSU's two sponsored plans (Aetna Student Health or Pacific Source) will be fully covered.\n\nMany private insurance plans cover the cost of the Meningococcal B vaccine, and SHS is working to ensure as many insurance plans as possible cover the vaccine when given at OSU. SHS will assist international students and others who have plans that do not cover the vaccine if provided at OSU to receive a vaccine at an alternate location. Students 18 or younger without insurance can receive the vaccination through benefits provided by the Oregon Health Plan.\n\nRegardless of your insurance status, it is important that students take the time to be vaccinated.\n\nOregon State requires incoming students under the age of 22 to have the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (MCV4), which covers multiple strains of the disease but not the B strain. Starting this fall, the university also began requiring incoming students age 25 and under to receive the meningococcal B vaccine series due to 3 confirmed cases on campus during the last academic year.\n\nFor questions about insurance coverage, please contact the SHS Billing Office at 541-737-8370. SHS staff will be at the vaccine clinics to assist with insurance questions as well. Please be sure to bring insurance information to the clinic.\n\nMore information on meningococcal disease is available by calling the OSU Student Health Services Nurse Advice line at 541-737-2724 or Benton County Health Department communicable disease nurses at 541-766-6835 or by visiting these websites:\nhttp://studenthealth.oregonstate.edu/infectious-diseases/meningococcal-disease\nhttp://healthoregon.org/mening.\n\nSincerely,\nDan Larson\nInterim Vice Provost\nStudent Affairs'\n\n--\nHannah Carey, MPH\n<hannah.carey@valleyaidsinfo.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Hannah Carey for submitting the above information regarding meningococcus group B disease on the Oregon State University Corvallis campus. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/239.]", "summary": "To promote good public health, the university will have two immunization clinics for students this month for meningitis as well as other vaccines:\n\nMeningococcal B Immunization Clinic\n\nWednesday, Nov. 8\n\nMU Multi-Purpose Room 13\n\n9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nImmunizations Offered: Meningococcal (MCV4) and Meningococcal B\n\nImmunization Clinic\n\nTuesday, Nov. 21\n\nMU Journey Room 104\n\n9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nImmunizations Offered: Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR), Varicella (Chickenpox), Hepatitis, Tetanus Diphtheria Pertussis (Tdap), Meningococcal (MCV4) and Meningococcal B.\n\n Sincerely,\nDan Larson\nInterim Vice Provost\nStudent Affairs'\n\n--\nHannah Carey, MPH\n<hannah.carey@valleyaidsinfo.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Hannah Carey for submitting the above information regarding meningococcus group B disease on the Oregon State University Corvallis campus.

The 2nd student, who lives in a residence hall, was diagnosed on [Sun 12 Nov 2017] with bacterial meningitis.\n\n'It is not known yet whether the 1st case led to the 2nd case,' University Health Services [UHS] Executive Director George Corey said at a press conference [Tue 14 Nov 2017] afternoon. UMass Amherst is the state's largest public university and more than 3-quarters of its 21 000 undergraduate students are from the state.\n\nMeningococcal disease can lead to meningitis -- a potentially deadly infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord -- and infections of the blood, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even when treated, meningococcal disease kills 10 to 15 percent of infected people, the center says. As many as 10 to 20 percent of survivors suffer disabilities like hearing loss, brain damage, kidney failure and amputations. 'Meningococcal disease often occurs without warning - even among people who are otherwise healthy,' the center says.\n\nThe university said it is reaching out to those close to the student diagnosed this weekend, who is in stable condition at an area hospital. The student diagnosed [24 Oct 2017] is also in stable condition, the university said.\n\n'Because these 2 students were not in close contact with each other, these 2 cases raise our level of concern,' Corey said in a statement. 'UHS is working in consultation with federal and state public health officials, and will be updating advice as more information becomes available.'\n\nThe student diagnosed [24 Oct 2017] has a serogroup B infection, a strain not covered by the meningitis vaccine required for college attendance. That vaccine covers strains A, C, Y and W, the university said. The serogroup B vaccine is available on campus.\n\nMeningococcal disease spreads via close contact like coughing or kissing or lengthy contact among people living in the same household. The university advised students not to 'swap saliva' and to avoid sharing food and drinks, cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing and wash hands regularly.\n\n'As with all vaccines, protection is not immediate and should be thought of as a wise precaution for this winter and for several years to come,' Corey said in a statement.\n\n[Byline: Stephanie Murray]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nAnn Yao Zhang\nUniversity of Rochester\nRochester, New York, USA\n<azhang27@u.rochester.edu>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Ann Yao Zhang for submitting the above information regarding meningococcus group B disease on the University of Massachusetts Amherst with 2 primary cases of meningococcus disease within 1 month.

In Susanville where the outbreak was initially traced to the high school football team and forced the temporary closure of the school as well as the Community College, public health officials say they've had 50 possible cases reported. Of those 22 are suspected and 18 are clinically diagnosed; 16 of which are lab confirmed. Another 10 have been ruled out. Here in Washoe County the count is now 36 cases.\n\nViral meningitis can be caused by a number of different viruses. In this case, there's initial evidence the outbreak is being caused by one particular enterovirus known as ECHO virus 30. 'We've got some evidence suggesting eco30 here,' says Washoe County Epidemiologist Dr. Randall Todd. 'They've got lab evidence suggesting ECHO 30 there. What we want to know is at the molecular level is this the same virus.' That would be a first step toward finding a common source for the outbreaks. 'It's more likely if they are the same molecularly there is a common source.'\n\nUnlike the Lassen County outbreak there appears to be no geographic hot spot here. No school, for instance, with a number of cases.\n\nLarge percentages however, are children. 'As many as 72 percent of the cases were in children,' says Dr. Todd. 'With 53 percent being children that are considered school age, between the ages of 5 and 17; and 67 percent of our cases were male.'\n\nThose numbers are fairly typical of an outbreak of viral meningitis, an inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and the spinal cord. Viral meningitis is less serious than bacterial meningitis. There's no treatment other than for symptoms which include a fever and headaches.\n\nThe advice for avoiding it remains the same. Don't share anything you're going to put in your mouth--a particular note of caution with Halloween and the other holidays coming up. Wash your hands often; keep common surfaces clean and; if you don't feel right see a doctor; don't spread it.\n\n[Byline: Ed Pearce]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It would not be surprising if the agent or agents causing these clusters are the same. The areas are only about 100 miles [approx. 161 km] away as the crow flies.\n\nThe non-polio enteroviruses are the most common causes of viral meningitis, especially during the summer and fall months. Most people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person, through fecal contamination of water or food, or contact with contaminated inanimate objects.\n\nThe ECHO viruses (enteric cytopathic human orphan) viruses are part of the enterovirus species in the picornavirus family.

Most of these cases are serogroup W, which has recently risen across Australia. 10 are definite serogroup W with 5 awaiting final laboratory testing but likely to be serogroup W.\n\nThere has been a rapid increase in meningococcal W disease in the month of September [2017] with 10 cases of confirmed or probable serogroup W reported.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Katherine, with an urban population of 6094 in 2011, is a town in Northern Territory, Australia, 320 km (200 mi) southeast of Darwin and 17 km (10.6 mi) northwest of Royal Australian Air Force Base (RAAF) Tindal, which has a residential population of 742. Katherine provides education, health, local government services and employment opportunities for the families of personnel stationed at RAAF Tindal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine,_Northern_Territory).\n\nFollowing the mass introduction into the population of a vaccine specific for one particular meningococcal serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, such as, serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African meningitis belt following the introduction of A vaccine, only to be replaced by emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups, such as serogroups B and W. A similar situation is apparently occurring in Australia; there has been a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases after the introduction of conjugate meningococcal C vaccine to the National Immunisation Program (NIP) in 2003. Serogroup C disease has become very rare (1.2 percent of cases with identified serogroup in 2016) (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf).

The news report above says that most of the serogroup W infections in the NT have occurred in Aboriginal children living in Katherine.\n\nBecause of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroup W in the UK, the UK is now offering an expanded conjugated serogroup vaccine, the quadrivalent Men ACWY, for adolescents, who are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group, to stop the spread of serogroup W. This is being done by replacing the routine teenage Men C booster with the Men ACWY vaccine (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx).\n\n3 types of meningococcal vaccines are now available in Australia:\n- monovalent meningococcal C conjugate vaccine or meningococcal C conjugate combined with the _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib) vaccine;\n- meningococcal B vaccine;\n- quadrivalent (A, C, W, Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccines.\n\nRoutine meningococcal C conjugate vaccine at 12 months of age is recommended and funded under the NIP (National Immunisation Program).

The new report is only the 3rd case ever reported of this disease being transmitted on an airplane, said Yushi Hachisu, of the Chiba Prefectural Institute of Public Health in Chiba, Japan, who helped investigate the case. Hachisu presented the case on [5 Oct 2017] at IDWeek, an infectious disease conference in San Diego.\n\nMeningococcal disease is caused by the bacteria _Neisseria meningitidis_. About 10 percent of the population carries this bacterium in their nose and throat without showing any symptoms of disease. But the bacteria can cause serious illness if it gets into the blood or the brain. In the brain, the bacteria can cause meningitis -- a swelling of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord; in the blood, it can cause and infection called septicemia.\n\nThe woman and her husband, both in their 50s, were traveling from Japan to Germany on [8 Aug 2015], according to the report. They happened to be on the same flight as a team of Scottish and Swedish scouts who were returning from the World Scout Jamboree, an international gathering of scouts ages 14 to 17. A total of 6 of the scouts later developed meningococcal disease in an outbreak that was linked to attendance at the jamboree. [See ProMED-mail posts in the See Alsos. - Mod.ML]\n\nThe married couple did not sit directly next to the scouts, but sat in a row behind and across the aisle from the Scottish scouts. They noticed that one of the scouts seated in front of them was coughing throughout the flight, the report said. Once they arrived in Germany, the couple hopped on another flight to Spain, where they went sightseeing. But a few days later, on [11 Aug 2017], the woman felt tired and developed pain in her throat and a cough. Her husband also developed pain in his throat and a mild fever.\n\nThey felt sick for the rest of their trip, but felt somewhat better upon their return to Japan on [16 Aug 2015], the report said. However, on [19 Sept 2015], the woman developed a sudden high fever and chills, as well as pain in her joints. She visited four health care facilities and underwent tests before she was finally hospitalized on [25 Sept 2015]. The fluid in her joints tested positive for _N. meningitidis_ bacteria, which means she had a blood infection with _N. meningitidis_ that spread to her joints. Samples taken from the husband's nose and throat also tested positive for _N. meningitidis_, although he did not develop further symptoms. Both the woman and her husband were infected with the same strain of _N. meningitidis_ that caused the outbreak in the scouts, the report said. The woman was treated with antibiotics and recovered.\n\nMeningococcal disease is rare in Japan, with only about 3 cases per 10 million people, the researchers said.\n\nThe new report 'strongly suggests that _N. meningitidis_ was transmitted from the Scottish scouts to the Japanese couple during their international flight,' the researchers wrote in their report.\n\nStill, the overall risk of transmitting meningococcal disease on an airplane is low, Hachisu said. But it can happen -- in 2005, officials in Australia reported cases of 2 people who got sick with _N. meningitidis_ after traveling on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. Officials determined it was likely that one of the infected passengers spread the bacteria to the other passenger, or both of the infected individuals got the bacteria from another person on the flight that wasn't showing symptoms.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that passengers who sit next to someone with _N. meningitidis_ on a flight that is more than 8 hours long receive preventive antibiotics. A longer flight increases the chance of transmission, Hachisu said.\n\n[Byline: Rachael Rettner]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[From 29 Jul 2015 through 8 Aug 2015, about 34 000 boy scouts and their leaders from 150 countries attended an international Jamboree in Yamaguchi, Japan. Invasive meningococcal disease subsequently developed in 3 scouts and one parent from Scotland and 2 scouts from Sweden after Jamboree ended. The index case was reported to have developed symptoms while returning to Scotland. The strains from all 6 cases were identical and belonged to serogroup W (Kanai M, Kamiya H, Smith-Palmer A, et al. Meningococcal disease outbreak related to the World Scout Jamboree in Japan, 2015. Western Pac Surveill Response J. 2017; 8(2): 25-30. Published online 2017 May 8. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729922).\n\nThe Japanese woman and her husband, described in the news report above, were traveling by plane from Japan to Germany on 8 Aug 2015, and sat in a row behind and across the aisle from the Scottish scouts, one of whom, presumably the index case, was coughing throughout the flight. Three days later, they both began to feel ill with pain in the throat. About 6 weeks later, the woman developed a sudden high fever and chills, and was subsequently diagnosed with meningococcal septic arthritis. The incubation period for invasive meningococcal disease is 3 to 4 days, with a range of 2 to 10 days; however, this incubation period commonly pertains to meningitis or meningococcemia (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mening.html).\n\nThe Japanese woman had primary meningococcal arthritis (i.e., arthritis without signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or meningococcaemia), which is rare occurring in as little as 1 percent of meningococcal infections (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628474/). It is usually preceded by an upper respiratory infection in 50-55 percent of presentations, and patients may appear nontoxic, afebrile, and polyarthralgic. Her husband had pharyngitis from which meningococci were isolated.\n\nBoth the woman and her husband were said in the news report above to be infected with the same strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ that caused the outbreak in the scouts. Presumably both wife and husband became infected with the outbreak strain by exposure to the index case on the 8 Aug 2015 airplane flight. However, we are not told if matching isolates was based on genotyping or just that all the isolates were serogroup W. Most likely genotyping was done.\n\nMeningococci are thought to spread from person to person by exposure to nasopharyngeal secretions, which can happen during close contact (coughing or kissing, living in the same household). Dispersion of large droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions occurs within 3 feet of a coughing patient, such as the few rows directly in front of or behind an ill airplane passenger.\n\nOther respiratory illnesses that have spread onboard air flights include influenza, tuberculosis and SARS (1-5). For active tuberculosis in a passenger, all passengers seated on an airplane in the same row and in the 2 rows in front of and behind the index case are considered contacts (http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2006/who_htm_tb_2006_363.pdf).\n\nIn addition to the proximity of passengers to the index case, risk to passengers and flight crew members also depends on the flight duration, the ability of a patient to generate an infectious spray of nasopharyngeal secretions, and the number of organisms per ml of respiratory excretion. However, aircraft ventilation systems are believed to be highly efficient at keeping the air free of pathogens, which it does by exchanging the air frequently in passenger cabins and passing the circulated air through high-efficiency particulate-arresting (HEPA) filters (http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2006/who_htm_tb_2006_363.pdf).\n\nThe U.S. CDC employs a passive surveillance system by which local health departments report suspected cases of air-travel-associated meningococcal disease. In 2001, the CDC reported that from February 1999 through May 2001, it received 21 reports of cases of air-travel-associated invasive meningococcal disease, an average of one report every 6 weeks (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm). Approximately half of these cases were reported to a CDC airport quarantine station, and the rest were reported to CDC headquarters. The mean time between the completion of the flight and the onset of illness was 1.9 days (range: 0--10 days). As many as 5 case-patients had onset of illness before arrival, but the others had onset of illness after the flight had landed and the exposed passengers had dispersed. The CDC noted at the time that no secondary cases among air travel contacts of persons with meningococcal disease had been reported to the CDC, perhaps because of difficulties in subsequently tracing exposed passengers.\n\nBecause the attack rate among close contacts of patients with meningococcal disease is an estimated 500--800 times greater than the general population, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis is recommended for contacts that are exposed to the respiratory secretions of the index patient to prevent secondary cases of meningococcal disease. The assessment of risk to passengers and flight crew members should be based on the flight duration and seating proximity to the index case-patient. The CDC recommends that household members traveling with an index case-patient, persons traveling with an index case-patient who have had prolonged close contact (e.g., roommates), and, for flights more than 8 hours, including ground time, anyone having direct contact with a patient's oral secretions should also be identified and the need for antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis evaluated (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm).\n\nIn the CDC communication (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm), because of the absence of data at the time about increased risk to other passengers, the CDC limited their recommendations for chemoprophylaxis to those passengers seated in either seat next to an index case-patient. However, we now have data that risk extends to passengers in adjacent rows. Because the risk for illness in the close contacts is highest during the 1st few days after infection, chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) after exposure to an index case-patient (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm). Chemoprophylaxis administered later than 14 days is probably of limited or no value.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Moser MR, Bender TR, Margolis HS, Noble GR, Kendal AP and Ritter DG.

Officials say over 30 cases have been reported in Washoe County so far in 2017, with 27 reported since 15 Jul 2017. Patients have ranged in age from one to 81-years-old, and the median average is 13-years-old.\n\nMeningitis is a rare disease that causes inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord usually due to a bacterial or viral infection. While some types of meningitis can be fatal, viral meningitis is [so at least generally is - Mod.LL] the least dangerous type of meningitis. It is also the most common. There are no vaccines and those who get the disease often recover on their own within 7-10 days, but officials say they are continuing to monitor the patients\u0384 progress, and it is still important for anyone experiencing symptoms to see a healthcare provider right away. Babies younger than one-month-old and those with weakened immune systems are more likely to experience serious symptoms from the disease.\n\nDr. Randall Todd, the Director of Washoe County Health District's Epidemiology Division, says that most of the cases reported were hospitalized for about 2 days and have since recovered.\n\nThe Health District and the CDC are working to learn if the outbreak is associated with an outbreak in Susanville, California that prompted the closure of Lassen High School and Lassen Community College. Laboratory tests are underway to determine if there is a link between the 2 outbreaks.\n\nThe disease can be contracted by close contact, such as touching or shaking hands with an infected person; touching objects, surfaces, or dirty diapers that have the virus on them and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; or drinking water with the virus in it. You can prevent the disease by washing your hands often especially after changing diapers, using the toilet, coughing, or blowing your nose. Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands and avoid close contact such as kissing, touching, or sharing cups with people who are ill. The health district also recommends simply staying home when you are ill.\n\nSurfaces that may be contaminated can be disinfected using a bleach solution (1/2 cup [120 mL] of bleach to one gallon [3.785 L] of water.) Areas that should consider deep cleaning include households with anyone recently diagnosed with viral meningitis, community sports clubs, daycare facilities, group home daycare, public museums, playgrounds, or any other facilities that host activities for children, such as churches.\n\nDespite most of the cases being reported in students, Washoe County Schools say at this point they are not planning on closing schools because no single school has more than 2 cases.\n\n[Byline: Jaclyn Shearer]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] California (Lassen County)\nDate: Tue 3 Oct 2017\nSource: KOLO [edited\nhttp://www.kolotv.com/content/news/Susanville-schools-closed-because-of-meningitis-cases-448516563.html\n\n\nLassen High School and Lassen Community College in Susanville, CA, are back open after being closed through 29 Sep 2017 after Lassen County's Public Health Department confirmed viral meningitis in Lassen County. A total of 14 cases have been clinically diagnosed, 9 of them lab-confirmed, of 43 total possible cases in Lassen County.\n\nAccording to a Public Health release, the department is working with medical providers to ensure prompt identification and reporting of patients with signs and symptoms of viral meningitis. Lassen Health says the investigation began with the high school football team, but is not further identifying anyone whose symptoms are being tested.\n\nAccording to the release, viral meningitis is an inflammation of the tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord that is caused by a virus. It is typically less severe than bacterial meningitis, and most people recover on their own within 7 to 10 days. Viral meningitis cannot be treated with antimicrobials, and there is no need for contacts of cases to receive preventive antimicrobials. Although clusters of cases of viral meningitis are not common, they do occur.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It would not be surprising if the agent or agents causing these clusters are the same. The areas are only about 100 miles [161 km] away as the crow flies.\n\nMeningitis refers to the inflammation of the meninges, the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord, and implies lack of specific brain and spinal cord involvement (called encephalitis and myelitis, respectively, although some involvement may be present). In viral meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually visibly clear, but on laboratory examination the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating. Usually the CSF glucose level is normal (as compared to bacterial meningitis where it is low) and the CSF protein level is mildly elevated (where in bacterial meningitis it is significantly elevated). As noted, the symptoms of viral meningitis usually last from 7 to 10 days, and the patient recovers completely.\n\nThe non-polio enteroviruses are the most common causes of viral meningitis, especially during the summer and fall months. However, other causes of viral meningitis include mumps, lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses, arboviruses, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2. Non-infectious causes include certain drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and systemic diseases, such as lupus, sarcoidosis, and metastatic cancer.\n\nMost people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person, through fecal contamination of water or food, or contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Enteroviruses can also be spread through the respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person.\n\nRecently introduced CSF gene screens for viral meningitis/encephalitis can be quite useful in making a specific diagnosis. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3549, http://healthmap.org/promed/p/14040.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n \n\nMeningitis is a rare disease that causes inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord usually due to a bacterial or viral infection. \n\nMeningitis refers to the inflammation of the meninges, the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord, and implies lack of specific brain and spinal cord involvement (called encephalitis and myelitis, respectively, although some involvement may be present).

During the month of April 2017, the number of suspected cases increased followed by a gradual decline in the following 2 months (May and June 2017).

Do we know what strain(s) of meningococcal disease the Taiwan cases had? Were they all the same? If the organisms are distinguishable, we would not consider this an outbreak but, rather, a cluster.\n2. Much of the evidence on which chemoprophylaxis policies are based is now rather old. At the time, it was far more common for students to live in 'dormitories', with 2 or more students sharing a bedroom. Now -- at least in the UK -- this is extremely unusual: most student accommodation has only one student (or couple) per bedroom - no sharing with a relative stranger. A high proportion even have en-suite bathroom facilities. Is that the same in USA? Perhaps the Taiwanese military provides less comfortable lodgings!\n3. What is the basis for the moderator's comment that 'The choice of vaccine will depend on knowing the serogroup of the outbreak strain, because the quadrivalent (ACYW) meningococcal vaccine will cover serogroups A, C, Y, and W, and the serogroup B vaccine will cover only serogroup B, without cross-coverage.' I'm particularly interested in the comment that the 'serogroup B vaccine will only cover...'. Since the so-called serogroup B vaccines do not use the polysaccharide capsule ABCWY antigens, but rather antigens from different part of the organism, they are independent of the ABCWY antigens, and the group B vaccines can be expected to be effective against meningococci independent of the ABCWY classification.\n4. Experience with these new so-called serogroup B vaccines remains limited. At present we do not have evidence to clarify the extent of 'herd immunity' they will provide, but we have some evidence to suggest that they prevent disease (invasion), but not colonization (infection), and are therefore unlikely to have a significant effect on herd immunity.\n5. The rationale for chemoprophylaxis based on the hypothesis that a more-than-usually virulent strain has evolved, with the argument going as follows:\na. Meningococcal carriage is common - in some studies, over a 3rd of 1rst-year university students will be carrying the organism after 2-3 months at university (a combination of the carriage rates in this age-group, and the social-mixing effect of starting at university, presumably).\nb. People [who] become ill with invasive meningococcal disease almost invariably get sick within 5 days of acquiring the organism. If somebody has been colonized for 7 days or more, they are extremely unlikely to get sick with it.\nc. Some strains -- like the C strain that caused outbreaks in teenagers in the UK in the 90s -- are considerably more virulent, with very little asymptomatic carriage. (The virulence genes are unrelated to the capsular phenotype, and capsular switching, maintaining the same virulence factors, is possible and appears to have happened with the increase in W serogroup disease in the UK, for example.[1])\nd. For the less virulent strains at least...\ne. When somebody becomes ill, it could be because of individual factors (the case was unusually susceptible -- for underlying reasons, such as inherited complement deficiencies, or because of an unfortunate timing eg recent viral infection); or because of pathogen associated factors -- the organism had evolved to become more than usually virulent.\nf. Given the high carriage rates, there's little point in chemoprophylaxis for normally virulent organisms.\ng. So chemoprophylaxis is based on the hypothesis that the case may have acquired their infection from a healthy carrier of a more virulent organism. The purpose is to eliminate carriage of this organism. The contacts targeted are therefore those from whom the case is most likely to have acquired their infection. (There is very little evidence of benefit for treating other people exposed to the case.)\nh. There is also a hypothesis -- supported, I believe, by some evidence -- that healthy carriers of meningococci and related organisms (such as _N. lactamica_) can benefit from 'competitive inhibition'. This means that the presence of the organism they are carrying reduces their chances of acquiring a new, potentially more virulent strain - see b. above.\ni. For this reason, extending chemoprophylaxis to people other than those from whom the case acquired their infection might do more harm than good (by increasing people's susceptibility to new infections).\n\n1.

Protection against invasive meningococcal disease is conferred mainly by complement-mediated antibody-dependent killing of _Neisseria meningitidis_. Studies that tested in an in vitro bactericidal assay against serogroup C, W and Y meningococci using sera collected in the UK, Germany, France and Brazil from individuals immunized with one of the B serogroup vaccines found that sera from was bactericidal 'in a range from 45 per cent to 90 per cent' (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4755123/#R11), the preliminary data having been presented in poster sessions.\n\nHowever, on the basis of what we know for sure at present, 'experts from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention' (http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_meningococcal_b.asp), say that meningococcal polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines 'provide no protection against serogroup B disease, and meningococcal serogroup B vaccines (MenB) provide no protection against serogroup A, C, W, or Y disease.

When somebody becomes ill, it could be because of individual factors (the case was unusually susceptible -- for underlying reasons, such as inherited complement deficiencies, or because of an unfortunate timing eg recent viral infection); or because of pathogen associated factors -- the organism had evolved to become more than usually virulent.\n Studies that tested in an in vitro bactericidal assay against serogroup C, W and Y meningococci using sera collected in the UK, Germany, France and Brazil from individuals immunized with one of the B serogroup vaccines found that sera from was bactericidal 'in a range from 45 per cent to 90 per cent' (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4755123/#R11), the preliminary data having been presented in poster sessions.\n\n (The virulence genes are unrelated to the capsular phenotype, and capsular switching, maintaining the same virulence factors, is possible and appears to have happened with the increase in W serogroup disease in the UK, for example.[1])\n Since the so-called serogroup B vaccines do not use the polysaccharide capsule ABCWY antigens, but rather antigens from different part of the organism, they are independent of the ABCWY antigens, and the group B vaccines can be expected to be effective against meningococci independent of the ABCWY classification.

On 26 Jul 2017, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) announced one cluster of 3 reported meningococcal meningitis cases at a military base. 2 cases tested positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ and one died. The test result of the other case is pending. All contacts have been evaluated by a physician and given prophylaxis. All of them have been asked to monitor their own health. As of now, no new suspected cases have been reported and the outbreak has been brought under control.\n\nOn 23 Jul 2017, Taiwan CDC was notified of a suspected meningococcal meningitis case. The case was an active duty soldier at a military base in northern Taiwan. On 22 Jul 2017, when he developed symptoms, he sought immediate medical attention; the following morning, he died. On 23 Jul 2017, another hospital diagnosed the 2nd suspected case of meningococcal meningitis at the same military base. To prevent further transmission, the local health authority conducted an expanded epidemiological investigation and implemented a number of prevention measures, which identified the third suspected case, which was reported to the health authority on 24 Jul 2017. Currently, the 2 cases are stable and being treated. A total of 191 contacts, including military servicemen, family members residing in the same households, and healthcare workers, have been identified. After the physician evaluation, 118 contacts were given prophylaxis. The local health authority provided the contacts with relevant health education and asked them to monitor their own health till 12 Aug 2017.\n\nAccording to the surveillance data compiled by Taiwan CDC, thus far this year [2017], a total of 8 meningococcal meningitis cases, including 1 death, have been confirmed.\n\nMeningococcal meningitis is an acute infectious disease caused by meningococcus. The disease is transmitted from person-to-person through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions from carriers. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 10 days. The symptoms include fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, hemorrhagic rash, pink spots, confusion or other mental changes, coma, and seizure. When necessary, antibiotics are prescribed as the treatment. [Prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy is always necessary. Before antibiotics were available, the case fatality ratio [CFR] for invasive meningococcal disease was between 70 and 85 per cent. With use of antibiotics, the CFR now is 10-15 per cent, although meningococcemia is fatal in up to 40 per cent of patients (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html). - Mod.ML]\n\nTo ward off meningococcal meningitis, wash hands with soap and water frequently, maintain good indoor ventilation, avoid staying in poorly ventilated rooms for long hours, and seek prompt medical attention when suspected symptoms developed. Physicians are advised to be vigilant for suspected cases and prescribe antibiotics when appropriate. Travelers planning to visit areas affected by meningococcal meningitis are advised to visit the outpatient travel clinic at contracted hospitals in the nation to evaluate the need of meningococcal meningitis vaccination prior to their trip. The public is urged to seek timely medical assistance when suspected symptoms develop and inform the doctor of any recent travel history to facilitate prompt diagnosis and case reporting.

The Health Department said an elderly person was recovering in hospital after being diagnosed with serogroup Y meningococcal disease.\n\nThe incidence had been decreasing dramatically in WA over time, from a peak of 86 cases in 2000, down to 16 in 2013. But last year [2016] 23 cases were reported in WA, and there have been 15 so far in 2017.\n\nDepartmental medical coordinator Professor Paul Effler said the increase was likely due to people developing an immunity to certain strains. 'I think it's in part to the mutations that happened, the changes that happened in the bacterium itself, people develop immunity to it, and we develop immunity across the population so it goes away and then it comes back if a new strain that we haven't been exposed to comes into the community,' he said. 'The other thing that occurred is we started doing vaccinations against meningococcal C some years ago and that's helped drive down [meningococcal serogroup] C to record low levels.'\n\nProfessor Effler said outcomes were similar for all strains of the disease. He said a vaccination campaign had been launched for adolescents aged 15 to 19 after an increase in cases of the W strain. Teenagers in this group had the highest rates of carriage of the bacteria in the back of the nose and throat, and were believed most likely to be responsible for transmission to children and the elderly. 'Uptake [of vaccination] is good but we'd encourage any parents, or parents of teens, or teens that are out there in those years to make sure they look for their consent form that'll be coming home from the school so they can get their vaccination for free at school,' he said.\n\n[Byline: David Weber]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDenis Green\n<legion@q-net.net.au>\n\n[ProMED-mail Thanks Denis Green for his continued contributions.\n\nImmunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups.\n\nThere are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W135), either alone or conjugated to protein.

A statement by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control stated that the outbreak, which has been ravaging the country for 22 weeks, has affected 4 additional local government areas bringing the total affected local governments to 226 compared to what was obtainable last month [April 2017].\n\nZamfara State recorded the 1st case of the latest meningitis outbreak and has recorded the highest casualty; followed by Sokoto, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi and Yobe, which have reached the alert/epidemic threshold. So far, a total of 14 005 suspected cases have been identified from 23 states and the Federal Capital Territory. Out of 901 samples sent for laboratory testing, 423 were confirmed positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ while 309 tested samples showed the causative organism to be _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C, with 8 per cent fatality rate from the disease. The health agency attributed the increase in the number of suspected cases to an increased knowledge of the case definition for the disease.\n\nMany health professionals at inception of the outbreak had missed the epidemiology of the disease when it 1st presented itself thereby making government intervention in providing vaccines to combat the spread of the disease late. According to the NCDC, the knowledge of the disease, however, does not translate to better outcome for the cases, as seen with the number of deaths recorded so far. The health agency said the case management, like other disease conditions, follows a sequence of case detection, laboratory confirmation, treatment using the preferred drug of choice and supportive care.\n\n'At the onset of the outbreak, a large number of identified cases did not have samples taken for laboratory testing and were managed empirically. This may have been a contributory factor to the high number of deaths recorded. However, the Rapid Response Teams deployed to the most affected states supported sample collection and therefore an increase in laboratory confirmed cases,' it said.\n\nThe agency said in order to prevent future outbreak of the disease since meningococcal meningitis is a seasonal event of public health concern, there is a need for intensive and periodical community sensitisation on the disease and the need for early presentation and use of the public health facilities for immediate and Control (NCDC) alongside the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and other partner agencies have provided on-site support for case management in the worst affected states.\n\n[byline: Ayodamola Owoseye]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The outbreak of subtype C meningococcal meningitis is continuing in Nigeria and surrounding countries.\n\nMeningococcal meningitis is a bacterial disease caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_.

However, large, recurring epidemics affect an extensive region of sub-Saharan Africa known as the 'meningitis belt' which comprises 26 countries from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. In this area, outbreaks occur during the dry 'epidemic' season, usually covering the 1st half of the year. Before 2010, serogroup A was responsible for the large majority of epidemics in this area but serogroup C is now prominent, probably related to the use of the serogroup A vaccine.\n\nA map showing the belt can be seen at: https://www.washingtontravelclinic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/meningitis-belt.png. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62.]", "summary": "\n\nThe agency said in order to prevent future outbreak of the disease since meningococcal meningitis is a seasonal event of public health concern, there is a need for intensive and periodical community sensitisation on the disease and the need for early presentation and use of the public health facilities for immediate and Control (NCDC) alongside the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and other partner agencies have provided on-site support for case management in the worst affected states. \n\n[byline: Ayodamola Owoseye]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The outbreak of subtype C meningococcal meningitis is continuing in Nigeria and surrounding countries.

The commissioner for health, Dr Jide Idris, while reviewing the activities of the state government with regards to curtailing and controlling the spread of the meningitis epidemic in press statement dismissed the report as false, capable of causing undue panic among the citizenry. 'The report carried by some newspapers and online platforms is untrue and does not represent the reality of the situation in Lagos State as at today', he said.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, there are 2 main types of meningitis. The epidemic-prone meningitis, which is referred to as cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) is caused by a bacterium called _Neisseria meningitidis_ and its occurrence is seasonal or cyclical depending on the level of herd immunity and climatic conditions. The 2nd type of meningitis is non-epidemic meningitis. This type of meningitis is usually caused by a virus or other bacteria, but not by _N. meningitidis_. The non-epidemic meningitis occurs without any seasonal pattern or periodicity.\n\nIdris also disclosed that though the disease surveillance notification officer [for] Lagos Island Local Government reported 9 suspected cases of meningitis from Massey Street Children Hospital in week 13 of this year [week ending 31 Mar 2017] with 2 deaths, none of these was confirmed as due to the causative agent of CSM. He further revealed that though all the 9 cases presented with clinical features of meningitis at the said hospital but laboratory tests proved that they were either due to _Haemophilus influenzae_ or _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and not _N. meningitidis_.\n\nIdris, in addition, said that the Ministry of Health was also notified last week of a 3 year old boy presenting clinically as meningitis at a registered private facility in Lagos but the laboratory investigations did not confirm CSM. According to him, 'the blood culture yielded no growth but the urine culture yielded klebsiella and not meningococcus. The patient is already responding to treatment.' Idris affirmed that 'none of these cases presented with a history of recent travel to any area with an outbreak of meningitis and neither were visits from such areas recorded with the aforementioned cases.'\n\nIdris seized the opportunity to reiterate the Lagos State government's firm resolve to prevent and control the spread of the epidemic to the state. He then urged the people of the state to support governmental effort by reporting suspected cases to the nearest public health facility or call the following lines 08037170614, 08023169485. The commissioner stressed the need for the observance of a high standard of personal and environmental hygiene as a preventive measure against the outbreak of the disease noting that such hygiene measures should include washing of hands with soap and water frequently and thoroughly, avoiding direct contact with the discharges from an infected person and covering of mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.\n\n'It is strongly advised for people to avoid overcrowding in living quarters, provide cross ventilation in sleeping and work-rooms and other places where many people come together and get vaccinated with CSM vaccine when you are travelling to areas where meningitis outbreaks have been reported,' he added. Idris noted that health workers in the state have already been placed on red alert on the disease and surveillance teams consisting of epidemiologists are also intensifying their surveillance and monitoring activities.\n\n'Health workers are also advised to avoid close and prolonged contacts with suspected and probable cases of CSM, ensure proper disposal of respiratory and throat secretions of cases, report suspected or probable cases and observe universal precaution and make use of personal protective equipment when in contact with such cases. There is no need to panic. We will continue with our surveillance activities, constantly review our records and brief the public from time to time,' he added.\n\n[byline: Chioma Obinna]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The usual pathogen in the African meningitis belt during the dry season has been _Neisseria meningitidis_.

No case has been detected after the 31 March 2017. The Ashanti Region, where the outbreak has occurred, is outside the Africa meningitis belt and thus there is low index of suspicion among attending clinicians. The last two outbreaks in this region occurred in 2008 and 2011. Authorities believe there could be more undetected cases and thus surveillance activities have been intensified. Authorities have warned of possible misdiagnosis of meningitis cases as upper respiratory tract infection or malaria. The immediate setting of the outbreak (boarding high school) presents many surveillance challenges: High School sick bays do not usually have the capacity to handle such cases and therefore refer them. However, referrals are to parents/guardians and not health facilities. Information on the causative pathogen will be available in 2 - 3 days time.

M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has supported the health authorities with surveillance and case management in the most-affected areas since February [2017], when the outbreak was officially declared. However, the slow reaction of the country and a global shortage of vaccines have hampered the response.\n\nOn 15 Apr [2017], MSF set up a 200-bed treatment centre in Sokoto Town, followed by a 20-bed facility in Anka, Zamfara. In these locations, MSF's Nigeria Emergency Response Unit (NERU) works intensively to provide free, high-quality medical care and reduce mortality rates as much as possible.\n\nThese teams treat challenging cases in a difficult environment. 'A few days ago, a 9-year-old boy was brought in unconsciousness and with severe meningitis,' recalls Caroline Riefthuis, an MSF nurse in Sokoto. 'He received treatment for 5 days and recovered, but unfortunately we found out that he had become deaf and blind, some of the side-effects of severe meningitis.'\n\nThis little boy is one of 614 patients treated in Sokoto Mutalah Mohamad Hospital since April 2017, when MSF took over the management of the centre from the MoH due to a lack of supplies and qualified staff to run it. In Anka General Hospital, 137 patients were admitted since the beginning of the outbreak. Most are between 5-20 years old.\n\nIn addition to the staff working in the treatment centres, 11 MSF surveillance teams visited health facilities to determine the origins of new cases in Sokoto, Zamfara, Yobe, Niger and Kebbi. These visits also allowed MSF to implement additional activities, such as health promotion, to increase community awareness of the signs and symptoms of meningitis and active case finding.\n\nAt the end of April [2017], the Nigerian MoH reported 9646 suspected cases of meningitis C, with a total of 839 deaths since late 2016. And on 1 May [2017], MSF was finally able to join a vaccination campaign launched by the health authorities in Sokoto. In the 3 most-affected Local Government Areas (LGAs), 25 MSF teams vaccinated approximately 850 people per day for 7 days to reach a target population of 148 000 people -- of a total target of 800 000 -- between the ages of 1-20. An additional campaign with a target population of nearly 130 000 people will start later this month [May 2017] in the 4 most-affected LGAs of Yobe State.\n\nAlthough these vaccination campaigns are a crucial step to stop the spread of the disease, MSF has concerns regarding the late response to the crisis in a country where meningitis epidemics are not rare. 'The national early warning system and timely response needs to be strengthened, and the implementation strategy better-defined, to reduce the impact of the outbreak as much as possible,' explains Philip Aruna, MSF Head of Mission in Nigeria.\n\nEven more worrisome is the global shortage of meningitis C vaccine, which contributed to the delayed response and increased mortality rates in Nigeria. 'The outbreak is spreading fast, and we are concerned because there are not enough vaccines to cover the affected population,' says Aruna. In Sokoto, for example, 3 million vaccines are required to launch a mass campaign, but only 800 000 were available. This insufficient quantity only allows for a reactive campaign, which requires teams to act fast to prevent the disease from spreading further.\n\nTo address these logistical challenges and reduce the mortality rates, MSF insists that treatment centres be decentralised so that all people affected by the disease, even those in remote areas, can access free, quality health care and the right tests to quickly confirm cases and prevent misdiagnosis.

The MSF Emergency Response Unit (NERU) also responds to medical emergencies such as meningitis and measles outbreaks. NERU has been active in the country since 2006.\n\nMSF has provided health care to people displaced by violence as well as host communities in northeastern Nigeria's Borno State since mid-2014.

This epidemic is different from past ones in that _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A, the previous predominant pathogen, has been replaced by meningococcus serogroup C, likely as a consequence of mass vaccination campaigns using a conjugate meningococcal serogroup A vaccine, the MenAfriVac-A. This vaccine reduced by over 90 per cent the incidence of meningococcal meningitis due to serogroup A.\n\nTo prevent replacement by other pathogenic serogroups, a quadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine, such the ACYW vaccine, would be ideal. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines.

Kakale disclosed this to newsmen in Sokoto on Sunday [2 Mar 2017] when he gave an update on the state of high alert declared by the state government since [Mon 20 Mar 2017]. He said that the deaths were mostly recorded out of the nearly 600 clinically confirmed cases of meningitis in the 8 worst-hit local governments; Rabah, Kebbe, Tureta, Gada, Dange/Shuni, Wamakko, Kware and Bodinga.\n\nKakale said, 'The epidemic was caused by the serogroup 'C'' strains of meningitis and not the serogroup 'A'' strains, which the people of the state had hitherto developed immunity for. This new strain of meningitis is deadlier than the dreaded Ebola disease as it kills within 4 to 6 hours of afflicting a patient. More than 80 per cent of the victims also had not been immunised, hence, the aggravation of the epidemic.'\n\nThe commissioner further stated that the state government has embarked on a statewide, mass vaccination for the people of the state, against meningitis. He explained that over 700 000 persons, aged 1 to 30 years were being targeted across the 23 local governments of the state. Kakale further stressed the need for the people of the state to ensure that their children were fully immunised against the child killer diseases like measles, whooping cough, yellow fever and diphtheria, among others. 'They should also desist from self medication as adequate drugs and medications are provided by the state government for the free treatment of the patients.'\n\n'No fewer than 100 medical personnel comprising medical doctors, nurses, ambulances and other logistics are still operating across the state. The people should also desist attaching traditional beliefs like witchcraft and report all suspected cases of meningitis, measles and other diseases to the nearest health facility. We will not rest on our oars until the epidemic is fully mitigated, although the cases have drastically reduced. Some of the isolation camps hitherto set had since been closed in most of the local governments,'' Kakale said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Sun 2 Apr 2017\nSource: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]\n\n\nThis information has not yet been verified.

Already 90 Local Government Areas in 16 states have been affected. The death toll recorded so far is 328. The states affected include: Zamfara, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbe, Niger, Nassarawa, Jigawa, Abuja, Gombe, Tarawa, Yobe, Osun, Cross River, Lagos and Plateau. The Minister of Health said that neighbouring West African Countries are also facing similar health threats from _Neisseria meningitidis_.\n\nAccording to the Minister [of Health], the country is currently experiencing an outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) that has spread across the country and mostly affecting states in the upper parts of the country that fall within the African Meningitis Belt. Other countries that are facing similar outbreaks at the moment include our West-African neighbours like Niger, Chad, Cameroun, Togo, and Burkina Faso. This epidemic has come with a difference, as all previous epidemics were caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup 'A' but this year [2017] we are recording serogroup C in epidemic proportion for the 1st time. The worst CSM epidemics experienced in Nigeria occurred in 1996 (109 580 cases and 11 717 deaths), 2003 (4130 cases and 401 deaths), 2008 (9086 cases and 562 deaths), and 2009 (9086 cases and 562 deaths). Following these successive outbreaks, the World Health Organisation (WHO) instituted a mass vaccination campaign using a new conjugate vaccine the MenAfriVac-A in about 16 out of the 26 vulnerable countries (including Nigeria). It resulted in a reduction of over 94 per cent incidence of the disease in most countries, thus significantly reducing the risk of serogroup A.\n\nSome key lessons learnt from the MenAfriVac-A mass vaccination campaign and the recent happenings across the sub-region, are that although serogroup A was successfully displaced, other strains which were hitherto less significant can actually assume epidemic proportions. Thus efforts must continue towards preventing a rebound of the serogroup A and also preventing a potential replacement by all other strains, said the Minister.\n\nAs at [Fri 31 March 31], 90 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 16 states of the Federation are so far affected by the new strain of CSM including Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbe, Niger, Nassarawa, Jigawa, FCT, Gombe, Tarawa, Yobe, Kano, Osun, Cross Rivers, Lagos and Plateau.\n\nA total number of 2524 people have been reportedly affected while the death toll has risen to 328. So far, a total 131 samples have been confirmed in the laboratory, out of which a majority is _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C.

The student is in good condition, officials said.\n\nUniversity spokesman Steve Clark said school officials think the case is unrelated to the November 2016 cases, which weren't related to one another.\n\nCounty officials have identified people who had close personal contact with the student before he or she was taken to the hospital, Clark said. They were treated with a preventative medicine and didn't exhibit any signs of meningitis, as far as officials know.\n\nOfficials recommend all undergraduate students under 25 years old get vaccinated, per Centers for Control and Prevention advice. Clark especially urged students 25 and younger who live in congregate housing -- such as residence halls, Greek houses and private co-ops -- to get vaccinated.\n\nOfficials also urge people under 25 who visit such housing to get vaccinated.\n\nClark said about 5000 students live in student housing. As many as 2000 more students 25 and younger live in off-campus congregate housing, he said.\n\nThe university will host vaccination clinics at its McAlexander Fieldhouse next Wednesday and Thursday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The clinics target students who are 25 and younger and live in congregate housing, Clark said, but the university won't turn anyone away.\n\n'We understand that news of this matter is concerning for our students and their families,' he said in a statement. 'While this is a serious matter, it is not emergency.'\n\nOregon children have not been routinely vaccinated against type B, the most common form of the disease in the state, causing an outbreak at the University of Oregon in 2015 and infecting the 2 students at OSU this past November [2016].\n\nSymptoms include fever, headache, weakness and rash. The bacteria can spread, inflaming tissue in the brain and around the spine. It's imperative to get quick treatment with antibiotics. The disease can be deadly. Between 2003 and 2007 in the United States, 500 people among 4100 died from meningitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe infection is spread by coughing and sneezing, sharing drinking, eating and smoking utensils, and intimate activity, officials said.\n\nOregon Senate Bill 274, which would require colleges and universities that provide student housing to give enrolling students information about vaccine-preventable diseases known to affect people between 16 and 21 years old, was introduced in January [2017]. It was referred to the Senate Committee on Education later that month.\n\n[Byline: Jim Ryan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 3 Mar 2017\nSource: KATU News [edited]\nhttp://katu.com/news/local/3rd-osu-student-hit-with-meningococcal-disease\n\n\nThe same strain of [_Neisseria meningitidis_, the bacterium that causes] meningococcal disease that infected 2 Oregon State University students last fall has sickened another student.\n\nThe Gazette-Times reports the student has been hospitalized in Corvallis since 23 Feb [2017] and is in good condition.

In infants aged under one year, over 50 per cent of cases are caused by serogroup B, and in people over 11 years of age, 75 per cent are caused by serogroups (C, Y, or W). Serogroup B meningococci have also been responsible for several outbreaks and isolated cases on US college campuses in the last 5 years (http://www.nfid.org/idinfo/meningococcal/meningococcal-b-college-outbreaks.html).\n\nIn November 2016, ProMED-mail posted a report that 2 OSU [Oregon State University] students in Corvallis were diagnosed with meningococcal disease due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B. According to the 1st news report above, meningococcus serogroup B was also isolated from a 3rd case of meningococcal meningitis on the Corvallis campus of OSU. The 'same strain' mentioned in the 2nd news report could mean that perhaps genotyping had been done that would indicate all 3 isolates are closely related genetically. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe CDC defines an outbreak of meningococcal disease as the occurrence of 3 or more confirmed or probable cases during a period of less than or equal to 3 months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate of at least 10 cases per 100 000 persons, which is approximately 10-fold greater than the normal occurrence http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm.\n\nOregon State University (OSU) is a coeducational, public university; the main campus is located in the city of Corvallis in the Willamette Valley of the US state of Oregon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University#Main_campus_.28Corvallis.29). The university has a total student enrollment of 30 354, the largest among all Oregon universities.\n\nIn 2015, ProMED-mail reported that 6 cases of invasive serogroup B meningococcal disease occurred in students at the University of Oregon campus in Eugene, Oregon between 13 Jan 2015 and 19 Mar 2015 (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) fatal, college, sg. B, sg. B vaccine 20150531.3398946). Eugene is 47 miles (75.6 km) south of Corvallis.\n\nA 7th case associated with the University of Oregon occurred in a father of a student who visited the campus in May 2015. Presumably, if he was infected with the outbreak strain, he must have had contact with someone on campus who was a persistent asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carrier over a month after the last student case. Five of the 6 student cases, including a case who died, had bloodstream meningococcal infections.

Malta will have to wait its turn, manufacturers say. Global demand for the vaccine outstrips supply, manufacturers say.\n\nA one-year-old baby died of [meningococcal] meningitis [serogroup] B, a disease against which vaccines are currently unavailable, this newspaper is informed. Sources said the baby died last month [January 2017] after contracting the disease that affects the lining around the brain and spinal cord. The Central Procurement and Supplies Unit (CPSU) was informed that the local agent for the meningitis B vaccine had a stock of vaccines available in a number of local pharmacies, a Health Ministry spokeswoman said.\n\nThe representatives of international pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in Malta were in liaison with their suppliers to hasten further delivery, and the CPSU was in liaison with both companies to monitor the situation, the spokeswoman added.\n\nThe ministry was also asked about the baby's death, but no reference was made to it in its reply late yesterday [23 Feb 2017] evening.\n\nThe government does not supply the vaccine against the specific strain that affected the infant, which can, however, be purchased from private hospitals and pharmacies. Paediatricians said private hospitals had purchased the vaccine from pharmacies abroad, but these too had since run out.\n\nAccording to one paediatrician, the unavailability of such a vaccine in light of the baby's death was very worrying, particularly to parents. Another paediatrician, however, warned against the matter getting out of hand, saying the issue was not as worrying as parents were making it out to be. Babies who were not vaccinated were not in any immediate danger, he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the local representative of GSK confirmed that the vaccine was not available and it would not be for some time. She said no fixed date had yet been given as to when a supply would be made available to the local market. According to the spokeswoman, the vaccine was in high demand all over the world, and as GSK [GlaxoSmithKline] had agreements with a number of governments abroad, supplies would be shipped to these countries 1st. At present, demand exceeded the quantity manufactured.\n\n'It's important to understand that, in these cases, we need to stock enough for boosters, so before sufficient doses are available, this will not be made available,' the GSK spokeswoman said.\n\nAccording to the Maltese Paediatric Association, about 10 cases of meningitis have been reported among children. The signs of meningitis are fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, vomiting, dislike of bright light and drowsiness. Infants and younger children may not always show such symptoms but, instead, feed poorly or become very lethargic.\n\n[Byline: Claire Caruana]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although there are at least 13 _ Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W is most common. Meningococcal vaccines contain capsular polysaccharide for _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups A, C, Y, and W, either alone or conjugated to protein. The conjugate capsular polysaccharide vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines.\n\nSerogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B outer membrane vesicle protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen. At least 2 serogroup B meningococcal vaccines -- Bexsero (GlaxoSmithKline, GSK) and Trumenba (Pfizer) -- are available.\n\nMeningococcal disease often occurs without warning and frequently progresses rapidly to death, even when it is treated appropriately. In addition, about 10-20 percent of survivors of meningococcal disease will suffer disabilities such as hearing loss, brain damage, and amputations. Vaccines are used to prevent meningococcal disease, not treat someone already ill from the disease. Immunity following use of a meningococcal vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide the vaccine contains regarding the A, C, Y, and W polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines or the surface proteins regarding serogroup B vaccines, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal groups.\n\nVaccines are frequently used to prevent spread of meningococcal disease in the face of an institutional or community outbreak (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/interim-guidance.pdf). Antibiotics are also used to prevent spread of meningococcal disease in persons who are at high risk because they have been in close contact (coughing or kissing) or lengthy contact, especially among people living in the same household.\n\nAccording to the 2017 Malta National Immunization Schedule, meningococcal vaccines are not included in the series of vaccines for infants and children (https://health.gov.mt/en/phc/pchyhi/Pages/National-Immunisation-Schedule.aspx). In the U.S., vaccination against meningococcal disease due to serogroups A, C, Y, and W is only recommended for children aged 2 months through 10 years who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease, i.e., have complement component deficiencies, have functional or anatomic asplenia (including sickle cell disease), are in the risk group for an outbreak for which vaccination is recommended, or are traveling to or residing in regions where meningitis is epidemic or hyper-endemic (for specifics, see Table at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6324a2.htm#Tab).

MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - ITALY (09): (TUSCANY) FATAL, SEROGROUP C, ANOTHER CASE\n**********************************************************************************\n Meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccine was introduced in the Tuscany regional immunization schedule in 2005, with 3 doses to all children at 3, 5, and 13 months of age, and at the national level, MCC was introduced in 2012. Prompted by the serogroup C outbreak, health officials promoted an MCC vaccination campaign in 2015 in adolescents and adults in the area where serogroup C _N. meningitidis_ disease was reported 2015, which was extended to the whole Tuscany Region and to the elderly in 2016. \n\n--\nPasquale Urbano\n The child is affected by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C, the same that has been circulating in Tuscany since 2015, when it caused 31 cases of meningitis or sepsis; the present case is the 29th case in 2016. This case is particularly worrying because the child had been vaccinated, as were 12 others of the 60 in the current outbreak, which is occurring in a limited part of Tuscany, where a massive vaccination campaign has been launched.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2015-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2005-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2012-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "2016-03-26 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Florence", "country": "Italy"}, {"location": "Italy", "country": "Italy"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4808261", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Undiagnosed illness - Benin: (AL) fatal, children, meningitis excl, RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4808261", "date": "2017-02-01 18:21:49", "main_text": "UNDIAGNOSED ILLNESS - BENIN: (ALIBORI) FATAL, CHILDREN, MENINGITIS EXCLUDED, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n****************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 14 Jan 2017\nSource: Benin WEB TV [in French, machine trans, edited]\nhttps://beninwebtv.com/2017/01/panique-a-malanville-alassane-seibou-rassure-depidemie-de-meningite/\n\n\nThe deaths of 4 schoolchildren from Madecali Center in the commune of Malanville [Alibori department] in December [2016] and beginning of the current year [2017] as a result of brutal headache without fever and followed by a brutal death the same day has been the subject of various interpretations. For many people, these deaths were due to a meningitis epidemic. Assertion [was] fed [by] social networks throughout the week.\n\nBut through a press statement made in his office on [Thu 12 Jan 2017], the Minister of Health, Alassane S\u00e9ibou, wanted to reassure the population. 'We are not in a situation of meningococcal meningitis epidemic ... Benin is not in an epidemic situation' said the minister to say that there was more fear than evil.\n\nAccording to Minister Alassane S\u00e9ibou, the teams in the health zone 'undertook systematic examinations of children and to date 22 children with similar signs of headache, fever have been identified and put [under] observation at the Malanville area hospital for care and follow-up.' At the end of the analyses according to the explanations provided by the Minister of Health, 'On the samples taken, the presence of Gram-positive diplococcus was obtained in a single child. The other samples are negative,' said the minister before concluding that the results obtained so far exclude the hypothesis of 'an epidemic of meningococcal meningitis.'\n\nHowever, the joint teams of the Ministry of Health of the departments of Borgou, Alibori, and the health zone of Malanville are working on the ground for further investigations.\n\n[Byline: Edouard Djogbenou]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Roland H\u00fcbner for the submission above that concerns an outbreak in Malanville, a city, arrondissement, and commune, with a population of 168 006 residents, in the Alibori Department of northeastern Benin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malanville). The illness was fatal in 4 children and was initially suspected to be bacterial meningitis, but a 'systematic investigation' that may have included examination of cerebrospinal fluid in 22 children was 'negative' in all but one patient, in whom the 'sample' revealed 'Gram-positive diplococci', which presumably is _Streptococcus pneumoniae_.\n\nThere is some confusion in the discription of the children's illness in the news report above; the 4 children who died had 'headache, without fever', but the other 22 ill children were said to have 'similar signs of headache, fever'. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.\n\nDiagnoses in the other patients are not stated in the news report above, but Roland H\u00fcbner also submitted an article that was recently (in February 2017) published in the Lancet (http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/langlo/PIIS2214-109X(16)30287-X.pdf), which concerned an outbreak of suspected meningitis in the Democratic Republic of Congo in December 2014. Meningitis was initially suspected by health workers because of neck muscle spasm, but only 4 of 83 patients who underwent lumbar puncture had cerebrospinal fluid evidence of meningococcal meningitis. The outbreak was attributed to a dystonic reaction secondary to haloperidol, which patients had mistakenly taken when consuming tablets labeled fraudulently as diazepam, but which in fact contained undeclared haloperidol.\n\nDystonic reactions are characterized by intermittent spasmodic or sustained involuntary contractions of muscles in the face, neck, trunk, pelvis, or extremities that can result in stiff neck, tongue protrusion, lockjaw, facial grimacing, or eye deviation, most often associated with use of antiemetics, antidepressants, and antipsychotics, such as haloperidol (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/814632-clinical). These reactions are more common in children and young adults. Dystonic reactions are treated with benztropine (Cogentin) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Diazepam may also be useful, but diazepam has been found rarely to cause an acute dystonic reaction (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3065401).\n\nA drug-related dystonic reaction maybe the cause of the outbreak in Benin; its diagnosis will require a thorough history of drug use.

There is growing concern about Men-W, which is increasingly affecting young adults. Meningitis has serious consequences and can prove fatal. Charity Meningitis Now is urging all students returning to university after the Christmas and New Year break to make themselves aware of the signs and symptoms of meningitis and to take up a free vaccine. Cases of the killer disease peak during the winter months, and students are a high-risk group.\n\nThe charity's acting chief executive Rachel Robinson said: 'The ability to recognise meningitis and septicaemia quickly can save lives. 'The sooner you can get medical help, the less likely it is to become life-threatening. That's why learning the signs and symptoms is so important.' Early symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and muscle pain are very similar to flu or even a hangover, but someone with meningitis or septicaemia can get a lot worse very quickly. More specific signs and symptoms to look out for include fever with cold hands and feet, drowsiness, confusion, pale blotchy skin, stiff neck, dislike of bright lights, and a rash which doesn't fade under pressure.\n\nRachel added: 'Prevention is also vital, which is why we're also encouraging all eligible young people to take up the free vaccine for Men ACWY. 'Hopefully our ongoing campaign will encourage more of them to take this simple and potentially lifesaving step.' Men ACWY immunisation was added to the national programme in August 2015 following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in response to the rising number of meningococcal W (Men-W) cases. But figures from Public Health England show that just 11.1 percent of 18-year-olds eligible to get the Men ACWY vaccine between April and July last year [2016] had taken up the offer, leaving about half a million young people in England in this age group still at risk from the disease.\n\nFor more information, visit the Meningitis Now website.

Between July 2013 and June 2014, just 98 cases were reported in England and Wales, but 184 cases were reported between July 2014-June 2015, at which time, Men W accounted for 15 per cent of all meningococcal disease. In 2009, Men W accounted for only 1-2 percent of all meningococcal cases in the UK. The strain of Men W (ST-11) is particularly virulent, causing more severe illness and a higher case fatality rate.\n\nThe vaccination schedule in the UK had been as follows: At 2 months of age, babies were given meningococcal serogroup B (Men B) vaccine; at 3 months of age, Men C vaccine; at 4 months, a 2nd dose of Men B; at 12-13 months, a 3rd dose of Men B and a 2nd dose of Men C in a combined vaccine with _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib); and at 13-18 years of age and 1st-time university students, meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y (Men ACWY) vaccine (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-c-vaccine.aspx).\n\nSince the Men C vaccine was introduced in 1999, the Men C disease has been virtually eliminated in the UK. Nowadays, there are just a handful of Men C cases each year, mainly in older, unvaccinated adults (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-c-vaccine.aspx). However, the near elimination of Men C as a consequence of the Men C conjugate vaccine program in the UK has been followed by the emergence of a 'replacement' pathogen, Men W. Consequently, starting on 1 Jul 2016, the dose of Men C vaccine that had been offered to babies at 3 months of age has been removed from the vaccination schedule (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-c-vaccine.aspx). All children will continue to be offered the Hib/Men C vaccine at one year of age, and the tetravalent Men ACWY vaccine at 14 years of age, and students up to the age of 25 1st going to university, to prevent Men W disease (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx).\n\nSouth East England is the most populous of the 9 official regions of England and includes the counties of Hampshire, Surrey, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, East Sussex, the Isle of Wight, Kent, Oxfordshire, and West Sussex.

Over the weekend [19-20 Nov 2016], a 2nd test performed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta determined that patient was infected with the same strain [serogroup] of the disease, according to Lili'a Neville, public information officer for Benton County. No additional cases have been diagnosed, Neville said.\n\nOn [Fri 18 Nov 2016], OSU Student Health Services began offering vaccinations against the B strain [serogroup] of the disease to students under 25 [years of age] and is continuing to do so. 'We'll be communicating to students as they leave (campus) for the Thanksgiving [24 Nov 2016] holiday to continue to watch for symptoms,' said Steve Clark, OSU's vice president for marketing and university relations.\n\nMeningococcal disease primarily afflicts young people. Most incoming students at OSU are required to be inoculated against 4 of the most common variants of the disease, but that vaccine does not protect against the B strain [serogroup].\n\nWhile the disease is not highly contagious, it is dangerous and can be fatal. To spread, it generally requires close contact with an infected person for a cumulative total of at least 4 hours. OSU and county health officials have been working to identify people who may have been exposed to the infected students and treat them with antibiotics as a preventative measure. 'We have about 230 on our list,' said Charlie Fautin, deputy administrator of the Benton County Health Department. He said most of those people had been contacted and given antibiotics, but others have not yet been located.\n\nSymptoms of meningococcal disease include high fever, headache, stiff neck, exhaustion, nausea, rash, vomiting, and diarrhea. Anyone experiencing these symptoms is advised to seek medical attention right away.\n\nAn outbreak of meningococcal disease at the University of Oregon early last year [2015] made 7 people sick and killed one student.\n\nVaccinations against meningococcal disease-B are available locally beyond the OSU campus, Neville said, but they require a doctor's prescription.\n\n[byline: Bennett Hall]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Serogroups B, C, and Y are the major causes of meningococcal disease in the United States, each being responsible for about a third of cases (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm).

Figures obtained by The Weekend West show 9 of the 12 cases of the disease this year have been linked to strains from the bacteria group W. Type B [_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B] caused the other 3.\n\nMeningococcal disease is a rare, life-threatening illness caused by a bacterial infection of the blood or the membranes that line the spinal cord and brain.\n\nA young WA child -- the 12th case this year [2016] -- died from the disease last week. In the past, there have been virtually no local cases caused by W strains, but there were 2 in 2014, 4 cases last year [2015] and 9 this year. The WA Health Department said this week it was monitoring the trend, which was also being seen in states including Victoria and could have implications for vaccination recommendations.\n\nVictorian authorities have seen a sharp rise in a group W strain known as ST11, which was responsible for 4 per cent of meningococcal cases in 2013 but 30 percent of cases last year [2015].\n\nAt present, a vaccine to protect against type C meningococcal disease, historically the most common in Australia, is free for children and given at 12 months [of age]. A vaccine against meningococcal B, the most common type in WA [the 1st paragraph above says that this year [2016] serogroup W, not serogroup B, is the most common serogroup], is available but not government-funded. There is a privately funded vaccine against W strains, but it is usually only advised for overseas travellers.\n\nThe Health Department spokesman said that while the overall number of invasive meningococcal disease cases in WA had been falling since 2000, there had been a recent increase in cases linked to W strains.\n\nThe Telethon Kids Institute is doing a trial of a vaccine against the A, C, W and Y strains in young children.\n\n[Byline: Cathy O'Leary]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_ only infects humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10 percent of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.\n\nImmunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common.\n\nThere are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W135), either alone or conjugated to protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.\n\nFollowing the mass introduction into the population of a vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, e.g., serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African Meningitis Belt following A vaccine, only to be replaced by emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups.\n\nSimilarly, serotype replacement has been observed following pneumococcal vaccination programs, which necessitated expansion of serotypes covered by the vaccine (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-vaccine strain emergence - USA (AK) 20070425.1348).\n\nBecause of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroup W ST-11 as a cause of invasive meningococcal disease in the UK, the UK is now offering an expanded conjugated serogroup vaccine, Men ACWY, for adolescents, who are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group, to stop the spread of serogroup W. This is being done by replacing the routine teenage Men C booster with the Men ACWY vaccine (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx).\n\nWestern Australia, covering the entire western 1/3rd of Australia, is mostly arid, its population being concentrated in the fertile southwest corner and its capital, Perth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia). - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/289.]", "summary": "Following the mass introduction into the population of a vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, e.g., serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African Meningitis Belt following A vaccine, only to be replaced by emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups.

So far this year [2016], there has been a total of 11 cases of the potentially deadly infection -- ranging from a one-year-old to a 94-year-old -- up from 7 cases at the same time last year and 30 for all of 2015.\n\nOf the 11 cases this year [2016], 10 have been the meningococcal [serogroup] B strain, which is not covered on the national vaccine register, prompting calls for it to be added to the list. Health Minister Jack Snelling said the federal government should give 'careful consideration' to adding the [serogroup] B strain vaccine. 'In the meantime, probably the most important thing is for parents to speak to their local GP about whether it is advised to have that particular vaccination for meningococcal B,' he said.\n\nAt present, the meningococcal C vaccine is available through the National Immunisation Program, but the meningococcal B vaccine is only available from GPs at a cost of USD 125 per vaccine. Four shots are needed in total. SA [South Australia] Health chief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips said it was an individual decision between parents and GPs about whether to vaccinate children against the B strain. 'It's a safe vaccine, and it's an effective vaccine, but is not on the free list at the moment,' he said.\n\nA federal government spokesman said the government could not include a new vaccine on the register unless it was recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. 'On each occasion, the application was rejected on the basis of clinical uncertainty; that is, where the clinical evidence for its effectiveness has not been demonstrated in the applicant's submission,' the spokesman said.\n\nSA Health would not disclose the ages or suburbs of the latest 3 people diagnosed with the infection. 'Some are doing very well. Some were in hospital ... Thank heavens none have died,' Prof Phillips said.\n\nWhile the infection is most common among children under 2 and people aged between 16 and 25, it can affect anyone at any age, especially during the cooler months when there are more respiratory infections around. Symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, a stiff neck, sore muscles and, in some cases, a rash of red and purple spots.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nKathleen Harriman, PhD, MPH, RN\nChief, Vaccine Preventable Diseases Epidemiology Section\nImmunization Branch\nCalifornia Department of Public Health\n<kathleen.harriman@cdph.ca.gov>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Kathleen Harriman for providing the news report that says that 10 of the 11 cases of meningococcal meningitis in the state of South Australia have been due to serogroup B.\n\nSouth Australia (SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia.

A cluster of cases in the last several months has disproportionately affected men who have sex with men (MSM).\n\nMeningococcal disease is caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ bacteria, which are transmitted from person-to-person through respiratory droplets, during face-to-face or prolonged contact, or by sharing utensils, drinks, or cigarettes. It is a serious infection that can cause meningitis (brain infection) and/or bacteremia (blood infection), and can lead to death.\n\nTo date, Orange County has had 4 cases that are part of the cluster in Southern California; 3 of these cases have occurred since 1 Jun 2016, including 1 death. On average, Orange County has only 5 meningococcal cases each year.\n\nBecause of this local increase in risk, the County of Orange Health Care Agency, in conjunction with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services, is expanding vaccination recommendations for meningococcal disease to include all gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, in addition to all persons with HIV infection.\n\nHigher risk for meningococcal disease in MSM has been associated with: regularly visiting crowded venues such as bars, parties, etc.; regularly having close or intimate contact with multiple partners; smoking or illicit drug use; and/or HIV positive status.\n\nMSM who are unaware of their current HIV status and who have not been tested in the past year should seek HIV testing.\n\nIndividuals covered under this new recommendation are encouraged to speak to their medical providers about getting the vaccine. For those who are uninsured or whose insurance does not cover the vaccine, the OC Health Care Agency can provide vaccinations at low or no cost. There are 2 clinics located at 1725 W 17th Street in Santa Ana that will offer vaccine to qualified individuals:\n\nImmunization Clinic: 7:30 am - 4:30 pm, Mon-Fri, closed for lunch 11:45 am - 12:45 pm\nTesting, Treatment and Care Clinic: 8 am - 4 pm, Mon, Wed, Thu, and Fri; 10 am - 4 pm Tue.\n\nBoth are walk-in clinics, so wait times can be expected. Those needing just vaccination should go to the Immunization Clinic, but if testing for sexually transmitted disease and/or HIV is desired, please go to the Testing, Treatment and Care Clinic. For more information, please call the Health Referral Line at 800-564-8448.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) includes meningitis, bacteremia and sepsis and is caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ bacteria, which are transmitted from person-to-person through respiratory droplets usually during close contact. Persons who are HIV-infected are at increased risk of meningococcal disease.\n\nOutbreaks of IMD have recently occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium, and France caused by a _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C strain with the same multilocus sequence type (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf).

People who have been in contact with the student have been notified, and will be prescribed antibiotic medication as a preventative measure.\n\n'The bacteria that causes meningococcal disease are not as contagious as the common cold or the flu, and they are not spread by casual contact or by simply breathing the air where a person with the disease has been,' Lasky said. The bacteria strain infecting the second student has not been determined yet, she said. The hospital has requested testing on the new case to identify it, which will also help in establishing any potential link between the cases.\n\nThe disease infects the lining of the human brain and spinal cord. It can also infect the bloodstream, Lasky said. Physical symptoms include fever, soreness and rash. While the disease can be treated with antibiotics, rapid care is important.

Genotyping will need to be done to establish if the strains isolated from these 2 patients are closely related. Outbreaks of meningococcal disease usually are caused by closely related strains. If strains are unrelated by genotyping, the 2 cases most likely do not represent an outbreak.\n\nThe CDC has defined the situation that would call for just chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of a case and the situation that would additionally call for immunization of the population at risk (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a3.htm). A single case would only call for chemoprophylaxis of close contacts, but mass vaccination might play a role protecting the population at risk during an outbreak. Mass vaccination campaigns are expensive, require a massive public health effort, and can create unwarranted concern among the public. The decision to implement a mass vaccination campaign to prevent meningococcal disease depends on whether the occurrence of more than 1 case represents an outbreak or an unusual clustering of endemic disease.\n\nIf the only association between patients is attending the same school or university, the population at risk is all persons attending the school or university. Rutgers has an enrollment of 67 000 students (48 000 undergraduates and 19,000 postgraduates) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University). However, Rutgers has several campuses (Newark, Camden and New Brunswick), with 31 593 undergraduates and 8841 graduate students at the New Brunswick campus.\n\nThe CDC recommends (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a3.htm): 'If 3 or more cases have occurred in either an organization-- or a community-based outbreak during 3 or less months (starting at the time of the 1st confirmed or probable case), a primary attack rate should be calculated.' (Attack rate per 100 000 = [(number of primary confirmed or probable cases during a 3-month period) / (number of population at risk)] x 100 000.) 'Vaccination of the population at risk should be considered if the attack rate is over 10 cases/100 000 persons.'\n\nEven though only 2 cases have so far been reported, assuming the 2 patients at Rutgers are primary cases and the population at risk is 40 000, the attack rate is below 10 per 100 000. If the population at risk could be narrowed or more cases are reported, the decision to mass vaccinate could change.

Several outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease have been reported in Europe and the United States among men who have sex with men (MSM). We recently identified an outbreak of serogroup C meningococcal disease among MSM in Germany and France. In this study, genomic and proteomic techniques were used to analyze the outbreak isolates. In addition, genetically identical urethritis isolates were recovered from France and Germany and included in the analysis. Genome sequencing revealed that the isolates from the outbreak among MSM and from urethritis cases belonged to a clade within clonal complex 11. Proteome analysis showed they expressed nitrite reductase, enabling anaerobic growth as previously described for gonococci. Invasive isolates from MSM, but not urethritis isolates, further expressed functional human factor H binding protein associated with enhanced survival in a newly developed transgenic mouse model expressing human factor H, a complement regulatory protein. In conclusion, our data suggest that urethritis and outbreak isolates followed a joint adaptation route including adaption to the urogenital tract.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nOur results demonstrate the power of combining laboratory infection surveillance, genomics and proteomics technologies and transgenic animal models to unravel the molecular basis of meningococcal evolution that lead to short-term changes in the epidemiology of meningococcal disease. Our data also suggest that genomic plasticity of meningococci permits a rapid generation of variants with increased fitness for alternative/novel niches. The AniA+, fHbp- phenotype seems to be associated with urethral and rectal colonization, leading to the clinical manifestation of urethritis/proctitis as well as the capacity for direct sexual transmission. These findings further highlight the link between metabolic processes and virulence.\n\nOur finding that cc11/ET-15 meningococci adapted to a gonococcus-like lifestyle suggests that the variant may be widely distributed in the MSM community. This should be further investigated by meningococci C carriage studies in MSM. As suggested by our results, reversion to a hypervirulent phenotype (AniA+, fHbp+) is possible through the reacquisition of functional fHbp that enhances bacterial survival in the blood. The spontaneous reversion to fHbp+ state may occur but at low frequency (less than 5 x 10^-4). Alternatively, transformation and recombination during mixed carriage and/or mixed urethral infection may be responsible for this reversion [15].\n\nThe impact of the acquired capacity for sexual transmission on meningococcal evolution remains to be followed. If persistent wide-spread transmission in the MSM community is confirmed, time-limited vaccination strategy specifically targeting MSM implemented thus far mainly in areas affected by the outbreaks should be reconsidered [11, 41], since more widespread vaccination of MSM could limit international spread in the MSM community.\n\n[The full article, including Figures, Methods, Results, and References, is available at the source URL.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is usually transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions, mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 percent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ in the nasopharynx at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc., facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) carries a high case fatality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.\n\nOutbreaks of IMD have occurred in the past several years among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium and France caused by a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C strain with a certain genotype (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf). Similar outbreaks among MSM caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C have occurred in Canada and the US (see prior ProMED-mail posts below).\n\nMolecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of IMD are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/).\n\nSeverely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing bacterial meningitis (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial meningitis in HIV-1-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285) and less virulent strains have been reported to cause IMD in immunocompromised HIV-infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60).

However, MSM who have developed meningococcal meningitis have been mostly HIV-negative, according to the above report.\n\nMass vaccination campaigns using meningococcal C vaccine have been used to control outbreaks of IMD in MSM (CDC. Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep. 1997; 46(RR-5): 13-21; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).\n\nA meningococcal genotype (serogroup C, PorA type P1.5-1,10-8, FetA type F3-6 and cc11) was identified in isolates from MSM with IMD in Germany and France (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20523 and http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21016). Meningococci with the identical genotype were also isolated in Germany and France from cases with urethritis/proctitis. In the present study, genome sequencing analysis showed that isolates from MSM with IMD clustered with urethritis and proctitis isolates collected in the 2 countries, distinct from other cc11/ET-15 isolates. The meningococcal isolates from both MSM with IMD and urethritis were able to grow anaerobically in the presence of nitrite, as do gonococci, unlike non-MSM/urethrtis meningococcal isolates. Anaerobic growth, usually rare in meningococci but found in gonococcus, is thought to allow gonococci to survive under anaerobic and acidic pH in the urethra or rectum, leading to the clinical manifestation of urethritis/proctitis as well as the capacity for direct sexual transmission. However, strains that were isolated from MSM with IMD were found to have genes that facilitated survival in the blood, unlike strains that remained in the urethra or rectum, causing urethritis and proctitis. These studies suggest that in the outbreak of IMD in MSM, meningococci were transmitted sexually and that reverted to a phenotype with enhanced bacterial survival in the blood, which facilitated meningococcemia and systemic dissemination. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100.]", "summary": "[The full article, including Figures, Methods, Results, and References, is available at the source URL.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is usually transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions, mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism.

One has died from the illness.\n\nAt least 6 cases were caused by the same strain of meningococcal bacteria, leading health officials to call this more seriously an 'outbreak' rather than a less concerning 'cluster.'\n\nThree of the 4 cases occurred within the past 6 weeks. Men who have sex with men are being urged to get a meningitis vaccination. It is not clear why the health alert has only now been issued.\n\nFour of the 9 cases were among men who live in LA County, while the 5 additional cases were reported by Orange County. 'This represents an increase above the typical number of reported cases,' the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said.\n\nSeveral outbreaks and clusters of meningococcal disease among gay and bisexual men have been reported in New York City, Los Angeles County and Chicago since 2013, they added. The outbreak in New York in 2013 generated new concerns about an AIDS-like virus. A total of 22 men were infected there from 2010 to 2013, and 7 of them died. Three people from Los Angeles and San Diego counties died of the disease in 2014, out of a total of 11 confirmed cases. Outbreaks have also recently been reported, primarily among people [who] were HIV-positive.\n\nPeople with HIV are more susceptible to meningococcal disease. The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended this week that all HIV patients routinely receive meningococcal vaccines.\n\n'We are concerned that gay and bisexual men in Southern California may be at increased risk for meningococcal disease,' state public health officer Dr. Karen Smith said in a statement. 'We encourage men who partner with other men to be aware of the risk of meningococcal disease and consider getting vaccinated.'\n\nInvasive meningococcal disease is a bacterial infection that develops quickly and can lead to meningitis and sepsis, health officials say. If not treated quickly, meningitis can cause permanent hearing loss, brain damage or even death.\n\nThe disease, which is fatal in about one in 10 patients, is spread by close contact with an infected person. It can be easily transmitted by kissing, through unprotected oral or anal sex and even by close proximity to an infected person who is sneezing and coughing. Even sharing a cigarette with an infected person is a risk factor.\n\nSymptoms begin within days of infection and include fever, vomiting, severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, rash and generalized muscle pains.\n\nThe AIDS Healthcare Foundation urged Los Angeles County health officials on Friday [25 Jun 2016] to develop a public information campaign, supply vaccines, and work with community partners to avoid more deaths.\n\n'We are calling on L.A. County Health officials to immediately roll out an aggressive, high profile and targeted public information campaign about this latest meningitis outbreak,' said Michael Weinstein, president of AHF. 'We urge Los Angeles County and other affected health jurisdictions to quickly ramp up their supplies of vaccines and partner with the community in vaccination efforts as well as educating the community.\n\n'We are ready and willing to partner with the county in vaccine and prevention efforts and will try to make vaccines available at our Southern California area AHF Wellness Centers next week,' Weinstein added. AHF is providing vaccines.\n\nIn April of 2014, AHF and West Hollywood City Councilman John Duran pressed health agencies to sound the alarm more directly and earlier to the gay community.\n\n[Byline: Troy Masters]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 24 Jun 2016\nSource: The Orange County Register [edited]\nhttp://www.ocregister.com/articles/disease-720426-meningococcal-health.html\n\n\nNine cases of meningococcal disease have been detected in men in Orange and Los Angeles counties since May [2016], including in one Orange County patient who died from the infection, health officials said Friday [24 Jun 2016].\n\nIn an advisory, the California Department of Public Health warned that the outbreak of the rare disease primarily shows up in adult gay and bisexual men, and that people with HIV are at particular risk.\n\nIt can cause meningitis and bloodstream infections, said Dr. Matt Zahn, medical director of epidemiology and assessment at the Orange County Health Care Agency. 'It's a vaccine-preventable disease,' he said. 'So, if a person is HIV positive or is a man who has sex with other men, it is important that he gets the vaccine.'\n\nOne in 10 people die from meningococcal disease, Zahn said. 'This is a sobering statistic because it hasn't changed even with improving medical care and treatment,' he said.\n\nThe outbreak is among several clusters reported among gay and bisexual men in New York City, Chicago and Southern California in the past 2 years.\n\nSymptoms of meningococcal disease may include fever, vomiting, severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, rash and muscle pain. Symptoms generally appear within a few days of exposure. The CDPH advised anyone who experiences these symptoms to get medical treatment immediately.\n\nState health officials said those infected with HIV and gay and bisexual men who may be at increased risk for meningococcal disease -- those with multiple partners, smokers, drug users, or who regularly frequent crowded venues -- get the MenACWY vaccine.\n\nFor information on vaccination locations, visit http://1.usa.gov/296r5Mi.\n\n[Byline: Deepa Bharath]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) have recently occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium and France caused by a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C strain with the same multilocus sequence type (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf).

All are from villages in Tharsi Township.\n\nDr Win Naing, head of the Department of Public Health in Mandalay Region, said health officials were taking preventative measures to control the outbreak. They have started a vaccination campaign and advised people in the affected area to avoid large crowds. 'We are doing fieldwork in the area where the patients live and other locations nearby,' he said. 'We are monitoring around the clock for any further outbreaks in the area.'\n\nThe cases were reported from [5 Mar 2016], when the 1st death was reported. Another child died on [7 Mar 2016], while 2 more passed away on [9 Mar 2016]. The most recent cases were detected in Aung Myin Thar village on [12 Mar 2016], with 2 suspected patients immediately taken for medical treatment, according to the Department of Public Health.\n\nU Myint Thein, a senior National League for Democracy official in Tharsi Township, said 2 patients had been transferred to Mandalay due to the severity of their illness. 'Today we went to see the patients at Meiktila Hospital. The 5 children ... are in a stable condition,' he said.\n\nTests of the blood samples taken from infected children confirmed that the meningitis had been caused by the _Neisseria meningitidis_ group B bacteria, one of 6 serotypes that can cause an outbreak.\n\nThe deaths have been attributed to delays in seeking treatment. Dr Win Naing said it was essential that anyone suspected of having the highly fatal disease present for treatment as soon as possible. 'Meningitis tends to happen in the early summer season because ... the disease can be transmitted in dusty places,' Dr Win Naing said. 'It is most commonly found in dry zone areas, such as Mandalay and Magwe.' He added that outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease have occurred seasonally since 1992. 'People need to look out for the symptoms and if they notice any people with them then they should be reported to the health department,' he said. 'They should also avoid areas with large numbers of people and use a face mask when in a dusty place.'\n\nMeningococcal meningitis is transmitted person-to-person via mucus, particularly through coughing and sneezing, or sharing eating or drinking utensils. The infection affects the lining around the brain and spinal cord. According to the World Health Organization, the commonest symptoms are a stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity to light, confusion, headaches, and vomiting.\n\nAbout 20 per cent of infected people do not show symptoms, but can act as carriers within the community, according to Dr Win Naing. Even with early treatment, 5 to 10 per cent of cases are fatal, typically within 24 to 48 hours after symptoms appear. Between 10 and 20 per cent of survivors suffer from brain damage, hearing loss or a learning disability. Without immediate antibiotic treatment, the disease is fatal in closer to 50 per cent of cases.\n\nIn order to control the spread of the outbreak, Dr Win Naing said the region health department has been vaccinating family members of affected children, and anyone else who may have been in close contact with the patients. Adjacent villages have been warned to be on the lookout for the disease and to avoid festivals, donation ceremonies or other events where crowds may congregate. The health officials also recommended sprinkling water over dirt roads to limit dust.\n\n'Any age can suffer from the disease, but children whose resistance is weak are at highest risk to be infected,' Dr Win Naing said. Meningitis is considered a leading cause of death of children under five in Myanmar.\n\n[byline: Myint Kay Thi, Kyaw Ko Ko]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-MBDS from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above says that 11 children, 4 of whom have died, developed bacterial meningitis due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B in the first 2 weeks of March 2016. All are from Tharsi Township in the Mandalay Region of central Myanmar. The news report says that family members and other close contacts of affected children are being vaccinated in order to control the spread of the outbreak. However, we are not told which meningococcal vaccine is being used.\n\nSeveral meningococcal vaccines are available. Immunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are the commonest.\n\nThere are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W135), either alone or conjugated to protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines.\n\nSerogroup B vaccines have been developed based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen. Bexsero and Trumenba are 2 new serogroup B vaccines approved for use in the US.

In order to control the spread of the outbreak, Dr Win Naing said the region health department has been vaccinating family members of affected children, and anyone else who may have been in close contact with the patients. \n\nTests of the blood samples taken from infected children confirmed that the meningitis had been caused by the _Neisseria meningitidis_ group B bacteria, one of 6 serotypes that can cause an outbreak. \n\nSerogroup B vaccines have been developed based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen. \n\n'Any age can suffer from the disease, but children whose resistance is weak are at highest risk to be infected,' Dr Win Naing said. The news report above says that 11 children, 4 of whom have died, developed bacterial meningitis due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B in the first 2 weeks of March 2016. The most recent cases were detected in Aung Myin Thar village on [12 Mar 2016], with 2 suspected patients immediately taken for medical treatment, according to the Department of Public Health. 2 children in a serious condition are being treated for the bacterial infection at Mandalay General Hospital, while 5 more children are receiving treatment at Meiktila General Hospital. \n\n\nHealth authorities are on high alert following a recent meningococcal meningitis outbreak that has claimed the lives of 4 children in Mandalay Region. The news report says that family members and other close contacts of affected children are being vaccinated in order to control the spread of the outbreak. \n\nMeningococcal meningitis is transmitted person-to-person via mucus, particularly through coughing and sneezing, or sharing eating or drinking utensils. \n\nThe cases were reported from [5 Mar 2016], when the 1st death was reported. \n\nThere are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W135), either alone or conjugated to protein. \n\nAbout 20 per cent of infected people do not show symptoms, but can act as carriers within the community, according to Dr Win Naing.

From January 2015 to end February 2016, 43 cases were reported, among which 10 were fatal, compared to two cases caused by serogroup C recorded in 2014 and three in 2013. No secondary cases occurred. 35 strains belonged to C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:ST-11(cc11). Control measures have been adopted and immunisation campaigns implemented. Studies on risk factors and carriage are ongoing.\n\nIn this report we present an unexpected increase of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in Tuscany, Italy, since January 2015, leading to a total of 43 cases, of whom 10 were fatal, due to infection with serogroup C _N. meningitidis_. In Italy, serogroup C is the second commonest serogroup (31 per cent of the 115 cases with a known serogroup in 2014), after serogroup B (48 per cent of the 115 cases in 2014) [1]. In Tuscany, the total number of IMD cases was 16 in 2014 and 12 in 2013, with 2 and 3 cases caused by serogroup C, respectively [1].\n\nEpidemiological features\n------------------------\nFrom January 2015 to February 2016, 43 laboratory-confirmed cases of IMD due to serogroup C _N. meningitidis_ (31 in 2015, 12 in 2016) were reported from the Regional Health Authority of Tuscany (RHAT) to the Italian National Surveillance System for Invasive Bacterial Disease (IBD). No secondary cases were detected. The incidence of serogroup C cases was higher than in previous years: 0.83 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2015 and 1.98 in the 1st 2 months of 2016, whereas the average incidence for 2012-2014 was 0.08 per 100 000 inhabitants ranging from 0.05 in 2014 to 0.11 in 2012.\n\nThe National Reference Laboratory at the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, ISS) received 22 bacterial isolates and 18 clinical samples (10 from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 8 from blood) from 40 patients; for 3 cases material was not available. 35 out of the 40 samples analysed were confirmed as C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:ST-11 (cc11).\n\nThe median age of the 43 cases reported in the period was 28 years (range: 9-82), with the age group 20-29 years being the most affected (n\u2009=\u200915; incidence: 3.9/100 000), followed by the age group 9-19 years (n\u2009=\u200910; incidence: 2.6/100 000). Interestingly, 18 cases were reported among people over 30 years old (incidence: 0.5/100 000), and 11 among people over 55 years old (incidence: 0.6/100 000). There was no notable difference between males and females, with 21 cases registered among women and 22 among men.\n\nThe main clinical manifestations were: sepsis only (n=18), sepsis and meningitis (n=14), followed by meningitis only (n=11). 10 patients aged between 12 and 82 years died.\n\nInformation on vaccination status was available for 42 of the 43 cases detected between January 2015 and February 2016. 5 patients had been vaccinated with meningococcal C conjugate (MCC) vaccine. Apart from one case in an individual aged 62 years, vaccinated on the day of the symptom onset, in the remaining 4 cases aged 9, 12, 17, 22 years, the vaccine was administered in 2006, 2007, 2013, and 2008, respectively. In the latter cases, the apparent vaccine failure was likely to be due to the relatively short duration of the protection induced by one vaccine dose [2]. 2 of the vaccinated cases developed meningitis and 2 sepsis (one of them died).\n\nFigure 1 [see source URL] shows the case distribution by year from January 2000 to February 2016 and by month for January 2015 to February 2016, and Figure 2 [see source URL] presents the geographical distribution of the cases. An increase in the number of cases was observed since January 2015 in a densely populated area in the north of Tuscany, between the cities of Florence, Prato, and Empoli. Between January and April 2015, the cases were confined in this area. At the end of the spring, some cases occurred in the coastal area of Tuscany, between Pisa and Viareggio, an area frequented by young people during the summer. From the end of September 2015, the cases reappeared in the original area, where 12 cases with four deaths occurred in the 1st 2 months of 2016.\n\nThe incidence was calculated as the ratio between the number of cases in the study period (14 months) divided by the person-years of exposure (calculated as the people living in each municipality of Tuscany in 2015 (http://www.demo.istat.it in Italian), multiplied by the exposure time in years (that is, 14 months/12=1.17 years)).\n\nBackground\n----------\nMeningococcal serogroup C strains cc11, are known to cause invasive disease burden worldwide [3] and are responsible for high mortality rates among cases [4]. Outbreaks due to C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:ST-11(cc11) of IMD were reported in Germany in 2013 [5], in France in 2014 [6], in Italy among staff members of a cruise ship at the port of Livorno, Tuscany, in 2012 [7], and in 2 clusters in northern Italy, in December 2007 and July 2008, respectively, showing a high rate of septicaemia and fatal outcome [8].\n\nThe RHAT introduced the MCC vaccine in the regional immunisation schedule in 2005, with 3 doses to all children at 3, 5, and 13 months of age (subsequently turning to a single dose at 13 months, in 2008), and a catch-up immunisation until 6 years of age with a single dose. In 2007, the RHAT also implemented a catch-up vaccination programme with a single dose of MCC targeting the age group 11 to 14 year-olds. At national level, MCC was introduced in the Italian National Immunisation Plan in 2012 [9].\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nSince March 2015, the RHAT involved ISS in the microbiological characterisation (including genomic analysis) and public health response. The factors contributing to an excess of IMD cases due to such hyper-virulent meningococcal C strain remain currently unknown but investigations are ongoing. An immunisation campaign has been implemented and continuously adapted to the evolution of the epidemiological situation. Starting with 30 March 2015, a single dose of meningococcal (ACYW) polysaccharide\u2010protein conjugate vaccine has been actively offered free-of-charge to the age group 11-19 years, even if already vaccinated with MCC in childhood (letters with invitations have been sent to individuals within this age group); the vaccine has been offered to individuals aged 20-44 years residing in the area of the local health units that reported at least one case of serogroup C _N. meningitidis_ since 2015 (Arezzo, Empoli, Florence, Lucca, Massa, Pistoia, Pisa, Prato, and Versilia). Up to 31 Dec 2015, 120 272 children and teenagers aged between 11 and 19 years were vaccinated, leading to a coverage of 42.5 per cent in this age group; 109 101 individuals aged between 20 and 44 years were vaccinated (vaccine coverage 14 per cent). On 16 Feb 2016, due to the increasing number of cases in age groups not previously included in the vaccination target groups, the immunisation campaign was extended to the whole Tuscany Region and to older people, using the monovalent vaccine as an alternative option to the tetravalent vaccine, maintaining the active offer only to 11-20 years age group.\n\nFollowing the advice of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), standard operating procedures for public health management of IMD, including contact tracing and administration of chemoprophylaxis to close contacts, already established before 2015, were extended and included the recommendation to offer vaccination to unimmunised people [10].\n\nConclusion\n----------\nIn order to investigate the reasons of this unusual increase in the number of cases, to assess possible epidemiological links between cases, and to identify specific groups of population at risk for both meningococcal serogroup C disease and carriage status, research protocols consisting in detailed investigation of the cases and _N. meningitidis_ cross sectional carriage surveys are going to be implemented in Tuscany, shortly. Molecular characterisation of meningococcal of serogroup C isolates, in particular those belonging to the finetype C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:ST-11(cc11), is in progress, to define the correlation with isolates reported in other countries [5,6]. The same analysis is now performed also in IMD cases occurring in other Italian Regions, in order to verify the spread of the strain involved in the outbreak in Tuscany to other Italian areas.\n\nThese investigations will help to better understand the dynamic of the ongoing circulation of this hyper-virulent meningococcal serogroup C strain and to identify groups of population at higher risk, in order to address specific prevention strategies, develop preparedness plans for an effective response to future IMD threats, and to address the ongoing public health concern.\n\nAt present, the Italian Health Authorities have enhanced IMD surveillance activities but did not consider necessary to provide special recommendations for people travelling to Tuscany.\n\n[Figures and references are available at the source URL above.]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The report above gives a fuller picture of the meningococcal C outbreak in Tuscany, Italy, than ProMED-mail has so far reported.

In Africa, meningitis causes each year sporadic cases in many countries and outbreaks in countries along the meningitis belt in West and Central Africa. In 2012, _Neisseria meningitidis_ was the cause of the epidemic with a predominant serogroup NmW135 in Cote d'Ivoire. In 2016 _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ was confirmed to be the main agent of the meningitis epidemic in Ghana. This article aims to bring forward the features of the circulating serotypes of this epidemic that caused 50% mortality in order to contribute to the therapeutic and immunization response to the serotypes components of vaccines.\n\nA total of 66 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected from the National Reference Center of Meningitis in Pasteur Institute of Cote d'Ivoire, which were coming from areas affected by the epidemic germs. The identification of the germs was made through conventional bacteriology and by the PCR method. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) [was determined for] penicillin G and ceftriaxone. The _S. pneumoniae_ serotypes [were determined] by region based on differences in the [capsular] polyssacharides. The molecular serotyping of pneumococci was done according to the Rekha et al, 2006 Protocol.\n\nOut of the 66 CSF collected from the patients suspected to have meningitis, 28 were positive with a rate of 42.4%: 71.4% (20/28) [were positive for] _S. pneumoniae_, 17.8% (5/28) [for] _N. meningitidis_ and 7.1% (2/28) _H. influenzae_ b.\n\nThe MIC [for an isolate of _S. pneumoniae_] was 0.015 to penicillin G and 0.06 mg/L for the ceftriaxone. The strains were very sensitive, allowing treatment according to the national protocol.\n\nSerotyping (PCR) of _S. pneumoniae_ shows a distribution of 50% (10/20) for serotype 1, 5% (1/20) for serotype 12 and 5% (1/20) for the serotype 5.\n\nThese results confirm the predominance of serotype 1 _S. pneumoniae_ in Cote d'Ivoire. This is a polyclonal epidemic. The [molecular?] sequencing will clarify the characteristics of the serotype 1 strains.\n\n--\nDr. Clarisse Kouame Elogne\nAttach\u00e9 de recherche\nUnite de Bacteriologie Clinique\nResponsable qualit\u00e9 et bios\u00e9curit\u00e9\nInstitut Pasteur de CI\nCote d'Ivoire\n<nzolecla@yahoo.fr>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Clarisse Kouame Elogne for submission of data on the etiology of bacterial meningitis in Cote d'Ivoire, a country in the African meningitis belt.\n\nThe usual pathogen in this region has been _Neisseria meningitidis_. However, several other bacterial species, including _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Hemophilus pneumoniae_, have noted to be involved in bacterial meningitis outbreaks in the African meningitis belt before (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699486).\n\nSome studies have emphasized that _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ may cause outbreaks of bacterial meningitis in an epidemic pattern in the African meningitis belt during the dry season, especially in older children and young adults (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/192/2/192.abstract?ijkey=9d47813b96aa1d50880f62e9e7efbc4d32bfea9a&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha and http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.abstract?ijkey=7d2ca30004fffc8d1410102f6ec758a72efc1f82&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha). _S. pneumoniae_ serotype 1 from a single clonal complex (ST 217) has predominated in several outbreaks, but other pneumococcal serotypes are also isolated. The case-fatality rate for pneumococcal meningitis has been high; over 40 percent of cases are fatal, regardless of age group.\n\nIdentifying the specific microbial causes of a bacterial meningitis outbreak is critically important, because prior meningococcal immunization programs with a particular serogroup vaccine in the region may have resulted in replacement of a previous serogroup with other meningococcal serogroups or the outbreak may actually be due to non-meningococcal bacterial species.\n\nUse of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine could be beneficial in an outbreak where pneumococcal etiology predominates. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines reduce carriage of serotypes of _S. pneumoniae_ contained in the vaccine and thus person-to-person transmission of these pathogens, which occurs by close contact with respiratory secretions or saliva. However, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was found to include serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) protective against only 8 percent of the isolates in one study in Burkina Faso (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.full).

However, several other bacterial species, including _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Hemophilus pneumoniae_, have noted to be involved in bacterial meningitis outbreaks in the African meningitis belt before (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699486). Some studies have emphasized that _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ may cause outbreaks of bacterial meningitis in an epidemic pattern in the African meningitis belt during the dry season, especially in older children and young adults (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/192/2/192.abstract?ijkey=9d47813b96aa1d50880f62e9e7efbc4d32bfea9a&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha and http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.abstract?ijkey=7d2ca30004fffc8d1410102f6ec758a72efc1f82&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha). \nBacterial meningitis is an infection caused by 3 main germs named _Neisseria meningitidis_, _Haemophilus influenzae_ and _Streptococcus pneumoniae_. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevnar 13, which covers serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F, may be more effective, especially when serotype 1 predominates. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines reduce carriage of serotypes of _S. pneumoniae_ contained in the vaccine and thus person-to-person transmission of these pathogens, which occurs by close contact with respiratory secretions or saliva. MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL - COTE D'IVOIRE: STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE ST.1 PREDOMINATES\n shows a distribution of 50% (10/20) for serotype 1, 5% (1/20) for serotype 12 and 5% (1/20) for the serotype 5. From: Clarisse Kouame Elogne <nzolecla@yahoo.fr> [edited]\n\n\nPneumococcal infection in the Meningitis Outbreak of 2016 in West Africa: Cote d'Ivoire\n------------------- _S. pneumoniae_ serotype 1 from a single clonal complex (ST 217) has predominated in several outbreaks, but other pneumococcal serotypes are also isolated. In Africa, meningitis causes each year sporadic cases in many countries and outbreaks in countries along the meningitis belt in West and Central Africa. Out of the 66 CSF collected from the patients suspected to have meningitis, 28 were positive with a rate of 42.4%: 71.4% (20/28) [were positive for] _S. pneumoniae_, 17.8% (5/28) [for] _N. meningitidis_ and 7.1% (2/28) _H. influenzae_ b.\n\nThe MIC [for an isolate of _S. pneumoniae_] was 0.015 to penicillin G and 0.06 mg/L for the ceftriaxone. \n\nUse of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine could be beneficial in an outbreak where pneumococcal etiology predominates. This article aims to bring forward the features of the circulating serotypes of this epidemic that caused 50% mortality in order to contribute to the therapeutic and immunization response to the serotypes components of vaccines. However, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was found to include serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) protective against only 8 percent of the isolates in one study in Burkina Faso (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.full). In 2016 _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ was confirmed to be the main agent of the meningitis epidemic in Ghana. A total of 66 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected from the National Reference Center of Meningitis in Pasteur Institute of Cote d'Ivoire, which were coming from areas affected by the epidemic germs. The case-fatality rate for pneumococcal meningitis has been high; over 40 percent of cases are fatal, regardless of age group. The _S. pneumoniae_ serotypes [were determined] by region based on differences in the [capsular] polyssacharides. These results confirm the predominance of serotype 1 _S. pneumoniae_ in Cote d'Ivoire. \n\nSerotyping (PCR) of _S. pneumoniae_ Date: Mon 14 Mar 2016\n \n\nThe usual pathogen in this region has been _Neisseria meningitidis_.

It is estimated that between 10 to 25 percent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc. facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) carries a high mortality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.\n\nIMD is reportedly rare in Italy, where 0.25 confirmed cases per 100 000 population were observed in 2011, whereas the rate for Europe as a whole was 0.77 (http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2015/710656/#B2).\n\nThere are 12 serogroups, but the majority of invasive meningococcal infections are caused by organisms from the A, B, C, X, Y, or W-135 serogroups. Serogroup B and C have been responsible for the majority of IMD in Europe, but since implementation of conjugated meningococcal serogroup C vaccine immunization programs, the frequency of IMD due to serogroup C has dropped; 73.6 percent of IMD was caused by serogroup B in Europe in 2011, while serogroup C accounted for only 14.4 percent of cases in 2011 (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/invasive-bacterial-diseases-surveillance-2011.pdf).\n\nIn Italy, since 2009-2010, most regions have established a universal infant free-of-charge meningococcal C conjugate vaccine program, reaching an average vaccination coverage of 68 percent in the 2008 birth cohort (http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2015/710656/#B2), and in the same period, 12 regions recommended the immunization of adolescents aged between 11 and 16 years, with one dose. The National Vaccination Plan 2012-2014 included meningococcal serogroup C conjugate universal routine vaccination for toddlers between 13 and 15 months of age and 11-18-year-old adolescents (http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2015/710656/#B2).\n\nMolecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of IMD are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI.

Tain District, where the pneumococcal meningitis outbreak is occurring, is one of the 22 districts of the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tain_District).

While the state authorities attribute it to the outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis, the locals believe it is simply witchcraft or a Jin spirit that struck.\n\nThe victims were initially said to have complained of severe headache, stomach pain and high body temperature. They all died within 24 hours after contracting the disease. There are divergent views about the number of deaths so far recorded, with some putting it at 10; others claiming they are higher since the disease manifested. Thus, it remains a source of controversy even when state officials maintain there was no death recorded because those that were brought to Yauri General Hospital had been treated and discharged.\n\nCommunity leaders contacted refused to talk because they were asked not to by the Emir of Yauri, Dr Zayyanu Abdullahi. However, some locals who spoke to Daily Trust confirmed that many deaths were recorded as a result of the disease, which emanated from Kasuwan Albasa (Onion market) very close to Yauri River, a tributary of the Niger.\n\nThe market is patronized by farmers from different states, particularly the neighbouring Niger State, whose locals transport their farm produce to the market by canoe. A resident of Yauri, Alhaji Shehu Wakala, said the death toll has as of Thursday 18 [Feb 2016] reached 17, saying it was a mysterious disease because it strikes only those with links to the market.\n\nA trader at the market said the disease started manifesting in the market on Mon 8 Feb [2016], when the market was filled to capacity. 'I was in the shop when I was told of the disease. And few minutes later the market became deserted by traders for fear of contacting it,' he recounted, adding that it was after 2 days that people started returning and opened their shops for business, and there had been no report of such disease since then.\n\nAn onion dealer who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that 4 deaths had been recorded in the market on that fateful Monday. 2 of the people that died were female and two male, including a purified-water hawker and a sugar-cane trader. He could not tell the actual cause of the deaths, but revealed there were conflicting reports about it, with some saying it was a spirit that struck, while others attributed it to witchcraft, and some health workers from Birnin Kebbi who visited the market said their investigation showed it was cerebrospinal meningitis.\n\nHe however believed that the disease was caused by contaminated water from the river, which he said was used by virtually all the traders for drinking and performing ablution, as it remains the only source of water in the area and environs. 'We had made several complaints to the local authorities that we need a clean source of water in the area, but nothing has been done about it. The last time our chairman complained they said they were looking for private individuals who would provide such amenities and manage them, but that was not forthcoming,' he said.\n\nWhen contacted, chairman of the traders association declined to speak until there was written permission from the Emirate Council. He intimated that they were summoned and warned by the council not to grant any interview to the media unless there was a written permission duly signed by the secretary of the palace. The secretary on the other hand said it was the principal medical officer of the Yauri General Hospital who has been authorised to speak on the matter by the ministry. But the principal officer declined to comment on the matter, saying nobody authorised him to entertain any questions from the press.\n\nHowever, a [member of] senior medical personnel in the hospital confirmed that based on the outcome of their investigation, the disease was the result of the outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis. He denied that it was witchcraft or a spirit and revealed they were on top of the situation. 'I don't practice witchcraft. I don't believe in it. This is what the people out there have been saying. As a result of the disease, an isolation centre was opened at Rukuballo which is a few kilometers from the city,' he said, adding that 9 people who suffered the attack were treated and discharged at the centre and 7 were presently on admission and responding to treatment. He said that no deaths had been recorded in the centre and if there [had been], [they must have been] outside the facility.\n\nIn addition, patients were provided with enough drugs and there was an Abuja-based organization which visited the facility and promised to support them. It was observed at the isolation centre that few people were on admission and they were managed with only 2 nurses, who kept sealed lips on the matter.\n\nSadly, [a] 14 year old was not fortunate to be among the survivors. Her father said his daughter was among the vendors at the onion market, selling pure water. He recalled her breaking the news of the outbreak of the disease to her grandmother, who in turn asked her not to go there again but she was adamant. She later complained of headache, stomach pain, and fever after returning from the market on Monday [15 Feb 2016] and she was taken to a herbalist who said she was suffering from spiritual attack and gave them some herbs. After taking it she was relieved that night. But her condition worsened the following day and her uncle was called after which he decided to take her to the hospital but she died on the way.\n\nThe Kebbi State government, in a statement signed by special adviser to Governor Atiku Bagudu on health, Dr Fatima Mustapha Bunza, said the recent 'strange' killer disease in Yauri, Yauri LGA has not put the state at epidemic threshold. It said it was caused by cerebrospinal meningitis, adding that the outbreak was reported from Yauri town in Yauri LGA on 8 Feb 2016 with additional cases on 13 Fri Feb 2016, making a total of 9 cases. [The statement] read: 'An isolation camp was immediately established in Yauri and samples for laboratory investigations dispatched to the laboratory in Sokoto.'\n\nThe statement continued: '2 out of 9 samples tested were confirmed positive for [_Neisseria meningitidis_ ] serotype C. A single case from Andarai in Maiyama LGA was earlier confirmed in January [2016]. The 1st confirmed case was treated and discharged in January [2016] and currently the 2 confirmed cases are responding to treatment at the isolation camp in Yauri. With these numbers alone, we are not yet at the epidemic threshold, but we should all be on the alert and intensify surveillance in all our communities as the government of Kebbi State deploys proactive measures to forestall escalation of the situation.'\n\nThe statement also revealed that the state government has already instituted some measures, which included the state's rapid-response team and the Yauri LGA teams which were activated from the 1st day of the report. In addition, CSM [cerebrospinal meningitis] Treatment protocol has been shared to all the disease surveillance and notification officers (DSNOs) and some test lumbar puncture kits were also shared. More kits are being expected from World Health Organization (WHO) country office.\n\nIt further intimated that an active case search supported by DSNOs, as well as WHO, is on-going, including community mobilisation, advocacy and sensitisation of traditional leaders in the LGA. In this regard, Kebbi State government is working with the Federal Ministry of Health, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (CDC) to mobilise support to contain further spread as well as secure vaccines for dual purposes of prevention and [creating] immunity within the population, based on available results and epidemiological history.\n\n[byline: Anyichie Tochukwu]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nigeria falls within the African Meningitis Belt, the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa where epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June. _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A has been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf).

' According to Dr Bampoe, it remains unclear why pneumococcal meningitis is spreading quickly in the districts in the Brong Ahafo region, but he said that the focus of health officials at the moment is on keeping the disease from spreading further. \n\nSince the last ProMED-mail post on this outbreak 2 weeks ago, the number of cases has risen from 30 to 55, and the number of deaths from 8 to 'slightly over 19'. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines reduce carriage of serotypes of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ contained in the vaccine and thus person-to-person transmission of these pathogens, which occurs by close contact with respiratory secretions or saliva.

More than 20 people have died from the infection within a few months. More than 300 cases of infection have been recorded in the country since the beginning of the year [2015] in total.\n\nThe main cause of meningitis is meningococcal disease. Without preventive measures, outbreaks occur once every 10 years. The last time it was recorded in Kyrgyzstan was 2006. There were deaths. Forecasts of doctors are unfavorable.\n\n'Starting in 2014, the increase in the incidence of meningococcal meningitis was recorded. If you take our hospital data, you will see that in 2014, 283 patients were hospitalized due to meningitis; for 11 months of the current year [2015], we have 301 sick persons,' said Asel Balabanova, the head of the admissions department of the Republican Clinical Infectious Diseases Hospital.\n\nMoH [Ministry of Health] last year [2014] and this year officially addressed to the Kyrgyz government the specific calculation of needs for the purchase of vaccines against this infection,' said Abdykadyr Joroev, the head of the Department of Prevention of Diseases of the Sanitary-Epidemiological Service of the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nThe plans are to vaccinate children from 2 to 17 years of age. It will take more than half a million dollars. Such money doesn't exist in the budget. Therefore, the MoH sent several requests to donors and to the embassies of various countries to help with the purchase of vaccine. These letters are under review. Vaccination in the country costs up to USD 5.00. Such a sum for vaccination is not payable by everyone in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nMeningococcal disease may affect people of all ages but is commoner in children of preschool age.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_ infects only humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10 per cent of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers, as well as people ill with invasive meningococcal disease, are responsible for the spread of the disease. The risk for acquiring meningococcal disease in close contacts of ill people is 500-800 times greater than among the general population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.\n\nAntibiotics are recommended to prevent secondary infection in close contacts of patients with invasive meningococcal disease. Those at-risk contacts include household members, roommates, attendees at the same child care center, or anyone directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions through close social contact during the 7 days before onset of disease in the index case, such as through kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, or endotracheal intubation. Because the risk for illness in contacts is highest during the 1st few days after infection, chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) after contact with an index case-patient. Chemoprophylaxis administered after 14 days is probably of limited or no value (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr4605.pdf). Antibiotics that effectively eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, and these drugs are appropriate for chemoprophylaxis. In areas where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of _N. meningitidis_ have been detected, ciprofloxacin should not be used for chemoprophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm).\n\nMass meningococcal vaccination campaigns have been used to control outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease with vaccines that contain meningococcal serogroups appropriate for the outbreak (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). However, we are not told in the news report above what serogroups are causing the outbreak or what types of meningococcal vaccines are planned to be used. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.\n\nSeveral meningococcal vaccines are available. Immunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups.

Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/138.]", "summary": "\n\nMass meningococcal vaccination campaigns have been used to control outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease with vaccines that contain meningococcal serogroups appropriate for the outbreak (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).

It is the deadliest form of meningococcal disease with the highest death rate but can be treated in intensive care if caught early enough.\n\nNew figures reveal that between July 2013 and June 2014 just 98 cases were reported in the England and Wales -- but in the same period last year [July 2014-June 2015] this had soared by 88 percent to 184.\n\nMen W now accounts for 15 per cent of all meningococcal disease in the UK -- and experts are warning that the alarming rise will continue unless there is widespread uptake of a new vaccine.\n\nChristopher Head, the chief executive of Meningitis Research Foundation, said there is particular concern over the 'ST-11' strain of Men W in teenagers. 'The rise in this ST-11 Men W disease is particularly alarming because it is striking mainly healthy people across all age groups, but with a marked spike amongst teenagers,' she said. 'The strain is also associated with more severe illness which often requires treatment in intensive care and has a higher associated death rate than other strains of meningococcal disease, 13 per cent compared to 5 to 10 percent for other strains.'\n\nRecent figures from Public Health England show in 2009, Men W only accounted for 1 to 2 percent of all meningococcal cases in the UK. But in 2013/14 it accounted for nearly 15 per cent of all cases.\n\nProfessor Adam Finn from the University of Bristol has also seen a sharp rise in the disease in the South West alone, with 12 cases reported last year. The Paediatrics professor said: 'In most years we had seen only 1 or 2 [cases]. So the number of cases has gone up quite a lot. Now a dozen might not sound like that many, but nevertheless, if you multiply that by the county, you can quickly get to cases that are in the hundreds. So it is the trajectory of this, the rapid rise, that's caused the alarm, and we really want to get on top of this before those cases double again, or double again, and we start seeing dozens and dozens of cases.'\n\nTo try and stem the spread of ST-11, a new vaccine has been introduced for 14-18-year-olds and under-25-year-olds who are going to university for the 1st time. The new starters at university and 17-18-year-olds are being treated 1st with Men ACWY vaccine as they are at a higher risk, with 14-years-old treated as the vaccine is restocked.\n\nChristopher Head added: 'Adolescents aged 14 to 18 are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group and offering Men ACWY vaccine to all of them should stop the bacteria from being passed on. This means that even unvaccinated people will be protected from catching the disease -- an effect known as herd protection. Although we welcome the implementation of the Men ACWY vaccine amongst 14-18-year-olds over the next couple of years, it will take time for herd protection to be established. So babies, who are particularly vulnerable to developing disease will remain unprotected. Fortunately, the Men B vaccine Bexsero, which will be routinely available for babies from September [2015], will protect against Men W ST-11.'\n\nAnyone concerned about the new strain can call the Meningitis Research Foundation helpline on 080 8800 3344.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_ only infects humans; there is no animal reservoir and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10 percent of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations.

Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.\n\nIn the UK, babies have been routinely offered the meningococcal C conjugate vaccine (Men C) at 3 months of age as part of the National Health Service (NHS) childhood vaccination program since 1999. A new meningococcal B vaccine (Men B or Bexsero) is being 1st added to the childhood immunization program starting in September 2015 (https://www.meningitisnow.org/how-we-help/campaigns/beat-it-now/faqs-on-meningitis-b-vaccine/?gclid=CN6JjdSKk8gCFcQUHwodxysLfQ).\n\nThe vaccination schedule in the UK at present is as follows: At 2 months of age babies are given Men B vaccine; at 3 months of age, Men C; at 4 months, a 2nd dose of Men B; at 12-13 months, a 3rd dose of Men B and a 2nd dose of Men C in a combined vaccine with _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib); and at 13-18 years of age and 1st-time university students, Men ACWY (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-c-vaccine.aspx).\n\nSince the Men C vaccine was introduced in 1999, the Men C disease has been virtually eliminated in the UK. Nowadays, there are just a handful of Men C cases each year, mainly in older, unvaccinated adults (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-c-vaccine.aspx). However, the near elimination of Men C as a consequence of the Men C conjugate vaccine program in the UK has been followed by the emergence of a 'replacement' pathogen, meningococcus serogroup W.\n\nSimilarly, after widespread use of conjugate meningococcal A vaccine in the African meningitis belt, meningococcus serogroup A, the serogroup that had been historically the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in the African meningitis belt (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf), was eliminated, followed by its replacement with meningococcal serogroup C (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger (05): serogroup C, fatal, vaccine shortage 20150802.3552463). Similarly, serotype replacement has been observed following pneumococcal vaccination programs, which necessitated expansion of serotypes covered by the vaccine (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-vaccine strain emergence - USA (AK) 20070425.1348).\n\nBecause of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroup W as a cause of invasive meningococcal disease in the UK, the UK is now offering an expanded conjugated serogroup vaccine Men ACWY for adolescents who are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group to stop the spread of serogroup W. This is being done by replacing the routine teenage Men C booster with the Men ACWY vaccine (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx).

The beginning of the epidemic in the Tomsk region was caused by warm weather and the premature opening of the bathing season. Also, the main risk factors for the infection are consumption of fruits and vegetables not subjected to careful handling and non-observance of measures of personal hygiene.' See more at http://70.rospotrebnadzor.ru/. - Mod NR]\n\n[The term 'meningitis' means an inflammation of the meninges, which are the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. Normally, there are 0 to 5 white cells (all mononuclear cells) per cmm [per cubic millimeter] in the CSF. CSF becomes cloudy when there are more than 500 white cells per cmm. When the CSF is visibly clear, but on laboratory examination the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating, the term aseptic meningitis is used.\n\nThe most common cause of aseptic meningitis is a viral infection, and enteroviruses are common causes of viral meningitis, especially in children during the summer months. However, aseptic meningitis may be caused by other viruses, such as arboviruses, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, some bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Non-infectious causes include certain drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and systemic diseases, such as lupus, sarcoidosis, and metastatic cancer.\n\nMost people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person, through fecal contamination of water or food, or contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Enteroviruses can also be spread through the respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person.\n\nTomsk is a city and the administrative center of Tomsk Oblast, Russia, located on the Tom River in Siberia, with a population of 524 669 in 2010 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomsk). - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map shpwomg Tomsk can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/471.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Rospotrebnadzor today [28 Aug 2015] put a message on its website:\n\n'Rospotrebnadzor of the Tomsk region reports that, according to the preliminary diagnosis from August [2015], there continued a seasonal rise in the incidence of enterovirus infection, including acute viral meningitis.

When the CSF is visibly clear, but on laboratory examination the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating, the term aseptic meningitis is used. \n\nParents and relatives of the patients also reported on overcrowding of those sick with enteroviral meningitis. In the 2nd medical unit, 54 patient beds (45 in the clinic of Simbirtseva), 80 patients, and a 3rd city hospital with 76 patients were crowded, being treated for the infection, despite the fact that the latter is designed for 70. \n\nThere are many references that tell about an outbreak of meningitis in Tomsk without giving specific figures. According to TB2[?], on Wednesday [29 Wed 2015?] 28 patients with suspected meningitis were seen at a clinic in Tomsk.

County Public Health officials stress these are cases of viral meningitis and not the more dangerous bacterial meningitis.\n\n'People with viral meningitis usually complain they've got the worst headache of their life', says Ann McDowell, epidemiologist with the San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department, 'they're feeling nauseous, they might throw up, a stiff neck, they are sensitive to light, those are the most common symptoms that you see.' Meningitis, be it viral or bacterial, must be reported to the local county public health department wherever it is detected. So far no bacterial meningitis has been detected on or off the Cal Poly campus.\n\n'Viral meningitis is contagious person to person only if you are in close proximity and sharing personal fluids', McDowell says, 'so if you are sharing cups or eating utensils, or personal hygiene, or if you are hugging or kissing or in close contact with somebody you can you can spread it but it's very rare to spread viral meningitis.'\n\nCal Poly students we spoke with say they were alerted about the viral meningitis cases on campus by the University via email. 'I'm glad that I'm aware of it', says Cal Poly student Erin Clark, 'but I feel like that's a pretty low percentage of people affected.' 'Wash your hands more, don't go to class if you're feeling real bad, professors are really understanding', adds Cal Poly student Martha Limon, 'go to the health center, even if its just a cough, just go to the health center.'\n\nThere's no vaccine or antibiotic for viral meningitis, treatment includes plenty of rest and fluids, full recovery can take up to 10 days.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The term 'meningitis' means an inflammation of the meninges, which are the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord, and implies lack of brain and spinal cord involvement (otherwise called encephalitis and myelitis, respectively). In viral meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually visibly clear, but on laboratory examination the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating. The symptoms of viral meningitis usually last from 7 to 10 days, and the patient recovers completely.\n\nThe non-polio enteroviruses are the most common causes of viral meningitis, especially during the summer and fall months. However, other causes of viral meningitis include mumps, lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses, arboviruses, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2. Some bacteria and non-infectious causes of meningitis can produce a CSF picture simulating viral meningitis. Non-infectious causes include certain drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and systemic diseases, such as lupus, sarcoidosis, and metastatic cancer.\n\nMost people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person, through fecal contamination of water or food, or contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Enteroviruses can also be spread through the respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person.\n\nCalifornia Polytechnic State University, also known as Cal Poly, is a public university located in San Luis Obispo, California, United States, with almost 20 000 undergraduate and 1000 postgraduate students (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Polytechnic_State_University).

This was the largest meningitis outbreak caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C in the African meningitis belt.\n\nThe number of suspected cases increased very rapidly, tripling weekly between 1 and 15 May 2015. 13 districts in Niger crossed the epidemic threshold. The 5 districts of Niamey, Niger's capital and largest city, reported 5267 suspected cases and 260 deaths.\n\nThe outbreak peaked between 4 and 10 May 2015 when 2182 cases, including 132 deaths, were reported. Since then, the outbreak declined substantially -- from 22 to 28 Jun, a total of 11 cases, including 2 deaths, were reported.\n\nLaboratory tests confirmed the predominance of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (Nm) serogroup C in the affected areas, with Nm serogroup W also being identified in 12 percent of positive samples. Although serogroup C has been the predominant cause of meningitis in wealthy countries, it has never been of high concern in Africa.\n\nAn epidemic committee was activated to manage the outbreak at all levels of the country. An international team comprising experts from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was deployed to support the Ministry of Public Health in carrying out epidemiological investigations and strengthening the national surveillance capacity.\n\nTogether with its partners, WHO assisted the government of Niger in the implementation of mass vaccination campaigns and other emergency control measures. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control approved 4 vaccination requests and released 965 000 doses of multivalent C and W containing polysaccharide vaccine and 200 000 doses of ACYW conjugate vaccine. Furthermore, the government of Niger obtained 200 000 doses of polysaccharide ACWY vaccine from the government of Mali.\n\nIn addition to mass immunization campaigns and enhanced surveillance, social mobilization and case management activities were performed in all affected areas. These measures led to the control of the outbreak.

A vaccine introduced 5 years ago has all but defeated meningitis A infections in Africa. But infections with another strain, Type C, are on the rise.\n\nSome experts fear the new strain will explode next year [2016], while others say too little is known to predict its course reliably.\n\nMeningitis C vaccines exist but are expensive: USD 20 per shot is the lowest price offered thus far to an international public health consortium, led by the World Health Organization, that stockpiles vaccines for emergencies. The consortium, the International Coordinating Group for Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control, is seeking 5 million doses. To be effective, they must be shipped and injected before January [2016], when meningitis normally returns to Africa with the dry harmattan winds. Unless something drastic happens -- a surge of donor money, or huge price cuts -- the consortium's experts do not hold out much hope. 'If we don't get the doses, we'll be having a really hard time,' said Dr. William A. Perea, coordinator of the WHO's epidemic diseases control unit. 'So we are making a little noise.'\n\nThe global vaccine industry is fragile. Because of mergers and acquisitions, only 4 major pharmaceutical companies -- GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi-Pasteur, Merck and Pfizer -- still make vaccines for diseases other than flu. They are primarily interested in serving wealthy countries, where they can charge USD 100 or more per dose. As a result, there are too few factories to supply the vaccines poor countries need and, also, little competition to drive down prices.\n\n'Vaccine pricing has traditionally been much more secretive than drug pricing,' said Kate Elder, vaccines policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders. 'When we survey companies, they never tell us how they arrive at prices.' State-owned factories in India, Brazil, Cuba and elsewhere also manufacture meningitis vaccines. While they can sometimes be paid to make more than their own countries need, many are reliant on old technology and hampered by government bureaucracies. A low-priced vaccine against meningitis C and 4 other strains of the infection is being developed in India but will need at least another 5 years of testing.\n\nMeningitis used to strike thousands of Africans every year. In 1997, meningitis sickened 250 000 people and killed 25 000. Survivors also suffer. 1/4th are left brain-damaged, paralyzed, prone to seizures, or without limbs that had to be amputated. In African schools for the deaf, most students are meningitis victims. Desperate families often sell everything to pay for care: chickens, cows, even front doors, which in West Africa can be elaborately carved heirlooms.\n\nType A bacteria were once responsible for more than 80 percent of Africa's meningitis cases, but that infection is being vanquished by a new vaccine, MenAfriVac, which was introduced in 2010 by the WHO, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and PATH, a Seattle health technology group. Over 220 million doses against Type A, made by the Serum Institute of India for 50 cents each, have been injected. But that success has had an alarming coda. Two years ago, a new Type C strain appeared, a genetic variant from the previous Type C.\n\nIn April [2015], a serious outbreak in Niger sickened nearly 6000 people and caused nearly 500 deaths. 'There was a lot of anxiety, because very few people in Niger didn't know somebody who'd gotten ill or died in the past,' said Dr. Sarah A. Meyer, an epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who helped fight the outbreak. 'People prayed for the rains to start. And they started rushing to the pharmacy for vaccines.' Experts are now fiercely debating what will happen when the harmattan winds return to Africa's so-called meningitis belt, which stretches from the Atlantic Coast to Ethiopia.\n\nExperts at the WHO and Doctors Without Borders fear that the new strain will spread. But others, including Dr. Meyer and colleagues at the CDC, say there is no way to predict that with confidence. Previous outbreaks of meningitis C -- in Europe, for example -- have not followed the pattern typical of Type A in Africa: a few low-level years, then an explosive epidemic. 'The idea that there is a death knell sounding for these countries is exaggerated,' said Dr. Marc LaForce, a meningitis expert who led the development of MenAfriVac. But the new Type C strain is not identical to its European ancestor, 'so one has to prepare,' said Dr. Olivier Ronveaux, an epidemiologist at the WHO. Over the next few weeks, his agency hopes to swab the throats of Africans across the belt to see how many carry the new Type C strain without symptoms. That may help predict what will happen in January [2016].\n\nOn a much smaller scale, a similar strain substitution took place on American college campuses in the last decade. Expensive new quadrivalent vaccines, effective against multiple strains of meningitis, were introduced in 2005 and reduced infections with Types A, C, W and Y by more than 90 percent. Then, in 2013, the B strain surged, causing outbreaks at Princeton and the University of California, Santa Barbara. One student died. The Obama administration responded by importing a meningitis B vaccine that had been approved in Europe but not in the United States.\n\nMeningitis often strikes young people and can progress from a bad headache to death so quickly that hospital care comes too late, even in the United States. Mysteriously, _Neisseria_ bacteria spread easily in saliva and harmlessly colonize the throats of about a 1/5th of the world's population. The bacteria kill only if they reach the bloodstream or the meninges, membranes protecting the brain and spine. In the West, 'freshman meningitis' or 'boot camp meningitis' affects people gathered in dorms or barracks who adopt new habits like sharing beer bottles, toothbrushes, cigarettes or joints, or kissing.\n\nIn Africa, meningitis surges when cold winds force families indoors and dry out throats, opening tiny cracks through which bacteria enter the blood.\n\nThe world used to rely on polysaccharide vaccines, which are cheap, but their protection does not last long, and they do not kill silent throat infections. About 20 years ago, conjugate vaccines were introduced. By coupling the polysaccharides -- sugarlike molecules from the bacterial membranes -- to proteins, they provoke long-lasting immune responses and can also clear silent infections.\n\nSix strains of the meningitis bacteria cause disease: A, B, C, W, X and Y. GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi make conjugate vaccines against A, C, W and Y and have made some of them available to the WHO at lower prices. But the manufacturers cannot produce enough for a major outbreak. The Serum Institute of India is working on a vaccine against 5 strains -- all but B -- but it will not be finished until about 2020, Dr. LaForce said, assuming it passes all clinical trials.\n\nVaccines against Type B bacteria must be made differently because the polysaccharides on the membrane of that strain resemble some on the surface of human nerve cells, so there is a risk that making antibodies to them could cause a dangerous autoimmune reaction.\n\n[Byline: Donald G.

Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days, but can range between 2 and 10 days.\n\nThe news reports say that antibiotics and immunization are being given to close contacts as precautionary measures. The risk for acquiring meningococcal disease in close contacts is 500-800 times greater than among the general population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). Effective prophylactic antibiotic regimens for adults include: rifampin 600 mg orally twice daily for 2 days; ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally as a single dose; and ceftriaxone 250 mg as a single intramuscular injection.\n\nSeveral meningococcal vaccines are available to control the disease during an outbreak. Immunity following use of a meningococcal vaccine is specific for the capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups.

Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.

State health officials are urging men who have sex with men (often shortened to MSM) to be vaccinated as soon as possible for meningococcal meningitis, after the Ramsey County resident became infected with and died from the disease.\n\nIn a news release, Minnesota Department of Health [MDH] officials say they are concerned about possible connections between the victim and an ongoing outbreak of disease, though no direct connection has yet been found.\n\nThe release says the man in his 40s, who is known to have had sex with men, died in the past week from the disease, which [is] caused by bacteria [_Neisseria meningitidis_] that progresses rapidly and can be fatal in about 10-15 percent of cases.\n\nHis condition was exacerbated by the fact that he was also HIV-positive, which placed him at greater risk of developing serious illness from meningococcal meningitis, according to the department.\n\n'We believe that the MSM community in Minnesota may be at increased risk for meningococcal disease,' Kristen Ehresmann, director of the infectious disease division at the MDH, said. 'We want to try to head off the possibility of an outbreak occurring here, so we strongly encourage all MSM, especially those who are HIV-positive, to go get vaccinated.'\n\nBecause the outbreak in Chicago [Illinois] has seen 7 people infected in the MSM community, of whom 1 has died, the MDH says those who are most at risk of infection are HIV-infected men who have sex with men. Also at high risk are men who regularly have close or intimate sexual contact with men met through websites, apps, or at bars or parties.\n\nThey are being advised to see their doctor or go to a vaccination clinic to get a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination, which covers the bacteria (serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_) currently causing the outbreak.\n\nThe disease is transmitted through close personal contact in small droplets of saliva or nasal secretions, with those who have it contracting it through kissing, drinking directly from the same container, sharing smoking materials or through other contact with nose or throat secretions.\n\nAccording to WebMD, it is a 'rare but serious infection' that causes the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed. It affects around 1000 people in the US every year and can be fatal or cause serious complications without quick treatment, with the Centers for Disease Control [CDC] saying around 15 percent of those who survive can be left with disabilities including deafness or brain damage.\n\nThe most common symptoms of the disease are sudden high fever, a severe and persistent headache, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting, a discomfort with bright light, drowsiness, joint pain, and confusion. WebMD said that a 'reddish or purple' skin rash that doesn't turn white when a glass is pressed against it is another important sign to watch for, as the disease can cause blood poisoning.\n\n[Byline: Adam Uren]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Minnesota, with a population of almost 5.5 million people, is a state in the Midwestern United States. Ramsey County, where the man who died of meningococcal meningitis resided, is located directly to the east of the city of Minneapolis. The seat of Ramsey County is the city of St. Paul, which is also Minnesota's state capital. Nearly 60 percent of state's residents live in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the 'Twin Cities'); the rest of the state consists of farming country and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota). Minneapolis-Saint Paul is about 400 miles (650 km) to the northwest of Chicago by interstate highways.\n\nThe news report refers to an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis serogroup C outbreak in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Chicago, Illinois, area, which ProMED-mail reported last week (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (IL) fatal, MSM, vaccine, RFI 20150711.3502722) and which has now apparently extended to the nearby US state of Minnesota, although we are not told directly if serogroup C was responsible for the Ramsey County resident's death.\n\nThe following was extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - France: (Paris) serogroup C, MSM, vaccination 20150124.3116307:\n\nOutbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) have occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium and France caused by a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C strain with a certain genotype (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf). Similar outbreaks among MSM caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C have occurred in Canada and the US (see prior ProMED-mail posts).\n\nMolecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of IMD are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U.

This is a rapidly growing outbreak with some unprecedented features.\n\nSuspected cases have been increasing very quickly, tripling over the last 2 weeks. This is the 1st large-scale meningitis outbreak caused by _Neisseria meningitides_ serogroup C to hit any country in Africa's meningitis belt.\n\nEleven districts from the regions of Niger, including the capital city, have crossed the epidemic threshold. This comprises all 5 districts in Niamey, where 4099 suspected cases, including 226 deaths, have been reported. The outbreak is of high concern because it affects a densely populated urban area of more one million people, creating a high risk of rapid spread and a large caseload.\n\nLaboratory tests have confirmed the predominance of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (Nm) serogroup C in the affected areas, with Nm serogroup W also being identified in several patient samples. Although serogroup C has been the predominant cause of meningitis in wealthy countries, it has never been of high concern in Africa. Over the past 40 years, serogroup C has caused only sporadic cases and a few localized outbreaks in Africa, generally of mixed serogroup A and C origin. These outbreaks occurred in Nigeria in 1975, in Niger in 1991, and in Nigeria in 2013-2014. [See prior ProMED-mail posts: Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria (02): serogroup C, MSF, 2013-2014, follow-up 20150325.3252914 and Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: serogroup C, WHO 20150317.3236196.]\n\nViewed against this historical pattern, the outbreak in Niger is an alarming development. Since this is the 1st large outbreak in Africa of meningitis caused by serogroup C, vaccines against this form of the disease are in short supply.\n\nA national epidemic committee has been activated to manage the outbreak. An international team, composed of staff from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was deployed to support the Ministry of Public Health's investigation of the outbreak and reinforce the country's surveillance capacity.\n\nWHO and partners are providing support to the government of Niger for the implementation of mass vaccination campaigns and other emergency control measures. Instrumental in this effort is the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control (ICG). ICG is a partnership uniting WHO, UNICEF, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF). It works closely with vaccine manufacturers. It was established in 1997 following exceptionally large and deadly meningitis outbreaks in Africa.\n\nTo date, ICG has approved 4 vaccination requests. Vaccines released include 460 000 doses of the older polysaccharide vaccine (produced by Instituto Finlay and Bio-Manguinhos), which protects against the A, C and W serogroups, and 200 000 doses of the newer conjugate vaccine (produced by Sanofi-Pasteur), which protects against serogroups A, C, W, and Y.\n\nThe conjugate vaccine, which is produced in small quantities for use in the US and European markets at prices that are unaffordable in Africa, was a result of the intervention of ICG and financial support from the GAVI Alliance. In addition, Niger's government has obtained 200 000 doses of polysaccharide ACWY vaccine from the government of Mali.\n\nSince multivalent conjugate vaccines were licensed in the US and Europe, the production of polysaccharide vaccines has dropped considerably and is now largely limited to use by international travellers. No further polysaccharide multivalent vaccines are available outside the stockpile maintained by ICG.\n\nIn response to this emergency situation, WHO, on behalf of ICG, has negotiated with public sector vaccine manufacturers and the pharmaceutical industry to start the urgent production of multivalent polysaccharide vaccines. An additional 640 000 doses will be dispatched to Niger in the coming weeks.\n\nVaccine campaigns targeting children aged 2 to 15 years are ongoing in 8 of the 11 epidemic districts, including Niamey. MSF is supporting the Ministry of Public Health with teams of doctors and case management facilities; 18 500 vials of ceftriaxone, a highly effective antibiotic, have been made available with ICG support. Thanks to these interventions, the case fatality rate from meningitis has dropped in the past few weeks from 11 to 6.8 percent. WHO and partners are supporting the Ministry of Health in outbreak surveillance, population sensitization and preventive measures.\n\nOutbreaks of meningitis pose an enormous burden to the populations of African countries. The area known as the African meningitis belt -- which stretches across the continent from Senegal to Ethiopia affecting 21 countries -- is hyper-endemic for this disease. Cases frequently recur, with periodic outbreaks during the dry season, which runs from December to June. Large-scale outbreaks in 1996-1997 caused more than 200 000 cases, including 20 000 deaths. The most recent large outbreak occurred in 2009, causing more than 80 000 cases, mainly in Nigeria and Niger. The vast majority of these outbreaks were caused by serogroup A.\n\nSince 2010, a new conjugate vaccine, MenAfriVac, which protects against serogroup A and costs less than USD 1.00 a dose, has been progressively introduced in preventive mass campaigns in countries of the African Belt. The new vaccine was developed especially for Africa by the Meningitis Vaccine Project, coordinated by WHO and PATH.\n\nSince introduction of the new vaccine, the number of meningitis A cases in Africa has decreased dramatically, with no outbreaks caused by this serotype occurring in vaccinated areas (see the Weekly Epidemiological Record published on 27 Mar 2015 among the Related Links).\n\nThe meningitis A conjugate vaccine is the only currently available and affordable vaccine that can be used to prevent meningitis outbreaks in Africa, as it confers long-lasting immunity. All other vaccines used in Africa for other serogroups are the older polysaccharide vaccines, which confer immunity lasting only 3 to 5 years. These vaccines are now used only in emergency response to outbreaks and are not suitable for the preferred objective of prevention.\n\nFollowing introduction of the meningitis A conjugate vaccine, the market for polysaccharide vaccines shrank considerably and is now largely limited to international travellers. The International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control, or ICG, which manages an emergency vaccine stockpile, has been instrumental in maintaining an adequate supply of these older polysaccharide vaccines for use in emergencies.\n\nTo prepare for the 2015 epidemic season, WHO and its partners in ICG sent an advance request to vaccine manufacturers for 1.5 million doses of multivalent polysaccharide vaccines and 1.5 million doses of the new meningitis A conjugate vaccine.\n\nDue to production problems with one manufacturer, this request could not be fully met. To fill the gap in the stockpile supply, WHO asked 2 public sector manufacturers, the Instituto Finlay in Cuba and Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil, and one pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, to supply 600 000 and 500 000 doses of polysaccharide vaccine, respectively.\n\nThis vaccine shortage highlights the importance of accelerating the development of a multivalent conjugate vaccine affordable for the people and governments of Africa. For now, WHO continues to work with ICG and other partners to ensure that the stockpile of polysaccharide vaccines is maintained at a level sufficiently high to manage future outbreaks in Africa's meningitis belt.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The epidemiology of meningococcal meningitis in the African meningitis belt is changing after preventive vaccination with conjugate meningitis A vaccine -- MenAfrivac (R) -- was introduced in 2010.

Cases were aged between 5 and 46 months, and were either a cousin or sibling of another case. All 8 cases survived. Chemoprophylaxis was given to relevant nuclear family members and close contacts on each occasion, but failed to prevent further cases. _Neisseria meningitidis_ isolates from 6 cases were highly related, belonging to the ST-41/44 clonal complex, and shared the porA designation 7-2,4.\n\nIn November 2013, the outbreak control team recommended that directly observed ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis be administered simultaneously to the extended family, and that the 4 component meningococcal B (4CMenB) vaccine be administered to family members aged 2 months to 23 years inclusive and relevant close contacts of the 8th case. Subsequently these recommendations were implemented at 3 regional clinics. Additionally pharyngeal swabs (n=112) were collected to assess carriage rates of _N. meningitidis_ in this extended family. Pharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ was detected in 15 (13 percent) family members. From the epidemiological investigation and carriage study overcrowding was the most likely risk factor identified in this outbreak. To date, the combination of directly observed ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis and use of 4CMenB vaccine have controlled the outbreak with no further cases diagnosed.\n\nIntroduction\n----\nInvasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a life-threatening infection caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_. Risk factors for IMD include close contact with a known case, crowded environments, recent upper respiratory tract infection or influenza, cigarette smoking and immunological susceptibility [1].\n\nUnder Irish law, clinicians and clinical directors of laboratories must immediately notify suspected cases of IMD to the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) at the local Department of Public Health. Laboratories must also immediately notify IMD cases [that] meet the laboratory criteria for confirmed or probable disease in accordance with the case definition [2].\n\nAll notified cases of IMD are entered on to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) database, which is hosted by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), Ireland's specialist agency for the surveillance of communicable diseases. CIDR is a shared national information system, developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland [3].\n\nIn 2011, Ireland had the highest incidence of meningococcal disease in the European Union at 1.99 per 100 000 population [4]. However, this figure represents a decrease of 86 percent from 14.8 per 100 000 population reported in 1999. Irish Travellers are an indigenous minority in Ireland. Their lifestyle and culture, which may include a nomadic lifestyle, distinguishes them from the general population [5]. Irish Travellers experience social and cultural marginalisation in a similar manner to other indigenous minorities globally [6].\n\nIn Ireland, ethnic identification is not routinely collected on all individuals with notifiable infectious diseases. Consequently, assessing national rates of disease by ethnicity is not possible. However since 2004, when the CIDR system became operational, limited data on ethnicity is available. Based on such data, it is evident that while the incidence of IMD has decreased in the general population, a similar reduction has not been seen in the Irish Traveller population. In contrast, since 2004 there has been an increase in reported cases of IMD in this population group [7].\n\nIn 2013, 84 percent of meningococcal disease in Ireland was caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B [8]. While most cases of IMD occur sporadically, occasionally an unusual cluster or outbreak is reported. The National Guidelines on the Clinical and Public Health Management of Bacterial Meningitis defines an outbreak of meningococcal disease as 'a minimum of 4 cases of definite meningococcal disease within a 3-month interval, or 40 per 100 000 in any age group in a 3-month period, in a geographical area that makes epidemiological sense AND where available microbiological characterisation of the organism is the same' [9].\n\nWe describe the identification of 8 cases of IMD due to _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B in an extended Irish Traveller family over a 3.5-year period across 3 of 8 public health areas of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in Ireland. All 8 cases occurred in young children (\u226446 months) who were siblings or first cousins of identified cases in the outbreak. The measures to prevent further cases are described. Although the cluster formed by the 8 cases does not fulfil the criteria for the above outbreak definition, the term 'outbreak' is used in this report to reflect the high endemicity within this extended family.\n\nDiscussion\n-----\nThis report describes an outbreak of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B in an extended Irish Traveller family over 3.5-year period. While outbreaks of IMD are more commonly associated with serogroup C disease [5,21], prolonged community based and institutional outbreaks of serogroup B disease have been described [22,23]. Control measures in these outbreaks differed. In a prolonged serogroup B outbreak in northern France (2003-2005), an unlicensed monovalent outer membrane vesicle vaccine from Norway was thought to be [effective] and was administered initially to high-risk groups and subsequently to all the population [22]. In contrast, in a prolonged university outbreak in the United States (2008-2010), health promotion and ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis were the control measures used. Vaccination was not used as a control measure because a serogroup B vaccine was not licenced in the United States at that time [23]. Family clusters have also been described in the literature but their time duration is considerably shorter than our outbreak [24].\n\nTransmission of _N. meningitidis_ occurs through droplet spread of respiratory secretions or saliva [25]. On average 10 to 15 percent of the population are colonised with _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the duration of carriage can vary from days to months [26,27]. When cases continue to occur, despite appropriate management of contacts, possible reasons for ongoing transmission of _N. meningitidis_ include; immunological susceptibility, poor compliance with chemoprophylaxis, resistance to chemoprophylaxis, unidentified close contacts and overcrowding. We considered each of these as a possible cause of this outbreak continuing.\n\nThe association between immunological factors, host genetics and IMD is well recognised [28,29]. However, in this outbreak the 4 cases who underwent comprehensive immunological tests had normal immunological results; therefore immunological susceptibility was not thought a likely cause of increased incidence or ongoing transmission.\n\nCompliance of contacts with the recommended 4-dose schedule of rifampicin chemoprophylaxis could not be independently verified. Consequently, in order to ensure compliance, directly observed treatment with ciprofloxacin was provided at the clinics. Antimicrobial susceptibility results from the EMBU confirmed that the predominant outbreak strain was sensitive to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, rifampicin, and sulfadiazine. These results are in line with previous findings that IMD-associated strains of _N. meningitidis_ [that] exhibit decreased susceptibility to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, rifampicin and sulfadiazine are currently very rare in Ireland (data not shown).\n\nThere were on average 18 close contacts identified per case. This number is high when compared with an average of 7.6 contacts per case reported from a 2012 series of 38 IMD events in 4 regions in Ireland (data not shown). As this is a larger number of contacts than usually identified, it remains possible that not all close contacts were identified. Despite multiple interviews with the family to ensure identification of as many true close contacts as possible, it was recognised that recolonisation from a wider network remained a possibility.\n\nA carriage rate of _N. meningitidis_ of 13 percent was identified. This rate may have been affected by the large number of family members who had received chemoprophylaxis previously (n\u2009=\u200968), especially those who received it in the preceding month, n\u2009=\u200918. In the general population highest carriage rates of _N. meningitidis_ are seen in the 15 to 24 years-old age group [27]. The 2011 Irish census identified 22.4 years as the average age of an Irish Traveller compared with 36.1 years for the general Irish population [30]. In this outbreak-associated cohort, 83 (74 percent) of the participants in the carriage study were less than 25 years of age and 22 (20 percent) were aged between 15 and 24. It is conceivable that cases in this outbreak had many opportunities to mix with young adult relatives. However, results from the carriage study reveal that only 3 (14 percent) of the 22 participants aged between 15 and 24 years demonstrated _N. meningitidis_ carriage, compared with 9 (45%) of the 20 participants aged between 25 and 40 years. The higher rate of carriage in the older age group is higher than expected when compared with previously undertaken carriage studies, which revealed carriage rates of 8.8 percent in individuals aged 25 and older (data not shown).\n\nTraditionally Irish Traveller family size is larger than that of the general population of Ireland. In 2011, 26.9 percent of Traveller women reported to have 5 or more children compared with 2.6 percent of the general population [30]. Irish Travellers often live in houses or caravans in crowded conditions [30]. Household crowding and attendance at crowded venues such as clubs and parties are recognised as risk factors for carriage of _N. meningitidis_ and IMD [31,32]. Irish Travellers also frequently attend large family gatherings where there are large groups of people in close proximity for a prolonged period of time. This is supported by the large number of close contacts identified in the outbreak cases. From the carriage study 2/3 (n\u2009=\u200910, 67 percent) of the identified _N. meningitidis_ carriers lived in a trailer or caravan. Census information documents from 2011 identify that 12.3 percent of Irish Travellers live in trailers or caravans overall [30]. Therefore a larger proportion than expected of _N. meningitidis_ carriers lived in a trailer or caravan, which is likely to consist of 1 or 2 rooms in total. As the carriage study also identified that 2/3 (n\u2009=\u200910, 67 percent) of positive carriers live in households of 8 or more, in contrast to 8.32 percent of the total Irish Traveller population [30], an element of household crowding is likely to be present.\n\nAdditional previously reported factors associated with carriage of _N. meningitidis_ include personal and passive cigarette smoking and recent or concomitant respiratory tract infections or influenza [32-34]. Cigarette smoking rates are higher among Irish Travellers than in the general population (52.5 percent vs 29 percent) [6,35] and therefore it is possible that cigarette smoking could be associated with this outbreak. However, as information on cigarette smoking is not currently collected on enhanced surveillance for IMD, the rate of cigarette smoking for the outbreak family could not be confirmed. Neither information on cigarette smoking nor exposure to cigarette smoking was requested during the carriage study undertaken in December 2013.\n\nPreviously it has been difficult to control serogroup B IMD due to the absence of a vaccine. This has changed recently with the approval in 2014 by the Food and Drug Administration of a vaccine for the United States (Trumenba from Pfizer) [36]. Earlier, in January 2013, a 4-component Men B vaccine, referred to here as 4CMenB (Bexsero from Novartis), was licensed by the European Medicines Agency for use against serogroup B disease [37]. 4CMenB vaccine contains 3 antigens, factor H binding protein, neisserial adhesion A and _Neisseria_ heparin binding agent. In addition, the vaccine contains PorA (serosubtype P1.4) from the outer membrane vesicle of the New Zealand strain 98/254. These antigens affect meningococcal survival, function and virulence [38]. As the outbreak strain was identified as B:4:P1.7-2,4:ST-6697 (cc41/44), we were confident that the use of the vaccine would be beneficial to this outbreak.\n\nThe Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (MATS) is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) designed to evaluate expression of 4CMenB target proteins and to evaluate their cross-reactive potential. Strains are predicted to be covered by 4CMenB if they carry the porA p1.4 epitope or meet a minimum threshold of reactivity to _Neisseria_ heparin-binding antigen (NHBA), factor H binding protein (fHbp) or _Neisseria_ adhesin A (nadA) in the MATS ELISA, known as the positive bactericidal threshold (PBT) [39]. The case B isolate (which was identified as the outbreak strain) has undergone MATS testing and results predict this strain is covered by any of porA (p1.4), NHBA or fHbp peptides it carries.\n\nThe decision by 2 of the affected HSE regions to delay administration of the vaccine until January 2014 was not thought to have impacted on control measures. The affected family members received ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis and therefore short-term eradication of _N. meningitidis_ was likely. The duration of eradication of _N. meningitidis_ after receipt of chemoprophylaxis can vary from weeks to months [40]. Subsequently, the administration of 4CMenB in January [2014] was thought likely to provide longer-term immunity.\n\nTo our knowledge, this outbreak was the 1st time 4CMenB vaccine was used in an outbreak situation in Europe. In December 2013, this vaccine was used in an outbreak of serogroup B disease at Princeton University in the United States, when in excess of 5000 students and staff received this vaccine [41]. More recently in March 2014, the University of California, Santa Barbara vaccinated ca 9000 students and staff in response to 4 confirmed cases of serogroup B disease in the university [41].\n\nConclusion\n-----\nThis is a unique outbreak of IMD caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B in an extended Irish Traveller family across 3 regions of Ireland over a period of 3.5 years. This outbreak continued despite instigating all appropriate control measures on multiple occasions. From descriptive epidemiological data and the carriage study, the most likely risk factor identified for this ongoing outbreak was overcrowding. We hope that the combined use of directly observed ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis, in addition to vaccination with 4CMenB will be successful in halting this outbreak. We continue to monitor this family for new cases and strive to ensure that all relevant family members complete the recommended vaccine schedule. To date there have been no further cases of IMD in this family.\n\nThis outbreak highlights the importance of recording ethnicity as part of the enhanced surveillance information collected on all cases of meningococcal disease. We recommend the gathering of ethnicity data for key notifiable diseases including IMD. We also recommend that consideration be given to the use of 4CMenB vaccine for vulnerable groups living in similar crowded conditions.\n\n[For the Methods and Results sections, Tables, Figure, and References, please see the source URL.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Irish Travellers, also called gypsies, with a population of over 22 000, are a traditionally itinerant ethnic group who live mostly in Ireland, as well as having large numbers in the UK and in the United States (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Travellers).\n\nFor additional discussion of meningococcal disease and its epidemiology, see moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail posts on this subject. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39.]", "summary": "In November 2013, the outbreak control team recommended that directly observed ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis be administered simultaneously to the extended family, and that the 4 component meningococcal B (4CMenB) vaccine be administered to family members aged 2 months to 23 years inclusive and relevant close contacts of the 8th case. The National Guidelines on the Clinical and Public Health Management of Bacterial Meningitis defines an outbreak of meningococcal disease as 'a minimum of 4 cases of definite meningococcal disease within a 3-month interval, or 40 per 100 000 in any age group in a 3-month period, in a geographical area that makes epidemiological sense AND where available microbiological characterisation of the organism is the same' [9]. \n\n\nA prolonged outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease in an extended Irish Traveller family across three Health Service Executive (HSE) areas in Ireland, 2010 to 2013\n\nO'Connor L, Ward M, Bennett D, Mulhall R, O'Lorcain P, Cunney R, McDermott R, Neville E, Heslin J, FitzGerald R, Meyler K, Conlon M, Clarke A, Corcoran B, Fitzpatrick G, O'Connor B, Flanagan P, O'Flanagan D, Cotter S.\n\nSummary\n \n\nWe describe the identification of 8 cases of IMD due to _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B in an extended Irish Traveller family over a 3.5-year period across 3 of 8 public health areas of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in Ireland. However, results from the carriage study reveal that only 3 (14 percent) of the 22 participants aged between 15 and 24 years demonstrated _N. meningitidis_ carriage, compared with 9 (45%) of the 20 participants aged between 25 and 40 years. As the carriage study also identified that 2/3 (n\u2009=\u200910, 67 percent) of positive carriers live in households of 8 or more, in contrast to 8.32 percent of the total Irish Traveller population [30], an element of household crowding is likely to be present. Chemoprophylaxis was given to relevant nuclear family members and close contacts on each occasion, but failed to prevent further cases. _Neisseria meningitidis_ isolates from 6 cases were highly related, belonging to the ST-41/44 clonal complex, and shared the porA designation 7-2,4. Between March 2010 and November 2013, 8 laboratory-confirmed cases of serogroup B, invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) were identified in an extended Irish Traveller family across 3 Health Service Executive (HSE) areas of Ireland. Although the cluster formed by the 8 cases does not fulfil the criteria for the above outbreak definition, the term 'outbreak' is used in this report to reflect the high endemicity within this extended family. In this outbreak-associated cohort, 83 (74 percent) of the participants in the carriage study were less than 25 years of age and 22 (20 percent) were aged between 15 and 24. When cases continue to occur, despite appropriate management of contacts, possible reasons for ongoing transmission of _N. meningitidis_ include; immunological susceptibility, poor compliance with chemoprophylaxis, resistance to chemoprophylaxis, unidentified close contacts and overcrowding. The higher rate of carriage in the older age group is higher than expected when compared with previously undertaken carriage studies, which revealed carriage rates of 8.8 percent in individuals aged 25 and older (data not shown). \n\nThis outbreak highlights the importance of recording ethnicity as part of the enhanced surveillance information collected on all cases of meningococcal disease.

However, in this outbreak the 4 cases who underwent comprehensive immunological tests had normal immunological results; therefore immunological susceptibility was not thought a likely cause of increased incidence or ongoing transmission. In a prolonged serogroup B outbreak in northern France (2003-2005), an unlicensed monovalent outer membrane vesicle vaccine from Norway was thought to be [effective] and was administered initially to high-risk groups and subsequently to all the population [22]. All 8 cases occurred in young children (\u226446 months) who were siblings or first cousins of identified cases in the outbreak. In December 2013, this vaccine was used in an outbreak of serogroup B disease at Princeton University in the United States, when in excess of 5000 students and staff received this vaccine [41]. From the carriage study 2/3 (n\u2009=\u200910, 67 percent) of the identified _N. meningitidis_ carriers lived in a trailer or caravan. This rate may have been affected by the large number of family members who had received chemoprophylaxis previously (n\u2009=\u200968), especially those who received it in the preceding month, n\u2009=\u200918. As the outbreak strain was identified as B:4:P1.7-2,4:ST-6697 (cc41/44), we were confident that the use of the vaccine would be beneficial to this outbreak. To date, the combination of directly observed ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis and use of 4CMenB vaccine have controlled the outbreak with no further cases diagnosed. However, as information on cigarette smoking is not currently collected on enhanced surveillance for IMD, the rate of cigarette smoking for the outbreak family could not be confirmed. This report describes an outbreak of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B in an extended Irish Traveller family over 3.5-year period. \n\nA carriage rate of _N. meningitidis_ of 13 percent was identified. On average 10 to 15 percent of the population are colonised with _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the duration of carriage can vary from days to months [26,27]. From descriptive epidemiological data and the carriage study, the most likely risk factor identified for this ongoing outbreak was overcrowding. We continue to monitor this family for new cases and strive to ensure that all relevant family members complete the recommended vaccine schedule. This is supported by the large number of close contacts identified in the outbreak cases. In the general population highest carriage rates of _N. meningitidis_ are seen in the 15 to 24 years-old age group [27]. In 2013, 84 percent of meningococcal disease in Ireland was caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B [8]. From the epidemiological investigation and carriage study overcrowding was the most likely risk factor identified in this outbreak. \n\nAll notified cases of IMD are entered on to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) database, which is hosted by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), Ireland's specialist agency for the surveillance of communicable diseases. Pharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ was detected in 15 (13 percent) family members. The affected family members received ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis and therefore short-term eradication of _N. meningitidis_ was likely. More recently in March 2014, the University of California, Santa Barbara vaccinated ca 9000 students and staff in response to 4 confirmed cases of serogroup B disease in the university [41]. In 2011, 26.9 percent of Traveller women reported to have 5 or more children compared with 2.6 percent of the general population [30]. While outbreaks of IMD are more commonly associated with serogroup C disease [5,21], prolonged community based and institutional outbreaks of serogroup B disease have been described [22,23].

However, we are not told the microbial causes. Omdurman, with a population of 2 395 159 (2008), is the largest city in Khartoum State and in Sudan, on the western banks of the River Nile, opposite the capital city, Khartoum (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omdurman).\n\nSudan is just north of the African meningitis belt that stretches from Senegal in West Africa to the Horn of Africa in the east. The African meningitis belt is plagued by epidemics of bacterial meningitis during the dry season (December to April) and end at the onset of the rainy season (May to June). Large epidemics usually take place in irregular cycles every 5-12 years. During epidemics, the rate can be as high as 1000 cases per 100 000 population (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/meningococcal-disease). Serogroup A meningococcus is the main cause of meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt and accounts for an estimated 80-85 percent of all cases. A map showing the countries in the African meningitis belt can be seen at http://www.cdc.gov/travel-static/yellowbook/2014/map_3-11.pdf.\n\nA massive vaccination program against meningococcal serogroup A meningitis that targeted 16.9 million children and young adults aged 1-29 years was launched in Sudan, including Khartoum in 2012 (http://www.emro.who.int/sdn/sudan-news/meningitisa-2012sudan.html). The vaccine used was likely the conjugated serogroup A 'MenAfriVac' vaccine that is used in the WHO mass meningococcal vaccination program of all 1-29 year-olds in the African meningitis belt. This program was initiated in 2010 (http://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/events/menafrivac_faqs/en/index2.html). Burkina Faso became the 1st African country to introduce MenAfriVac nationwide and immunized more than 11 million people from 6-15 Dec 2010 (http://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/global.html). As of January 2015, over 217 million persons in 15 of the 26 countries of the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa have received meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/).\n\nBecause immunity following use of a meningococcal vaccine is serogroup-specific, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups, MenAfriVac will protect only against disease caused by the serogroup A meningococcus. Its use in the African meningitis belt has been associated with subsequent outbreaks in which serogroup A has been replaced by other meningococcal serogroups, such as C and W135. (See ProMED-mail posts Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger (03): serogroup C, fatal, WHO, update Archive Number: 20150517.3368315 and Meningitis, meningococcal - France ex African Meningitis Belt Archive Number: 20120526.1145958.)\n\nA large epidemic (February-August 1988) of serogroup A meningococcal meningitis occurred in Khartoum, with a total of 10 099 cases, corresponding to an annual incidence of 1679 per 100 000, but was thought to be related to the Mecca meningitis outbreak in August 1987 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2356440). The 1st reported international outbreak following the Hajj in 1987 was caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2569063).\n\nThe microbial causes of bacterial meningitis have also been studied during non-epidemic years in Khartoum. During the period April 1985 to November 1986 (18 months), 44 children were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis in Khartoum, 25 of whom had meningitis due to _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b; 8, _Neisseria meningitidis_; 7, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_; 3, Enterobacteriaceae; and 1, mixed infection (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699486).\n\nIdentifying the specific microbial causes of the current meningitis outbreak in Khartoum is important, because the prior serogroup A meningococcal vaccination program in Khartoum in 2012 may have resulted in replacement of serogroup A with other meningococcal serogroups or the current outbreak may actually be due to non-meningococcal bacterial species or even non-bacterial etiologies.

Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) has been responding to outbreaks of meningitis in northwest Nigeria since 2007 with no reported cases of serogroup C from 2007-2012. MenAfrivac (R), a serogroup A conjugate vaccine, was first used for mass vaccination in northwest Nigeria in late 2012. Reactive vaccination using polysaccharide ACYW135 vaccine was done by MSF in parts of the region in 2008 and 2009; no other vaccination campaigns are known to have occurred in the area during this period. We describe the general characteristics of an outbreak due to a novel strain of NmC in Sokoto State, Nigeria, in 2013, and a smaller outbreak in 2014 in the adjacent state, Kebbi.\n\nMethods: Information on cases and deaths was collected using a standard line-list during each week of each meningitis outbreak in 2013 and 2014 in northwest Nigeria. Initial serogroup confirmation was by rapid Pastorex agglutination tests. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from suspected meningitis patients were sent to the WHO Reference Laboratory in Oslo, where bacterial isolates, serogrouping, antimicrobial sensitivity testing, genotype characterisation and real-time PCR analysis were performed.\n\nResults: In the most highly affected outbreak areas, all of the 856 and 333 clinically suspected meningitis cases were treated in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Overall attack (AR) and case fatality (CFR) rates were 673/100 000 population and 6.8 percent in 2013, and 165/100 000 and 10.5 percent in 2014. Both outbreaks affected small geographical areas of less than 150 sq km [58 sq mi] and populations of less than 210 000, and occurred in neighbouring regions in 2 adjacent states in the successive years. Initial rapid testing identified NmC as the causative agent. Of the 21 and 17 CSF samples analysed in Oslo, NmC alone was confirmed in 11 and 10 samples in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Samples confirmed as NmC through bacterial culture had sequence type (ST)-10217.\n\nConclusions: These are the 1st recorded outbreaks of NmC in the region since 1979, and the sequence (ST)-10217 has not been identified anywhere else in the world. The outbreaks had similar characteristics to previously recorded NmC outbreaks. Outbreaks of NmC in 2 consecutive years in northern Nigeria indicate a possible emergence of this serogroup. Increased surveillance for multiple serogroups in the region is needed, along with consideration of vaccination with conjugate vaccines rather than for NmA alone.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nJane Greig\nMedecins sans Frontieres (MSF)\n<jane.greig@london.msf.org>\n\n[The article above published in PLOS describes in greater detail the outbreaks in Nigeria previously reported in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: serogroup C, WHO 20150317.3236196. The full article with tables, figures, and references can be obtained at the source URL above. The authors recommend the following:\n\n'NmC outbreaks have emerged in northwest Nigeria in the past 2 years, and there is some evidence of serogroup replacement in the meningitis belt following recent mass vaccination with NmA conjugate vaccine. Meningitis case surveillance systems, for both serogroup and strain, should continue to be strengthened in this region to allow for early identification and proper control (such as vaccination for the appropriate serogroup) of outbreaks. If NmC outbreaks become more widespread in northern Nigeria or adjacent regions in the coming years, large-scale preventative action may be required; a key measure is to ensure availability of ACYW135 polysaccharide vaccine for reactive vaccination.'\n\nWHO promotes a strategy of epidemic prevention and response in the African meningitis belt. Prevention has consisted of vaccinating all 1-29 year-olds in the African meningitis belt with the MenA conjugate vaccine. As of January 2015, over 217 million persons in 15 of the 26 countries of the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa have received meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). WHO epidemic response consists of 'prompt and appropriate case management with ceftriaxone and reactive mass vaccination of populations not already protected through vaccination.'\n\nThe presence of circulating bactericidal antibody at the time of exposure appears to be critical for protection against meningococcal disease. The antibody response to the polysaccharide antigen present in a vaccine is serogroup specific and affords no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. In view of replacement of meningococcal serogroup A with other serogroups following mass vaccination of the population with serogroup A conjugate vaccine, reactive mass vaccination to control an outbreak would require use of a meningococcal vaccine containing the serogroup causing the particular outbreak.\n\nSeveral vaccines are available to control the disease during an outbreak: a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine, C conjugate vaccines, tetravalent A, C, Y, and W conjugate vaccines and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines. Unlike polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and therefore longer-term protection, than the polysaccharide vaccines.\n\nThe 2 quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines that provide protection against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY-D [Menactra, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur] and MenACWY-CRM [Menveo, manufactured by Novartis Vaccines]) are licensed in the United States as a single dose for use among persons aged 2 through 55 years. Menactra is also licensed as a 2-dose series for infants and toddlers aged 9 through 23 months.

This policy was extended beyond the Paris region as a reaction to the continuing spread of serogroup C isolates belonging to a new lineage within clonal complex cc11 since the recommendation was 1st issued in July 2013.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nIn this report, we describe, based on combined epidemiological surveillance data and genetic typing of serogroup C meningococcal isolates, the spread of a specific invasive strain of meningococcus C (MenC) in the Paris region that had started as an outbreak among men who have sex with men (MSM) in June 2013.\n\nThe alert in June 2013\n----------------------\nIn the 1st half of 2013, 14 serogroup C IMD [invasive meningococcal disease] cases were reported in France in 25 to 59 year-old men, while 6 cases were reported in women. Of the adult male cases, 6 affected residents of the Paris region and 3 occurred within one week in early June in MSM. The variable regions 1 and 2 of PorA, the variable region of FetA and the clonal complex (cc) of the 3 isolates were characterised. These isolates showed the genotype C:P1.5-1,10-8:F:3-6:cc11 and belonged to the electrophoretic type (ET) 15 of the cc11 (cc11 harbours several lineages). Between October 2012 and May 2013, 5 serogroup C IMD cases in MSM were also reported in Germany [1], caused by isolates sharing the same characteristics as the ones in France. Further genetic analysis showed that the German and the French isolates shared additional markers that also differed from other lineages of the cc11 isolates (data not shown). These findings raised the question of the emergence of a new clone of serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ in the European MSM community [2]. Considering that serogroup C outbreaks occurred also among MSM in Canada in 2001 and in the United States in 2003 (Chicago [Illinois]) and in 2011-13 (New York City), a rapid risk assessment was prepared by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in July 2013 [3,4].\n\nWe established a national enhanced surveillance and prompted the regional public health officers to assess a possible link to the MSM community for all cases infected by C:P1.5-1,10-8:F:3-6:cc11 isolates.\n\nSerogroup C invasive meningococcal disease cases in the Paris region from July 2013 to December 2014\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSince July 2013, 34 cases of serogroup C IMD have been notified in the Paris region and 2 other cases have been diagnosed in other countries but were very likely to be linked to a source of exposure in the Paris region. Among these 36 cases, 17 were 25 to 59 years old and 5 were aged 60 years and older. The case fatality rate was 17 percent (6/36). The male/female ratio was 1.6 (22/14) (Table 1). None of the cases had been vaccinated against MenC disease.\n\nTABLE 1. Incidence and case fatality rates of serogroup C invasive meningococcal disease cases by age and sex, 1 Jul 2013 to 31 Dec 2014, Paris region, France (n=36)\n\nIsolates from 29 of the 36 cases were subjected to a complete molecular analysis and 14 were related to the genotype C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:cc11. Among those 14, 9 isolates showed the above-mentioned additional specific markers (Figure 1). They corresponded to 7 men (1 aged 15-24 years and 6 aged 25-59 years) and 2 women (one aged 25-59 years and 1 in the age group 60 years and older). 1 additional male case (15-24 years old) was epidemiologically linked to one of them (family cluster). These 10 cases were directly or indirectly linked to the MSM community (4 cases aged 25-59 years who self-identified as MSM and 6 who did not identify as MSM but attended social venues associated with the gay community in the Paris region).\n\nFIGURE 1. Cases of serogroup C invasive meningococcal disease by month of hospitalisation and genotypic combination, Paris region, France, 1 Jul 2013 to 31 Dec 2014 (n\u2009=\u200936)\n\nIncidence rates and risk evaluation\n-----------------------------------\nWhen considering all reported serogroup C IMD cases for all age groups and both women and men, no excess of cases was observed in the Paris region compared with the general population of France since July 2013. In contrast, we observed a gradual increase in the incidence of serogroup C IMD in the Paris region since 2013, a trend that was less marked elsewhere in France (Figure 2).\n\nFIGURE 2. Incidence rates of serogroup C invasive meningococcal disease cases France, 2010-14 (n=409)\n\nMoreover, IMD caused by C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:cc11 isolates have increased since 2011 particularly in the Paris region where it represented about half (11/22) of the notified meningococcus C IMD cases in 2014 (vs 12 percent elsewhere in France, p less than 10-3). During the period from 2011 to 2014, the mean annual reporting rate for these isolates was estimated at 0.05 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in the Paris region (vs 0.02 elsewhere in France, p less than 10-3).\n\nIn order to estimate the incidence among MSM in the Paris region, we used as the denominator the estimated figures from the 2006 national survey on sexual behaviour [5]. About 175 000 men living in the Paris region and aged 25 to 59 years reported sexual encounters with men at least once during their life.\n\nTaking into account the 4 cases notified in MSM since July 2013, the incidence of serogroup C IMD among 25 to 59 year-old MSM (individuals older than 25 years are not targeted by the national vaccination programme) in the Paris region was 2.28 per 100 000 person-years. The observed number of cases was 10 times greater than the expected number among men in this age group, if the incidence rate of C IMD cases was the same in Paris region than in all regions in France. No excess risk was demonstrated among men living in the Paris region who did not identify as MSM (Table 2).\n\nTABLE 2. Risk analysis of excess cases of serogroup C invasive meningococcal disease in 25-59 year-old MSM and men not identifying as MSM, Paris region, 1 Jul 2013 to 31 Dec 2014 (n=11)\n\nPublic health response and discussion\n-------------------------------------\nSurveillance of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in France relies on the mandatory reporting of cases to the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS) and the characterisation of invasive strains at the National Reference Centre (NRC) for Meningococci. Combined epidemiological surveillance and genetic typing of meningococcal isolates highlighted an increase of invasive meningococcal disease among MSM. These data suggested that the excess of serogroup C IMD cases among MSM living in the Paris region was linked to the circulation since mid-2013 of C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:cc11 isolates with additional specific markers, not only in MSM but also among individuals (women, as well as those men who do not identify as MSM) who attend social venues associated with the gay community. Following the 1st outbreak reported in June 2013, the French Council of Public Health (HCSP) issued a recommendation for a 3-month period of vaccination, with a meningococcal conjugate C vaccine offered to all MSM aged 25 years and older, living in the Paris region and attending social venues associated with the gay community. This recommendation also included all individuals attending gay festivals during summer 2013 in France [6]. Several health promotion activities were carried out during that summer by associations well-known in the gay community in France, but no vaccination campaign was officially performed. No data are available on the vaccine coverage reached in the targeted population.\n\nMoreover, data from national surveillance highlighted that 2 family clusters of 2 cases each were also reported outside the Paris region in 2014, indicating that such isolates may spread all over the country and not only in the Paris region. Because of the high serogroup C IMD incidence due to the C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:cc11 isolates and the persistence of cases linked to the MSM community, the recommendation was renewed in November 2014 for one year and extended beyond the Paris region to the whole country, targeting MSM and all individuals aged 25 years and older attending social venues associated with the gay community [7]. Vaccination against serogroup C meningococci had been recommended in France since 2010 at the age of 12 months, with a catch-up in children and young adults (13 months to 24 years old). However, the incidence of serogroup C IMD gradually increased between 2010 and 2013, mostly in infants younger than one year and in adults [8]. This increase suggested a lack of vaccine-induced herd immunity to reduce circulation of serogroup C meningococci, caused by low vaccine uptake (56 percent at the age of 2 years and 17 percent among the 15 to 19 year-olds in 2013).\n\nVaccine policy for targeting 1 to 24 year-olds should be strengthened more efficiently in France. In addition, enhanced microbiological and epidemiological surveillance should be currently maintained for the isolates responsible of continuous spread of invasive MenC among MSM and adults older than 25 years attending social venues associated with the gay community.\n\n[Tables, figures and references are available at the source URL.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions, mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 percent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc., facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) carries a high mortality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.\n\nOutbreaks of IMD have recently occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium and France caused by a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C strain with a certain genotype (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf). Similar outbreaks among MSM caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C have occurred in Canada and the US (see prior ProMED-mail posts).\n\nMolecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of IMD are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/). We are not told of the HIV status of the cases of IMD among MSM in France.\n\nHowever, less virulent strains have been reported to cause IMD in immunocompromised HIV-infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis. 2011; 15(2): 178-80, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).\n\nSeverely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing bacterial meningitis (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial meningitis in HIV-1-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285).\n\nMass vaccination campaigns have been used to control outbreaks of IMD in MSM ('See Also' below). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccines to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC. Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

They corresponded to 7 men (1 aged 15-24 years and 6 aged 25-59 years) and 2 women (one aged 25-59 years and 1 in the age group 60 years and older). These data suggested that the excess of serogroup C IMD cases among MSM living in the Paris region was linked to the circulation since mid-2013 of C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:cc11 isolates with additional specific markers, not only in MSM but also among individuals (women, as well as those men who do not identify as MSM) who attend social venues associated with the gay community. Taking into account the 4 cases notified in MSM since July 2013, the incidence of serogroup C IMD among 25 to 59 year-old MSM (individuals older than 25 years are not targeted by the national vaccination programme) in the Paris region was 2.28 per 100 000 person-years.

These 10 cases were directly or indirectly linked to the MSM community (4 cases aged 25-59 years who self-identified as MSM and 6 who did not identify as MSM but attended social venues associated with the gay community in the Paris region). \n\nSerogroup C invasive meningococcal disease cases in the Paris region from July 2013 to December 2014\n Following the 1st outbreak reported in June 2013, the French Council of Public Health (HCSP) issued a recommendation for a 3-month period of vaccination, with a meningococcal conjugate C vaccine offered to all MSM aged 25 years and older, living in the Paris region and attending social venues associated with the gay community. In November 2014, French public health authorities renewed the recommendation to target for vaccination against invasive meningococcal disease men who have sex with men (MSM) and all individuals 25 years or older attending social venues associated with the gay community. In this report, we describe, based on combined epidemiological surveillance data and genetic typing of serogroup C meningococcal isolates, the spread of a specific invasive strain of meningococcus C (MenC) in the Paris region that had started as an outbreak among men who have sex with men (MSM) in June 2013. \n\nMoreover, data from national surveillance highlighted that 2 family clusters of 2 cases each were also reported outside the Paris region in 2014, indicating that such isolates may spread all over the country and not only in the Paris region. Since July 2013, 34 cases of serogroup C IMD have been notified in the Paris region and 2 other cases have been diagnosed in other countries but were very likely to be linked to a source of exposure in the Paris region. When considering all reported serogroup C IMD cases for all age groups and both women and men, no excess of cases was observed in the Paris region compared with the general population of France since July 2013. -------------------------------------\nSurveillance of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in France relies on the mandatory reporting of cases to the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS) and the characterisation of invasive strains at the National Reference Centre (NRC) for Meningococci. \n\nWe established a national enhanced surveillance and prompted the regional public health officers to assess a possible link to the MSM community for all cases infected by C:P1.5-1,10-8:F:3-6:cc11 isolates. MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - FRANCE: (PARIS) SEROGROUP C, MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN, VACCINATION\n***********************************************************************************************\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n The observed number of cases was 10 times greater than the expected number among men in this age group, if the incidence rate of C IMD cases was the same in Paris region than in all regions in France. This increase suggested a lack of vaccine-induced herd immunity to reduce circulation of serogroup C meningococci, caused by low vaccine uptake (56 percent at the age of 2 years and 17 percent among the 15 to 19 year-olds in 2013). In addition, enhanced microbiological and epidemiological surveillance should be currently maintained for the isolates responsible of continuous spread of invasive MenC among MSM and adults older than 25 years attending social venues associated with the gay community. This policy was extended beyond the Paris region as a reaction to the continuing spread of serogroup C isolates belonging to a new lineage within clonal complex cc11 since the recommendation was 1st issued in July 2013. About 175 000 men living in the Paris region and aged 25 to 59 years reported sexual encounters with men at least once during their life. During the period from 2011 to 2014, the mean annual reporting rate for these isolates was estimated at 0.05 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in the Paris region (vs 0.02 elsewhere in France, p less than 10-3).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2015-01-22 00:00:00", "2014-11-26 00:00:00", "2003-03-26 00:00:00", "2013-06-26 00:00:00", "2010-03-26 00:00:00", "2013-07-26 00:00:00", "2009-03-26 00:00:00", "1997-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2013-05-26 00:00:00", "2001-03-26 00:00:00", "2014-03-26 00:00:00", "2013-03-26 00:00:00", "2014-12-26 00:00:00", "2006-03-26 00:00:00", "2011-03-26 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Chicago", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "isolate", "country": "Mexico"}, {"location": "France", "country": "France"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "HCSP", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Belgium", "country": "Belgium"}, {"location": "Paris", "country": "France"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "Germany"}, {"location": "Parent", "country": "Canada"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3236196", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: serogroup C, WHO", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3236196", "date": "2015-03-17 23:30:29", "main_text": "MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - NIGERIA: SEROGROUP C, WHO\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 13 Mar 2015\nSource: WHO Global Alert and Response (GAR), Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]\nhttp://www.who.int/csr/don/13-march-2015-nigeria/en/\n\n\nBetween 26 Jan and 5 Mar 2015, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) of the Federal Ministry of Health of Nigeria notified WHO of 652 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 50 deaths. Cases have been reported in 10 local government areas of 2 states, Kebbi and Sokoto. Laboratory tests have confirmed the predominance of _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C in the affected areas, with no other serogroups being identified. In Zamfara state, there has been a recent emergence of suspected cases of meningococcal disease; however, an outbreak has not yet been confirmed.\n\nA national task force was activated to manage the outbreak. WHO and partners, including Medecins Sans Frontieres and UNICEF, are closely monitoring the situation, and providing support to the government of Nigeria for the implementation of a mass vaccination campaign and other emergency control measures. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control has released 204 850 doses of vaccine, with the support of the GAVI Alliance, as well as 5000 antibiotic vials to respond to the outbreak. Case management and social mobilisation activities are also ongoing.\n\nCerebrospinal [bacterial] meningitis is caused by several microorganisms; among these, _N. meningitidis_ (Nm) is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis. The disease is highly contagious with seasonal epidemics in many African countries. Since the introduction of the Men A conjugate vaccine (MenAfrivac), which protects against the most prevalent type of Nm (serogroup A) the occurrence of the disease has declined significantly. From 2011 to 2014, the government of Nigeria conducted mass campaigns with the type A vaccine in all states at risk, including Kebbi state. Still, the risk of other types of _N. meningitidis_ persists, as evidenced by the current Nm C outbreak. The disease can be cured with antibiotics and prevented with vaccines.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the current information available on this outbreak.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[At least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described. Meningococcal disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, W135, and sometimes X. In the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa, designated the WHO African meningitis belt, large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June. The African meningitis belt extends from Ethiopia in the East, to Senegal in the West and includes Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Eritrea (see map at http://www.cdc.gov/travel-static/yellowbook/2014/map_3-11.pdf).\n\nSerogroup A meningococcus has been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). However, outbreaks have also been caused by other _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, such as serogroup C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17334579), X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751), and in March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/3581-ethiopia-suspected-meningitis-outbreak-situation-as-of-08-march-2012-.html).\n\nTo control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains. Since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt in 2010, the WHO noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, to be replaced by other serogroups.\n\nA map of Nigeria that shows the location of the northwestern states of Kebbi, Sokoto, and Zamfara can be found at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62.]", "summary": "Since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt in 2010, the WHO noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, to be replaced by other serogroups.

If the tests are positive, it would mean that yet another manifestation of enterovirus-68 has occurred. In Maryland, the state public health lab is conducting a broad range of testing on specimens submitted to the agency, state epidemiologist Dr. David Blythe says. Agency officials would not specify whether testing for EV-68 was occurring and did not confirm whether samples had been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. County health officials say that testing will occur at either the state level or be performed by the CDC.\n\nFive viral meningitis cases at the University of Maryland were confirmed as having been caused by an enterovirus, according to the University Health Center, and it's possible the EV-68 strain is causing the outbreak at the school, where more than 20 students have been infected. So far, only one instance of the specific meningitis-enterovirus-68 match has been confirmed recently in the U.S. In Connecticut, an elementary school student tested positive Thursday [30 Oct 2014] for both viral meningitis and EV-68. EV-68 symptoms have varied widely during the recent outbreak, from severe respiratory illness to paralysis and muscle weakness -- even resulting in one death. Latest figures from the CDC show that 1101 cases have been diagnosed in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Almost all cases have been among children, and the virus strain seems to particularly affect those with asthma or a history of wheezing.\n\nThe University of Maryland's health center had issued a statement about the viral meningitis cases, not wanting to cause alarm and hoping to avoid public confusion about bacterial meningitis, a much more serious condition that can result in hearing loss, seizures, brain damage and death. Bacterial meningitis is treated with antibiotics, and most colleges require students to be vaccinated against it before they are allowed to attend. Viral meningitis, on the other hand, can be treated with bed rest and water, along with medication to relieve fever and headache.\n\nThough a range of viruses can cause viral meningitis, it is possible that EV-68 is one of them, says Dr. Robert Wergin, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a practicing physician in Nebraska.\n\nFor reasons that remain unclear, University of Maryland officials say they will not know the particular strain of enterovirus behind the meningitis cases for weeks, according to an email from the University Health Center. Viral meningitis can come from a range of infections, including the mumps, herpes, measles, influenza, or even West Nile virus, though most cases are caused by an enterovirus -- cases of which are typically seen throughout the fall and spring. A teacher and a student also were infected with viral meningitis at a public school in the District of Columbia, only 10 miles away from the University of Maryland campus in College Park, Maryland. It is unclear whether a transmission occurred between the 2 or whether an enterovirus was the cause of the cases in the district. Other individual cases of viral meningitis have been confirmed across the country. Last week, an elementary school student was diagnosed with the virus [a virus?] in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Another case was diagnosed in a student at Sam Houston State University in Texas. Public information about what virus caused the meningitis or whether additional tests had been conducted was not released in either case.\n\nSymptoms of viral meningitis can last up to 10 days and include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and a lack of appetite. People generally recover spontaneously with supportive care, Wergin says. But as an enterovirus spreads, it can [may?] get into the tissues of the brain and spinal cord, causing inflammation. In rare, more severe cases, patients might require hospitalisation. It's unusual for an otherwise healthy person who is college-age to get viral meningitis, Wergin says; typically, it occurs among children younger than 5. It makes sense, however, that people could be more at risk in an enclosed environment like a classroom or dorm, he says.\n\n[Byline: Kimberly Leonard]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Susceptibility analysis\nDate: Thu 30 Oct 2014\nFrom: Stephen J.

Request for collaborators\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis ProMED-mail post reports on an investigation into sequence variation in the virus in an attempt to understand the epidemic potential and virulence of strains in the current outbreak. However, in addition to changes in the virus, rare human mutations affecting immunity to infection may be responsible for increased susceptibility to infections.\n\nThe laboratory of Dr. Jean-Laurent Casanova at Rockefeller University is devoted to the analysis of these kinds of mutations and has discovered numerous instances with increased susceptibility to a variety of organisms. They study cases and families in which unusual or unusually severe infections have occurred. Information thus far available (almost entirely from the news media) is limited. If confirmed by more complete investigation, the 3 fatal cases associated with enterovirus D68 in which the age and gender have been mentioned, fall into the category of unusually severe reactions to infection. One of these cases had concomitant _Staphylococcus aureus_ septicemia, a finding consistent with an immune defect that increased susceptibility both to the virus and to the bacterium. Dr. Casanova's laboratory would like to collaborate with groups that have access to specimens and families of patients who have died, with evidence of enterovirus D68 infection. CDC is aware of our efforts. Anyone with such access should contact me. All of the experimental work will be done in Casanova's laboratory.\n\nAn abstract outlining the general principles of the work follows. 'Guidelines for genetic studies in single patients: lessons from primary immunodeficiencies' authored by Jean-Laurent Casanova, Mary Ellen Conley, Stephen J. Seligman, Laurent Abel, and Luigi D. Notarangelo, published in J Exp Med 2014 211:2137-2149. The Abstract states: 'Can genetic and clinical findings made in a single patient be considered sufficient to establish a causal relationship between genotype and phenotype? We report that up to 49 of the 232 monogenic etiologies (21 percent) of human primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) were initially reported in single patients. The ability to incriminate single-gene inborn errors in immunodeficient patients results from the relative ease in validating the disease-causing role of the genotype by in-depth mechanistic studies demonstrating the structural and functional consequences of the mutations using blood samples. The candidate genotype can be causally connected to a clinical phenotype using cellular (leukocytes) or molecular (plasma) substrates. The recent advent of next generation sequencing (NGS), with whole exome and whole genome sequencing, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, and gene editing technologies-including in particular the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology-offer new and exciting possibilities for the genetic exploration of single patients not only in hematology and immunology but also in other fields. We propose 3 criteria for deciding if the clinical and experimental data suffice to establish a causal relationship based on only one case. The patient's candidate genotype must not occur in individuals without the clinical phenotype. Experimental studies must indicate that the genetic variant impairs, destroys, or alters the expression or function of the gene product (or 2 genetic variants for compound heterozygosity). The causal relationship between the candidate genotype and the clinical phenotype must be confirmed via a relevant cellular phenotype, or by default via a relevant animal phenotype. When supported by satisfaction of rigorous criteria, the report of single patient-based discovery of Mendelian disorders should be encouraged, as it can provide the 1st step in the understanding of a group of human diseases, thereby revealing crucial pathways underlying physiological and pathological processes.'\n\n--\nStephen J. Seligman, MD\nResearch Professor\nDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology\nNew York Medical College\n<stephen_seligman@nymc.edu>\n\n[The 1st report advances the proposition that human enterovirus D68 virus infection may be the principal determinant of (non-bacterial) meningitis. While this is an interesting proposition, no conclusive evidence is presented to support this contention. The commentary from Stephen J. Seligman seeks collaborators in a different molecular approach to analysis of enterovirus D68 genome function. This methodology has not so far been employed in the analysis of human enterovirus D68 genome function. Thus at present there is no definitive evidence that enterovirus D68 infection plays a major role in viral meningitis. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "When supported by satisfaction of rigorous criteria, the report of single patient-based discovery of Mendelian disorders should be encouraged, as it can provide the 1st step in the understanding of a group of human diseases, thereby revealing crucial pathways underlying physiological and pathological processes.'\n\n--\nStephen J. Seligman, MD\nResearch Professor\nDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Viral meningitis can come from a range of infections, including the mumps, herpes, measles, influenza, or even West Nile virus, though most cases are caused by an enterovirus -- cases of which are typically seen throughout the fall and spring. Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n Five viral meningitis cases at the University of Maryland were confirmed as having been caused by an enterovirus, according to the University Health Center, and it's possible the EV-68 strain is causing the outbreak at the school, where more than 20 students have been infected. The University of Maryland's health center had issued a statement about the viral meningitis cases, not wanting to cause alarm and hoping to avoid public confusion about bacterial meningitis, a much more serious condition that can result in hearing loss, seizures, brain damage and death. In this posting:\n[1] Genome function analysis\n For reasons that remain unclear, University of Maryland officials say they will not know the particular strain of enterovirus behind the meningitis cases for weeks, according to an email from the University Health Center. HUMAN ENTEROVIRUS D68 - NORTH AMERICA (16): MENINGITIS-ASSOCIATED?\n [The 1st report advances the proposition that human enterovirus D68 virus infection may be the principal determinant of (non-bacterial) meningitis. The recent advent of next generation sequencing (NGS), with whole exome and whole genome sequencing, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, and gene editing technologies-including in particular the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology-offer new and exciting possibilities for the genetic exploration of single patients not only in hematology and immunology but also in other fields. \n\nSymptoms of viral meningitis can last up to 10 days and include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and a lack of appetite. If confirmed by more complete investigation, the 3 fatal cases associated with enterovirus D68 in which the age and gender have been mentioned, fall into the category of unusually severe reactions to infection. [2] Susceptibility analysis\n\n******\n Thus at present there is no definitive evidence that enterovirus D68 infection plays a major role in viral meningitis. The ability to incriminate single-gene inborn errors in immunodeficient patients results from the relative ease in validating the disease-causing role of the genotype by in-depth mechanistic studies demonstrating the structural and functional consequences of the mutations using blood samples. \n\n\nA meningitis outbreak at the University of Maryland may be related to another virus that has swept across the country [USA] during recent months, though further testing is being conducted to determine the possibility. The causal relationship between the candidate genotype and the clinical phenotype must be confirmed via a relevant cellular phenotype, or by default via a relevant animal phenotype. A teacher and a student also were infected with viral meningitis at a public school in the District of Columbia, only 10 miles away from the University of Maryland campus in College Park, Maryland. Other individual cases of viral meningitis have been confirmed across the country. In Connecticut, an elementary school student tested positive Thursday [30 Oct 2014] for both viral meningitis and EV-68. It's unusual for an otherwise healthy person who is college-age to get viral meningitis, Wergin says; typically, it occurs among children younger than 5. Public information about what virus caused the meningitis or whether additional tests had been conducted was not released in either case. The Abstract states: 'Can genetic and clinical findings made in a single patient be considered sufficient to establish a causal relationship between genotype and phenotype? Though a range of viruses can cause viral meningitis, it is possible that EV-68 is one of them, says Dr. Robert Wergin, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a practicing physician in Nebraska.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "measles", "mumps", "west nile virus"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-26 00:00:00", "1101-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-04-01 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Oklahoma", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Connecticut", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "College Park", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nebraska", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Stillwater", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "the District of Columbia", "country": "Colombia"}, {"location": "Maryland", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2673398", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Enteroviral meningitis - Armenia (02): susp", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2673398", "date": "2014-08-09 09:15:51", "main_text": "ENTEROVIRAL MENINGITIS - ARMENIA (02): SUSPECTED\n************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 7 Aug 2014\nSource: ARKA News Agency [edited]\nhttp://arka.am/en/news/society/nearly_450_people_hospitalized_in_june_august_with_suspected_acute_meningitis_/\n\n\nNearly 450 people were hospitalized in Armenia in June, July, and the 1st week of August [2014] with suspected acute meningitis, a disease caused by enterovirus infections, Gayane Sahakyan, the head of the National Immunization Program of the Health Ministry, told a news conference today [7 Aug 2014]. 'Fortunately, the diagnosis of acute meningitis was confirmed only in less than 1/3 of cases. The number of people seeking [the] assistance of hospitals is gradually decreasing. There is no epidemic,' she said.\n\nSahakyan noted that diseases caused by enteroviruses are dangerous and have a variety of symptoms. They are transmitted through air and tactile contacts with sick people or contaminated objects. The point is that a healthy person could be a carrier of the disease for 5-6 months, and thus become a source of infection to others.\n\n'The danger is that the symptoms of enteroviral diseases can manifest themselves in many different ways, such as acute respiratory infections and diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. For an accurate diagnosis a special laboratory study is required,' Sahakyan said.\n\n'To protect against enterovirus diseases people must comply with the most basic rules of personal hygiene, wash hands, fruits, and vegetables thoroughly, disinfect homes and premises, not to swim in open water reservoirs not intended for swimming,' she said.\n\nShe said preventive measures are being implemented in kindergartens and children's summer camps at the order of the health minister in order to prevent outbreaks of enterovirus infections.\n\nEnterovirus infection is a group of acute infectious diseases caused by enteric viruses (enteroviruses), characterized by fever and [a variety] of clinical symptoms involving people's central nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, muscle, lung, liver, kidney, and other body organs.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail posted a report of an outbreak of serous acute meningitis presumed to be due to enteroviruses in Armenia in May-June 2014, with a total of 38 cases recorded, mainly in the 3- to 8-year-old age group (Enteroviral meningitis - Armenia 20140628.2572211). The news report above says the diagnosis of viral meningitis has now been confirmed in 'less than 1/3' of the total of 450 cases hospitalized with suspected acute viral meningitis and the number of hospitalized cases has been decreasing. The news report does not say if the enteroviral etiology has been confirmed in any of these cases.\n\nThe term 'meningitis' means an inflammation of the meninges, which are the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. 'Serous' meningitis is a term used when clinical findings (such as a stiff neck) suggest meningitis, but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), although under increased pressure, is clear to the naked eye (http://www.bmj.com/content/2/3691/627.3).\n\nNormally, there are 0 to 5 white cells (all mononuclear cells) per cmm [per cubic millimeter] in the CSF. CSF becomes cloudy when there are more than 500 white cells per cmm. When the CSF is visibly clear, but on laboratory examination the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating, the term aseptic meningitis is used.\n\nThe most common cause of aseptic meningitis is a viral infection and enteroviruses are common causes of viral meningitis, especially in children during the summer months. However, aseptic meningitis may be caused by other viruses, such as arboviruses, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, some bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Non-infectious causes include certain drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and systemic diseases, such as lupus, sarcoidosis, and metastatic cancer.\n\nMost people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person through fecal contamination of water or food or contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Enteroviruses can also be spread through respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/133.]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail posted a report of an outbreak of serous acute meningitis presumed to be due to enteroviruses in Armenia in May-June 2014, with a total of 38 cases recorded, mainly in the 3- to 8-year-old age group (Enteroviral meningitis - Armenia 20140628.2572211).

So far this year [2014], 20 cases of meningococcal infections have been reported with 8 of those occurring since September.\n\nChief Public Health Officer Dr Stephen Christley said while the disease was usually rare, numbers increased when more respiratory infections were around. 'As we have experienced increased numbers of cases in the past few weeks we're asking the general public to be aware of the symptoms of meningococcal disease and seek medical advice is necessary,' he said. 'Symptoms of meningococcal infection may include fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck and sore muscles, followed in some cases by a rash of red and purple spots. Babies or young children with meningococcal infection may also be fretful, refuse feeds or be difficult to wake.'\n\nDr Christley said meningococcal bacteria were carried in the nose and throat of about 10 per cent of the population, but the bacteria were usually harmless. 'The bacteria are spread from person to person through close contact, but only a very small number of people develop meningococcal disease,' he said. 'With all cases of meningococcal infection, SA Health will identify people who may have been in contact with the patient to provide them with information.' A Meningococcal Australia spokesperson recommended people keep vaccinations up-to-date and act quickly if they suspected someone had contracted the disease.\n\n'Meningococcal disease, while rare, is a disease that can lead to death in less than 24 hours,' the spokesperson said.\n\n'Around 5 to 10 percent of those who contract meningococcal disease will not survive and 20 percent of survivors are left with permanent disabilities that range from learning difficulties, sight or hearing problems, loss of fingers, toes and limbs, and scarring from skin grafts.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Australia can be seen at http://www.ga.gov.au/image_cache/GA4073.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/286.

However, the news report above fails to tell us the incidence rates in prior years for comparison and we are not told the serogroups involved. We are also not told if any outbreaks of meningococcal disease contributed to the total number of cases in South Australia. (In the US, only about 2 percent of cases of meningococcal disease occurs as part of an outbreak.) Outbreaks can occur in communities, schools, colleges, prisons, and other populations and are usually caused by the same or closely related strains. More information concerning the epidemiological findings concerning the cases of meningococcal disease in South Australia would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.\n\nFor Australia as a whole, the incidence of meningococcal disease declined from about 700 cases in 2001 to 208 laboratory-confirmed cases in 2012 (incidence rate 0.88 per 100 000), the lowest annual total incidence since surveillance data was collated (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf). The conjugate meningococcal C vaccine was introduced into the National Immunisation Program in 2003. Since 2003, there has been a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases from 34 percent of cases in 2003 to 5.7 percent in 2012, accompanied by an increase in serogroup B from 60 percent in 2003 to 83 percent in 2012 (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf).\n\nAccording to the annual reports of the Australian Meningococcal Surveillance Programme, the number of cases of meningococcal disease in South Australia fluctuated each year, from 13 to 24, of which the percent due to serogroup B ranged from 64 in 2001 to 96 in 2012 (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-annlrpt-menganrep.htm).\n\nFor comparison, in the US, prior to 2000, an estimated 1400 to 2800 cases of meningococcal disease occurred each year, with an incidence rate of 0.5 to 1.1 per 100 000 population.

This is a parasitic infection in rats, where it matures. Mollusks like snails and slugs pick up _Angiostrongylus_ larvae by ingesting them in rat feces.\n\nHow do people get this parasite?\nInfection is [caused] by accidentally or intentionally ingesting raw snails and slugs. Lettuce and other leafy vegetables may also be a source if contaminated by small mollusks. Eating raw or undercooked prawns and crabs that have ingested mollusks may also be a source of infection.\n\nWhat are the symptoms and disease?\n_A. cantonensis_ infection is usually asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Symptoms usually appear in 1-3 weeks. The most serious disease is eosinophilic meningitis. The symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting. The spinal fluid exhibits eosinophilia of over 20 percent. Deaths are sometimes reported.\n\nSymptoms may last for weeks to months.\n\nHow is this infection diagnosed?\nThe presence of eosinophils in the spinal fluid and a history of eating raw snails suggest angiostrongyliasis. Finding the worms in spinal fluid or at autopsy is confirmation.\n\nWhat about treatment?\nTreatment is usually not necessary. The parasite dies over time since it can't mature and complete its life cycle. Usually treatment of symptoms -- headache medicine, steroids -- are all that is needed.

However, outbreaks have also been caused by other _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, such as serogroup C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (http://cel.webofknowledge.com/InboundService.do?product=CEL&SID=4BczB7VSGYERs55e6vX&UT=000076093900009&SrcApp=Highwire&action=retrieve&Init=Yes&Func=Frame&SrcAuth=Highwire&customersID=Highwire&IsProductCode=Yes&mode=FullRecord), and X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751), and in March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/3581-ethiopia-suspected-meningitis-outbreak-situation-as-of-08-march-2012-.html). No reports on meningitis were available for Ethiopia for 2013 (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/) and we are not told the microbial etiology of the meningitis outbreak in the various regions of Ethiopia, nor the types of meningococcal vaccine being used, in the report above. ProMED-mail would appreciate information on the microbial causes of the meningitis outbreaks in Ethiopia and the meningococcal vaccines being used from knowledgeable sources.\n\nTo control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains. Meningococcal disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135. Rarely, outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have been related to other serogroups, such as type X, which has occurred in Niger in 2006 and Burkina Faso in 2010.\n\nSerogroup A, B, C, Y, and W135 polysaccharides are immunogenic in humans; serogroup B is poorly immunogenic, presumably because serogroup B polysaccharide resembles the human neural cell adhesion molecule. While effective capsular polysaccharides-based vaccines exist against serogroups A, C, W135, and Y, no similar vaccine is available against disease caused by serogroup B strains. However, a new protein-based, broad-spectrum meningococcal serogroup B vaccine has been developed. - Mod.ML]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n WHO procured 200 000 doses of meningitis vaccines in response to the increasing meningitis caseload and ahead of the meningitis epidemic season starting in October 2014.

According to the Department of Consumer Protection of the capital of Kazakhstan, 160 people have been hospitalized in 1 month.\n\n'As of 25 Jul 2014, there were 160 patients in hospitals' in-patient wards with symptoms that do not exclude meningitis. Since 1 Jul 2014, after clinical examination 139 patients have been diagnosed with serous meningitis. Of them, 50 cases are laboratory-confirmed,' the Department said in a response to a formal inquiry from Tengrinews.\n\nThe Department assured that it was not an outbreak but a seasonal rise, since there was a similar number of cases during the same period of last year [2013]. The number of cases peaked in July. The majority -- 95 percent -- of those diagnosed with meningitis were children under the age of 14.\n\n'No instances of group contagion have been registered; therefore, restrictive measures are not necessary,' the Department said in response to a question on whether educational institutions and kindergartens had to be quarantined.\n\n'The Health Department ensured timely hospitalization of the patients with serous meningitis. In cases of serous meningitis caused by enterovirus, disinfection measures in crowded places are not required as personal hygiene is enough to eliminate the non-percutaneous channel of the infection,' the agency said.\n\nVirological investigators tested 11 samples from fountains, 16 samples from surface water reservoirs, and 10 samples of sewage water. Only one sewage water sample showed enterovirus, indicating circulation of the virus in the external environment.\n\nThe Department called the citizens to carefully [follow] the general preventive measures to reduce the risk of catching the enterovirus infection.\n\nThese are: drink only bottled water or boiled tap water; wash hands with soap before each meal and after each visit to the toilet; strictly observe the rules of personal and public hygiene; wash fruit and vegetables with a brush before eating them, swim only in officially designated places; abstain from purchasing food products of unclear origin or away from officially designated trading areas.\n\n[Bacterial] meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Viral meningitis occurs more often than bacterial meningitis, and is milder. It usually occurs in the late summer and early fall. It most often affects children and adults under age 30. Symptoms usually come on quickly, and may include: fever and chills, mental status changes, nausea and vomiting, sensitivity to light (photophobia), severe headache, stiff neck, agitation, bulging fontanelles in babies, decreased alertness, poor feeding or irritability in children, rapid breathing, unusual posture, with the head and neck arched backwards.\n\nThe heath department specifically urged people not to reserve to self-treatment but to immediately see a doctor in case of noticing the symptoms.\n\n[Byline: Altynai Zhumzhumina, Dinara Urazova, Tatyana Kuzmina]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The term 'meningitis' means an inflammation of the meninges, which are the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. 'Serous' meningitis is a term used when clinical findings (such as a stiff neck) suggest meningitis, but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), although under increased pressure, is clear to the naked eye (http://www.bmj.com/content/2/3691/627.3).\n\nNormally, there are 0 to 5 white cells (all mononuclear cells) per cmm [per cubic millimeter] in the CSF. CSF becomes cloudy when there are more than 500 white cells per cmm. When the CSF is visibly clear, but on laboratory examination the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating, the term aseptic meningitis is used.\n\nAs stated in the news report above, the most common cause of aseptic meningitis is a viral infection and enteroviruses are usually the cause of viral meningitis, especially in children during the summer months. However, aseptic meningitis may be caused by other viruses, such as arboviruses, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, some bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Non-infectious causes include certain drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and systemic diseases, such as lupus, sarcoidosis, and metastatic cancer.\n\nMost people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person through fecal contamination of water or food or contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Enteroviruses can also be spread through respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person.\n\nMaps of Kazakhstan can be seen at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/kazakhst.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6183.

VIRAL MENINGITIS - GEORGIA (02)\n The minister of health has repeatedly said that there is no cause for alarm about the viral meningitis outbreak. The ministry also called on the parents themselves and schools staff to take additional hygiene measures to protect children, most importantly, by providing for a strict personal hygiene, and washing hands frequently. \n\nIt further said that in schools, pupils should not share utensils like plates and forks. \n\n--\n The last two times viral meningitis peaked was in 2010 and 2006. According to Georgia's National Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC), 169 of the cases were in Tbilisi, 51 in Kutaisi, 18 in Adjara, 11 in Rustavi, and one isolated case in each of a number of cities and towns all over Georgia.

Kindergartens and schools up to 6th grade will be closed until 27 May [2014], while sanitary measures are being implemented. This was decided Wednesday [21 May 2014] at a session between staff of the education and health ministries.\n\nBut health minister Davit Sergeenko says there is no reason for panic. 'Viral meningitis may peak within a 4 year time frame, but it doesn't get severe,' Sergeenko said at a press conference on Wednesday [21 May 2014]. He said all the cases are only of medium or light severity. Of the patients, 87 are receiving medical treatment at Iashvili hospital in Tbilisi, he said.\n\nAbout 15 of the cases are in Kutaisi, Georgia's 2nd largest city, and 4 in Batumi on the Black Sea coast. The youngest patient is 2 years old and the oldest 34.\n\nThe health minister says there is no vaccine for the virus causing this outbreak. One of the most effective ways to avoid infection is through good personal hygiene. At the press conference, Sergeenko underlined that there have been no severe cases among all the patients, but added that he has a plan prepared in case the outbreak gets worse. Later, it was announced that the Health Ministry and Education Ministry had decided at a session to close all kindergartens and schools up to 6th grade until 27 May [2014] to tackle the outbreak by beefing up sanitary measures.\n\nGeorgia usually has about 150 cases of meningitis in a year, but once every 4 years the number of cases peaks, as it did in 2006 and 2010.\n\nParents should be on guard and if they see that a child is irritated, lacks appetite or has fever, headache or other symptoms, they must immediately take them to a doctor.\n\nViral meningitis may be caused by a variety of viruses.

The girl was just 3 weeks old when she was rushed to hospital with a high temperature and sickness. She was left fighting for life in an isolation unit after it was confirmed she was suffering from meningitis.\n\nDoctors later told her frantic mum that tests showed the infection had been passed to her daughter in the saliva of their ginger tomcat Chesney. Mum-of-one, aged 21, said: 'I was just really, really surprised when the doctors said she caught it from the cat; I didn't have a clue it was possible.\n\n'For the 1st couple of days we feared the worst because [she] was so unwell. About 5 days later, the doctors asked if we had any pets. I said we had a cat. They explained to us that [her] illness had been caused by a bug carried by bacteria in the cat's saliva. It took them a while to find out what it was, because they had never seen it before. The doctor said that from the swab they had, there was a bug that grew, and they didn't know what it was. It turned out it was in cats, dogs, rabbits, and pigs; it was in their saliva and really rare. The doctors said there were only 39 recorded cases in the world, and most involved newborn babies because they didn't have an immune system. I was told that she could have died within hours if I hadn't brought her in. They thought the bug was transferred through Chesney's saliva. I'd been careful not to leave them alone together, but Chesney must have licked [her] milk bottle while my back was turned.'\n\n'When Sparkle began to improve she had to go and have her bones checked because the doctors said in half the cases, people later suffered a bone disease. I didn't really let Chesney near her when she was tiny. But I was breast-feeding and bottle feeding, and he must have licked her milk bottle or my hand. The cat did have a thing about going for her bottle to get at the milk; it's just a cat thing isn't it.'\n\n'[She] spent about 3 weeks in hospital, and then we had to take her back every day for a week to take antibiotics. Fortunately, she made a full recovery. The cat was never unwell; it was just a natural bacteria in his saliva.'\n\n[The girl] is now aged 3 and learning to ride a pony.\n\nThe terrifying episode unfolded shortly after [the mother] gave birth to her only child at the age of 18. She and [the baby]'s dad were at home at 7 pm one evening when their baby suddenly became very unwell. [The mother], from Winsham, Somerset, said: 'She was restless and had a very high temperature and wouldn't stop crying. It was a very piercing cry, and she then started being sick. I thought she had colic and sent [my husband] down to Tesco to get some colic drops. She didn't have a rash but was really, really hot and we gave her a bath to cool her down because she loved a bath.' But [the baby] became more unwell, and the couple wrapped her in a blanket and went to Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton after phoning NHS Direct.\n\nHer mother decided not to have 2-year-old Chesney put down after [her baby] recovered from the life-threatening illness. Instead, she gave the cat to her mum who lives 4 miles away. [Her mother] said: 'I used to worry about Sparkle at 1st and didn't let her near any animals for more than a year. But it was not Chesney's fault; he didn't mean to do it. I'd had him since he was a kitten; he was like my 1st baby, and I couldn't have put him down. We asked the doctors if we should get rid of the cat, and they said it wasn't really necessary. Now the baby is more immune to it than us because she has all the antibodies.' Sparkle now plays with Chesney every time she visits her grandmother's home in Chard.\n\nA spokeswoman for Musgrove Park Hospital today [17 Apr 2014] confirmed Sparkle was treated at the facility 3 years ago.\n\n[Byline: Andrew Gregory, Richard Smith]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above news report describes acute meningitis in a 3-week-old baby that was attributed to a pathogen found normally in cat saliva. The news report, unfortunately, fails to mention what that pathogen was, except to say that it was a rare cause of meningitis: '...only 39 recorded cases in the world and most involved newborn babies because they didn't have an immune system.'\n\nPossible pathogens in cat's saliva can be inferred from those isolated in cat bite infections. Anywhere from 20-80 percent of cat bites may become infected. _Pasteurella_, a Gram-negative coccobacillus that resembles _Hemophilus influenzae_, is the organism most commonly found in cat bite wound infections, with _Pasteurella multocida_ being the predominant _Pasteurella_ species; various viridans _Streptococci_ and _Streptococcus agalactiae_ (also known as Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci or GBS) are the 2nd most common type of organisms isolated (http://cmr.asm.org/content/24/2/231.full). (_Streptococcus pyogenes_, also known as Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, has not been isolated in cat bite wound infections.) Less frequently encountered aerobic organisms in cat bite infections include _Capnocytophaga_ species. Cats are also the main reservoir of _Bartonella henselae_, the causative agent of cat scratch disease, which is found in cat saliva.\n\n_Pasteurella multocida_ has been implicated as a rare cause of bacterial meningitis. Most of these meningitis patients had an animal contact, and many were newborns (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2425895/, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19730153, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17055368, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17206557 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8666850). Meningitis in these patients can be complicated by osteomyelitis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12878338).\n\n_S. agalactiae_ (GBS) is a major cause infection of the newborn; early-onset disease occurring in the 1st week of life is septicemia accompanied by pneumonia, while late-onset disease is septicemia more often accompanied by meningitis (http://www.cdc.gov/groupbstrep/about/newborns-pregnant.html). GBS thus cannot be considered a rare cause of meningitis.\n\n_Capnocytophaga_ cause overwhelming sepsis in asplenic patients, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. About 20 patients with _Capnoytophaga_ meningitis have been described in the medical literature, but the age range has been 17-83 years (mean, 50.6 years) (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/3/e42.full.pdf).\n\n_Bartonella henselae_ has not been shown to cause bacterial meningitis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12051353, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8562744). Anaerobic bacteria, although common in cat saliva and cat bite wound infections, are very rarely the cause of acute bacterial meningitis without identifiable risk factors (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC268396/?page=1, http://anaerobicinfections.blogspot.com/p/central-nervous-system-infections.html).\n\nCat and other feline bites and exposures can also transmit to humans _Francisella tularensis_, the cause of tularemia, _Yersinia pestis_, the cause of plague, and _Mycobacterium bovis_, which can cause human tuberculosis (ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis, human - UK: (England) 2013, domestic cat-to-human transm. 20140327.2361967). Although these organisms can cause meningitis, they would not be described as normal flora in cats' saliva.\n\nSo my vote is for _Pasteurella multocida_ as the etiologic agent in this child's meningitis.

The 2 patients are students at the Assou Oubassalam school. According to a statement from the Department of Health, local health authorities promptly took the necessary measures under the meningitis control program. Both children were transferred to the regional hospital in Ouarzazate [Souss Massa Draa region]. Their families have also been tested and received preventive care, and an epidemiological investigation has been carried out in the affected children's and neighboring douars [an Arabian village consisting typically of a group of tents or huts that encircle an open space]. Similarly, all students, teachers, and school staff have been tested, which revealed 2 new cases among the students. Nearly 800 persons were vaccinated against meningitis and for added efficiency, the health minister, Hussein Al Ouardi, sent a specialized team of the Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases directorate to the site, to carry out an epidemiological investigation and take, if necessary, additional measures.\n\nTo date, the 4 students who remain hospitalized are doing well. Finally, the Department of Health wishes to clarify that these are isolated cases, which are controlled.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June in the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa, designated the WHO African meningitis belt, which extends from Ethiopia in the East, to Senegal in the West and includes Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Eritrea (see map at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/content/yellowbook/2014/map_3-11.pdf). Serogroup A meningococcus has been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf).

The outbreak at Princeton prompted a vaccination campaign at the school using an unlicensed, imported vaccine because the usual meningitis vaccine [available in the United States] doesn't protect against it.\n\n'CDC's laboratory analysis shows that the strain in Princeton University's serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreak matches the strain in the Drexel University case by 'genetic fingerprinting',' the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. 'This information suggests that the outbreak strain may still be present in the Princeton University community and we need to be vigilant for additional cases.'\n\nCDC's Dr Thomas Clark says the case doesn't represent a new outbreak at Drexel. [The Drexel student] had been in contact with students from Princeton, which is about 45 minutes away.\n\nCDC and state health officials have been tracking everyone in close contact with [the Drexel student]. 'That investigation did identify some Princeton students as close contacts and they were given antibiotics,' Clark told NBC News. 'The fact that the strain matches means that they are most likely [the] source (of infection),' he added.\n\nCDC has vaccinated more than 5000 Princeton students against [_N. meningitidis_ serogroup] B using a vaccine in wide use in Europe called Bexsero. Its maker, Novartis, plans to apply for a license to use Bexsero in the United States. Bexsero was also used in an unrelated outbreak of meningitis B at the University of California Santa Barbara [last fall 2013].\n\nMost of the Princeton students [the Drexel student] had been in contact with had been vaccinated against the [serogroup B] strain. Clark says it's possible people can be vaccinated and be protected themselves, while still able to spread the bacteria to others. 'We just don't know,' he said. Clark said there are no plans for vaccinations at Drexel. 'Right now it's one case and it doesn't tell us there is going to be an outbreak,' Clark said.\n\nBut the case shows that college students in particular need to be careful. Meningitis isn't particularly easy to catch, but kissing and other close contact are good ways to spread it. Meningitis can kill very quickly and unexpectedly and students with symptoms such as high fever, stiff neck, or a rash need to seek immediate medical attention.\n\nAbout 500 cases of bacterial meningitis are reported in the US each year, with more than a third caused by [serogroup] B. About one in 10 people who get sick die and 20 percent are permanently disabled.\n\n[Byline: Maggie Fox]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above says that there is an epidemiologic link between the Drexel student and the Princeton meningococcal meningitis outbreak, which is supported by matching genotypes for the Princeton and Drexel meningococcal strains. The Drexel student had contact with students from Princeton and this contact occurred relatively recently, after the Princeton students had been vaccinated with the Bexsero serogroup B vaccine.\n\nThe 1st dose of the serogroup B vaccine was given to 5268 Princeton individuals, which represented 91 percent of the approximately 5800 University community members who were said to be eligible to receive the vaccine, between 9 and 12 Dec 2013 (http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S38/68/80C91/index.xml) and by mid-February 2014, 95 percent of the approximately 5800 eligible individuals received the 1st dose of the vaccine. Full immunity requires a 2nd dose of the vaccine and 4709 individuals received the 2nd dose by 20 Feb 2014 (http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S39/26/72G66/index.xml).\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_ only infects humans; there is no animal reservoir and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10 percent of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days, but can range between 2 and 10 days.\n\nThe protein conjugate meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines (unlike Bexsero, which is based upon meningococcal protein antigens) have been found to induce a higher and more sustainable immune response and reduce the rate of nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci and thus its transmission. Bexsero is the only broad coverage serogroup B vaccine; it has been approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia to help protect against invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B. Its effect on nasopharyngeal carriage rate is not known.\n\nFor further discussion of invasive meningococcal disease on a college campus, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail postings: Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (05): (NJ) college, sg B, vaccine 20131125.2073662; Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (04): (CA,NJ) college, sg B, vaccine 20131122.2069150; Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (03): (NJ) college, sg.

Meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains. Meningococcal disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135. Rarely, outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have been related to other serogroups, such as type X, which has occurred in Niger in 2006 and Burkina Faso in 2010.\n\nSerogroup A, B, C, Y, and W135 polysaccharides are immunogenic in humans; serogroup B is poorly immunogenic, presumably because serogroup B polysaccharide resembles the human neural cell adhesion molecule. While effective capsular polysaccharides-based vaccines exist against serogroups A, C, W135, and Y, no similar vaccine is available against disease caused by serogroup B strains.

Lab tests confirmed that the rare 'serogroup B' strain was responsible for her death, the university said in a statement.\n\nDrexel, located in downtown Philadelphia, is tracking down anyone who had recent contact with [this student] in an effort to provide prophylactic antibiotics to ward off infection, school officials said in a statement. [The student] recently attended a regional officer training conference for the Phi Mu sorority. The sorority's national chapter said in a statement that it has contacted other conference attendees.\n\nMeningitis is generally spread through close personal contact such as kissing, sharing drinks, or coughing. Most college students are required to get a meningitis vaccination, but that does not protect against this particular strain.\n\nAfter 8 students were infected at Princeton University, the US Food and Drug Administration in November [2013] allowed the school to import a vaccine [Bexsero] that is not approved in the United States but is licensed in Europe and Australia.\n\nIn February [2014], students at the University of California at Santa Barbara began receiving the vaccine -- known as Bexsero -- after an outbreak sickened 4 and led to one student having a foot amputated. No one died at either school.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there are about 160 serotype B infections in the United States every year.\n\n[Another student], a biomedical engineering student at Drexel, said students on Friday [14 Mar 2014] were made aware of the death and the risk to those who were in contact with [the deceased student], but were going about their daily business. 'I know the school is taking it seriously because they've sent several emails,' he said.\n\n[Byline: Daniel Kelley, Barbara Goldberg, Matthew Lewis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B recently occurred at Princeton University (8 cases) and the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) outbreak (4 cases). However, molecular typing showed that these 2 outbreaks were caused by 2 different serogroup B strains, indicating that the outbreaks were not related.\n\nThe news report above states that a student at Drexel University died of invasive meningococcal disease caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B. We are not told if there is an epidemiologic linkage between the Drexel case and the cases at Princeton or UCSB, nor if molecular typing has been done or if so, whether the Drexel strain is related to either the Princeton or UCSB strain. The distance between Princeton and Philadelphia is about 45 miles (72 km).\n\nChemoprophylaxis is given to close contacts whose risk for acquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among the total population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). Effective antibiotic regimens for adults include: rifampin 600 mg orally twice daily for 2 days; ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally as a single dose; and ceftriaxone 250 mg as a single intramuscular injection.\n\nAlthough there are several vaccines based on the meningococcal capsular polysaccharide that cover serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, they are not effective against infection caused by serogroup B. There has been no licensed serogroup B vaccine in the US. Because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen, serogroup B vaccines cannot be based on capsular polysaccharide. Vaccines that use outer membrane vesicle protein from an outbreak strain have been used successfully in New Zealand and Cuba to control epidemics in those countries caused by the targeted serogroup B strain, but these vaccines do not cover other strains of serogroup B organisms.\n\nThe Bexsero vaccine, a broad-spectrum serogroup B vaccine, is available only for investigational use in the US, and has been used in the outbreaks on the Princeton and UCSB campuses. The Bexsero vaccine contains surface proteins that occur across most serogroup B strains and elicits bactericidal antibodies that can confer protective immune responses (Donnelly J, Medini D, Boccadifuoco G, et al: Qualitative and quantitative assessment of meningococcal antigens to evaluate the potential strain coverage of protein-based vaccines.

Activities that can put people at risk of the disease include: smoking, including marijuana, cigarettes and hookah; close contact with an infected person, including sharing beverages or cigarettes, kissing and coughing; and staying in group settings such as dorms, jails or shelters for extended periods.\n\nThe infection can cause brain damage, hearing loss or potentially death. Symptoms can include fever, stiff neck, skin rash, severe headaches, low blood pressure and muscle pain. The disease spreads quickly, so fast diagnosis and treatment is 'imperative,' health officials said.\n\nThe county plans to offer free vaccines to residents without health insurance beginning tomorrow [3 Apr 2014].

Of these 8, 4 cases were reported among men who have sex with men (MSM), including 3 men who were HIV-positive. Of those cases, 3 died. Public Health refused to provide any more information, so it remains unclear if any of the deaths were of gay men.\n\nA vital difference between these cases and investigations of IMD in 2012 and 2013 is that distinct epidemiological commonalities were found among the 2014 MSM cases.\n\nOf the 4 IMD cases among MSM, 3 reported either residence in, or socializing around, the West Hollywood and North Hollywood areas, and 3 were between 27-28 years of age (the 4th case was 50 years of age).\n\nThe nexus being West Hollywood and the illness extending to the HIV community raise the level of caution issued by the Public Health Department. Based on consultations with the Centers for Disease Control, Public Health recommends that all HIV positive men and men who have sex with men (MSM) get vaccinated for meningitis immediately.\n\n'All HIV-positive MSM, and all MSM regardless of HIV status, who regularly have close or intimate contact with multiple partners, or who seek partners through the use of digital applications, particularly those who share cigarettes, marijuana or use illegal drugs, should visit their health provider to be vaccinated against invasive meningococcal disease,' said Jonathan E. Fielding, MD, MPH, Director of Public Health and Health Officer. 'At-risk MSM who don't have health insurance can obtain a free vaccination through the Department of Public Health.'\n\nLast year [2013] West Hollywood took a scare when a popular lawyer died hours after falling ill from the disease. Days later it was revealed that a 2nd gay man had succumbed to the disease [in December 2012, but Public Health had not made the connection between his death, meningitis and his sexual orientation until April 2013]. Still, despite the concerns expressed at the time about the potential for widespread contagion, neither man had an acquaintance or crossed paths, and no more gay men came down with the infection in the weeks following.\n\nPublic Health was slower to get off the dime than city and HIV/AIDS leaders council member John Duran and AHF [AIDS Healthcare Foundation] founder/president Michael Weinstein, however, so AHF dug into its own pockets to offer free meningitis vaccinations to the HIV and gay community, to phenomenal response. Within 3 days of offering the vaccine, AHF's outreach campaign had provided 2896 free vaccinations to the community. It also came to light that Public Health until November 2012 did not do any sexual orientation screening, but that a retroactive look for indicators had been done and found that gay men in West Hollywood/Los Angeles were not spreading the illness in larger than usual numbers.\n\n'Most of the meningitis we see,' Jonathan E. Fielding, the county director of public health said last year [2013], 'is in family groups. Children, especially, spread the illness.' Explaining last year that he understood the 'level of concern' in the gay community, that meningitis should not be considered a 'gay disease,' and while meningitis is infectious, it is not as contagious as flu or the common cold, he said. Still, the community stakeholders and Public Health remain wary of large gatherings of people likely to share water bottles, cutlery or engage in deep kissing, such as [at] nightclubs.\n\nAIDS Healthcare Foundation, which led the way to vaccinations last year [2013], will also be offering them at their Men's Wellness Center located at 1300 North Vermont Avenue, Suite 407, Los Angeles.

Similar outbreaks among MSM occurred in Canada and the US caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C. The US outbreak involved 22 cases in New York City between 2010 and 2013, with 7 deaths (see prior ProMED-mail posts).\n\nIn April 2013, 2 cases of IMD in Los Angeles (LA) County suggested that the outbreak in New York City may have spread to the West Coast, but the strain from one of the Los Angeles cases was said to be different from the one in New York (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (New York City) fatal, MSM, vaccination 20130520.1725339). The news report above does not state what serotypes are involved in the 8 cases that have occurred in LA County so far this year (2014), especially in the 4 MSM cases, nor if molecular typing has been done on the current strains and if so, whether these strains are related to the prior LA County strain or the European, Canadian or New York outbreak strains. ProMED-mail would appreciate any information on the molecular characteristics of the strains involved in the current LA County outbreak.\n\nMolecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/).\n\nHowever, less virulent strains have been reported to cause invasive meningococcal disease in immunocompromised HIV infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis. 2011; 15(2): 178-80, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).\n\nWe are told that 3 of the 4 infected MSM were co-infected with HIV, but not if their CD4 counts were low. Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing bacterial meningitis (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial meningitis in HIV-1-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285_Bacterial_meningitis_in_HIV-1-infected_patients_in_the_era_of_highly_active_antiretroviral_therapy).\n\nThe primary method for preventing sporadic meningococcal disease is chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone for persons who are known to be close contacts after a case is identified. Close contacts of patients are considered to be household members, day-care center contacts, and other persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful for deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.\n\nIn the face of multiple anonymous sexual encounters among some MSM, a mass vaccination campaign has been used to control outbreaks of IMD in MSM. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccine to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC. Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

A total of 31 suspected cases have been reported since the 1st case was registered late last month [January 2014]. However there have been no deaths.\n\nIn a press release issued by the MOH, Adjumani district has recorded the highest number of cases with 14 cases followed by Arua, which has so far registered 13 cases. The release reveals that the neighbouring districts of Koboko and Maracha have recorded 2 cases.\n\nThe release states that 'the outbreak was reported after receiving confirmatory results from central public health laboratory (CPHL), which proved that 2 people had tested positive for the disease.' The most affected areas in Adjumani district are the 3 districts hosting refugees who fled from South Sudan due to the current instability. The affected sub-counties include Dzaipi, Adropi, and Arinyapi, which share borders with South Sudan where a weekly market operates. This is likely to amplify transmission in the region and spill over the border.\n\nAccording to the release the ministry has dispatched a team of health experts to strengthen the local team in the districts. 'The necessary drug supplies have been mobilized; plans are under way to designate treatment centers in all the existing health facilities in the affected districts,' states the release.\n\n[Byline: Violet Nabatanzi, Juliet Waiswa]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Adjumani is a district in northwestern Uganda; it borders the district of Arua to the southwest and South Sudan to the north. Arua is also a district in northwestern Uganda, but it is separated from the border with South Sudan by the Ugandan districts of Koboko, Maracha, and Yumbe. For a map of Ugandan districts, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda.\n\nSouth Sudan and Uganda are included in the WHO African meningitis belt, a region in sub-Saharan Africa where the incidence rate of meningitis is very high. Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the African meningitis belt each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/images/map3-13-frequent-epidemics-meningococcal-meningitis-large.png.\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A is said to have been the most commonly isolated pathogen in the African meningitis belt. However, outbreaks have also been caused by other _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, such as serogroup C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (14760584.5.3.319' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/ 14760584.5.3.319), and X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751). In March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://tinyurl.com/q3jm3jg), and other bacterial species such as, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ have also been implicated (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa (02): WHO meningitis region 20131028.2024307). However, we are not told what pathogen is causing the current outbreak in northwestern Uganda, although the news release above implies that it is the result of 'hosting refugees who fled from South Sudan due to the current instability.'\n\nIn May 2013, Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), in collaboration with the South Sudanese Ministry of Health, stemmed a meningococcal meningitis serogroup A outbreak and vaccinated against the disease over 130 000 people with the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in South Sudan's Upper Nile state (see http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/article.cfm?id=6802). Starting in October 2013, WHO expected that South Sudan would complete vaccinating its 5.6 million at risk population with meningitis conjugate vaccines in 3 phases by 2015 (http://www.emro.who.int/surveillance-forecasting-response/surveillance-events/meningitis-south-sudan.html).\n\nWHO reported (WHO Global Alert and Response, available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/index.html) that the number of cases reported from 1 Jan to 12 May 2013 (epidemiological week 19) was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa: WHO meningitis region 20130606.1759273).

UCSB scheduled vaccine clinics for 24 Feb-7 Mar 2014.\n\nIt [Bexsero] protects against meningitis [serogroup] B, a strain not included in the standard meningitis vaccine given to teenagers. More than 5200 students at Princeton University in New Jersey received the emergency vaccine in December [2013] after an outbreak of a slightly different strain of meningitis B there sickened 8 students associated with the school since March [2013].\n\nFour students at UCSB were sickened by a slightly different strain of meningitis B, including an 18-year-old freshman whose feet had to be amputated because of complications.\n\n'The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed the use of the serogroup B meningococcal vaccine for the UC Santa Barbara campus,' administration officials wrote in a letter to students. CDC recommends that all undergraduates get the vaccine, as well as faculty, staff, and graduate students who have certain specific medical conditions or who live in dormitories. 'The vaccine can be provided only to those recommended by the CDC, as described above. The specified groups were recommended by the CDC to receive the vaccine because young adults and people with certain medical conditions are at increased risk of getting meningococcal disease,' the letter reads.\n\nThe rare but dangerous infection kills one in 10 people who get it and leaves 20 percent of those who survive with serious disabilities.\n\nOfficials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at 1st that the outbreak at UCSB was different and that students there likely did not need the vaccine. Many outbreaks of meningitis B stop at 4 or fewer cases over a few weeks. The UCSB outbreak infected the 4 students within 3 weeks in November [2013].

All 4 students with meningococcal disease became ill within a 3-week time period of November 2013. One case has resulted in permanent disability.\n\nA number of steps have been taken to minimize the spread of the disease including:\n- Providing preventive antibiotics to more than 500 students who were identified as close contacts of the initial 3 ill students and close contacts of the fourth case have also been identified and have received antibiotics.\n- Providing information on meningococcal disease and strategies for prevention to all students, staff and faculty at UCSB.\n- Ongoing consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n- Providing information about the outbreak to healthcare providers across the state to raise awareness.\n\nNo currently available disease prevention and control strategies can ensure that no additional cases will occur as part of this outbreak. However, the PHD and UCSB are working jointly with the California Department of Public Health to implement a number of actions that have the potential to reduce the risk of future cases. Any possible impact of these actions to prevent additional cases is unknown.\n\nIn the setting of an ongoing outbreak of a serious disease, we believe that these actions are reasonable. While these actions may not prevent additional cases, we hope they may reduce the number of persons exposed to the outbreak strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ bacteria.\n\nTherefore, this week we will be:\n- Providing antibiotics to additional individuals who we believe may have already been exposed to the bacteria based on a scientific assessment of the social networks of existing cases. These students will be directed to obtain antibiotics at UCSB no later than Tuesday [3 Dec 2013] and will be directed to take the medication onsite.\n- Informing all students, staff, and faculty at UCSB about the importance of seeking medical care if they are ill (especially if they have signs and symptoms of meningococcal disease such as fever and headache) as timely treatment is very important to recovery. Even students who have been given preventive antibiotics can become ill depending on the timing of exposure; preventive antibiotics only offer protection for about one day, so students can become ill if exposed to the bacteria again in the future.\n- Informing all students, staff and faculty at UCSB of the importance of maintaining healthy personal habits during the normal stressful exam period (such as, good sleep, nutrition, and hygiene behaviors) and staying home when ill to minimize exposure to others.\n- Suspending specific social events on campus, that is, parties sponsored by Greek organizations, in an effort to interrupt transmission of the outbreak strain in social networks.\n\nThese actions are initiated with the goal of protecting health and preventing additional cases of meningococcal disease. They are important and compliance is greatly appreciated!\n\nIf there are any new developments with the meningococcal disease outbreak in our community, these will be communicated in a timely manner.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDSweet\n<donnaargus@yahoo.com>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Mon 2 Dec 2013\nSource: NBC News/Health [edited]\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/health/4th-meningitis-case-confirmed-calif-university-2D11685154\n\n\nParties and other social events may be curtailed at the University of California, Santa Barbara after a 4th case of meningitis was confirmed in a potentially deadly outbreak that has left one student permanently disabled.\n\nSanta Barbara County public health officials on Monday [2 Dec 2013] urged the school to suspend some campus events, including Greek fraternity and sorority parties, after an 18-year-old male student was diagnosed as the 4th case in a month.\n\nThree of the cases at UCSB have been caused by the B strain of meningitis bacteria, which is not covered by a US vaccine recommended for college students, officials said in a release. Officials are still waiting to confirm the strain in the latest case.\n\nThe infection kills at least 1 in 10 people who contract it and leaves about 20 percent of those who survive with permanent problems, including limb loss and mental retardation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health officials declined to say how the student in the UCSB outbreak had been disabled.\n\nAn outbreak of meningitis B across the country at Princeton University in New Jersey has been caused by the same strain, but with a different genetic fingerprint than the UCSB cases, CDC officials said.\n\nSanta Barbara health officials also warned that certain students who may have been exposed to infection will be directed to receive antibiotics to prevent illness no later than Tuesday [2 Dec 2013] -- and to take the medication onsite. More than 500 students considered to be close contacts of those who are ill have been given the drugs already, but preventive antibiotics may protect only for about one day and students who are exposed again can get sick, officials noted.\n\nThey're urging students to seek medical care at the 1st sign of symptoms, which can include fever, stiff neck and headache. 'In a setting of an ongoing outbreak of a serious disease, we believe that these actions are reasonable,' health officials said in a statement.\n\nUniversity officials said they weren't 'suspending' social gatherings, but were asking students to refrain from participating in 'social events that involve close personal contact, alcohol, and/or smoking and where eating utensils and cups/glasses may be shared.'\n\n'All the existing cases appear to have had close personal contact,' they added in an email to the campus community.\n\nAt Princeton, where 8 students associated with the New Jersey school have been sickened since March [2013], health officials are planning to start a mass vaccination on Monday [2 Dec 2013] with an imported vaccine that covers meningitis B. The vaccine, called Bexsero, is approved in Europe and Australia, but not in America.\n\nSo far, there are no plans to request a similar intervention in California, a CDC spokesman said, noting that that could change.\n\n'We are working in close collaboration with state and local health officials to monitor the outbreak at UCSB,' said Jason McDonald. 'And we are prepared to work with partners to make the serogroup B meningococcal vaccine available if the circumstances of this outbreak warrant its use.'\n\nEach outbreak requires individual consideration about the number of cases, the timing, and the characteristics of the bacteria that cause the outbreak, he added.\n\nBacterial meningitis is a dangerous infection of the protective membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges. It is spread through respiratory droplets or secretions exchanged through close contact such as coughing or kissing.\n\nTeens and young adults are especially vulnerable to the disease because they spend a lot of time together in close quarters such as dorms, coffee shops, and bars, with plenty of potential to swap germs. At any one time, 5 percent to 10 percent of the population may carry the bacteria in their throats, but only a small proportion develops infections. Exposure to smoke and getting a respiratory illness, like a cold, can increase the chance of infection, CDC says.\n\nCases have dropped sharply in the US in recent years, but between 800 and 1200 are typically reported annually. The worry is that between 10 percent and 12 percent of those who get the fast-moving infection die, and about 20 percent of those who recover can wind up with severe side effects including deafness, mental retardation, and limb amputations, according to the CDC.\n\nMeningitis vaccines licensed in the US cover only 4 strains that cause illness: A, C, Y, and W-135. Scientists have worked for decades to create a vaccine to prevent infection with the meningitis B strain.\n\nMeanwhile, a case of meningitis that sickened an employee at another New Jersey college, Monmouth University, was determined to be caused by the C strain of meningitis. That person remains hospitalized, but is recovering, a spokeswoman said.\n\n[Byline: JoNel Aleccia]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news releases above report one additional case, the 4th, of meningococcal meningitis in a 3-week period in a student at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus. Previous ProMED-mail posts reported that the 3 prior cases at UCSB were caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B, and that additional molecular typing showed that the UCSB outbreak was unrelated to an outbreak on the Princeton University campus that is also due to _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B.

No epidemiologic links have been identified between the Princeton University and the UCSB cases.\n\nAlthough both outbreaks are caused by serogroup B, additional molecular typing shows that the outbreaks are being caused by 2 different strains, indicating that the outbreaks are not related.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH), Princeton University officials, and local health authorities have been working closely together since the 1st case of meningococcal disease associated with Princeton University was reported in March 2013. CDC, the California Department of Public Health, UCSB officials, and local health authorities have also been working closely together since the 1st case of meningococcal disease associated with UCSB was reported in November 2013.\n\nClinical recommendations\n------------------------\nIncreased awareness of meningococcal disease and prompt early case recognition among healthcare providers is critical. If a Princeton University or UCSB student, or a person who has had close contact with someone from those university communities develops a fever and headache or rash, meningococcal disease should be suspected; empiric treatment should be considered; blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures should be collected; and suspected cases should be reported to the local health department.\n\nIf there is a high degree of clinical suspicion for meningococcal disease, but CSF or blood specimens are sterile, CDC recommends sending specimens to the Meningitis Laboratory at CDC for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The CDC considers the risk of transmission of these strains beyond the university communities to be low. However, to monitor potential transmission of these strains, CDC is requesting that health departments send all isolates, whether or not they are linked to these universities, from serogroup B meningococcal disease cases occurring during 1 Nov 2013, through 31 Dec 2013, to the Meningitis Laboratory at CDC for further molecular testing. Please contact the Meningitis and Vaccine Preventable Diseases Branch at <meningnet@cdc.gov> to arrange shipment of isolates.\n\nCDC does not recommend a change in normal activity to avoid contact with the affected universities or their students. Good hygiene practices such as hand washing, and coughing or sneezing into the arm are recommended. The licensed quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines are recommended for all adolescents 11 through 18 years old and 1st year college students living in residence halls, but these vaccines do not protect against serogroup B, the serogroup that is causing the Princeton University and UCSB cases. A serogroup B meningococcal vaccine, which is only licensed for use in Europe and Australia, will be offered at Princeton University. FDA has allowed the use of the vaccine at Princeton University under an Investigational New Drug application.\n\nAll suspect cases of invasive meningococcal disease associated with the 2 universities should be reported as follows:\n\n- cases associated with Princeton University should be reported to Denise Garon, NJDOH, at (609)826-5964 or <Denise.Garon@doh.state.nj.us>.\n\n- cases associated with UCSB should be reported to Kathleen Harriman, CDPH, at\n(651)699-2970 or <kathleen.harriman@cdph.ca.gov>.\n\nGuidance on recommendations for prophylactic use of antibiotics in close contacts of persons with meningococcal disease is available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a2.htm?s_cid=rr6202a2_w.\n\nMore information can be obtained from\n- your local and state health departments\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/index.html http://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/vaccine-serogroupB.html.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nJulie H Levison, MD\nMassachusetts General Hospital\nDivision of Infectious Diseases\nBoston, MA\nUSA\n<JLevison@partners.org>\n\n[The CDC Health Advisory above says that, although both the Princeton University outbreak of meningococcal disease (8 cases) and the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) outbreak (3 cases) are caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B, additional molecular typing shows that these 2 outbreaks are caused by 2 different serogroup B strains, indicating that the outbreaks are not related.

Officials at the New Jersey school could not provide the current health status of the student.\n\nThe latest case comes shortly after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed the university to use an imported vaccine to help control the disease's spread. The past cases at the Ivy League school were caused by the meningococcal bacteria known as serogroup B. State law requires all Princeton students living in dormitories to receive a meningitis vaccine that protects against most strains but not the serogroup B variety, Princeton spokesman Martin Mbugua said in an email.\n\nThe outbreak of serogroup B meningitis is rare but not the 1st of its kind in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC].\n\nBexsero, made by Swiss drug maker Novartis AG, will be provided to all undergraduate students, graduate students who live in university housing on or off campus, and students and faculty with certain illnesses, such as sickle cell disease, Princeton officials said earlier this week.

'Everyone involved is working hard to organize a potential serogroup B meningococcal disease vaccine campaign as quickly as possible that fits into Princeton University's academic calendar,' said CDC spokeswoman Sharon Hoskins. The Princeton inoculation campaign is set to be voluntary for students and is expected to begin in early December 2013, with another event in February 2014, according to the school's website.\n\nFederal and New Jersey state health officials have not advised visitors or students to avoid the campus, Mbugua said. Meningitis is a serious disease that is spread through coughing and exchanges of saliva, and people living in dormitories or other crowded living quarters are especially at risk. The most severe cases can result in death, hearing loss, brain damage, kidney disease, or amputation of limbs. Symptoms include fever, headaches and stiff neck.\n\n[Byline: Eduardo Munoz, Curtis Skinner; Edith Honan, Matthew Lewis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 22 Nov 2013\nSource: CBC New York [edited]\n<newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/11/22/8th-case-of-meningitis-confirmed-at-princeton-university/#comments>\n\n\nAnother case of meningitis has been confirmed at Princeton University, bringing the total number of cases to 8 this year [2013].

Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, rash, increased sensitivity to light, confusion, body aches, joint pain, nausea and vomiting, and the disease can even prove life-threatening. Meningitis is an inflammation of protective membranes located on the brain and spinal cord, while meningococcemia is an infection of the blood.\n\nA 1st-year student, who was the first to contract meningococcal disease and meningitis, was taken to the hospital last Tuesday [12 Nov 2013], according to Student Health executive director Mary Ferris. Currently at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, the student is in critical condition due to severe sepsis, or blood poisoning, according to updates from CaringBridge.org, a non-profit organization that offers updates on the condition of hospital patients. According to the site, the student's blood is thin, his circulation is poor, and he may need to be put on dialysis to improve his kidney function.\n\n'I just want to express our extreme sympathy for the family and for students that... have this illness,' Ferris said. 'We really hope they recover. They're both being well-cared for in the hospital.'\n\nAccording to Ferris, the diagnosis of a 2nd student sparked widespread concern from students and their parents, especially in light of the UCSB student's critical condition and a recent meningitis outbreak at Princeton University [New Jersey].\n\n'[At UCSB] it's not an outbreak...but it is significant just because it is such a bad disease,' Ferris said. 'It does happen every couple years that we'll get one case, and there's a lot more attention to it because of the national interest about meningitis too.'\n\nA 1st year pre-biology major said she is concerned students living in residence halls have a greater chance of contracting the disease. 'We live in such close quarters so we are constantly in contact with everyone,' she said. 'Most people end up just sharing a water bottle or whatever, and so it's really easy to spread.' However, a 3rd-year resident assistant for Santa Catalina [UCSB's largest residence hall] said he does not think students living in residence halls are at increased risk for contracting the disease, because other students come in contact with each other just as much [as] freshmen in the dorms do. 'I don't really think the residence halls would hurt your chances in any way,' he said. 'I think that it's as dangerous as just being in school here because the close quarters are equal to that of just being in classes with people.'\n\nAccording to Ferris, the infection is not unique to the residence halls, as locations where the disease usually surface are 'common' places with a great density of people. 'Whenever people are living in close conditions, there's more chance of a spread of this infection,' Ferris said, 'So that would be true if you were an army recruit, or [if] you went to a convention where there were a lot of people in the same room for a long time.'\n\nFrequent handwashing and overall good hygiene can help to prevent the spread of the disease, as well as abstaining from sharing water bottles, drinking glasses, eating utensils, and cosmetics, according to Ferris. She also said meningitis occurs most frequently amongst young freshmen or college students because the bacterium attacks young, healthy people.\n\n'The fact that you're a young healthy person living in close quarters with everyone else increases your risk,' Ferris said, 'But you can really decrease that risk by getting that meningitis shot.'\n\nStudent Health will offer a meningitis vaccine on a walk-in basis on Tuesdays from 9 to 11 a.m. and Fridays from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. The UCEN [University Center] will also offer shots next Tuesday [26 Nov 2013] from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The vaccination is recommended for all students ages 16 and up.\n\n[byline: Hannah Nelson]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] California (Santa Barbara)\nDate: Thu 21 Nov 2013\nSource: The Daily Nexus [edited]\nhttp://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/officials-warn-of-third-possible-case/\n\n\nA 3rd case of meningococcal disease -- which causes the highly contagious and deadly illness meningitis -- at UCSB has been identified by Santa Barbara public health officials.\n\nWhile Student Health officials say the newest case has been identified, confirmation of meningitis in this 3rd case is still 'pending'. 2 UCSB students were diagnosed with the illness in the past week, with one student in critical condition. Both of these cases have the type B [serogroup] of the disease, which is 'not included in the vaccine,' according to Student Health's website.\n\nStudent Health director Mary Ferris said there has been no quarantine of the disease and no restrictions have been placed on normal campus activity.\n\n'All close contacts of the meningitis cases are being offered treatment, and Public Health has made no recommendation to cancel any activities or scheduled events on campus,' Ferris said.\n\nPublic Health and UCSB officials will host a press conference to discuss preventative measures being taken to halt spread of disease.

Last week [week of 12 Nov 2013], 2 male students fell ill. None of the cases have been fatal.\n\n'We've been on high alert,' said Mary Ferris, executive director of student health services.\n\nMeningitis can be spread through kissing, coughing, or prolonged contact. Symptoms can include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nPublic health and school officials urged people on campus to watch out for signs of meningitis and to practice good hygiene such as covering their mouths when coughing.\n\nWhile the Santa Barbara cases involved the type B meningococcal bacteria -- the same type that sickened 7 people at Princeton University in New Jersey -- health officials said there's no link between the outbreaks.\n\nPrinceton earlier this week decided to make available a meningitis vaccine that hasn't been approved in the US. Doses of the vaccine for the type B meningococcal bacteria will be available next month [December 2013] for students who live in dorms.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] New Jersey (Princeton)\nDate: Tue 19 Nov 2013\nSource: Bloomberg [edited]\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-18/princeton-to-offer-meningitis-b-vaccine-after-new-case-reported.html\n\n\nPrinceton University will offer students, pending federal approval, a meningitis vaccine not currently available in the US, after a 7th case was reported this year [2013] on the Ivy League campus. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is preparing to recommend that all undergraduate students, as well as graduate students living in dormitories, get the vaccine, the Princeton, New Jersey-based college said yesterday [18 Nov 2913] in a statement. Costs would be covered for students who receive the vaccine, it said.\n\nBy early May [2013], 3 Princeton University students were diagnosed with meningitis, spread through kissing, sharing drinking glasses, and other forms of close contact.\n\n'[Princeton] University is prepared to accept these recommendations and make arrangements to provide access to this vaccine as soon as possible,' Princeton said. All 7 cases -- 6 students and one campus visitor -- developed infections with meningococcus [serogroup] B. Because the strain of the bacteria isn't covered by vaccines available in the US, federal health officials approved importation of the immunization Bexsero, made by Novartis AG. Princeton expects to make the 1st of 2 doses of the vaccine available in early December [2013]. The 2nd dose would come in February [2014], according to the statement. 2 doses are required for maximum protection, the school said.\n\nNot everyone gets sick from the bacteria, which may be carried by as much as 10 per cent of the Princeton population, said Andrin Oswald, head of Novartis vaccines and diagnostics, in a phone interview from Basel, Switzerland. The number of cases is occurring in about 1 out of 1000 students there. That's significantly higher than most other vaccine-preventable diseases, and 100 times the 1 to 2 in 100 000 seen with other forms of meningitis, he said.\n\nThe university has been working with CDC and the New Jersey Department of Health since the 1st case was reported in March [2013, after spring break]. The CDC requested and received permission last week [week of 12 Nov 2013] from the Food and Drug Administration to bring in the vaccine, Barbara Reynolds, a CDC spokeswoman, said [16 Nov 2013] in a telephone interview.\n\nThe outer coating of the [serogroup B] bacterium is similar to something found naturally in the body, making it harder to attack, Oswald at Novartis said. Bexsero, the 1st vaccine against the strain, is based on a protein found on the surface of about 80 per cent of the circulating B strains, including the one found in Princeton, Oswald said. Meningococcus B accounts for 40 per cent of cases in the US and as much as 80 per cent in Australia and parts of Europe. Bexsero was cleared for sale in Europe in January [2013] and in Australia in August [2013]. The vaccine hasn't been available in the US because drug companies and regulators couldn't agree on how to measure the efficacy of the injection, Oswald said. 'In many geographies [serogroup] B has become the dominant strain because we could vaccinate against the other types of meningitis,' Oswald said.\n\nTo obtain the immunization for Princeton, CDC asked the FDA to grant the vaccine investigational new drug status, typically used to begin a clinical trial, Oswald said. CDC would need to oversee the use of the immunization since the company doesn't have an actual study under way, he said.\n\nBy early May [2013], 3 [Princeton] students had been diagnosed. The most recent patient developed symptoms 8 months later on 8 Nov 2013.\n\nNovartis, Sanofi, and GlaxoSmithKline Plc all make shots available in Europe and the US that protect against 4 of the 5 major [serogroups] of the disease, not including the B [serogroup]. Pfizer Inc, the New York-based drugmaker, has a vaccine for meningitis B that has begun the final stage of development.\n\n[byline: Janet Lorin, Michelle Fay Cortez, Lisa Wolfson]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 1st 3 news reports above describe another outbreak of meningococcal meningitis serogroup B that is occurring at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus. Please see the recent ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (03): (NJ) college, sg. B, new vaccine 20131117.\n\nUCSB is a public research university that is part of the University of California system located 8 miles (13 km) from Santa Barbara and 100 miles (160 km) northwest of Los Angeles, with almost 19 000 undergraduates (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara#Housing). There are 8 residence halls, 5 located on the east side of the main campus, 2 on the west side of the main campus, and 1 located near the entrance to the west campus. There is in addition private housing, as well as housing in sorority and fraternity houses. Where the 3 ill UCSB students lived or socialized is not stated in the news reports above.\n\nAn outbreak of meningococcal disease is defined as the occurrence of 3 or more confirmed or probable cases during a period of less than or equal to 3 months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate of at least 10 cases per 100 000 population, which is about 10 times greater than the normal occurrence (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).\n\nChemoprophylaxis is given to close contacts whose risk for acquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among the total population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). Effective antibiotic regimens for adults include: rifampin 600 mg orally twice daily for 2 days; ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally as a single dose; and ceftriaxone 250 mg as a single intramuscular injection.\n\nClose contacts of patients are household members, day care center contacts, and persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to people who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _Neisseria meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.\n\nIn addition, the new reports above say that University of California Santa Barbara students are being encouraged to be vaccinated against this disease, but does not say which type of meningococcal vaccine is being offered. A quadrivalent serogroup A, C, Y, and W-135 conjugate meningococcal vaccine is not effective against _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B, only the Bexsero serogroup B meningococcal vaccine would be expected to be effective in the face of a serogroup B outbreak. Princeton University, which is also experiencing a serogroup B outbreak, is expected to use the Bexsero vaccine that is not currently available in the US. Whether the UCSB and Princeton University outbreaks are related to each other could be resolved if the genotypes of the strains of _N. meningitidis_ from the 2 outbreaks were compared.\n\nFor further discussion of invasive meningococcal disease on a college campus, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail postings Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (PA) 20090218.0674 and Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (03): (NJ) college, sg.

A 1st-year student, who was the first to contract meningococcal disease and meningitis, was taken to the hospital last Tuesday [12 Nov 2013], according to Student Health executive director Mary Ferris. \n\nChemoprophylaxis is given to close contacts whose risk for acquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among the total population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). \n\nMeningococcal disease is transmitted through contact with another individual's respiratory and throat secretions, such as through activities like kissing and even just living in close quarters. \n\nStudent Health will offer a meningitis vaccine on a walk-in basis on Tuesdays from 9 to 11 a.m. and Fridays from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. Over 300 students who had close contact with the ill students were given antibiotics, said Charity Thoman, deputy health officer at the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. \n\nThe latest case involved a female student who was diagnosed with meningococcal disease earlier this week. \n\nPublic health and school officials urged people on campus to watch out for signs of meningitis and to practice good hygiene such as covering their mouths when coughing. By early May [2013], 3 Princeton University students were diagnosed with meningitis, spread through kissing, sharing drinking glasses, and other forms of close contact. \n\nTo obtain the immunization for Princeton, CDC asked the FDA to grant the vaccine investigational new drug status, typically used to begin a clinical trial, Oswald said. \n\nWhile Student Health officials say the newest case has been identified, confirmation of meningitis in this 3rd case is still 'pending'. \n\n'I just want to express our extreme sympathy for the family and for students that... have this illness,' Ferris said. [week of 12 Nov 2013] from the Food and Drug Administration to bring in the vaccine, Barbara Reynolds, a CDC spokeswoman, said [16 Nov 2013] in a telephone interview. \n\nPrinceton earlier this week decided to make available a meningitis vaccine that hasn't been approved in the US. \n\n'[Princeton] University is prepared to accept these recommendations and make arrangements to provide access to this vaccine as soon as possible,' Princeton said. That's significantly higher than most other vaccine-preventable diseases, and 100 times the 1 to 2 in 100 000 seen with other forms of meningitis, he said. \n\n'We've been on high alert,' said Mary Ferris, executive director of student health services. \n\nFrequent handwashing and overall good hygiene can help to prevent the spread of the disease, as well as abstaining from sharing water bottles, drinking glasses, eating utensils, and cosmetics, according to Ferris. In addition, the new reports above say that University of California Santa Barbara students are being encouraged to be vaccinated against this disease, but does not say which type of meningococcal vaccine is being offered. She also said meningitis occurs most frequently amongst young freshmen or college students because the bacterium attacks young, healthy people. \n\nNovartis, Sanofi, and GlaxoSmithKline Plc all make shots available in Europe and the US that protect against 4 of the 5 major [serogroups] of the disease, not including the B [serogroup]. \n\nPublic Health and UCSB officials will host a press conference to discuss preventative measures being taken to halt spread of disease.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-08-26 00:00:00", "2021-04-01 00:00:00", "2021-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-02-26 00:00:00", "2013-03-26 00:00:00", "2013-12-26 00:00:00", "2021-01-26 00:00:00", "2013-11-17 00:00:00", "2021-01-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2014-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "CALIFORNIA", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Basel", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Jersey", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Los Angeles", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Santa Barbara", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Santa Catalina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "UCSB", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Princeton", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW JERSEY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Switzerland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2024307", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa (02): WHO meningitis region", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2024307", "date": "2013-10-28 10:17:17", "main_text": "MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - AFRICA (02): WHO MENINGITIS REGION\n**************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 25 Oct 2013\nSource: The Global Dispatch [edited]\nhttp://www.theglobaldispatch.com/africa-meningitis-deaths-near-1500-for-first-nine-months-of-2013-29020/\n\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa recently released its updated Meningitis Weekly [2-29 Sep 2013] Bulletin [http://www.meningvax.org/files/BulletinMeningite2013_S36_39September.pdf], which shows the number of cases and fatalities from meningitis in 19 countries from the 'African Meningitis Belt' and it shows that for the 1st 39 weeks [as of 29 Sep 2013] there were 16 385 cases including 1460 deaths.

However, outbreaks have also been caused by other _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, such as serogroup C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (14760584.5.3.319' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/ 14760584.5.3.319), and X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751), and in March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/3581-ethiopia-suspected-meningitis-outbreak-situation-as-of-08-march-2012-.html).\n\nWHO recently reported (WHO Global Alert and Response, available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/index.html) that the number of cases reported from 1 Jan to 12 May 2013 (epidemiological week 19) is the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa: WHO meningitis region 20130606.1759273). The decrease in number of cases of meningitis was thought to be due to the progressive introduction of the newly developed meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt since 2010. A preventive strategy based on conjugate vaccines could have a significantly larger and more enduring impact on attempts to control the yearly recurrences of this disease in Africa that causes considerable morbidity and mortality, especially among children (see http://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/19745499/102). The meningococcal protein conjugate polysaccharide vaccines induce a T-cell-dependent response, resulting in an improved immune response in infants, provide long-lasting immunity, and prevent nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_, thus reducing transmission of this microorganism from person to person (see http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf).\n\nAccording to the WHO Meningitis Weekly Bulletin referred to above (Table 3, http://www.meningvax.org/files/BulletinMeningite2013_S36_39September.pdf), a bacterial pathogen was identified (by PCR, latex agglutination, or culture) in 802 out of 4209 (19 percent) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens that were obtained in the 16 385 (25.7 percent) meningitis cases. Of the bacterial pathogens identified, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ was the most frequent (404 cases), followed by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135 (229 cases). _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was identified in only 22 cases.\n\nNo bacterial pathogen was identified in almost 80 percent of the CSF specimens (3350 of the 4209). Presumably meningitis in these cases with CSF negative by PCR, latex agglutination, and culture was caused most commonly by viruses. In 57 CSF samples a contaminant was said to have been identified.\n\nIn Burkina Faso (BF), a CSF specimen was obtained in 1104 of 2409 cases (45.8 percent), but in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), in only 289 of 7880 (3.7 percent) cases.

The CDC has been working with the Food and Drug Administration about gaining access to this particular vaccine, CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds told CNN. 'We just got the approval from FDA this week to import the vaccine under the Investigational New Drug Application program,' Reynolds said, 'Now we're consulting with the Princeton University officials and New Jersey Health Department officials about the next step.'\n\nMeningococcal meningitis is caused by a bacteria called _N. meningitidis_ that can infect the lining of the brain and spinal cord.

'What's a little different now is this is the 1st time we've had an outbreak and also have had the possibility of using a vaccine that could protect against it,' she said.\n\nThe university's trustees are meeting this weekend to discuss the outbreak. Mbugua would not talk about the nature of those discussions or what day they would be held. 'I will not pre-empt the trustees' discussion by talking about it beforehand,' he said.\n\nReynolds said she did not have a timetable for how quickly the vaccine could be available. Its use would be optional for students at Princeton, she said. The most recent case at the school was diagnosed last Sunday, Mbugua said. Six of those affected are students, and one was a visitor, he said.\n\nThe student who most recently became ill remains hospitalized, according to the New Jersey Department of Health. Five other students have recovered, and the visitor's case is being followed by another state health department. The 1st case was reported in March 2013.\n\nMeningitis is a serious disease that is spread through coughing and exchanges of saliva, and people living in dormitories or other crowded living quarters are especially at risk. There is a vaccine available in the United States for other strains of the disease, Reynolds said. The CDC recommends the vaccine for children and students before they head off to college.\n\nBacterial meningitis can cause the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell. The most severe cases can result in death, hearing loss, brain damage, kidney disease or require the amputation of limbs. Symptoms include fever, headaches and stiff neck.\n\n[Byline: Noreen O'Donnell, Colleen Jenkins, Eric Beech]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of invasive meningococcal disease on a college campus, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (PA) 20090218.0674.\n\nThe annual incidence has been 0.3-1.1 per 100 000 persons, or approximately 1400 to 2800 cases, which usually occur as either sporadic cases or at times as outbreaks, usually in closed communities (e.g., college students living in dormitories, particularly freshman, and new military recruits). The highest incidence of meningococcal disease occurs in infants, with a secondary peak in adolescents.\n\n13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease, have been identified based on the bacterial outer polysaccharide capsule, of which 5 serogroups, A, B, C, W-135, and Y, cause the majority of meningococcal disease globally. In the United States, the majority of invasive meningococcal disease is caused by serogroups B, C, W-135, and Y. However, serogroup B accounts for approximately 1/3rd of all invasive meningococcal infections and about half of invasive infections in infants.\n\nThe CDC recommends the meningococcal conjugate vaccination for college students and any persons aged 11 to 18 years, military recruits, microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of _N. meningitidis_, persons who travel to Mecca during the annual Hajj or to countries in which _N. meningitidis_ is hyper-endemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local population will be prolonged, persons who have terminal complement component deficiencies, and persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia [without normal spleen function] (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559807 and http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm). Also, in an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the outbreak as soon as possible after an outbreak has been declared http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm.\n\nAlthough there are several vaccines based on the meningococcal capsular polysaccharide that cover serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, there has been no licensed serogroup B vaccine in the U.S. Because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen, group B vaccines cannot be based on capsular polysaccharide. Vaccines that use outer membrane vesicle protein from an outbreak strain have been used successfully in New Zealand and Cuba to control epidemics in those countries caused by the targeted serogroup B strain, but these vaccines do not cover other strains of serogroup B organisms.\n\nThe Novartis Bexsero vaccine contains 4 antigenic components: Factor H Binding Protein (fHbp), Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), Neisserial Adhesin A (NadA), and the outer membrane vesicle protein that is in the New Zealand MenB Vaccine (MenZB) derived from the New Zealand outbreak strain of MenB (strain NZ 98/254) (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine). The NZ98/254 component, which contains PorA serosubtype 1.4, was effective in a strain-specific outbreak in New Zealand. The Bexsero vaccine contains surface proteins that occur across most serogroup B strains and elicits bactericidal antibodies that can confer protective immune responses (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/10/19/1013758107.full.pdf). Bexsero is the 1st and only broad coverage vaccine to help protect all age groups against serogroup B disease, including infants who are at the greatest risk of infection (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and, Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).\n\nThe Bexsero vaccine side effects may include soreness at the injection site, and sometimes fever, lack of appetite, muscle aches, irritability and rashes. Almost 8000 people, including more than 5000 infants and toddlers, have had the new vaccine during clinical trials, and the side effects are said to be the usual ones expected with any of the current childhood vaccines (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine and http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine#sthash.GLMd4xiU.dpuf).\n\nPrinceton University is a private university ranked either 1st or 2nd among national universities by U.S. News & World Report from 2001 to 2013, with a highly selective undergraduate program, located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.

In early June 2013, due to an outbreak of meningitis, more than 100 children in Rostov-on-Don were admitted to the hospital.\n\nDuring a press conference, Professor of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology of MSMSU [Moscow State Medico-Stomatological University] Yuri Vengerov spoke about the disease, its symptoms and methods of treatment. He said that 'meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, which is caused by many different organisms. And very much depends both on the pathogen and on the form of meningitis. In particular, enteroviral meningitis -- caused by an enterovirus or [other] intestinal viruses -- is included in the number of benign meningitis cases, which rarely provide any complications or adverse effects.\n\nThe name enterovirus, or intestinal virus, suggests that it is an intestinal infection, but the virus is capable of getting from the digestive tract through the bloodstream into the brain causing inflammation, i.e. meningitis. As with other intestinal infections, the spread of enteroviral meningitis occurs in the summer, and the incidence is related to the consumption of untreated water, not washing fruits, and bathing in polluted water. Meningitis may also be transmitted via droplets, i.e. close contact. Patients may be [infected] in this way and can infect each other.\n\nThe basis for the diagnosis of meningitis is fever followed by severe headache of unusual intensity. It is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. These symptoms, fever and headache with vomiting, are an indication for emergency hospitalization. Severe forms, which can be fatal, are very rare in the case of enteroviral meningitis.\n\nPanic associated with an outbreak in Rostov ensued following diagnosis of a single case of pneumococcal meningitis. This is a severe form of meningitis which often leads to death. This was not divulged [by authorities] and was perceived to be part of the same epidemic. In fact, these are completely different diseases.\n\nMost enteroviral meningitis cases used to be in the Far East. There, the Amur river [the longest river in the world] and its tributaries arising in China carry untreated waste water contaminated by enteroviruses downstream. Every summer, there are up to several hundred cases. Now, it has spread to the Ural Mountains and along the coast of the Black Sea.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In Russian language reports, the term meningitis usually implies aseptic (serous) meningitis. During the past few weeks, there have been numerous reports of outbreaks of meningitis throughout Russia reported in ProMED-RUS and elsewhere. These are almost invariably outbreaks of serous meningitis and not the more dangerous meningoencephalitis. Outbreaks of serous meningitis occur habitually in the summer months.\n\nThe word 'meningitis' means an inflammation of the meninges, which are the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. These tissues can be damaged by bacteria, viruses, fungi, cancers, and even some anti-inflammatory medications. Meningitis caused by bacteria is called septic meningitis. This is a medical emergency and calls for immediate treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Fortunately, this type of meningitis is less common than aseptic meningitis. Most of the time, aseptic meningitis is not life threatening. If the brain tissues also become inflamed (encephalitis), the situation is more serious. The classic findings of meningitis are fever, a stiff neck, and headache. Other signs include nausea, vomiting and worsening of headache and photophobia. Children who are old enough to talk may complain of headache or nausea.\n\nThe most common cause of aseptic meningitis is a viral infection. In fact, sometimes the terms aseptic meningitis and viral meningitis are used interchangeably, although in actuality, other things like an allergic reaction can also cause aseptic meningitis. The viruses that usually cause meningitis in children include the enteroviruses. Enteroviruses cause about 90 percent of all viral meningitis cases. This family of viruses usually causes a rash, nausea, vomiting, and some respiratory symptoms as well as muscle aches (myalgias). The most common symptoms, however, are just irritability, fever, and rash. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1MnT.]", "summary": "In fact, sometimes the terms aseptic meningitis and viral meningitis are used interchangeably, although in actuality, other things like an allergic reaction can also cause aseptic meningitis.

The number of cases reported so far are the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years.\n\nOutbreaks of meningococcal disease have been confirmed in Guinea and South Sudan, where 404 suspected cases (38 deaths) and 196 suspected cases (13 deaths) have respectively been notified.\n\nIn Guinea, a small outbreak at the sub-district level was reported in Siguiri district, predominantly due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W135 (Nm W135). Upon request from the Ministry of Health of Guinea, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control released 63 075 doses of ACW polysaccharide vaccines. A reactive vaccination campaign targeting the affected population was conducted by the Ministry of Health from 2-7 May 2013.\n\nIn South Sudan, an outbreak of _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A (Nm A) was confirmed in Malakal County in the Upper Nile state. The ICG released 198 770 doses of meningococcal A conjugate vaccine to implement a reactive vaccination campaign from 15-24 May 2013, which was led by the Ministry of Health of South Sudan with the support of WHO and partners.\n\nAdditionally, outbreaks of meningitis were reported in Benin (one district), Burkina Faso (one district), and Nigeria (3 districts). These outbreaks were of short duration, and the predominance of the Nm bacteria was not confirmed. The ministries of health of affected areas implemented a series of preventive and control measures, which include reinforcement of surveillance, case management, and sensitization of the population.\n\nThe decrease in the number of cases of meningitis reported during the period under review is thought to be due to the progressive introduction of the newly developed meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt since 2010. The introduction of this 1st meningococcal vaccine available for preventive purposes in Africa has enabled the immunization of over 100 million people from 10 countries [1] in the meningitis belt in the past 3 years (2010-2012). The reduced case load and epidemic activity observed this year [2013] adds to the evidence on the impact of the introduction of this vaccine, which is expected to eliminate epidemics of Nm A, which is the predominant cause of the disease in Africa. Given that large-scale epidemics in the African meningitis belt appear to occur in waves of 4 to 10 years, close surveillance for meningitis remains essential.\n\nMeningitis outbreaks are detected as part of the enhanced meningitis surveillance system introduced in 2002, whereby participating countries collect and send weekly, district level data to the WHO African Regional Office Inter-Country support team of Ouagadougou, which compiles and disseminates this data through a weekly regional bulletin. This allows for timely detection of outbreaks at the district level as well as monitoring of the situation at a regional level, enabling the identification of cross border, multi-country epidemics and a coordinated response.\n\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation closely, in collaboration with partners and ministries of health in the affected countries.\n\n[1.] Burkina Faso (2010), Mali (2010-2011), Niger (2010-2011), Cameroon (2011-2012), Chad (2011-2012), Nigeria (2011-), Ghana (2012), Benin (2012), Senegal (2012), Sudan (2012-).

A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at http://www.medic8.com/images/map4-9.gif.\n\nAt least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described: 5 serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W-135) most commonly cause human disease. Although serogroup C accounts for most US outbreaks (Woods CW, Rosenstein NE, Perkins BA: _Neisseria meningitidis_ outbreaks in the United States 1994-1997 (Abstract). In: Proceedings of Annual Meeting of IDSA. 12-15 Nov 1998. Denver, Colorado. Alexandria (VA): Infectious Disease Society of America; 1998), serogroup A is most commonly associated with meningitis in the African meningitis belt. However, outbreaks have also been caused by serogroups C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (14760584.5.3.319' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/ 14760584.5.3.319), and X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751), and in March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/3581-ethiopia-suspected-meningitis-outbreak-situation-as-of-08-march-2012-.html).\n\nTo control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/).\n\nCapsular polysaccharide or protein conjugate vaccines are available to immunize against disease caused by serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y. However, no similar vaccine is available against disease caused by serogroup B or X strains. A new protein-based, 4-component meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine has been developed that is hoped will be a broad-spectrum B vaccine (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).\n\nThe meningococcal protein conjugate polysaccharide vaccines induce a T-cell-dependent response, resulting in an improved immune response in infants, provide long-lasting immunity, and prevent nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_, thus reducing transmission of this microorganism person-to-person (see http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf). A preventive strategy based on conjugate vaccines could have a significantly larger and more enduring impact on attempts to control the yearly recurrences of this disease in Africa that causes considerable morbidity and mortality, especially among children (see http://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/19745499/102).\n\nBecause meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains, laboratory confirmation of the serogroup causing an outbreak is important so that the appropriate vaccine is used. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1IeR.]", "summary": "\n\nBecause meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains, laboratory confirmation of the serogroup causing an outbreak is important so that the appropriate vaccine is used. \n\nMeningitis outbreaks are detected as part of the enhanced meningitis surveillance system introduced in 2002, whereby participating countries collect and send weekly, district level data to the WHO African Regional Office Inter-Country support team of Ouagadougou, which compiles and disseminates this data through a weekly regional bulletin.

Meanwhile, the health ministry said it had undertaken several activities to contain the disease outbreak. These included: reactivation of national and state epidemic task forces to coordinate the intervention response; heightening of surveillance at facility and community levels; enhancement of case management and laboratory capacity through training and deployment of technical officers from Juba [the capital of South Sudan]; the provision of drugs and laboratory supplies and their transport to Malakal; and planning with health partners to conduct a mass meningitis vaccination campaign targeting over 260 000 people living in Malakal county and surrounding payams [districts].\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 2 May 2013\nSource: Voice of America News [edited]\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/meningitis-kills-infects-dozens-south-sudan/1653653.html\n\n\nAn outbreak of meningococcal meningitis has claimed 2 lives and infected dozens of people in Upper Nile State in South Sudan, health officials said on Thursday [2 May 2013], warning that the number of new cases was still rising.\n\n'In week 15, there were 3 cases; in week 16, there were 19, and this week there are already 16 cases,' Dr John Lagu, the director of emergency preparedness at the Ministry of Health, said, adding that 2 patients have died of the disease.\n\nMeningococcal meningitis is caused by bacteria that affect the brain and spinal cord. The infection causes high fever, confusion, headache, and vomiting. Untreated, the illness can kill in 24 to 48 hours. The disease is contagious and spreads particularly quickly among people in close contact. Avoiding contact with an infected person is not always easy because some people show no symptoms of the disease even when they are infected and also because of the difficulty of keeping people isolated, Lagu said.\n\n'Mass gatherings are discouraged but, of course, you cannot discourage them 100 per cent because people have to go on with their daily lives, to buy things,' he said. To try to prevent the disease spreading further, South Sudanese health authorities plan to conduct a vaccination campaign, focused on the area in and around Malakal.\n\nA meningitis vaccine that costs USD 0.50 cents a dose and can be transported and stored for as long as 4 days without refrigeration or an icepack is available in Africa and has already had a dramatic impact in fighting the disease in the parts of Burkina Faso and Chad where it has been administered.\n\nSouth Sudan lies in the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa, which stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east, and has the highest rates of the disease in the world. In 2009, 14 African countries reported 5532 deaths from meningitis, the highest toll since an epidemic in 1996 claimed more than 10 000 lives.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[South Sudan is one of the countries in the African 'meningitis belt' that stretches from Senegal in West Africa to the Horn of Africa in the east. This region is plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm). The meningitis outbreaks occur in the dry season (December to April) and end at the onset of the rainy season (from May to June). Larger outbreaks occur every 8-12 years (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis range from 100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as high as 1000 per 100 000 (World Health Organization (WHO): Meningococcal meningitis fact sheet: http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/FactSheet-Meningitis.pdf).\n\nThere are at least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of meningococcal meningitis, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135.\n\nThe serogroup most commonly associated with the African meningitis belt is A. However, outbreaks have also been caused by serogroups C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (14760584.5.3.319' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/ 14760584.5.3.319), and X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751 ). In March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/3581-ethiopia-suspected-meningitis-outbreak-situation-as-of-08-march-2012-.html). The 1st news report above says that the current outbreak in South Sudan is due to serogroup A.\n\nTo control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). While effective capsular polysaccharides-based vaccines exist against serogroups A, C, W135, and Y, no similar vaccine is available against disease caused by serogroup B or X strains. A new protein-based, 4-component meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine has been developed that is hoped will be a broad-spectrum B vaccine (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).\n\nBecause meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains, laboratory confirmation of the serogroup causing an outbreak is important so that the appropriate vaccine is used.\n\nSouth Sudan became an independent country on 9 Jul 2011.

A few weeks ago, on 8 May [2013] the 2 young men had been out with friends in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and visited a gay club. Two days later, both felt sick. One suffered from nausea, vomiting, and a stiff neck. A little later, he was admitted to the hospital and remains in a coma. The other went to work; in the evening, he met friends, but he felt worse. Two days later, he died in his apartment. A bacterium called _Neisseria meningitidis_ was isolated from both men.\n\nMany people may carry these bacteria on the mucous membranes of nose and throat for months without becoming ill; the organism may then disappear. '20-30 per cent of young people in Germany may carry the pathogen,' said Wiebke Hellenbrand, of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). What distinguishes the healthy carrier from the sick, nobody knows.\n\nHow the 2 Berliners were infected is unclear. Meningococci are transmitted by droplet [aerosol or secretions from the nasopharynx of colonized persons]. Humans can be infected by kissing or coughing. 'Maybe the 2 infected each other. Or maybe they were both infected by a 3rd party,' said Ulrich Marcus of RKI. The exact route of the pathogen cannot be reconstructed but has led to investigations that have uncovered additional cases and a call to vaccinate some 80 000 men who have sex with men in Berlin.\n\nDeaths caused by _N. meningitidis_ are not unusual. In Europe, the subgroups B and C are particularly responsible for causing illness, mostly in children and teenagers. In 2012, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI: the German national disease surveillance insitute) reported 300 ill, 33 of whom died.\n\n'This case was really only noticed because these 2 men were diagnosed within 24 hours, and it was clear that they had spent the night together,' said Hellenbrand. That sounds like an outbreak. Meningococcal infections tend to break out in places where people come together in a confined space: guests on a cruise ship, fans at a rugby game, kids at a carnival party.\n\nAnd another thing made the RKI experts take notice: the 2 men were gay, or, as the RKI epidemiologists called them, MSM (men who have sex with men). Epidemiologists are concerned with behavior, not sexual orientation. MSM includes gays, as well as bisexuals and male prostitutes.\n\nActually, gays are not considered particularly vulnerable to meningococcal disease, which affects men and women, homo- and heterosexuals alike. But doctors in Toronto in 2001 described a small outbreak of meningococcal disease among MSM: six people developed the disease, and 2 of them died. This was followed by outbreaks in Chicago and Los Angeles. But doctors were really attentive only when an outbreak in New York City last year [2012] afflicted 22 gays, 7 of whom died.\n\nAnd now Berlin: investigation revealed that a young gay man had come to the hospital in February [which year?] with meningococcal disease. He died 10 hours later in the operating room. Later in Berlin, 2 cases were yet to be identified, one died in October 2012, the other fell ill in February 2013 and survived.\n\nConcerns have been expressed by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). On 3 Jul 2013, ECDC experts published a brief risk assessment. They concluded that in big cities in Europe, there is an increased risk that gay men are infected with meningococcus and warned that huge gay festivals, such as the Christopher Street Day in Berlin, might contribute to the dissemination of the pathogen. Countries should, therefore, be particularly vigilant for meningococcal cases.\n\nWhy gays in particular? Don Weiss of the health department in New York, who experienced the outbreak in his own city, wonders whether the pathogen has changed and adapted to the group of MSM. Could meningococci be colonizing the urethra of gay men and be transmitted during oral sex? Or has the pathogen adapted to the anal mucosa? 'We know that smoking is a risk factor, because it damages the lining of the airways and makes it easier for bacteria to enter the body,' says White [Weiss?]. 'The same could happen if the anal mucosa is irritated.' Then, anal intercourse would be a risk factor.\n\nAmanda Cohn of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta believes there is a simpler explanation: gays are a social group with close contacts and could, therefore, be affected like a school class. Many gay men have multiple sexual partners quickly, kiss in greeting, and go to crowded parties, which could magnify the problem. In one study, 43 per cent of gays carried the pathogen.\n\nThe question of whether a special strain of bacteria is circulating in the gay community must be examined in each case, says Ulrich Vogel from the National Reference Center for Meningococcal Disease at the University of Wurzburg. It would be possible to examine whether bacteria isolated from the Berlin patients grew better in intestinal mucosal cells or urethral cells than bacteria from other patients. Genetic sequencing of the Berlin strains is planned, and American and French researchers also want to sequence their samples. Perhaps a tiny change in the genetic material appears only in cases in MSM.\n\nMarlen Suckau of the Berlin Impfbeirat [vaccination advisory board] had wide ranging discussions to decide whether the situation was disturbing enough for them to issue a recommendation for vaccination. In essence, vaccination would be recommended if a regional cluster were identified. For meningococcal disease, that means 10 cases per 100 000 people in one year. The group of MSM in Berlin is estimated at 80 000, and 5 cases in 10 months is significantly below the threshold. On the other hand, France had already issued a recommendation for vaccination and gays were vaccinated in New York and Chicago.\n\nIn the end, the Impfbeirat noted that the cases were all aged 20 to 29 years, says Suckau. In this age group, there are an estimated 18 000 MSM in Berlin. Thus, the threshold was exceeded in this group.\n\nThe recommendation is still valid for all MSM. 'It's easier to communicate, and you cannot send away a 19 year old from a doctor's office,' says Suckau. The recommendation was published in the Official Journal. On Sat 27 Jul 2013, it will come into force. For 6 months, gays will be eligible for vaccination in Berlin.\n\n'This is a unique vaccine that is well tolerated,' says Suckau, who wonders how high uptake will be. Germans have a hard time with vaccination -- for example, debating measles vaccination. Against the swine flu virus H1N1, only 5 per cent in Berlin were vaccinated, says Suckau. 'So 20 per cent uptake for meningococcal vaccine would be a great success.'\n\n[byline: Kai Kupferschmidt]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 18 Jul 2013\nSource: Berlin.de/The Official Capital City Portal [in German, machine trans. edited]\n20130718.1630.387129.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>http://www.berlin.de/sen/gessoz/presse/archiv/ 20130718.1630.387129.html\n\n\nThe Berlin Impfbeirat on 17 Jul 2013 has recommended an extension of public vaccination in Berlin, according to which men who have sex with men (MSM) should be vaccinated against meningococcal disease. The scheme is expected to start on 27 Jul 2013. The reason for the extended vaccination recommendation is an increased incidence of meningococcal disease among MSM in Berlin.\n\nOf the total of 18 [cases of] meningococcal disease in Berlin in 2013, 7 were caused by group C _Neisseria meningitidis_. Of the latter, 3 patients died, and a 4th remains ill. These 4 patients are MSM and recent disease outbreaks among MSM have occurred in New York and Paris.\n\nMeningococcal bacteria are found in the nasopharyngeal cavity in humans and can be transmitted by kissing, for example, or coughing. About 10 per cent of the population carry the bacteria without necessarily being ill. It is assumed that about 40 per cent of MSM are carriers of the bacteria and thus may be at higher risk of disease. The disease is taken very seriously, as it may be associated with serious complications and permanent damage. 2/3rds of affected patients suffer meningitis, and 1/3rd a life-threatening bloodstream infection (sepsis). In 10-20 per cent of cases, there are permanent sequelae. The mortality rate of group C meningococcal disease is as high as 10 per cent.\n\nThe only effective way to prevent meningococcal disease is vaccination. According to the recommendation of the Standing Committee on Vaccination at the Robert Koch Institute (STIKO), all children up to the age of 18 years should receive a single dose of vaccine against group C meningococcal infection. In adults, the STIKO recommends vaccination for certain people with immune deficiencies, such as those who are HIV positive, or for travelers to certain countries. The STIKO has not issued any recommendation for vaccination for MSM, but this gap is now closed due to the current events. The vaccine used for the current outbreak in MSM must contain a meningococcal group C component and be approved for adults. The vaccine is very well tolerated in general.\n\nThe recommendation for vaccination is planned to expire on 31 Jan 2014, and its effectiveness will be reviewed after this period. At the same time, the state of Berlin is committed to ensuring that the issues of vaccination for MSM by STIKO be uniform and thus cleared for other states.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is extracted in part from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (New York City) fatal, MSM, alert 20130308.1576590:\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions, mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 per cent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc. facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Invasive meningococcal disease carries a high mortality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.\n\nAt least 13 serogroups, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described: 5 serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W-135) most commonly cause human disease. Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/).\n\nHowever, less virulent strains have been reported to cause invasive meningococcal disease in immunocompromised HIV infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis. 2011; 15(2): 178-80, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).\n\nSince 2010, there have been 22 cases due to serogroup C in New York City among MSM (http://eziz.org/assets/docs/cdphmemo_2012_12_MeningitisAdvisoryMSM.pdf); this serogroup accounts for most US outbreaks (Woods CW, Rosenstein NE, Perkins BA. _Neisseria meningitidis_ outbreaks in the United States 1994-1997 (abstract). In: Proceedings of Annual Meeting of IDSA. 12-15 Nov 1998. Denver, Colorado. Alexandria (VA): Infectious Disease Society of America; 1998).\n\nAccording to the 2nd news report above, there have been 18 cases in Berlin in 2013, 7 of which were due to serogroup C, but only 4 of the 18 cases were MSM, all of whom were infected with serogroup C organisms. The 3 deaths in Berlin were among MSM. Genotyping the Berlin and New York City serogroup C isolates would enable us to see if the same strain has spread to Europe.\n\nWe are not told whether any of the 4 infected MSM were co-infected with HIV and whether their CD4 counts were low. Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing invasive meningococcal disease (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial meningitis in HIV-1-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285_Bacterial_meningitis_in_HIV-1-infected_patients_in_the_era_of_highly_active_antiretroviral_therapy).\n\nThe primary method for preventing sporadic meningococcal disease is chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone for persons who are known to be close contacts after a case is identified. Close contacts of patients are considered to be household members, day-care center contacts, and other persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful for deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.\n\nHowever, in the face of multiple anonymous sexual encounters among some MSM, a mass vaccination campaign is being used to control this outbreak as detailed in the news releases above. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccine to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC.

The Berlin Impfbeirat on 17 Jul 2013 has recommended an extension of public vaccination in Berlin, according to which men who have sex with men (MSM) should be vaccinated against meningococcal disease. MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - GERMANY: (BERLIN) FATAL, MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN, VACCINATION\n*******************************************************************************************\n \n\nThe primary method for preventing sporadic meningococcal disease is chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone for persons who are known to be close contacts after a case is identified. Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. But doctors in Toronto in 2001 described a small outbreak of meningococcal disease among MSM: six people developed the disease, and 2 of them died. \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccine to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC. [cases of] meningococcal disease in Berlin in 2013, 7 were caused by group C _Neisseria meningitidis_. According to the 2nd news report above, there have been 18 cases in Berlin in 2013, 7 of which were due to serogroup C, but only 4 of the 18 cases were MSM, all of whom were infected with serogroup C organisms. For meningococcal disease, that means 10 cases per 100 000 people in one year. Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing invasive meningococcal disease (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. \n\nMeningococcal bacteria are found in the nasopharyngeal cavity in humans and can be transmitted by kissing, for example, or coughing. The mortality rate of group C meningococcal disease is as high as 10 per cent. According to the recommendation of the Standing Committee on Vaccination at the Robert Koch Institute (STIKO), all children up to the age of 18 years should receive a single dose of vaccine against group C meningococcal infection. \n\nAt least 13 serogroups, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described: 5 serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W-135) most commonly cause human disease. The reason for the extended vaccination recommendation is an increased incidence of meningococcal disease among MSM in Berlin. And now Berlin: investigation revealed that a young gay man had come to the hospital in February [which year?] with meningococcal disease. \n\n'This case was really only noticed because these 2 men were diagnosed within 24 hours, and it was clear that they had spent the night together,' said Hellenbrand. Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). And another thing made the RKI experts take notice: the 2 men were gay, or, as the RKI epidemiologists called them, MSM (men who have sex with men). They concluded that in big cities in Europe, there is an increased risk that gay men are infected with meningococcus and warned that huge gay festivals, such as the Christopher Street Day in Berlin, might contribute to the dissemination of the pathogen. The only effective way to prevent meningococcal disease is vaccination. \n\nMany people may carry these bacteria on the mucous membranes of nose and throat for months without becoming ill; the organism may then disappear. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). The exact route of the pathogen cannot be reconstructed but has led to investigations that have uncovered additional cases and a call to vaccinate some 80 000 men who have sex with men in Berlin. \n\nWe are not told whether any of the 4 infected MSM were co-infected with HIV and whether their CD4 counts were low. \n\nBerlin, located in north eastern Germany, with a population of 3.3 million people, is the capital of Germany and one of its 16 states; it is Germany's largest city and the 2nd most populous city in the European Union (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin). \n\nIn the end, the Impfbeirat noted that the cases were all aged 20 to 29 years, says Suckau. Since 2010, there have been 22 cases due to serogroup C in New York City among MSM (http://eziz.org/assets/docs/cdphmemo_2012_12_MeningitisAdvisoryMSM.pdf); this serogroup accounts for most US outbreaks (Woods CW, Rosenstein NE, Perkins BA. _Neisseria meningitidis_ outbreaks in the United States 1994-1997 (abstract). Amanda Cohn of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta believes there is a simpler explanation: gays are a social group with close contacts and could, therefore, be affected like a school class. Invasive meningococcal disease carries a high mortality rate if untreated. \n\nConcerns have been expressed by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). \n\n'This is a unique vaccine that is well tolerated,' says Suckau, who wonders how high uptake will be. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n It is assumed that about 40 per cent of MSM are carriers of the bacteria and thus may be at higher risk of disease. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc. facilitates the spread of the disease. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful for deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.\n\n \n\nHow the 2 Berliners were infected is unclear. Later in Berlin, 2 cases were yet to be identified, one died in October 2012, the other fell ill in February 2013 and survived.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "measles"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2012-03-26 00:00:00", "2003-03-26 00:00:00", "2010-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-02-26 00:00:00", "1997-03-26 00:00:00", "2009-03-26 00:00:00", "2001-03-26 00:00:00", "2011-03-26 00:00:00", "1998-03-26 00:00:00", "2013-07-27 00:00:00", "2012-10-26 00:00:00", "2013-02-26 00:00:00", "2021-01-03 00:00:00", "2013-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-05-08 00:00:00", "2014-01-31 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Chicago", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Toronto", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "France"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Berlin", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hellenbrand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "VA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Paris", "country": "France"}, {"location": "Los Angeles", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Friedrichshain - Kreuzberg", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Atlanta", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Denver", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "Germany"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1687659", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Meningitis, meningococcal - Russia: (SV,IK) fatal", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1687659", "date": "2013-05-02 17:02:49", "main_text": "MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - RUSSIA: (SVERDLOVSK, IRKUTSK), FATAL\n****************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n\n[1] Sverdlovsk\n[2] Irkutsk\n\n******\n[1] Sverdlovsk\nDate: Tue 23 Apr 2013\nSource: Rossiyskaya Gazeta [in Russian, trans.

Chemoprophylaxis administered after 14 days is probably of limited or no value (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr4605.pdf). Antibiotics that effectively eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _Neisseria meningitidis_ include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, and these drugs are appropriate for chemoprophylaxis. In areas of the United States where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of _N. meningitidis_ have been detected, ciprofloxacin should not be used for chemoprophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm and http://www.unboundmedicine.com/redbook/ub/view/RedBook/187078/7/meningococcal_vaccine_for).\n\nWe are not told in the 2nd news report above what tests are being done on the index patient's close contacts.

Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis range from 100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as high as 1000 per 100 000 (World Health Organization (WHO): Meningococcal meningitis fact sheet: http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/FactSheet-Meningitis.pdf).\n\nTo control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains.\n\nThere are at least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of meningococcal meningitis, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135. All these serogroup polysaccharides except B are immunogenic in humans; serogroup B is poorly immunogenic, presumably because serogroup B polysaccharide resembles the human neural cell adhesion molecule.\n\nWhile effective capsular polysaccharides-based vaccines exist against serogroups A, C, W135, and Y, no similar vaccine is available against disease caused by serogroup B strains. A new protein-based, 4-component meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine has been developed that is hoped will be a broad-spectrum B vaccine (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).\n\nRarely, outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have been related to other serogroups, such as type X, which has occurred in Niger in 2006 and Burkina Faso in 2010.\n\nArba Minch is a city with a population of 95 373 (2012) located in the Gamo Gofa Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region of southern Ethiopia, about 500 km (310 miles) south of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arba_Minch). Shebedino, with a population of 233 922 (2007), is one of the 'woredas' (districts) in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region of Ethiopia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebedino).\n\nA map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at http://www.medic8.com/images/map4-9.gif.

So we don't really understand why that is.' Have you been vaccinated?\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 17 May 2013\nSource: The New York Times [edited]\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/health/for-gay-men-a-fear-that-feels-familiar.html\n\n\nAt around 4 on a Saturday morning, a time when most of the gay bars in New York have closed and locked their doors, a steady stream of young and middle-aged men, almost all shirtless and some stripped down to their boxer briefs, have found their way down a dark stairwell and into a maze of basement rooms, where the decor can best be described as fallout-shelter chic. They have come to Paddles, an after-hours sex club in Chelsea, not yet ready to end their evening.\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a doctor and gay activist has come to spread the message that a new health threat has emerged among the city's gay population and that he is there to stop it. 'Have you been vaccinated?' he asks.\n\nA new, casually transmittable infection -- a unique strain of bacterial meningitis -- has cast a pall over the gay nightlife and dating scene, with men wondering whether this is AIDS, circa 1981, all over again. To date, 7 men have died in New York City, about a third of diagnosed cases, since 2010. And in the last few months, the contagion seemed to be accelerating. It has targeted gay and bisexual men, and nobody knows exactly why.\n\nThe city's best hope to curb the outbreak is to vaccinate as many at-risk men as possible, focusing on those most in danger: men who regularly hook up with other men whom they meet at parties, bars, clubs, and through apps like Grindr. Dr Don Weiss, the director of surveillance for the city's Bureau of Communicable Disease, has called it 'Russian roulette sex,' because 'sooner or later, you are going to come across this organism and be exposed.'\n\nThe health department's own vaccination efforts at several gay bars have had limited success. Men out partying want to have fun, not be told that they may fall prey to a lethal disease by doing so. Hence Dr Daskalakis's early-morning club crawl, medical bag in hand. Being a nonthreatening gay man who does not wear a white coat helps. So does his empathy and sense of humor.\n\nEvery half-hour or so, the owner of Paddles, Michael Aulito, makes a public-service announcement: 'If you haven't gotten a shot, please go talk to Dr Demetre.' Dr Daskalakis hands the men a consent form and asks the threshold question: 'Do you have an illness more serious than a cold?' 'Will it hurt?' they ask.\n\n'I'm hitting more than 700 today, my injections have gotten really good,' he says, grinning proudly. 'Can I get it from having sex?' 'Maybe,' he says, 'but not just from sex. You can get it from being close, like kissing or cuddling.' Dr Daskalakis stabs them in the arm with a needle, applies a Band-Aid and sends them on their way. All over Paddles, men are happily sucking on the lollipops he is handing out as a reward. 'Dr Demetre told me every person who gets a shot saves 4 other people,' Mr. Aulito says. 'If he gives 700 shots, that's 2800 people that he saved, an amazing number.' Mr Aulito has been vaccinated, as has his wife.\n\nPeter DeMartino, 40, the head of an AIDS organization, AIDS/HIV Services Group, in Charlottesville, Virginia, says that he is so excited at finding medical care in a sex club that he feels like waking up his traveling companion, who is from Philadelphia, to get inoculated, too. 'It's New York, right?' Mr DeMartino says. 'We know our populations are very -- migratory is not the right word -- but it's not much to have a weekend in New York. If there's an outbreak in New York, how soon before it's up and down the 95 [interstate I-95] corridor?'\n\nA 38-year-old events coordinator from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, said that he got his shot the week before from his doctor, but he is grateful that, for men who are not insured, Paddles is an option. 'I go out quite a bit,' he says. 'You don't have to have sex with someone to get meningitis. You go out to a bar on Friday night, you're in contact with hundreds of men, and you're not going to know. You're going to think, 'Oh, I'm hung over.' '\n\nThe bacterium [that causes meningococcal meningitis] is carried in the nose and mouth. Though not as contagious as a cold or flu, it can be spread through kissing, sneezing, or sharing a spoon. (Sharing cigarettes is also bad, but there is a theory in the literature that this is not because of the exchange of saliva but because smoking irritates the mucous membranes and facilitates bacterial invasion.)\n\n'How long is it good?' [someone] wants to know. 'It takes 7 to 10 days to take effect and provides up to 5 years of immunity,' Dr Daskalakis says. Often, men ask him, 'What are my chances of getting this?' 'Minuscule,' he replies. The idea, he explains, is to confer herd immunity by vaccinating as many at-risk men as possible. 'It could have picked another social network,' he says. 'It picked gay men. It's like thinking of the community as a large dorm without walls.'\n\nKnowing that Dr Daskalakis has entree where government apparatchiks do not, the city supplies him with free vaccine. A week ago, he vaccinated men at a house party in Brooklyn, in a location he did not want to be disclosed, where the host set the mood by dressing in drag as a platinum-blond nurse. 'The department of health loves that we're here -- loves, loves, loves,' he says, at Paddles.\n\nMeningitis can be treated with antibiotics if caught in time. The vaccine will prevent someone from getting it, and possibly reduce the ability of a carrier to spread it. The current strain was first detected among drug users in Brooklyn in 2006. In that outbreak, 23 people were infected and 7 died. After the city conducted a vaccination drive at drug treatment centers and soup kitchens, there was a three-year lull. Then there was 1 case in 2010, 4 in 2011, 13 in 2012 and 4 so far this year [2013], all among gay and bisexual men living in New York City. Of the 22, 7 have died. (City officials say there has been a 23rd case in a man who lived elsewhere in New York State but frequented the city.) Half of the men have been black, 18 percent Hispanic. Often, they are not out about their sexual activity, making it difficult for the health department to reach them. There have been 10 cases in Brooklyn, 7 in Manhattan, 2 in Queens and 2 in the Bronx. One man was homeless. Of the 22, 12 were HIV-positive, a possible risk factor because of their compromised immune systems. The last confirmed case was [15 Feb 2013].\n\nEpidemiologists are puzzled as to why the latest outbreak is attacking men but not women. 'We don't have any evidence that it's different in some biological way, we just know that it's different,' says Dr Jay Varma, the city's deputy health commissioner for disease control. 'And what is concerning is that it is largely restricted to men who have sex with men. So we don't really understand why that is.'\n\nLast month [April 2013], [the death of] a West Hollywood, California, lawyer fueled concerns that the outbreak had spread west. Los Angeles County health authorities and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have since confirmed that the strain of meningitis that killed [the lawyer] was different enough from the one in New York that it is unlikely that is how he was exposed. But the CDC has asked state health departments nationwide to be on the alert for cases among gay men.\n\nIn one positive sign, the number of vaccinations in the city has been rising sharply, to 10 200 as of [13 May 2013]. 'We have our fingers crossed,' Dr Varma said. 'One of the reasons we can't be 100 percent confident is that there are a number of Gay Pride events coming up, where there are a lot of people coming into the city, a lot of people interacting together, so we want to get through that period before we are really celebrating controlling it.'\n\n[Byline: Anemona Hartocollis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news releases above are updates on the outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease among men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City (NYC) that was reported in 2 prior ProMED-mail posts, Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (NY) fatal, MSM 20120929.1315676 and Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (New York City) fatal, MSM, alert 20130308.1576590.\n\nThe following is extracted in part from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (New York City) fatal, MSM, alert 20130308.1576590:\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 per cent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc. facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Invasive meningococcal disease carries a high mortality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.\n\nAt least 13 serogroups, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described: 5 serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W-135) most commonly cause human disease. Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U: Identification of the Hypervirulent Lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 Complexes, by Using Monoclonal Antibodies Specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/). However, less virulent strains have been reported to cause invasive meningococcal disease in immune-compromised HIV-infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I: Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis 2011; 15 (2): 178-80; available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).\n\nSince 2010 there have been 22 cases in NYC. We are not told in the news reports above or in previous news reports if there is any link among the 23 cases, other than they were MSM in NYC.\n\nIt is reported elsewhere that the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene stated that this outbreak was due to serogroup C (http://eziz.org/assets/docs/cdphmemo_2012_12_MeningitisAdvisoryMSM.pdf); this serogroup accounts for most US outbreaks (Woods CW, Rosenstein NE, Perkins BA: _Neisseria meningitidis_ outbreaks in the United States 1994-1997 (Abstract). In: Proceedings of Annual Meeting of IDSA. 12-15 Nov 1998. Denver, Colorado. Alexandria (VA): Infectious Disease Society of America; 1998).\n\nWe are not told the CD4 counts in the patients with HIV co-infection. Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing invasive meningococcal disease (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al: Bacterial meningitis in HIV-1-infected Patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009 Aug 15; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285_Bacterial_meningitis_in_HIV-1-infected_patients_in_the_era_of_highly_active_antiretroviral_therapy).\n\nThe primary method for preventing sporadic meningococcal disease is chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone, for persons who are known to be close contacts after a case is identified. Close contacts of patients are considered to be household members, day-care center contacts, and other persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.\n\nHowever, in the face of multiple anonymous sexual encounters among some MSM, a mass vaccination campaign is being used to control this outbreak as detailed in the 2nd news release above. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccine to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC.

According to the CDC, the man had snail soup with 5 of his friends a few days before exhibiting symptoms of headaches and neck stiffness.\n\nCDC official, Doctor Luo Yi-jun said 'he started to have fever and headaches a week to a month after eating the snail soup and his doctor found that _A. cantonensis_ had affected his brain.' According to the CDC, the patient is still undergoing medical treatment in a hospital. Meanwhile, his friends who had snail soup with him have not shown any symptoms of infection.\n\nLuo said that snails are the primary intermediate hosts of _A. cantonensis_. Humans are incidental hosts of this roundworm, and may become infected through ingestion of larvae in raw or undercooked snails or other vectors, or from contaminated water and vegetables. 'When _A. cantonensis_ infects human brains,' Luo said, 'the most common symptoms are headaches and neck stiffness associated with fever, confusion or altered consciousness, and vomiting.' According to the CDC, aside from this patient, 8 out of the 9 people who were infected with _A. cantonensis_ last year [2012] had consumed snails. They all made full recoveries after receiving medical treatments.\n\nThe CDC said that people should wear gloves when handling snails and boil them for at least 3 minutes to avoid infection. _A. cantonensis_, also known as the rat lungworm, is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands.

'We've had several cases who have been actually found dead in their apartment before they'd even gone to see a medical provider. So that is, to us, absolutely terrifying.'\n\nBut now the city says all men who are intimate with other men they've met on a website, or an app, or at a bar, or a party need to get vaccinated now. 'We think that people who are in these risk groups should be taking this very, very seriously,' said Varma. 'Probably all of us have people that fall potentially within this risk group. Vaccination is the best defense. I urge all men who meet these criteria -- regardless of whether they identify as gay -- to get vaccinated now and protect themselves from this disease before it is too late,' added Health Commissioner Dr Thomas Farley.\n\nSymptoms of meningitis are: high fever, headache, stiff neck, and rash that develop rapidly upon onset, according to the health department. Symptoms may appear 2 to 10 days after exposure, but usually within 5 days. Anyone experiencing these symptoms is advised to seek immediate medical care.\n\nMen who meet the vaccination criteria are urged to get the shot from their health care provider. Health Department clinics are also offering the meningitis vaccine to those who cannot get the shot from a doctor.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news release above is an update on the outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease among men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City that was reported last year [2012] in a ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (NY) fatal, MSM 20120929.1315676.\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 per cent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc. facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Invasive meningococcal disease carries a high mortality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.\n\nAt least 13 serogroups, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described: 5 serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W-135) most commonly cause human disease. Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are caused by only a few clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U: Identification of the Hypervirulent Lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 Complexes, by Using Monoclonal Antibodies Specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003 August; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/). However, less virulent strains have been reported to cause invasive meningococcal disease in immune-compromised HIV-infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I: Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis 2011; 15 (2): 178-80; available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).\n\nWe are not told in the news report above or in previous news reports if there is any link among the 17 cases, other than they were men who have sex with men. A prior health department news release said that 4 men who died also were HIV infected. Serogroup C _N. meningitidis_ accounts for most US outbreaks (Woods CW, Rosenstein NE, Perkins BA: _Neisseria meningitidis_ outbreaks in the United States 1994-1997 (Abstract). In: Proceedings of Annual Meeting of IDSA. 12-15 Nov 1998. Denver, Colorado. Alexandria (VA): Infectious Disease Society of America; 1998). However, we are not told the serotypes of the meningococcal organisms involved in this outbreak in New York City; or if the serotypes were the same, or whether the isolates have the same genotype.\n\nWe are also not told the CD4 counts in the patients who had HIV co-infection. Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing invasive meningococcal disease (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al: Bacterial Meningitis in HIV-1-Infected Patients in the Era of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009 Aug 15; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285_Bacterial_meningitis_in_HIV-1-infected_patients_in_the_era_of_highly_active_antiretroviral_therapy).\n\nThe primary method for preventing sporadic meningococcal disease is chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone, of close contacts after a case is identified. The risk of acquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater among close contacts than among the total population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). Close contacts of patients are considered to be household members, day-care center contacts, and other persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.\n\nA mass vaccination campaign has been used to control invasive meningococcal disease outbreaks in the USA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2738498/) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccine to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC.

Their investigation was based on 4 axes:\n- Analysis of available documents;\n- Analysis of the organization of the vaccination campaign and vaccine quality;\n- Interviews of the different parties involved;\n- Medical examination of the 36 cases in the 2 hospitals in N'Djamena.\n\nAs a result from the different analyses, discussions among the team, and after meetings or contacting those implicated (or not implicated), in the event, the experts have come to the preliminary conclusions below:\n\nExpert Findings:\nThe vaccination campaign organized in Gouro was conducted under normal conditions by staff who are experienced in implementing mass campaigns and routine vaccination programs.\n\nThe conditions of hospitalization, in particular the medical care at the psychological level, and the dialogue between the community and the health staff were insufficient.\n\nThe crises are triggered by noise, visits by foreigners, and the occurrence of crises among other patients.\n\nApart from these agitated periods, the children lead normal lives.\n\nThe patients are aged between 8 and 25 years, and with 77 percent of them being girls, i.e. 27 out of a total of 35.\n\nA child that had not been vaccinated complains of similar symptoms.\n\nAll the different medical examinations performed on the patients were normal. The neurological examination on patients at the request of the experts also concluded that all was normal.\n\nThe same MenAfriVac vaccine lot 127M1033, used in Gouro, was used in the entire Ennedi region.\n\nThe expert reports from WHO on the vaccine lot at the level of the manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII) showed no manufacturing defect.\n\nThe MenAfriVac vaccine, prequalified by WHO in 2010, has been subjected to all the required tests before being used. To date, more than 100 million people have been vaccinated in 10 countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Sudan, Senegal, Chad, and Benin).

It could be a convulsive syncope, not because of the content of the meningococcal vaccine but from the mere vaccination (as a result of the puncture, or because of fear of being stuck by the needle, who knows?). It sometimes happens, especially in adolescent girls. There is some risk of injury from falling when they suddenly lose consciousness.\n\n--\nDr. Juan B Bellido-Blasco\nSeccion de Epidemiologia\nCentro de Salud Publica de Castellon\nAvenida del Mar, 12\n12003-Castellon (Spain)\n\n[The above report in [1] contains the detailed findings of the thorough investigation of this event by a team of experts. All aspects of the vaccination activities, the vaccine and the procedures used were investigated and were found to be correct and appropriate. The conclusion that this event was an event involving mass hysteria was drawn on solid grounds after all other possibilities were eliminated. ProMED-mail has posted reports on outbreaks of mass hysteria in the past (see the list of 'see alsos' below).\n\nThe description of the involved individuals gave an age range old enough to be influenced by events they were seeing, and the composition of the involved group was 77 percent female. The fact that all involved individuals were at the same location, combined with the observation that the same lot of vaccine was used elsewhere without adverse events, and the inclusion of one affected individual who had not received the vaccine all strongly support the conclusion that the event was most likely a mass hysteria event.\n\n(Borrowing from a prior ProMED posting, Undiagnosed illness - Bangladesh (02):\nmass hysteria 20070720.2327:)'In a prior ProMED-mail posting from 2002, when there was a multistate outbreak of rash illness (see Unexplained rash illness - USA (multistate) (06) 20020605.4409), a reporter in a New York Times article, Margaret Talbot, had the following background material: 'Well-documented outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness do occur. Between 1973 and 1993, there were 70 reports of mass hysteria in medical journals; most took place in self-contained communities, like schools, barracks, and factories. Symptoms spread by 'line of sight' -- people get sick as they see other people getting sick -- which is quite different from what happens with a viral illness. Adolescents and preadolescents are particularly susceptible, and girls are more likely to fall ill than boys. Girls' heightened susceptibility to mass psychogenic illness need not be seen as due to their more 'hysterical' nature, but to their propensity to talk among themselves about their health. Additionally, women are more likely to seek medical attention, and presumably, therefore, to take note of their own symptoms, than men.'\n\nThere was a previous report of a mass hysteria event following vaccination with tetanus-diphtheria toxoid in Jordan in 2001. (see Kharabsheh S, Al-Otoum H, Clements J, Abbas A, Khuri-Bulos N, Belbesi A, Gaafar T, Dellepiane N. Mass psychogenic illness following tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination in Jordan. Bull World Health Organ. 2001;79(8):764-70. Epub 2001 Oct 24. Available at: http://www.who.int/docstore/bulletin/pdf/2001/issue8/vol79.no.8.764-770.pdf.)\n\nAbstract: 'In September 1998, more than 800 young people in Jordan believed they had suffered from the side effects of tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccine administered at school; 122 of them were admitted to hospital. For the vast majority, their symptoms did not result from the vaccine but arose from mass psychogenic illness.\n\nThe role played by the media, the children's parents, and the medical profession in the escalation of this mass reaction appeared, at 1st sight, to be unusual and even unique to the circumstances in Jordan at the time. A review of the literature showed, however, that this mass reaction was similar in many ways to previous outbreaks, even though the underlying causes varied. There are about 200 published accounts of mass responses to situations involving suspected poisoning or other events. Because such mass reactions are relatively rare and the triggers so diverse, individuals faced with responding to them are unlikely to have prior experience in how to handle them and are unlikely to take bold steps to prevent their escalation. Indeed, they may be unaware that such events have been recorded before. The lessons learned from this incident in Jordan may help other immunization programme managers to handle crisis situations elsewhere.'\n\nFor the HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Chad, see http://healthmap.org/r/1CnT. - Mod.MPP]", "summary": "Their investigation was based on 4 axes:\n- Analysis of available documents;\n- Analysis of the organization of the vaccination campaign and vaccine quality;\n- Interviews of the different parties involved;\n- Medical examination of the 36 cases in the 2 hospitals in N'Djamena.

Some of the children began to moan shortly after receiving their meningitis shot and then went into convulsions, said a former lawmaker from Gouro, Ahmat Saleh Bodoumi. International experts have been in the country since 9 Jan 2013 to investigate, the health ministry said in a statement.\n\nMeningitis outbreaks are frequent in the poor, landlocked Sahel country. 'During the past 15 years, Chad has recorded more than 50 000 cases of meningitis with more than 5000 deaths,' N'Gawara said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the sub-Saharan African region known as the 'meningitis belt' each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June\n(http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at http://www.medic8.com/images/map4-9.gif. Chad is located in the middle of this 'meningitis belt.' Epidemics of meningitis in the African 'meningitis belt' are mostly associated with the meningococcus. Mass immunization programs with meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine are recommended as a control measure in meningococcal outbreaks. Therefore, the adverse reactions, namely 'seizures' in this case, after a 'meningitis shot' reported above presumably occurred after receipt of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine, although this is not specified as such in the news release.\n\nThere are 2 kinds of meningococcal vaccine: 1) Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV) and 2) Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV). Adverse events after meningococcal vaccination consist primarily of local reactions, such as redness or pain, at the site of administration in as many as half the people who get meningococcal vaccines, and occur more commonly after MCV than after MPSV (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm#mening). A small percentage of people who receive the vaccine develop a low-grade fever.\n\nA more serious condition, Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) occurring up to one month after vaccine administration has been reported after administration of quadrivalent MCV. As of 15 Feb 2008, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has received 26 confirmed case reports of GBS within 6 weeks of receipt of the quadrivalent MCV Menactra out of more than 15 million doses of this vaccine being given.\n\nIn some children, having a fever can bring on a seizure. Febrile seizures can occur when a child has a fever from any cause, be it an infection or a febrile reaction to a vaccination. Febrile seizures usually last a minute or 2. They are most common with fevers reaching 102 deg F (38.9 deg C) or higher but can also occur at lower temperatures or when a fever is going back down. About 2-5 percent of young children will have at least one febrile seizure. Most febrile seizures occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Such events have been reported to occur at a very low level following vaccines, most notably following measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and the whole cell pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, (DTP) vaccine, which is no longer used in the United States.\n\nOnly one report of a seizure-like reaction after administration of a meningococcal vaccine could be found on a brief survey on the Internet (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/05vol31/dr3111b-eng.php). In this report, the 'seizure' occurred soon after receipt of meningococcal quadrivalent polysaccharide vaccine and was attributed to a 'pseudoseizure conversion reaction.'\n\nChad is a poor, landlocked country in central Africa. It is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the south west, and Niger to the west. N'Djamena is the national capital of Chad. Gouro is a subprefecture in the Ennedi region (one of the 22 regions of Chad), located northeastern Chad (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chad_07_region_locator_map_2008-02.svg).\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Chad is available at http://healthmap.org/r/017X. - Mod.ML]\n\n[The description of the event following the receipt of vaccine in the above newswire as 'moan shortly after receiving their meningitis shot and then went into convulsions' is curious. As mentioned above, febrile seizures have been reported following receipt of vaccine, but the time frame tends to be within hours to 2 weeks following vaccination. More frequently, immediate type reactions to exposure to antigens tend to be allergic reactions, with the more serious presentation being an anaphylactic event. Other possibilities that might explain what occurred include the possibility of a contaminant introduced into the vaccine vial (locally or at the manufacturer) or the use of a different adjuvant or higher than usual concentration of adjuvant, which has been associated with an increased incidence of local as well as febrile reactions.\n\nOf note, according to a WHO report, Chad and other African countries have recently been incorporating a new meningococcal A conjugate vaccine as part of their meningitis vaccination program activities.

According to a recent news report posted by ProMED-mail (Meningitis, meningococcal - Chile (03): (VS, RM) update 20121110.1403844), there have been a total of 98 cases of meningococcal meningitis. The outbreak is centered mainly in 2 Chilean regions: the Metropolitan Region (RM), which includes Santiago, and the region of Valparaiso. _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W135 predominates in the Metropolitan Region and serogroup B predominates in Valparaiso.\n\nAlthough the microbe that caused meningitis in the passenger on LAN flight 592 was not stated in the news report above, presumably it was the meningococcus, _N. meningitidis_. Meningococcal infection is spread primarily through direct contact with respiratory droplets from a nasopharyngeal carrier or an infected person. The incubation period between infection and appearance of symptoms is generally 3 to 4 days, but may range from 2 to 10 days.\n\nWhile this risk of secondary transmission among household members is estimated to be low (4 cases per 1000 household members at risk), it is 500 to 800 times higher than in the general population. Other at-risk contacts include attendees at the same child-care center, or anyone directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions (such as, through kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, or endotracheal intubation). Risk is also high in travelers who have prolonged contact with local populations in the Africa meningitis belt during an epidemic. The Hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia has been associated with outbreaks of meningococcal disease in returning pilgrims and their contacts.\n\nAntibiotics are recommended to prevent secondary infection in close contacts of patients with invasive meningococcal disease. Because the risk for illness is highest during the 1st few days after infection, chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) after contact with an index case-patient. Chemoprophylaxis administered after 14 days is probably of limited or no value. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for people in the same household, roommates, child-care/preschool contacts, and people who have been exposed directly to a patient's oral secretions through close social contact (such as kissing or sharing of eating utensils) during the 7 days before onset of disease in the index case. Antibiotics that effectively eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin and these drugs are appropriate for chemoprophylaxis. In areas of the United States where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of _N. meningitidis_ have been detected, ciprofloxacin should not be used for chemoprophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm and http://www.unboundmedicine.com/redbook/ub/view/RedBook/187078/7/meningococcal_vaccine_for).\n\nFrom February 1999 through May 2001, the US CDC reported it received 21 reports from local health departments of suspected cases of air travel associated meningococcal disease, on average 1.9 days (range: 0--10 days) between the completion of the flight and the onset of illness; CDC reported that 5 of these passengers had symptomatic meningococcal disease before their arrival (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm). No cases of secondary disease occurred among air travel contacts of persons with meningococcal disease; nevertheless, CDC noted that passengers who are seated next to a person with meningococcal disease for a prolonged flight are more likely to be exposed directly to the patient's oral secretions and are probably at higher risk for developing meningococcal disease than those seated farther from the index case-patient (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm).\n\nCDC, in collaboration with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, developed procedures for the management of air travel associated exposure to the meningococcus. The assessment of risk to passengers and flight crew members is based on the flight duration and seating proximity to the index case-patient. In the absence of data about increased risk to other passengers, they recommend antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be considered for passengers who are seated immediately next to an index case-patient for flights of more than 8 hours, including ground time (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm).\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Chile can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/2E*Q. - Mod.ML]", "summary": "No cases of secondary disease occurred among air travel contacts of persons with meningococcal disease; nevertheless, CDC noted that passengers who are seated next to a person with meningococcal disease for a prolonged flight are more likely to be exposed directly to the patient's oral secretions and are probably at higher risk for developing meningococcal disease than those seated farther from the index case-patient (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm). \n\nFrom February 1999 through May 2001, the US CDC reported it received 21 reports from local health departments of suspected cases of air travel associated meningococcal disease, on average 1.9 days (range: 0--10 days) between the completion of the flight and the onset of illness; CDC reported that 5 of these passengers had symptomatic meningococcal disease before their arrival (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm).

It is a cosmopolitan fungus inhabiting plant material, particularly grasses and soil. Dr Dreyzehner points out that currently used antifungal treatments are effective against this fungus.\n\nIn addition, he says that the incubation time for the infection may be significantly longer than originally suspected.

This environmental organism is much less common as a human pathogen than aspergillus. This agent is one of the molds associated with phaeohyphomycosis (McGinnis MR, Rinaldi MG, Winn RE. Emerging agents of phaeohyphomycosis: pathogenic species of Bipolaris and Exserohilum. J Clin Microbiol. 1986;24:250-259).

At present, there is culture, PCR, and/or histopathologic evidence of fungal central nervous system (CNS) infection in at least 25 patients. The commonest pathogen identified in these patients to date is _Exserohilum_ spp.\n\nOne patient has documented evidence of _Aspergillus_ spp. infection. When initiating treatment for patients with meningitis (that is, CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] pleocytosis* regardless of glucose and protein levels), epidural abscess, and/or vertebral osteomyelitis of unknown etiology who received an epidural injection with a New England Compounding Center product, clinicians should continue to follow routine empiric treatment protocols to cover for potential bacterial pathogens and add empiric broad spectrum antifungal therapy to the treatment regimen because of the severe adverse outcomes of untreated invasive fungal infection.\n\nThese recommendations are based upon current evidence that at least 2 fungal pathogens are involved, and the possibility that additional pathogens may be identified as the investigation continues. CDC has consulted with national experts on treatment options for fungal CNS and/or parameningeal infections in patients associated with this cluster. The following represents interim guidance and may change as new information becomes available.\n\nConsult an infectious disease physician to assist with diagnosis, management, and follow-up, which may be complex and prolonged.\n\nAfter collecting cerebrospinal fluid for culture, initiate empiric combination antifungal therapy using the following regimen in addition to routine empiric treatment protocols to cover for potential bacterial pathogens until the etiology of the patient's CNS and/or parameningeal infection has been identified:\n\nVoriconazole, preferably at a dose of 6mg/kg every 12 hours (IV initially) and to continue on this high dose for the duration of treatment, if possible. Regular monitoring of serum concentration (for example, weekly interval) is advisable.\n\nAND\n\nLiposomal amphotericin B, preferably at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg IV daily (higher than standard dose). The liposomal preparation of amphotericin B [AmBisome] is preferred over other lipid formulations. If nephrotoxicity is a potential concern, particularly in older patients, the dose may be decreased to 5mg/kg IV daily. Administration of 1L normal saline prior to infusion may be considered to minimize risk of nephrotoxicity.\n\nAvoid routine use of intrathecal amphotericin B, either the deoxycholate or the lipid formulations, due to limited data on its use and associated toxicities.\n\nThere is currently no clear evidence for the use of adjuvant steroid therapy. If used, careful monitoring of clinical status is warranted.\n\nAdequate duration of antifungal treatment is unknown but likely will require prolonged therapy (for example, months) tailored by the clinical response to treatment. Individual management decisions, including choice of long-term antifungal regimen, should be made in consultation with infectious disease physicians experienced in the treatment of fungal infections. Clinicians should be vigilant for potential relapse of infection after completion of therapy.\n\nAt this time, CDC does not recommend initiation of antifungal prophylaxis in exposed patients who are asymptomatic. These patients should be closely monitored for development of symptoms, with a low threshold for performing lumbar puncture should the patient become symptomatic.\n\nAt this time, CDC does not recommend empiric antifungal therapy for symptomatic patients who have normal cerebrospinal fluid laboratory examination. These patients should be closely monitored and re-evaluated for progression of symptoms. Should the patient have progression of symptoms, a lumbar puncture should be repeated immediately.\n\n*CSF WBC greater than 5 in a non-traumatic lumbar puncture.

He apparently worked in the engine room. A 2nd crew member is a 47 year old Italian who works in the cruise ship's galley, who also is in the intensive care unit. 2 other crew members include a Brazilian and a Filipino, whose conditions are described as less serious.

The 2800 dosages were described as an 'unprecedented quantity over a period of time so limited.' The medicine consisted of an antibiotic tablet of 500 milligrams for adults and syrup for about 400 children who were on board.

The ministry said that all 4 had been transported to hospitals in the port of Livorno. Doctors have distributed more than 2800 doses of rifampicin and ciprofloxacin to passengers of the MSC Orchestra. Those who had already disembarked over the past week are advised to take similar precautionary measures.

The cruise company stated that it was doing all that is necessary to ensure the health and well-being of its crew members and guests. The 4 crew members were found to have contracted meningococcal meningitis. The illness is transmitted through close contact with saliva or respiratory secretions. The Health Ministry also noted that the strain was detected in crew members working in the ship's kitchen; hence, it is not likely that they had close contact with guests. 2 out of the 4 cases were diagnosed as [meningitis due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup] C.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the United States and most industrialized countries, antibiotic chemoprophylaxis among close contacts of a patient with invasive meningococcal disease is recommended to prevent secondary cases.\n\nThe following is extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, bacterial, airplane exposure - USA (KS ex FL): alert 20070724.2378:\n\nMeningococcal meningitis occurs sporadically or as epidemics.

On Sat 6 Oct 2012, the pharmacy that distributed the steroid, meant for back pain, has issued a voluntary recall of all of its products. The New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts, announced in a news release that the move was taken out of an abundance of caution because of the risk of contamination. It says there is no indication that any other products have been contaminated. The Food and Drug Administration had previously told health professionals not to use any products distributed by the center.\n\nThe outbreak is spread across 9 states, the same states previously reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Richard Blumenthal, from Connecticut, is calling for stronger government oversight of so-called 'compounding pharmacies'. Blumenthal said on Sun 7 Oct 2012, that he will be writing to FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg to ask for stricter scrutiny of such pharmacies.

Clinics and medical centers rushed to contact patients who may have received the apparently fungus-contaminated shots and the FDA urged doctors not to use any products at all from the Massachusetts pharmacy that supplied the suspect steroid solution. It is not clear how many patients received tainted injections, or even whether everyone who got one will get sick.\n\nSo far, 35 people in 6 states -- Tennessee (25), Virginia (4), Maryland (2), Florida (2), North Carolina (1) and Indiana (1) -- have contracted fungal meningitis, and 5 of them have died, according to the CDC. All had received steroid shots for back pain, a highly common treatment.\n\nIn an alarming indication the outbreak could get a lot bigger, Massachusetts health officials said the pharmacy involved, the New England Compounding Center [NECC] of Framingham, MA, has recalled 3 lots consisting of a total of 17 676 single-dose vials of the steroid, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate. An unknown number of those vials reached 75 clinics and other facilities in 23 states between July 2012 and September 2012, federal health officials said. Several hundred of the vials, maybe more, have been returned unused, a Massachusetts official said.\n\nBut many other vials were used. At a clinic in Evansville, Indiana, more than 500 patients got injections from the suspect lots, officials said. At 2 clinics in Tennessee, more than 900 patients, perhaps many more, did.\n\nThe investigation began about 2 weeks ago after a case was diagnosed in Tennessee. The time from infection to onset of symptoms is anywhere from a few days to a month, so the number of people stricken could rise.\n\nInvestigators this week found contamination in a sealed vial of the steroid at the New England company, according to FDA officials. Tests are under way to determine if it is the same fungus blamed in the outbreak. The company has shut down operations and said it is working with regulators to identify the source of the infection.\n\n'Out of an abundance of caution, we advise all health care practitioners not to use any product' from the company, said Ilisa Bernstein, director of compliance for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\n\nThe type of fungal meningitis involved is not contagious like the more common forms. It is caused by a fungus often found in leaf mold and is treated with high-dose antifungal medications, usually given intravenously in a hospital. The common mold _Aspergillus_ was cultured from 5 patients, the CDC said Thursday [4 Oct 2012].\n\nThe New England company is what is known as a compounding pharmacy. These pharmacies custom-mix solutions, creams, and other medications in doses or in forms that generally aren't commercially available. Other compounding pharmacies have been blamed in recent years for serious and sometimes deadly outbreaks caused by contaminated medicines. Compounding pharmacies are not regulated as closely as drug manufacturers, and their products are not subject to FDA approval.\n\nA national shortage of many drugs has forced doctors to seek custom-made alternatives from compounding pharmacies. The New England company at the center of the outbreak makes dozens of other medical products, state officials said. But neither the company nor health officials would identify them.\n\nThe company said in a statement Thursday [4 Oct 2012] that despite the FDA warning, 'there is no indication of any potential issues with other products.' It called the deaths and illnesses tragic and added: 'The thoughts and prayers of everyone employed by NECC are with those who have been affected.'\n\nA 2011 state inspection of the Framingham facility gave the business a clean bill of health.\n\n[Byline: Mike Stobbe]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This posting reports that 'smoking' drug, that is, isolation of the same organism from the alleged vehicle, has occurred. - Mod.LL]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 4 Oct 2012\nSource: CDC, Healthcare-associated Infections (HAIs) [edited]\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/HAI/outbreaks/meningitis.html\n\n\nCDC is coordinating a multistate investigation of meningitis among patients who received epidural steroid injections (medication injected into the spine).

Potential infectious causes may include fungal pathogens as well as less commonly identified bacteria. The following algorithm has been developed to help guide clinicians in their diagnostic work-up of a patient with meningitis of unknown etiology who meets the outbreak definition (1). These instructions are meant to supplement routine laboratory and microbiologic test deemed necessary by the clinical team and should not replace existing diagnostic protocol.\n\nCSF: When possible, collect large volume of CSF (10-20 mL) for testing. Please save a minimum of 10 mL of CSF to send to state health departments and CDC for further testing (2). This should be an unspun sample or a fresh unadulterated sample. In addition to routine gram stain and bacterial cultures (including aerobic and anaerobic), fungal and AFB smears and cultures should be obtained. All cultures should be held for at least 2-3 weeks prior to discarding\n\nSpecifically for the work-up of possible fungal pathogens:\n- If patients have intraventricular shunts/drains, obtain large volume of CSF to culture for fungi from this source.\n- Send CSF sample for _Aspergillus_ galactomannan assay if available (3).\n- Serum: send specimen for _Aspergillus_ galactomannan assay.\n- Other tests: in addition to routine blood cultures, consider obtaining fungal and AFB blood cultures. Other potentially infected fluid collections should be sampled (such as aspiration of epidural abscess) and sent for microbiologic testing as described above for CSF specimens (including fungal smear).\n- Tissue specimens (including post mortem specimens): any relevant tissue specimens sent for histopathology should be stained and reviewed for infectious agents, including fungi (silver stain). Please save specimens to send to state health departments and CDC for further evaluation (2). Please send available autopsy specimens to CDC for further evaluation.

However, a mold species has been isolated from CNS specimens from at least 2 patients linked to the outbreak, 1 of whom also had _Propionibacterium acnes_ of unclear clinical significance isolated from a postmortem CNS specimen. 2 additional patients have preliminary histopathologic evidence of fungal infection.\n\nWhen treating patients with meningitis who meet the outbreak case definition (1), clinicians should continue to follow routine treatment protocols for meningitis of unclear etiology, including covering for potential bacterial causes of meningitis. In addition, until the etiology is better defined, clinicians are encouraged to add empiric antifungal therapy to the treatment regimen because of the severe adverse outcomes of untreated fungal meningitis. CDC has consulted with national experts on the following guidance; these treatment options for fungal meningitis in patients associated with this cluster are interim, and may change as new information becomes available.\n\nInitiate empiric antifungal therapy using the following regimen:\n- At a minimum, all patients should receive voriconazole (if no contraindications), preferably at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours (IV initially) and to continue on this high dose for the duration of treatment, if possible. Periodic monitoring of serum concentration is advisable.\n- Consider combination therapy with liposomal amphotericin B (preferred over other lipid formulations), preferably at a higher dose of 7.5 mg/kg IV daily. If nephrotoxicity is a potential concern, particularly in older patients, the dose may be decreased to 5 mg/kg IV daily. Administration of 1 L normal saline prior to infusion may be considered to minimize risk of nephrotoxicity.\n- Avoid use of intrathecal amphotericin B, either the deoxycholate or the lipid formulations, due to limited data on its use and associated toxicities.\n\nThere is currently no clear evidence for the use of adjuvant steroid therapy. If used, careful monitoring of clinical status is warranted.\n\nAdequate duration of treatment is unknown but likely will require prolonged antifungal therapy (e.g., months) tailored by the clinical response to infection. Individual management decisions, including choice of long-term antifungal regimen, should be made in consultation with infectious disease physicians experienced in the treatment of fungal meningitis. Clinicians should be vigilant for potential relapse of infection.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. A person with meningitis of sub-acute onset (1-4 weeks) following epidural injection after 1 Jul 2012.

At least 64 cases in 9 states have been diagnosed with meningitis linked to the contaminated drugs, the CDC reported Sat 6 Oct 2012. Health experts expect more cases will be reported and are asking anyone who had a recent steroid injection for lower back pain to be on the lookout for headaches, stiff neck, unsteadiness, and other classic symptoms of meningitis.\n\n'All patients who may have received these medications need to be tracked down immediately. Patients can find the names of the clinics that used these medications on the CDC website,' said CDC's Dr. Benjamin Park, medical officer for the fungal diseases branch. 'It is possible that if patients with infection are identified soon and put on appropriate antifungal therapy, lives may be saved.'\n\nTennessee state health officials said 4 more people had been diagnosed there since Thu 4 Oct 2012, bringing that state's total cases to 29, with 3 deaths. Michigan is the latest to report cases, with 4 there. People with suspected fungal meningitis have been diagnosed in Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan and Indiana.\n\nThe drug is question is called methylprednisone and is used mostly to treat older patients for lower back pain. All the cases so far have been traced to a single pharmacy in Massachusetts that makes the drugs to order. The pharmacy has closed, surrendered its license, and recalled its products, FDA officials said. But they said hundreds of people could have been injected with contaminated steroids and possibly other products. The pharmacy could have shipped products to all 50 states. CDC listed the 75 clinics known to have received shipments of methylprednisolone from the pharmacy.\n\nTennessee Health Commissioner Dr. John Dreyzehner said the clinics that treated the patients are not to blame. 'Our continuing investigation found no lapses in process at the clinics,' Dreyzehner told reporters on Fri 5 Oct 2012. 'Evidence indicates these clinics and clinicians had no way of knowing about the contamination.'\n\n'Fungus has been identified in specimens obtained from 9 patients, including _Aspergillus_ and _Exserohilum_,' CDC said. Both types of fungus are found in back yards; _Exserohilum_ can cause leaf spot, but it has also been linked to skin and sinus infections. _Aspergillus_ causes lung infections in cancer, HIV, and other patients with suppressed immune systems. Some kind of fungal contaminant has been found in at least one vial of drugs made by the pharmacy. Fungi can grow in drugs that are not stored properly, especially those without preservatives, like those made by the compounding pharmacy.\n\n'Currently, we think that this type of meningitis is quite severe, as we have been describing here. The antifungal treatment for this is intravenous antifungal treatment and requires initial hospitalization. But the duration of antifungal therapy could be prolonged, possibly on the order of months,' Park said. To be especially careful, health officials have widened their warning to anyone who got a steroid injection in the spine between 1 Jul and 28 Sep 2012. 'Infected patients have presented approximately 1-4 weeks following their injection with a variety of symptoms, including fever, new or worsening headache, nausea, and new neurological deficits (consistent with deep brain stroke),' the FDA said in a statement on its website. 'Some of these patients' symptoms were very mild in nature.'\n\nThe FDA says there will be no shortage of methylprednisone. 'There are FDA approved versions of methylprednisolone acetate injection on the market, available with or without preservatives,' it said.\n\n'Although all cases detected to date occurred after injections with products from these 3 lots, out of an abundance of caution, CDC and FDA recommend that healthcare professionals cease use of any product produced by the New England Compounding Center until further information is available,' the FDA added. Among the other drugs from the pharmacy being recalled are 3 steroid drugs, betamethasone, a steroid usually given in creams or as a spray, dexamethasone and triamcinolone; 2 local anesthetics called lidocaine and bupivicaine; the blood pressure drug clonidine; and saline.\n\nCompounding pharmacies are not regulated as closely as drug manufacturers, and their products are not subject to FDA approval.\n\n[Byline: Maggie Fox]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As the number of cases continues to frighteningly rise, a 2nd mold, _Exserohilum_, has been reported to be involved.

Invasive meningococcal disease is a severe bacterial infection that has a high fatality rate. Within the past 4 weeks, there have been 4 cases; one died and one person is in critical care. The cases are spread across several boroughs and among men ages 31 to 42 years old.\n\nThe most recent 4 cases have all been among HIV-infected men. People living with HIV are at a greater risk than the general population of acquiring invasive meningococcal disease and if infected, dying from the infection. This disease is spread by prolonged close contact with nose or throat discharges from an infected person. Examples of prolonged contact include living in the same household or intimate activities, including kissing and sexual contact.\n\nCommon symptoms of meningitis are high fever, headache, stiff neck and rash that develop rapidly within 2 days. People that have been in prolonged close contact with infected people need to see their health care provider immediately to receive preventive antibiotics. Symptoms may occur 2 to 10 days after exposure, but usually within 5 days. People who experience symptoms should seek medical care immediately.\n\nMedia Contact: Jean Weinberg\n<Pressoffice@health.nyc.gov>\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 per cent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc. facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Invasive meningococcal disease carries a high mortality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.\n\nAt least 13 serogroups, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described: 5 serogroups (A, B, C, Y, & W-135) most commonly cause human disease. Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are caused by only a few clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the Hypervirulent Lineages of Neisseria meningitidis, the ST-8 and ST-11 Complexes, by Using Monoclonal Antibodies Specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003 August; 41(8): 3873-3876; Available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/). However, less virulent have been reported to cause invasive meningococcal disease in immune-compromised HIV-infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis 2011;15 (2); Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).\n\nWe are not told in the news reports above if there is any link among the 12 cases, other than they were men who have sex with men. The health department news release above only concerns the 4 most recent cases that are also HIV infected. We are not told the serotypes of the organisms involved in this outbreak in New York City; nor, if the serotype were the same, whether the isolates have the same genotype.\n\nWe are also not told the CD4 counts in the patients who have HIV co-infection. Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing invasive meningococcal disease (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial Meningitis in HIV-1-Infected Patients in the Era of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009 Aug 15;51(5):582-7).\n\nChemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone, is given to appropriate contacts whose risk for acquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among the total population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). Close contacts of patients are considered to be household members, day-care center contacts, and other persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of New York can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/3alU. - Mod.ML]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org However, less virulent have been reported to cause invasive meningococcal disease in immune-compromised HIV-infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I.

CDC's guidance to patients has not changed as a result of this voluntary recall. Patients who feel ill and are concerned about whether they received a medication from NECC should contact their physicians.\n\nClinicians should actively contact patients who have received medicines associated with 3 lots of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (80 mg/mL) recalled on 26 Sep 2012. The potentially contaminated injections were given starting 21 May 2012. Symptoms that should prompt diagnostic evaluation include: fever, new or worsening headache, neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, new weakness or numbness, increasing pain, redness or swelling of the injection site.\n\nWhat is causing these infections?\n---------------------------------\nThe infections are caused by a fungus. At this point, the original source of the outbreak has not been determined; however, all infected patients identified thus far have received preservative-free (PF) methylprednisolone acetate (80 mg/mL) from among the 3 lots voluntarily recalled by the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, MA.\n\nWhat should physicians be doing?\n--------------------------------\n1. Find out if you have administered a potentially contaminated medication from New England Compounding Center. The 3 potentially contaminated lots are:\nMethylprednisolone Acetate (PF) 80 mg/ml Injection, Lot No. 05212012@68, BUD 11/17/2012\nMethylprednisolone Acetate (PF) 80 mg/ml Injection, Lot No. 06292012@26, BUD 12/26/2012\nMethylprednisolone Acetate (PF) 80 mg/ml Injection, Lot No. 08102012@51, BUD 2/6/2013\n\n2. Contact patients who have been exposed. All patients who have received medication from 1 of these 3 lots should be immediately contacted directly (that is, called) to determine if they are having any symptoms. It is important to note that infected patients have presented with mild symptoms, only slightly worse than baseline.\n\n3. Refer symptomatic patients for a diagnostic procedure. For patients who received epidural injection with medication from the lots listed above and have any symptoms of meningitis or basilar stroke, a diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed, if not contraindicated. Because presenting symptoms of some patients with meningitis have been mild and not classic for meningitis (such as new or worsening headache without fever or neck stiffness), physicians should have a low threshold for LP.\n\nWhile CDC is only aware of infections occurring in patients who have received epidural steroid injections, patients who received other types of injection (such as joint injection) with potentially contaminated methylprednisolone acetate should also be contacted to assess for signs of infection (such as swelling, increasing pain, redness, warmth at the injection site) and should be encouraged to seek evaluation (such as an arthrocentesis) if such symptoms exist.\n\nInterim instructions regarding diagnostic testing and treatment options are available at http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/clinicians/index.html.\n\n4. Report concerning cases to public health. Physicians should report suspected cases to their state health department.\n\nClinicians are also requested to report any suspected adverse events following use of these products to FDA's MedWatch program at 1-800-332-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch.\n\nIs there a role for prophylaxis?\n--------------------------------\nCurrently, CDC emphasizes the need for rapid clinical evaluation and diagnosis, if indicated. Prophylaxis is not recommended at this time.\n\nIs there a role for lumbar puncture in asymptomatic patients?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nAt this time, CDC does not recommend performing lumbar puncture in exposed patients who are currently asymptomatic. These patients should be closely monitored for development of symptoms, with a low threshold for performing lumbar puncture if the patient should become symptomatic. The clinical investigation of patients associated with this outbreak is ongoing, and this recommendation may change as new information becomes available.\n\nWere the 3 lots mentioned above only used for spinal injections?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nNo. These medications were used for other types of injections, including injections into the joint (such as the knee). To date, CDC has only identified infections in patients who received epidural steroid injections with these medications. However, patients who received other types of injections with these products may also be at risk.\n\nWhat states have received the potentially contaminated medication?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n23 states have received medication from the New England Compounding Center:\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia\n\nThe names of the facilities that have received medication from one of these lots are available at http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/meningitis-facilities-map.html.\n\nAre other medications from the New England Compounding Center associated with infections?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nTo date, CDC has not received reports of infections linked to other products from the New England Compounding Center. However, out of an abundance of caution, CDC recommends that patients cease use of any product produced by the New England Compounding Center until further information is available. A list of products produced by the New England Compounding Center can be found through the FDA website at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm322734.htm.\n\nIf patients have taken or used medications from New England Compounding Center, and they are worried that they are ill because of use of one of these products, they should seek medical attention. Again, CDC has not received any reports of infection linked to other products from New England Compounding Center.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Other sites of infection may be recognized as the medication is used for indications outside epidural injection in sites such as joints.\n\nIt has not yet been reported from CDC what the date (or dates) of injection were and what the 1st day of symptoms.

Of these, 8 were linked to a recent travel history to Sub-Saharan Africa. These cases were reported in France concomitantly with the meningitis epidemic season in Sub-Saharan Africa. Considering the high number of travellers between France and West-African countries belonging to the so-called meningitis belt, the French recommendations for travellers stress the importance of vaccination before travelling to these countries.\n\nIn mid-February 2012, 2 W135 invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) cases were reported in 2 French regions (Pays de la Loire and Rhone-Alpes) in persons having recently returned from Senegal. The 1st case had arrived in France on [12 Feb 2012] and was hospitalised 3 days later. The 2nd case arrived on [19 Feb 2012] and was hospitalised on the same day. No connection could be established between the 2 cases but they had both visited the same region in Senegal (near Mbour) and they were both working with non-governmental organisations (NGOs).\n\nIn France, the annual mean incidence of IMD varies between 0.9 and 1.5 cases per 100 000 population. Cases are mainly due to serogroup B and C meningococci (65 percent and 27 percent respectively for the last 10 years). Serogroup W135 is rare in France; sporadic cases were reported in the 1990s (less than 5 cases per year) and they mainly belonged to the clonal complexes ST-11 and ST-22 (French National Reference Centre for Meningococci (NRCM), unpublished data). However, this serogroup underwent a clonal expansion in France and other European countries in 2000, during the 1st reported multinational outbreak of serogroup W135 _Neisseria meningitidis_ infections belonging to a particular clone of the ST-11 clonal complex. This outbreak started among pilgrims to Mecca and their contacts [1] and then affected Sub-Saharan countries (mainly Burkina Faso) [2,3]. Following a peak of incidence in 2002 with 42 reported cases, the incidence of W135 (ST-11) IMD cases decreased in France and the W135 cases were most frequently due to isolates belonging to the clonal complex ST-22 representing in 2011 less than 3 percent of the cases with known serogroup (14/542) (NRCM, unpublished data).\n\nInvestigation of W135 meningitis cases in 2012\n----------------------\nIn 2012, the epidemic meningitis season, which coincides annually with the dry season between December and June, had already started in the so-called meningitis belt when the 2 W135 cases imported from Senegal were notified. Therefore we collected information regarding recent travel for all the W135 IMD cases that occurred in France since the beginning of the year [2012].\n\nBetween [1 Jan 2012 and 1 Apr 2012], a total number of 16 IMD cases were notified in France. This is an important increase if compared to the previous 5 years when only 4 to 8 W135 cases were reported each year during the 1st 5 months.\n\nAll 16 cases reported this year were laboratory-confirmed through isolation of _N. meningitidis_, positive PCR or detection of _N. meningitidis_ antigens. The median age of cases was 45 years (range: 2 months to 89 years) and the M:F ratio was 9:7. None of the 16 cases had been vaccinated with a tetravalent A/C/Y/ W135 meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine.\n\nFor 8 of the 16 cases, a link to Sub-Saharan Africa was identified: 2 had returned from Senegal in February [2012], one had arrived from Mali 4 days before the disease onset and one arrived from Senegal 15 days before the disease onset. The other 4 cases did not travel during their incubation period but a recent travel history was found for their close contacts: to Benin for one case, to Mali for 2 cases and to Senegal for one case with dates of return to France within the 3 weeks before the disease onset of the case. The purpose of travel was visiting friends and relatives for 6 cases or contacts and working for NGOs for two.\n\nConsidering an incubation period of 10 days, the dates of arrival in France and onset of the disease, 3 of the 8 cases could be considered as imported. The remaining 5 cases may have been infected by asymptomatic contacts carrying an imported strain. However, strains were not investigated among contacts.\n\nAmong the 8 cases, 4 cases presented with meningitis, 2 with pneumonia and septicaemia, one with arthritis, and one with pericarditis. No death was registered among the cases.\n\nAs of 24 May 2012, no other W135 IMD case has been notified since 1 April 2012.\n\nAll 8 'possibly import-related' W135 IMD cases were caused by the same strain, characterised at the NRCM in Paris by multilocus sequence typing, PorA variable regions (VR1 and VR2), penA and fetA genes. The antigenic formula was W135:2a:P1-5,2, the genetic typing showed porA VR1=5, VR2=2, fetA=F1-1, penA=1, and the strains were ST-11.\n\nConclusions\n---------\nThe increase of serogroup W135 meningococcal disease incidence in France in early 2012 was concomitant to the meningitis epidemic season in Sub-Saharan Africa. From [1 Jan 2012 to 15 Apr 2012], almost 15 000 meningitis cases have been reported in West Africa to the World Health Organization. In some countries (e.g. Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger) the serogroup W135 was predominant among cases for which _N. meningitidis_ has been identified whereas serogroup A was predominant in other countries like Chad [4]. Serogroup W135 has increased in Niger in 2010 [5]. No laboratory results were available from Senegal.\n\nThe French NRCM typed 8 isolates from Cote d'Ivoire. These bacteria were isolated in February 2012 in 3 different districts of the country. All the isolates from France and Cote d'Ivoire shared the same tested markers (porA VR1=5, VR2=2, fetA=F1-1, penA=1, ST-11) (unpublished data). Eight other cases of W135 cases were also isolated in France during the same period but they reported no travel history during the previous 3 months. All these isolates also showed different markers (unpublished data).\n\nFurther investigations are required including typing isolates from other countries within the meningitis belt and comparing results with isolates from the previous years in order to help understanding this recent re-emergence of W135/ST-11 isolates. A long-lasting establishment of this serogroup in sub-Saharan African countries may prompt re-considering the vaccination strategies in the belt upon the introduction of the conjugate vaccine against serogroup A [6].\n\nIn the meantime, specific surveillance should be enhanced in Europe and recommendations for travellers who have contacts with population in high-incidence countries should be updated taking into account that non-pilgrimage-related travel is rarely associated with transmission and that the purposes of travel described above for the cases themselves or their asymptomatic contacts were visits to family members and friends or work for NGOs [7]. Since there are frequent travellers between France and West-African countries belonging to the meningitis belt, the French recommendations for travellers insist on the importance of vaccination with a quadrivalent A/C/Y/ W135 vaccine (preferably a conjugate vaccine) when travelling to these countries [8].\n\n[For References, see the URL for this article above.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] African Meningitis Belt\nDate: Thu 24 May 2012\nSource: WHO Global Alert and Response (GAR) [edited]\nhttp://www.who.int/csr/don/2012_05_24/en/index.html\n\n\nFrom [1 Jan 2012 to 17 Apr 2012] (epidemiologic week 17), outbreaks of meningococcal disease have been reported in 42 districts in 10 of the 14 countries of the African Meningitis Belt [with enhanced surveillance for meningococcal disease, which includes Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan and Togo]. These outbreaks have been detected as part of the enhanced surveillance.\n\nThe 10 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria and Sudan) reported a total of 11 647 meningitis cases including 960 deaths resulting in a case fatality ratio of 8.2 percent. The outbreaks were mainly caused by the W135 serogroup of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (Nm) bacteria.\n\nIn response to the outbreaks, the Ministries of Health implemented a series of preventive and control measures which included enhancement of surveillance, case management, sensitization of the population, strengthening of cross border collaboration and provision of vaccines through the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control (ICG).\n\nThe ICG released a total of 11 000 vials of antibiotic (Ceftriaxone) and 1 665 673 doses of vaccines to 6 countries [Table: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, and Ghana, where Nm serogroup W135 is said to have caused the epidemic; and Chad and Sudan, where Nm serogroup A is said to have caused the epidemic] most affected by the epidemic, upon requests. The vaccines released include 919 023 doses of polysaccharide ACW/ACYW vaccine, 746 650 doses of meningitis A conjugate vaccine and 81 418 doses of polysaccharide AC vaccine.\n\nThe ICG is working with manufacturers and partners to ensure the stockpiles of the appropriate vaccines are maintained in sufficient quantities, for responding effectively to epidemics in the future. ICG partners include WHO, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).\n\nThe emergency stockpile was established with the support of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). The vaccination campaigns were conducted with the support of MSF, UNICEF, IFRC, the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), and the United Nations through its Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).\n\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation closely, in collaboration with partners and Ministries of Health in the affected countries.\n\n[For Table, see the URL for this article above.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMed-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The sub-Saharan region of Africa is plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis. This region, known as the 'African Meningitis Belt,' stretches from the east to the west coast of Africa, and includes Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan and Togo (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm). The meningitis outbreaks occur in the dry season (December to June), and every 8-12 years large outbreaks occur (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis range from 100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as high as 1000 per 100 000 (World Health Organization: Meningococcal meningitis fact sheet: http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/FactSheet-Meningitis.pdf).\n\nThe following is extracted from the moderator's comments in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: (YO), susp. 20110524.1581:\n\n'Epidemic thresholds are used to confirm the emergence of an epidemic in order to step up control measures, that is, mass vaccination and appropriate case management. For definitions of epidemic thresholds, see http://www.who.int/disasters/repo/6618.doc.\n\n'To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). In 2009, meningococcal serogroups A and W135 were involved in outbreaks in Nigeria (see ProMED mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria (03) 20090509.1731). These serogroups cause meningitis that is potentially vaccine-preventable. However, in 2010, a new strain (serogroup X) of meningococcal meningitis emerged in Burkina Faso that led to huge outbreaks in that country, with 46 percent (6/13) of the regions in the country being at epidemic level. Serogroup X is one of those for which no vaccine exists. Niger, which borders the Yobe State of Nigeria, also experienced cases due to serogroup X in 2010 and experienced an epidemic of meningitis due to this strain in 2006 (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa (02): WHO meningitis region. 20100426.1343).'\n\nThere are at least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_ based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135. Capsular polysaccharide or protein conjugate vaccines are available to immunize against disease caused by serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains.\n\nThe meningococcal protein conjugate polysaccharide vaccines induce a T-cell-dependent response, resulting in an improved immune response in infants, provide long-lasting immunity, and prevent nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_, thus reducing transmission of this microorganism person-to-person (see http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf). A preventive strategy based on conjugate vaccines could have a significantly larger and more enduring impact on attempts to control the yearly recurrences of this disease in Africa that causes considerable morbidity and mortality, especially among children (see http://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/19745499/102).\n\nThere is no polysaccharide vaccine for disease caused by serogroup B. Because serogroup B polysaccharide resembles the human neural cell adhesion molecule, the serogroup B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic. A new protein-based, 4 component meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine has been developed that is hoped will be a broad-spectrum B vaccine (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease.

There are several different pathogenic serogroups of meningococcal bacteria including groups A, B, C, Y, and W135. These groups of bacteria can be further divided into specific strains.\n\n_N. meningitidis_ causes bacterial meningitis and sepsis. The bacteria are transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 per cent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone, living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc) facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/).

Tom Skinner, a CDC spokesman in Atlanta, said it would test a biopsy sample from the researcher and a sample of the laboratory pathogen he was working with to create fingerprints for each. 'If the fingerprints match, you know it's highly likely he acquired the infection from working in the lab,' he said. 'Someone getting sick and dying from the organism they're working with in the lab is exceedingly rare,' he added.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of people, including relatives, close friends, medical personnel who treated the researcher and some of his co-workers at the research department of the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center were being given antibiotics as a precaution.\n\nHarry Lampiris, chief of infectious disease at the San Francisco VA, said it is likely the researcher died as a result of his work with _Neisseria meningitidis_, a strain of bacteria that causes meningococcal disease, which leads to meningitis and bloodstream infections. 'It's our responsibility to assume it's laboratory-associated until proven otherwise,' he said.\n\nSince the 1960s, vaccines have been available for some strains of meningococcal disease. But scientists in the San Francisco lab have spent more than 20 years trying unsuccessfully to develop a vaccine against serogroup B, the strain that killed the researcher. 'It's been like the Holy Grail to develop the vaccine against [serogroup] B,' Lampiris said.\n\nThe researcher died of multiple organ failure caused by meningococcal infection and septic shock, said Eileen Shields, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Department of Public Health. He died less than a day after becoming ill. The disease can come on quickly with symptoms including high fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, rash, confusion and fatigue.\n\nLampiris said coworkers described the researcher, who began work at the lab in October, as 'a very talented, hard-working and fastidious individual. He was a very bright person who was probably at the beginning of a long research career,' he said.\n\nMeningitis, an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, commonly strikes infants and college students living in dormitories, Lampiris said. He said the researcher had not had contact with either group.\n\nAbout 1000 Americans each year suffer from meningococcal disease, and an estimated 10 to 15% die from it, Skinner said. He could not say how many of the cases resulted from serogroup B.\n\nThe California Division of Occupational Safety and Health is investigating the circumstances of the researcher's death, along with its federal counterpart and the CDC, the city Public Health Department and the San Francisco VA.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nRobert Spencer\n<Robert.Spencer@UHBristol.nhs.uk>\n\n\n[The following was extracted from a Journal Watch report on laboratory-acquired meningococcal disease\n(http://infectious-diseases.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2002/322/1):\n\n'_Neisseria meningitides_ causes bacterial meningitis and sepsis. Diagnosis is usually made by culturing the organisms on standard microbiologic media. Disease is most often acquired by inhalation, and microbiology personnel may be exposed when processing lab isolates. Following the deaths of 2 microbiologists in 2000 from meningococcal disease after occupational exposure, the CDC posted an Internet request for reports of similar cases of occupationally acquired meningococcal disease [see Laboratory-acquired meningococcal disease - United States, 2000. CDC MMWR 2002 Feb 22; 51(7): 141-4; available at\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5107a1.htm &\nSejvar JJ, et al: Assessing the risk of laboratory-acquired meningococcal disease. J Clin Microbiol 2005; 43(9): 4811-4; available at http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/43/9/4811.pdf].\n\n'A total of 16 cases were reported; 8 were from the USA. 9 (56 percent) were caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B and 7 (44 percent) by serogroup C. 8 patients (50 percent) died. Patients were exposed by reading plates (50 percent), making subcultures (50 percent), and performing serogroup identification (38 percent). All patients worked in microbiology labs. The risk for infection among microbiologists is estimated to be 7 times that among the general population (95 percent confidence interval, 1-19).\n\n'Comment: Although meningococcal disease is uncommon, microbiologists working with _N. meningitidis_ should take special care, because their infection risk is elevated, and the case-fatality rate is high. Most risk is likely associated with exposure to pure cultures rather than to patient samples. Precautions should include using a biosafety hood when manipulating isolates and wearing splash-guards and masks. When such protections are not available, isolates should be referred to other labs for serotyping. Vaccination of personnel may also be considered, but current meningococcal vaccines do not protect against disease from _N. meningitidis_ type B and thus will not eliminate risk for infection.\n- C Robert Horsburgh Jr, MD'\n\nThere are five common meningococcal serogroups: A, B, C, W135, and Y, and a sixth type (X) has recently emerged in Africa. Capsular polysaccharide or protein conjugate vaccines can immunize against disease caused by serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y. Serogroup B remains a major cause of severe invasive disease in infants and adolescents worldwide; but, because the serogroup B polysaccharide resembles the human neural cell adhesion molecule, the serogroup B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic. The MeNZB\u2122 vaccine previously used in New Zealand was developed to protect against a particular strain of meningococcal B disease in New Zealand. However, the MeNZB\u2122 vaccine only protected against this specific B strain, and did not protect against meningococcal A, C, Y or W135 or the many other strains of B.\n\nA new protein-based, 4 component meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine includes the New Zealand outbreak strain\u2019s outer membrane vesicle plus three semiconserved surface-protein antigens: factor-H binding protein variant 1(fHbp1), neisserial heparin binding antigen (NHBA), and neisserial adhesin A (NadA) is under study (Gossger N, Snape MD, Yu L-M, et al.

In some rare cases, it\nis drug-induced, caused by the administration of contaminated drugs,\nsuch as anaesthesia.\n\nMid DAY met one of the unlucky 11 [patients], who recently underwent a\nprocedure for ligament reconstruction. Soon after the surgery at KEM\nhospital, however, [the patient] started showing symptoms of high\nfever with chills and a headache. 'He fell unconscious and started\nconvulsing, as a result of which we had to admit him to the ICU,' said\na doctor. 'Ligament reconstruction allows a patient to go home hours\nafter the surgery. But [the patient] ended up with meningitis. The\ndoctors have clearly diagnosed him with post spinal meningitis,' said\na doctor.\n\nPost spinal meningitis is a rare medical complication caused by the\nintroduction of anaesthesia through the spine. The disease may be\ncaused by the mechanism of administration, the contamination of\nequipment used, or the contamination of the drug itself.\n\n[The patient], who has been kept under observation is now undergoing\nrigorous antibiotic treatment to cure him. 'The doctor had told us\nthat I could go home on the very day of the surgery, so I was shocked\nwhen I ended up in the ICU,' said [the patient] who still suffers from\nheadaches.\n\nBesides [this patient], 10 other patients who were admitted to the\nhospitals to be cured of sundry ailments ended up contracting the\ndeadly disease. 3 of them were new mothers, who had undergone\nC-section deliveries. Out of the 11 patients, 4 cases each have been\nreported in Sion and Bhabha hospital, while the 3 others were admitted\nat KEM for treatment.\n\nOf the 4 cases reported at Sion hospital, 2 patients were critical,\nbut were pulled out of infection after rigorous antibiotic treatment.\nThe others are also stable after receiving treatment.\n\nCiron supplies approximately 2 lakh ampules of bupivacaine annually,\nto various civic hospitals. Dr Sanjay Oak, dean of KEM hospital and\ndirector of major civic hospitals, said, 'I have received the\ncomplaints. Anaesthesiologists suspect that an anaesthetic drug used\nduring procedures is causing the disease. We will refer this matter to\nthe FDA. To prevent other casualties, we have stopped using the drugs\nbeing delivered by the company to our hospitals.'\n\nDr Shashikant Wadekar, medical superintendent, Bhabha hospital, said,\n'After our anaesthesiologists brought this anomaly to my notice, we\nstopped using the drug. All the 4 patients had developed post spinal\nmeningitis, but we treated them here. They are now stable.'\n\nDr Sandhya Kamat, dean of Sion hospital, said, 'After doctors\ncontended that the anaesthesia could be responsible for the\nmeningitis, we had sent samples of it to FDA for examination. They\nhave [confirmed] that it is a standard sample of the drug. However, as\na precautionary measure, we have discarded the drug received from our\npharmaceutical company, and have got another sample from a different\ncompany.'\n\nDr Ami Merchant, consultant anaesthesiologist at Lilavati hospital\nsaid, 'Bupivacaine is a very common drug used as spinal anaesthesia.\nIt is very safe. Incidence of drug-induced meningitis is very rare.\nThere are several ways in which one can contract post-operative\nmeningitis. In some cases, doctors fail to follow strict aseptic\nprocedures and equipment, like using antiseptic masks and gear, or\nsterile gloves. In other cases, the contamination of a drug during\nmanufacture can ultimately be responsible for the disease. The\noccurrence of 11 cases over 5 months needs to be studied.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate Sat 12 Nov 2011\nSource: MidDay [edited]\nhttp://www.mid-day.com/news/2011/nov/121111-mumbai-After-meningitis-cases-FDA-inspects-pharma-plant.htm\n\n\nAfter Mid DAY's [report] on 11 patients who contracted meningitis\nafter being administered local anaesthetic drug bupivacaine at 3 civic\nhospitals, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has inspected the\nmanufacturing plant of Ciron Pharmaceuticals, which supplies the drug\nto the hospitals. It is also collecting bupivacaine samples from the\nfacilities for testing them.\n\nCivic doctors said they were shocked over the apathy of the\nadministration. 'Even if there was the slightest of doubt about the\nanaesthetic, the BMC hospitals should have stopped the drugs, instead\nof waiting for 11 patients to get meningitis,' said a senior doctor\nrequesting anonymity.\n\nThey also claimed they were compelled to use the drug despite having\ndoubts as a circular from the director's office prohibited them from\nprescribing it from pharmacies outside. After 2 cases of meningitis\nsurfaced from Sion hospital, the doctors suspected that the drugs had\na role to play in the infection and alerted the FDA, which checked the\ndrugs and gave it a clean chit.\n\nK B Shende, joint commissioner, FDA (drugs), said, 'Sion hospital had\ngiven us the drugs for examination earlier.

Intrathecal\ndrug administration means the introduction of a drug by injection into\nthe subarachnoid space around the spinal cord. Drug may also enter the\nsubarachnoid space inadvertently after injection into the epidural\nspace.\n\nMeningitis that follows drug administration by lumbar puncture can be\neither 'septic' or 'aseptic.' The term 'septic meningitis' is used to\nindicate that infectious agents such as bacteria were introduced\nintrathecally at the time of the lumbar puncture. The term 'aseptic\nmeningitis' following intrathecal drug administration usually refers\nto meningitis due to the drug itself or due to a chemical contaminant\nof the drug or the equipment used to administer the drug.\n\nThe clinical presentation of drug-induced aseptic meningitis is very\nsimilar to that of the septic variety, with fever, headache, stiff\nneck, and changes in mental status; the prognosis of drug-induced\naseptic meningitis is generally excellent with complete long-term\nrecovery. A hypersensitivity mechanism is invoked to explain\ndrug-induced aseptic meningitis.\n\nThere are several reports in the literature of drug-induced aseptic\nmeningitis associated with intrathecal administration of bupivacaine\n(http://www.hopkinsguides.com/hopkins/ub/citation/17641986/[Bupivacaine_induced_aseptic_meningitis]_,\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17641986,\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20306069, and\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19653822).

The DHB [District Health Boards] will liaise with\ncommunity groups, employers and tertiary institutions to get to that\ngroup.\n\n'Initially, the programme will be offered to high school students in\nthe highest risk areas progressively over the 2 weeks from 26 Sep\n2011,' Dr Mills said. 'With exams coming up, it's important to get\nthat group vaccinated before the exam season starts.'

Viral infections are the most common\ncause of meningitis. Viral ('aseptic') meningitis is serious but\nrarely fatal in people with normal immune systems. Usually, the\nsymptoms last from 7 to 10 days, and the patient recovers completely.\n\nDifferent viral infections can lead to viral meningitis. But most\ncases, particularly during the summer and autumn months, are caused\nby enteroviruses (which include enteroviruses, coxsackieviruses, and\nechoviruses). Most people who are infected with enteroviruses either\nhave no symptoms or only get a cold, rash, or mouth sores with\nlow-grade fever. And, only a small number of people with enterovirus\ninfections develop meningitis.\n\nEnteroviruses, the most common cause of viral meningitis, are most\noften spread through direct contact with an infected person's faeces.\nThe virus is spread through this route mainly among small children\nwho are not yet toilet trained. It can also be spread this way to\nadults changing the diapers of an infected infant.\n\nEnteroviruses and other viruses (such as mumps and varicella-zoster\nvirus) can also be spread through direct or indirect contact with\nrespiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an\ninfected person. The viruses can also stay on surfaces for days and\ncan be transferred from objects. Viruses also can spread directly\nwhen infected people cough or sneeze and send droplets containing the\nvirus into the air we breathe. The time from when a person is\ninfected until they develop symptoms (incubation period) is usually\nbetween 3 and 7 days for enteroviruses. An infected person is usually\ncontagious from the time they develop symptoms until the symptoms go\naway.

'The Colorado Department\nof Public Health and Environment's lab has confirmed that the\nbacteria that caused the recent infection were Group C meningococcal\nbacteria (also called _Neisseria meningitidis_, serogroup C). In\naddition, special molecular 'fingerprinting' tests (called PFGE\n[pulsed field gel electrophoresis] tests) allowed them to confirm 8\nof these cases were caused by identical strains.'\n\nFour of the 8 cases reported in Larimer County since May 2010 have been fatal.\n\nThe most recent case was a CSU student who was hospitalized in early\nDecember 2010 with a meningococcal disease. He was released from\nPoudre Valley Hospital about a week later and is believed to be doing\nwell at his parents' home out of state.\n\nThe linked cases include illnesses that killed a Metro State College\n[student] in April 2010; caused a disabling case of meningitis in a\nCSU student in May 2010; led to 3 fatal meningococcal cases among 3\nFort Collins hockey players in June 2010; caused a less severe case\nin a hockey player's child in August 2010; and killed a CSU student\nin October 2010.\n\n'We have looked at a number of connections between all the cases,'\nsaid Dr. Adrienne LeBailly, director of the Larimer County Health\nDepartment.

The increased pressure causes the head to swell and damages\nbrain tissue. Treatment includes placing a shunt to drain the fluid,\nbut inevitably these shunts become plugged and require emergency\ncare, not always available in rural Africa and other resource-limited\nregions of the developing world. Surgeons vigorously explore the use\nof new brain endoscopes to divert fluid buildup internally in such\nchildren, but this approach addresses the fluid and does not fix\nprevious infection damage to the brain.\n\n'Brains of children with hydrocephalus can be completely or mostly\ndestroyed either by the scarring from the disease or by the pressure\nof the cerebrospinal fluid that cannot escape,' said Schiff. 'Many of\nthese children with the worst aftereffects of infection will be\nmentally deficient and survive only as long as their mothers can\nadequately care for them. Understanding the causes could eliminate or\nprevent the enormous costs to lives and families that hydrocephalus brings.'\n\nHydrocephalus in infants in sub-Saharan Africa is thought to be\ncaused most often by meningitis-type infections during the 1st month\nof life. The U.S. and Ugandan researchers looked at the fluid from\nthe brains of 3 sets of 25 consecutive infant hydrocephalus patients\nduring January, July and October [2010] to try to determine the cause\nof the disease. By the time parents bring infants with rapidly\ngrowing heads to the CURE Children's Hospital in Mbale, Uganda, the\nunderlying infection is gone. The researchers were unable to culture\nany bacteria from the samples.\n\nTo identify traces of previous bacterial infection, the researchers\nused DNA sequencing to look for 16S ribosomal DNA that exists in all\nbacteria. They reported their findings in the current issue of the\nJournal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics [Lingling L, et al. Association\nof bacteria with hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants. J Neurosurg\nPediatrics 2011; 70:73-87. Available at:\n<http://www.esm.psu.edu/wiki/_media/research:sjs49:li_et_al_association_of_bacteria_with_hydrocephalus_in_ugandan_infants_j_neurosurg_peds_2011.pdf>],\nshowing that 94 percent of the samples contained bacterial remnants.\nThe researchers found a seasonal difference between samples\nrepresenting infection during the dry season that were predominantly\nBetaproteobacteria and [infection during the rainy season that were\npredominantly Gammaproteobacteria]. [Betaproteobacteria is a class of\nGram-negative bacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria, which includes\n_Burkholderia_ and _Neisseria meningitidis_, and Gammaproteobacteria\nis a class of Gram-negative bacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria,\nwhich includes _Pseudomonas_, _Escherichia_, and _Acinetobacter_.]\n_Acinetobacter_ appeared in the majority [95 percent according to the\nLingling et al J Neurosurg Pediatrics study] of patients following\nrainy season infection. Some sequences that appeared in the DNA\nanalysis were from unknown bacteria, and in many cases, the bacterial\nfragments were not identifiable as to the type of _Acinetobacter_\nthey represented.\n\nIn the United States and other industrialized countries, infant\nhydrocephalus is usually due to either a congenital anomaly or, in\nlow birth weight premature infants, due to brain hemorrhages from\nimmature blood vessels. At one time, Group B _Streptococcus_ was a\ncommon cause of postinfectious hydrocephalus in infants in\nindustrialized countries, but now physicians test mothers for the\ninfection and treat with antibiotics before they give birth, and the\ninfections are rare. Surprisingly, according to Schiff, in Uganda,\nnone of the remnant DNA in the infants was from Group B _Streptococcus_.\n\nLooking for the source of the neonatal infections, the researchers\ntargeted the living environment from infants with evidence of prior\n_Acinetobacter_ infection and located patients' homes. What they\nfound were villages of huts where cow dung was pounded into the hut\nfloors to keep water and ants out and used in patios around the huts\nwhere vegetation is cleared to protect against snakes. Newborns enter\nan environment where they not only live near animals but also are\nsurrounded by their material.\n\nThe researchers sampled both the cow dung floors and excrement from\ncattle, goats and chickens. They found similar genetic sequences from\nthe bacteria retrieved from the infants as in the hut floors and\nnearby dung. 'It is really hard to keep infants to an adequate\nstandard of cleanliness in this environment,' said Schiff. 'The\nbacteria we found reflects, I think, a significant environmental\ninfluence.' While the researchers have not yet proven that these\nbacterial infections are the cause of the devastating hydrocephalus\noccurrences, they believe that in part, bacterial infections from\nanimals are the cause.\n\nHistorically, certain East African peoples have applied cow dung to\nstem bleeding in umbilical cord stumps, which caused newborn\ninfections. Although such infections are now rare, the scope of\nnewborn bacterial infections related to living in close proximity to\ndomestic animals remains poorly categorized.\n\n'As far as we can tell, these types of environmental newborn\ninfections are the dominant cause of hydrocephalus on the planet,'\nsaid Schiff. 'We may be dealing with bacteria that we can't culture,\nviruses or parasites, and we may be dealing with different organisms\nin different locations.'\n\nThe researchers are continuing their work and forming an African\nHydrocephalus Consortium with Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia.\nThey are conducting follow-up clinical trials at the Mbarara\nUniversity of Science and Technology in southwest Uganda on\nmother-infant pairs with new neonatal infections, and at the CURE\nChildren's Hospital of Uganda on older infants with postinfectious\nhydrocephalus. These trials use next-generation technologies and high\nquality microbiology to sort out the causative agents affecting these\ninfants. They are also continuing to explore the environmental\nconnection so that public health strategies toward preventing the\ninitial infections might be found.\n\n[Byline: A'ndrea Elyse Messer]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nThomas James Allen\n<tjallen@pipeline.com>\n\n[Hydrocephalus, which is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal\nfluid (CSF) in the brain, is a recognized post-infectious\ncomplication in survivors of neonatal meningitis.

By 9 Aug 2010, 114 cases had been notified. Most of the cases were\nregistered in the city and amalgamated municipality of Daugavpils and\nneighbouring territories. According to current evidence, 2 types of\nenteroviruses, coxsackie A-9 virus and echovirus 30, are the causative\nagents of the outbreak.\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\nA large aseptic meningitis outbreak caused by at least 2 enteroviruses\n(coxsackie A-9 virus and echovirus 30) is still ongoing in the\nsouth-eastern part of Latvia. The epidemiological pattern of the outbreak\n(age and sex distribution of cases) corresponds to the usual characteristic\nof the enteroviral infection, with the majority of cases in males and young\nchildren or adolescents. The incidence of aseptic meningitis was high in\n2006 and 2007, and low in 2008 and 2009. Although in previous non-epidemic\nyears (2007-2009), seasonal increases of enteroviral meningitis began in\nMay to June, this year [2010] the outbreak started later, at the end of June.\n\nIn view of the seasonal character (summer-autumn) of enteroviral infections\nand taking into account reopening of schools after the summer holidays,\nfurther spread, importation, and transmission of infection to other Latvian\nregions cannot be excluded. The risk of international spread is assessed as\nnot significant. Further monitoring and data analysis are to be performed\non a regular basis.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Latvia can be accessed at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/02yo>. - Mod.CP]\n\n******\n[2] Serbia\nDate: Thu 12 Aug 2010\nSource: Eurosurveillance edition 2010; 15(32) [edited]\n<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19638>\n\n\nOngoing outbreak of aseptic meningitis associated with echovirus 30 in the\ncity of Novi Sad, Autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia, Jun-Jul 2010\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n[authors: G Cosic 1, P Duric 1, V Milosevic 2, J Dekic 1, G Canak 3, V\nTurkulov3\n1.

From 2 Jun to 25 Jul 2010, 80\ncases of aseptic meningitis were notified, with an incidence rate ranging\nfrom 10 to 366 per 100 000 population in different local communities. The\nmajority of cases (n=64) were aged between 2 and 15 years. Echovirus 30 was\ncultured from 2 of 4 cerebrospinal fluid specimens. The outbreak, for which\nno common source has yet been identified, is ongoing.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nOutbreaks of aseptic enteroviral meningitis are notified in the Autonomous\nProvince of Vojvodina every 4 to 5 years. The largest previous outbreak\noccurred in 2000, with 461 cases reported that year (the incidence rate in\nthe province was 23 per 100 000 population and incidence rate in the City\nof Novi Sad was 28 per 100 000 population). Outbreaks of aseptic\nenteroviral meningitis were notified in all neighbouring countries\n(Croatia, Hungary, and Romania) in the last 2 decades. In Kosovo under\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, an outbreak with a total\nof 878 cases of acute neurological syndrome was reported in 2006 to the\nWorld Health Organization Regional Office for Europe: enteroviral origin\nwas detected. Enteroviral meningitis outbreaks involved many communities\nthroughout other countries within Europe and also other continents.\n\nAs expected in temperate climate, the ongoing outbreak has occurred in hot\nsummer months, spreading by direct or indirect contact. Although none of\nthe common sources (contaminated food or water) has yet been implicated,\nsince viral meningitis outbreaks are sometimes associated with recreational\nuse of water, the use of public swimming pools had been considered a\npotential source of infection in this outbreak but no such exposure of\ncases has been identified.\n\nPreviously reported outbreaks of enteroviral meningitis have demonstrated a\npredominance of males in child cases, with a sex ratio of 2:1. Our findings\nare consistent with this. They are also in line with these reports that\nfind a large proportion (70 per cent) of cases under 15 years of age, but\nthere was a higher incidence rate (149 per 100 000 population) in children\naged 5-15 years.\n\nAccording to its epidemiological features, this outbreak is likely to\ncontinue towards the autumn months. No specific control measures are\navailable for non-polio enteroviruses. Good personal and communal hygiene\nis recommended (thorough hand washing as a routine practice, prompt and\nsafe disposal of waste and faeces, and prompt washing or disposal of the\nsoiled articles in preschool and nursery facilities), as well as\ndisinfection of contaminated surfaces with household cleaning products, and\navoidance of shared utensils and drinking containers. All susceptible\npeople and parents of young children are advised to ask for medical help\nimmediately when there is onset of sudden headaches, fever, nausea, and\nvomiting.\n\nA 3-step model has been suggested for diagnostic procedures in order to\nensure comprehensive diagnostic investigation, including local medical\ninvestigation and usual analysis (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and\nserology) of acute cases, then as a 2nd step, extended analysis of\nsuspected cases by a reference laboratory for commonly recognised causative\nagents (or less common agents if indicated, such as, in returning\ntravellers), and finally identification of specific pathogens in cases with\nunknown aetiology.\n\nMonitoring circulating enteroviruses is important because individual\nserotypes have different temporal patterns of circulation and the changes\nin predominant serotypes can be accompanied by large-scale outbreaks of\nenteroviral illnesses. Environmental surveillance has been used\nsuccessfully in monitoring enterovirus circulation and assessing the extent\nor duration of epidemic non-poliovirus enteroviruses in specific populations.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Serbia can be accessed at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/02yq>.\n\nViral ('aseptic') meningitis is serious but rarely fatal in people with\nnormal immune systems. Usually, the symptoms last from 7 to 10 days and the\npatient recovers completely. Different viral infections can lead to viral\nmeningitis. But most cases, particularly during the summer and fall months,\nare caused by enteroviruses (which include enteroviruses, coxsackieviruses,\nand echoviruses). Most people who are infected with enteroviruses either\nhave no symptoms or only get a cold, rash, or mouth sores with low-grade\nfever. And, only a small number of people with enterovirus infections\ndevelop meningitis.\n\nEnteroviruses, the most common cause of viral meningitis, are most often\nspread through direct contact with an infected person's stool. The virus is\nspread through this route mainly among small children who are not yet\ntoilet trained. It can also be spread this way to adults changing the\ndiapers of an infected infant.\n\nEnteroviruses and other viruses can also be spread through direct or\nindirect contact with respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal\nmucus) of an infected person. This usually happens through kissing or\nshaking hands with an infected person or by touching something they have\nhandled and then rubbing your own nose or mouth. The viruses can also stay\non surfaces for days and can be transferred from objects. Viruses also can\nspread directly when infected people cough or sneeze and send droplets\ncontaining the virus into the air we breathe.\n\nThe time from when a person is infected until they develop symptoms\n(incubation period) is usually between 3 and 7 days for enteroviruses.

Although none of\nthe common sources (contaminated food or water) has yet been implicated,\nsince viral meningitis outbreaks are sometimes associated with recreational\nuse of water, the use of public swimming pools had been considered a\npotential source of infection in this outbreak but no such exposure of\ncases has been identified. Good personal and communal hygiene\nis recommended (thorough hand washing as a routine practice, prompt and\nsafe disposal of waste and faeces, and prompt washing or disposal of the\nsoiled articles in preschool and nursery facilities), as well as\ndisinfection of contaminated surfaces with household cleaning products, and\navoidance of shared utensils and drinking containers. In Kosovo under\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, an outbreak with a total\nof 878 cases of acute neurological syndrome was reported in 2006 to the\nWorld Health Organization Regional Office for Europe: enteroviral origin\nwas detected. The epidemiological pattern of the outbreak\n(age and sex distribution of cases) corresponds to the usual characteristic\nof the enteroviral infection, with the majority of cases in males and young\nchildren or adolescents. \n\nMonitoring circulating enteroviruses is important because individual\nserotypes have different temporal patterns of circulation and the changes\nin predominant serotypes can be accompanied by large-scale outbreaks of\nenteroviral illnesses. They are also in line with these reports that\nfind a large proportion (70 per cent) of cases under 15 years of age, but\nthere was a higher incidence rate (149 per 100 000 population) in children\n In view of the seasonal character (summer-autumn) of enteroviral infections\nand taking into account reopening of schools after the summer holidays,\nfurther spread, importation, and transmission of infection to other Latvian\nregions cannot be excluded. \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< All susceptible\npeople and parents of young children are advised to ask for medical help\nimmediately when there is onset of sudden headaches, fever, nausea, and\nvomiting. From 2 Jun to 25 Jul 2010, 80\ncases of aseptic meningitis were notified, with an incidence rate ranging\nfrom 10 to 366 per 100 000 population in different local communities. A large aseptic meningitis outbreak caused by at least 2 enteroviruses\n(coxsackie A-9 virus and echovirus 30) is still ongoing in the\nsouth-eastern part of Latvia. Although in previous non-epidemic\nyears (2007-2009), seasonal increases of enteroviral meningitis began in\nMay to June, this year [2010] the outbreak started later, at the end of June.

An outbreak of aseptic meningitis has been ongoing in several areas of\nLatgale region, in the south-eastern part of Latvia since the end of June\n2010. Outbreaks of aseptic\nenteroviral meningitis were notified in all neighbouring countries\n(Croatia, Hungary, and Romania) in the last 2 decades. According to current evidence, 2 types of\nenteroviruses, coxsackie A-9 virus and echovirus 30, are the causative\nagents of the outbreak.

Health\nofficials said today [23 Jun 2010] they have traced the bacteria to a\ndeath in Denver in April [2010].\n\nOfficials are speculating that players at the end of a [9 Jun 2010]\nhockey game in Fort Collins removed their mouth guards, then shook\nhands, spreading the bacteria through saliva on their hands, said\nJane Viste, a spokeswoman for the Larimer County Department of Health\nand Environment. Since meningitis is spread through contact with\ninfected saliva or nasal fluids, it is also possible that this\noutbreak was transmitted through spitting during the game or sharing\nof water bottles, she said. 'This clustering among the hockey players\nis very unusual,' said Dr Adrienne LeBailly, the department's director.\n\n[N.S., a] 28-year-old mechanical engineer whose wife is 6 months\npregnant, died Tuesday [? 22 Jun 2010]. Another hockey player, B.W.,\na 29-year-old father of 2, died on 14 Jun 2010. A 3rd hockey player,\nW.J., remained hospitalized in critical condition in Montana, where\nhe had been vacationing, Karen Ogden, a spokeswoman for Benefis\nHealth System Hospital in Great Falls, Montana, told AOL News.\n\nThe 4th person, a Colorado State University [CSU] student who has not\nbeen publicly identified was transferred to a hospital in Denver\nafter falling ill during Memorial Day weekend [29-31 May 2010], Viste\nsaid. Although B.W.'s wife works at CSU, the connection between the\nhockey players and the ill CSU student is unknown and possibly\nremote, Viste said.\n\nWhat is known is that the bacteria responsible for 4 of the 5 cases\nare genetically identical, meaning they come from the same source.\nThe test results for W.J. haven't been sent from Montana to Fort\nCollins yet, but they are likely to be genetically identical to the\nothers, officials said.\n\n'Even with this information, we will be very unlikely to tie the\ncases together directly,' LeBailly said. 'Many people carry these\nbacteria in their throats but have no symptoms.'\n\nLess than 1 percent of the people who harbor the bacteria become ill,\nbut they can transmit it to others. The bacteria can cause either\nmeningitis, an infection of the membranes covering the brain and\nspinal cord, or sepsis, an infection of the bloodstream.\nMeningococcal sepsis has a mortality rate of up to 15 percent or\nmore, Viste said.\n\nCounty health officials are vaccinating all Fort Collins Adult Hockey\nLeague players. So far, 65 people have received preventative\nantibiotics, and about 55 have received vaccinations, Viste said.\nCollege students are routinely advised to get vaccinated for\nmeningitis before attending school.\n\nOfficials are optimistic the outbreak might be over. 'Enough time has\npassed for the incubation period, and we've seen no new cases, so\nthat's very good news for now,' Viste said.\n\nIronically, Fort Collins, a community of 120 000 residents 65 miles\n[105 km] north of Denver, is home to one of the research laboratories\nof the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n[Byline: Karen Schwartz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Fort Collins, the location for 4 of the 5 cases of meningitis due to\na genetically identical strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ , is home\nto Colorado State University (CSU). The city is the county seat of\nLarimer County, Colorado and is located about 60 miles north of the\nColorado State Capitol in Denver\n(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Collins,_Colorado>). Three of the\nFort Collins cases occurred among adult hockey league players who\nparticipated in a game on 9 Jun 2010 in Fort Collins; the 4th Fort\nCollins case, apparently unrelated to hockey playing, occurred in CSU\nstudent in late May 2010. The 5th case, whose epidemiologic link to\nthe other cases is apparently unknown, occurred in Denver in April 2010.\n\n_N. meningitidis_ causes bacterial meningitis and sepsis. The\nbacteria are transmitted from person to person via droplets of\nrespiratory secretions mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal\ncarriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25\npercent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time,\nand the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations.\nClose and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing and coughing\non someone, living in close quarters or dormitories (military\nrecruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc.)\nfacilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period\nfor meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days\n(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>).\n\nEach year, up to 3000 people in the USA develop meningococcal\ndisease. The annual incidence generally ranges from 0.5 to 1.1 cases\nper 100 000.

The trip was organized through a social networking site.\nApproximately 200 Grade 11 and 12 students departed Vancouver on 25\nMar 2010 and returned on 2 Apr 2010. Students were predominantly from\nhigh schools in the Vancouver region, although some participants were\nfrom schools in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nIn total, 23 students were reported as having presented to physician\noffices or emergency rooms between 6 Apr and 25 Apr 2010 with\nsymptoms including fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and sore neck. 5\nwere hospitalized for a period of 2 to 10 days. Severity of symptoms\nvaried substantially, but all students recovered. We undertook an\naggressive laboratory search for the etiology given the serious\nillness being seen in the affected students and the continued spread\nto non-traveler contacts. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from\n3 patients and tested for bacterial and viral agents of meningitis.\nAll culture and PCR tests for bacterial meningitis and herpes simplex\nvirus were negative. CSF samples were positive for enterovirus by\nRT-PCR in 2 of the 3 cases. A stool sample from one of the cases was\nalso positive for enterovirus by RT-PCR.\n\nCases were 14 to 18 years old and most were males from the same high\nschool. 7 cases presenting from 6 to 13 Apr 2010 had participated in\nthe trip to the Dominican Republic. These included 2 hospitalized\ncases, one of whom was positive for enterovirus in CSF and stool\nsamples. 16 cases who had not participated in the trip were reported\nfrom 13 to 25 Apr 2010. Investigation of exposures revealed that\nthese were close contacts or schoolmates of cases who had travelled.\n\nIn particular, 8 cases were members of a sports team who attended a\ngame together on 10 Apr 2010. Among these, one case had travelled to\nthe Dominican Republic and reported sharing drinks with a team member\nwho subsequently was admitted to hospital and tested positive for\nenterovirus in a CSF sample. 6 others were likely secondary or\ntertiary transmissions within this group, and the remaining case was\nreported at another game one week later.\n\nAlthough not all students presenting with illness were found to have\nsymptoms of meningitis, they all had symptoms consistent with\nenterovirus infection. Initially, a notice recommending ill students\nto seek medical attention was sent to trip participants through the\nsocial networking site. Prevention messages recommending\nhand-washing, respiratory etiquette, avoiding contact with saliva and\nstaying home when ill were distributed to school districts and health\nauthorities on 9, 13 and 19 Apr 2010. At the school where most cases\nattended, disinfection of commonly touched surfaces began on 19 Apr 2010.\n\nThis outbreak of meningitis generated considerable anxiety among the\ntrip participants and their parents particularly when the etiology\nwas unknown and early cases were treated empirically with\nantibiotics.

These microorganisms infect the blood\nand the cerebrospinal fluid. Viral meningitis is generally less\nsevere and resolves without specific treatment. Viral meningitis\n(also called aseptic meningitis) is an infection that causes\ninflammation of the layers (meninges) that surround the brain and\nspinal cord. Many different viruses can cause meningitis; the most\ncommon are the enteroviruses. These viruses are present in the\nintestines and can cause colds, sore throats, stomach upsets and\ndiarrhoea. Only rarely do these viruses spread through the body to\nthe meninges causing meningitis.\n\nEnteroviruses are most often spread from person to person through\nfecal contamination, and through respiratory secretions (saliva,\nsputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person. When an enterovirus\ncausing meningitis is identified, it is usually either a\ncoxsackievirus or an echovirus.\n\nIndividuals and parties visiting countries with less well-developed\neconomies and variable standards of personal and community hygiene\nare likely to expose themselves to common enteric viruses to which\nthey have little preexisting immunity. This is evident in the party\nof children from Canada visiting the Dominical Republic and spreading\ninfection in their home country on their return.

Of\nBurkina Faso's 13 regions 6 are at epidemic level. Since the\nbeginning of 2010, 5118 cases of meningitis have been reported, and\n718 people have died according to the health ministry. Health\nMinister Seydou Bouda told reporters at a press conference on 22 Apr\n[2010] that strain X was not 'well-known in Burkina.' Meningitis --\ntransmitted by nose and throat secretions -- usually spreads across\nsub-Saharan West Africa in the dry months from December to June.\n\nTen cases of the strain have been reported in Niger according to Dr\nMamadou Djingarey, a World Health Organization (WHO) official in the\ncapital, Ouagadougou. Niger experienced an epidemic of strain X in\n2006. Strain X is 'no more worrying than other meningitis strains,'\nthe official told IRIN; strain A is the most lethal of the 12\nmeningitis strains, according to WHO.\n\nStrain X has been reported in 14 of Burkina Faso's 65 districts.\nBouda said the symptoms of the new strain were the same as other\nstrains -- sudden fever, headache, and vomiting -- while children\nless than one year old might experience swelling in their head\n[bulging of the anterior frontanelle].\n\nAcross West Africa, some 14 700 meningitis cases and 1650 deaths were\nreported between 1 Jan and 11 Apr 2010, according to the most recent\nWHO statistics available. This is not as critical as the same period\nin 2009, when 49 209 people were infected in an outbreak that killed\n2767. Affected countries this year [2010] include Benin, Burkina\nFaso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana,\nGuinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Togo, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-EAFR\n<promed-eafr@promedmail.org>\n\n[The emergence of a new strain (serogroup X) of meningococcal\nmeningitis in Burkina Faso this year [2010] has led to huge outbreaks\nin the country, with 46 percent (6/13) of the regions in the country\nbeing at epidemic level. The associated case fatality since the year\nstarted is equally high, that is, 14 percent (781/5118), yet it\nshouldn't exceed 10 percent for a well-managed epidemic. Serogroup X\nis reported to have caused outbreaks in Niger in 2006 and has now\nmoved to Burkina Faso as indicated in the current report. Serogroup X\nis one of those for which no vaccine exists, hence outbreak control\nrelies solely on enhanced surveillance for early case detection and\nreferral, appropriate case management using single dose oily\nchloramphenicol, and social mobilization and health education. - Mod.JFW]\n\n[The number of suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis in Burkina\nFaso has quadrupled, as has the number of deaths since the last\nreport in Feb 2010 (see ProMED-mail post, Meningitis, meningococcal -\nAfrica: WHO meningitis region 20100225.0627).\n\nTo control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the\nappropriate meningococcal vaccine, depending on availability, in\nevery involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity\n(whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the\npopulation have been vaccinated (see\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>).\n\nThere are at least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_ based on\nthe antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease\nis most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135. All these\nserogroup polysaccharides but B are immunogenic in humans.\n\nThere are several different types of meningococcal vaccines that use\nmeningococcal polysaccharides as the immunogen: the vaccines may\ncontain one or more of the polysaccharide serogroups alone or\nconjugated to protein. Meningococcal vaccines will only protect\nagainst meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups\nthat the vaccine contains.\n\nPolysaccharide vaccines, which have been available for more than 30\nyears, exist for serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 in various\ncombinations (such as, a bivalent AC, trivalent ACW-135, and a\ntetravalent ACYW-135 polysaccharide vaccine). There is a monovalent\nprotein conjugate vaccine against serogroup C and a tetravalent\nagainst serogroups A, C, Y, and, W-135.

Children and teenagers from preschools, schools, and boarding\nschools are at special risk. - Mod.NP\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of meningococcal disease, is\ntransmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions\nmostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It\nis estimated that between 10 and 25 per cent of the population carry _N.\nmeningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher\nin epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing,\nsneezing, and coughing on someone, living in close quarters or dormitories\n(military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc)\nfacilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for\nmeningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days\n(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>). Outbreaks tend to\noccur in semi-closed communities, such military recruit camps, college\ndormitories, schools, and day-care centers. Community-based outbreaks in\ntowns, cities, and counties may also occur among persons who are not close\ncontacts of each other and who do not share a common affiliation.\n\nAn outbreak of meningococcal disease is defined as the occurrence of 3 or\nmore confirmed or probable cases during a period of less than or equal to 3\nmonths, resulting in a primary disease attack rate of at least 10 cases per\n100 000 persons, which is about 10-20 times greater than the normal\noccurrence (for calculation of attack rates see\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>).

Close contacts\nof patients are household members, day-care center contacts, and persons\ndirectly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering\nchemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually\nis not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for\n_N. meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.\n\nIn an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the\nmeningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the outbreak as\nsoon as possible after an outbreak has been declared\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>). Mass\nimmunization campaigns are labor-intensive and costly. Meningococcal\npolysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children, do not protect\nunvaccinated population groups, and only provide protection for up to 3\nyears. As a result, repetitive meningitis outbreak responses can deplete a\ncountry's scarce health care finances with comparably little impact.\n\nA preventive strategy based on conjugate vaccines could have a\nsignificantly larger and more enduring impact.

We aimed to collect all available population based\ndata on pneumococcal meningitis throughout life in the African\nmeningitis belt and then to model overall meningitis risk to help\ninform vaccine policy.\n\nMethods: After a systematic review of literature published from 1970\nthrough the present, we found robust population-based _Streptococcus\npneumoniae_ (Sp) meningitis data across age strata for 4 African\nmeningitis belt countries that included 35 surveillance years\nspanning from 1970 to 2005. Using these data we modeled disease risk\nfor a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 persons followed throughout life.\n\nResults: Similar to meningococcal meningitis, laboratory-confirmed\npneumococcal meningitis was seasonal, occurring primarily in the dry\nseason. The mean annual Sp meningitis incidence rates were 98, 7.8 to\n14, and 5.8 to 12 per 100 000 among persons <1, 1 through 19, and 20\nto 99 years of age, respectively, which (in the absence of major\nepidemics) were higher than meningococcal meningitis incidences for\npersons less than 1 and over 20 years of age. Mean Sp meningitis case\nfatality ratios (CFR) among hospitalized patients ranged from 36-66\npercent depending on the age group, with CFR exceeding 60 percent for\nall age groups beyond 40 years; depending on the age group, Sp\nmeningitis mortality incidences were 2- to 12-fold greater than those\nfor meningococcal meningitis.\n\nThe lifetime risks of pneumococcal meningitis disease and death were\n0.6 percent (1 in 170) and 0.3 percent (1 in 304), respectively. The\nincidences of these outcomes were highest among children age <1 year.\nHowever, the cumulative risk was highest among persons age 5 to 59\nyears who experienced 59 percent of pneumococcal meningitis outcomes.\nAfter age 5 years and depending on the country, 59-79 percent of\nmeningitis cases were caused by serotype 1.\n\nConclusions: In the African meningitis belt, Sp is as important a\ncause of meningitis as _Neisseria meningitidis_, particularly among\nolder children and working age adults.

The disease occurs during the dry\nseason, with most cases reported in mid-April.\n\nAs of 7 Feb [2010], health ministries in high-risk countries reported 2298\ncases, with a 13 per cent fatality rate. Burkina Faso has reported the\nhighest number of cases, but Togo has experienced the highest fatality\nrate, where 25 of 108 infected people died [23 percent fatality rate]. The\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) described the situation as 'alarming.'\n\nMamoudou Harouna Djingarey, a WHO epidemiologist and meningitis expert,\ntold IRIN it was still not clear why infections were spreading earlier than\nexpected. 'This [timing] is a sign of a major epidemic risk if no action is\ntaken,' he warned. Extensive meningitis outbreaks tended to occur every 8\nto 10 years, he said, but were now occurring about every 4 years. In the\n2009 meningitis season, 14 African countries reported a total of 78 416\nsuspected cases, including 4053 deaths, the largest number of infections\nsince the 1996 epidemic.\n\nStudies are being carried out to determine whether climatic and\nenvironmental factors might be influencing the extent of the current\nepidemic. Djingarey told IRIN that infections had also been reported\nfurther south than usual, including in Uganda, Kenya, and Democratic\nRepublic of Congo.\n\nBurkina Faso: on 17 Feb 2010 the Health Ministry in Burkina Faso reported\n1251 meningitis cases, with a 15.4 per cent fatality rate. This time last\nyear [2009] there were 25 per cent less infections, but a similar\npercentage of deaths. The disease has reached epidemic proportions in Pama\nin the east, Titao in the north, Sapouy in the centre west, and Batie in\nthe south east, defined by WHO as areas where at least 10 out of 100 000\npeople are infected. 3 other districts with half as many reported\ninfections are on alert, according to Burkina Faso's Ministry of Health.\n\nVaccinations have been carried out in Pama and Titao, and more are\nscheduled to take place in the centre west on 20 Feb 2010. 'If we can react\nquickly the numbers will drop,' Health Ministry epidemiologist Jean Ludovic\nKambou told IRIN.\n\nWHO recommends vaccinating everyone aged from 2 to 29 years and living in\nan epidemic zone, as well as people in neighbouring areas that are on\n'alert'. If the country does not have enough vaccine, it can request\nno-cost or minimal-cost vaccines from a meningitis vaccine stock managed by\nWHO. Alejandro Costa, a WHO vaccine scientist, told IRIN no countries have\nrequested vaccines as of 19 Feb 2010.\n\nCosta told IRIN 100 000 doses of vaccine from the stockpile had been sent\nto Chad, which did not have vaccines on hand but was facing an epidemic in\nthe southern regions of Mandoul and Logone Orientale [see ProMED-mail post\nMeningitis - Chad: (LR,MA) RFI 20100223.0600].

Minister Seydou Bouda considers these\nnumbers 'still too high' for the expectations and everyone should share\nresponsibility and include in their plans the epidemics and in particular\nmeningitis epidemics. Technicians should seek to reduce as much as possible\nthe processing of samples and to remove all obstacles to the prompt access\nto vaccines in areas of need as well as review the chain of coordination of\nreactive control.\n\nThe current system is such that persons in a district facing an epidemic\nmust travel to Ouagadougou to obtain the necessary vaccines. In addition\nthere are formalities that at certain levels must be fulfilled during a\nworking day, the vehicles are not necessarily available in the provinces,\nand neither are the financial resources to pay the persons in charge of\nvaccination. Some have proposed that the alert team at the central level\nwork day and night, transport the vaccines to epidemic areas, and at the\nsame time deal with the formalities.\n\nThe idea to place a sufficient amount of vaccine in the districts is not\ncurrently feasible. The existing amount of vaccines will allow for a\n'dusting' in small quantities and unable to cope with a large-scale\nvaccination where necessary. In other words, it will be difficult to\ncollect these vaccines once they have been distributed across 63 districts,\nif there is an emergency in a given region. Earlier this season, the\nMinistry of Health had about 850 000 doses of vaccine in stock. To date,\n'there is a stock of about 730 000 (728 370) doses,' says Dr Tiendrebeogo.\nA new order has been placed,' he said.\n\nThe quality of the meningococcal vaccine is not in question at the moment.\nThe new concern for this 'epidemic season' of meningitis is that people who\nwere vaccinated in 2009 still contracted the disease. This is the case in\nTitao in the Nord Region. 'People vaccinated in 2009 as well as those who\nweren't have contracted the disease,' says a report of the epidemiological\nsurveillance service. The report states that of 54 patients, more than half\n(51.9 per cent) reported having been vaccinated.\n\nFor the director of disease control, it is possible that the bodies of\nvaccinated people were debilitated by other reasons, which would prevent\nthe development of the necessary immunity to counteract the infection. He\nadded, 'We are in a context where there is malnutrition, which might\nexplain why persons vaccinated do not develop satisfactory immunity.\n\nHe emphasized that the vaccine available against serogroup A meningococcus\nhas a success rate of 95 per cent. In his view, the effectiveness of the\nvaccine 'may arise' as a question of scientific rigor. But he wants the\nBurkinabe to understand that people can miss a vaccination campaign given\nthe population movements, and that they may still contract the disease upon\nreturning to an already vaccinated area.\n\nFor her part, Professor Ramata Ouedraogo, microbiologist, said that the\ncurrent vaccine against meningococcus A does not protect from other types\nof meningitis and pointed out that 'people can acquire another type of\nmeningitis next year even when they say they have been vaccinated.' Health\nauthorities have given priority to meningococcus A, which according to\nexperts is responsible for almost all outbreaks in the country.\nNonetheless, treatment for other types of meningitis is also available.\nThus, 20 000 doses of [ACW135Y vaccine against 4 strains of meningococcus]\nare ready. For financial reasons, the government lacks sufficient doses of\nvaccines against all strains of the bacterium.\n\nThe technicians commented on the case of Titao. Of a total of 62 reported\ncases, 42 cases (68 per cent) were in people from villages neighboring\nMali, and others directly from Malian villages.\n\nMinister Seydou Bouda issued an order for everyone to be vaccinated, no\nmatter how transient, or whether they come from neighboring Mali. 'Anyone\nwho comes to you must be vaccinated in order to break the chain of the\nepidemic,' he said.\n\nThe Committee on the Management of Epidemics has recommended the\norganization of a cross-border meeting with health authorities in Mali and\nthat samples of cerebrospinal fluid continue to be taken for monitoring the\nbacteria.\n\nWHO, in partnership with the European Union, is considering the possibility\nof a vaccination campaign at a regional level (Economic Community Of West\nAfrican States - ECOWAS). 'We are in the process of discussing the issue,'\nsays Henriette Nikiema, representing the EU on this occasion. UNICEF has\npledged some 63 million francs CFA [approx. USD 130 000] to facilitate the\nacquisition of doses of vaccine, but also to strengthen the capacity of\nlaboratory technicians, the laboratory technical platform, and the\ntransport of samples.\n\nThough not the most deadly, meningitis is the disease most feared by the\npeople of Burkina Faso, by the authorities, and even by the technical\npartners. Despite monitoring and response systems repeatedly corrected, the\ndisease always manages to strike. The new announced conjugate vaccine\nprovides great hope.\n\n[byline: Aime Mouor Kambire]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are at least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_ based on the\nantigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease is most\ncommonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135.

Meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to\nthe meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains.\nPolysaccharide vaccines, which have been available for more than 30 years,\nexist for serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 in various combinations (such as, a\nbivalent AC, trivalent ACW-135, and a tetravalent ACYW-135 polysaccharide\nvaccine).

The analysis\nerased any doubt about what caused the researcher to become sick last\nmonth [October 2009] and intensified investigations into precisely how\nhe was exposed to a germ known as _Neisseria meningitides_, which can\ncause meningitis.\n\nThe city's biological lab safety division will review safety\nprocedures in BU's medical labs, to ensure that the school is doing\neverything possible to minimize researchers' exposure to pathogens,\nBarry said.

This time, the university has pledged to operate\ntransparently, promising to share findings of an internal\ninvestigation with scientists across the university and even\nresearchers at other schools. 'We want others to learn if there are\nways we identify that this could be prevented,'' said Ara Tahmassian,\nassociate vice president for research compliance at Boston University\nSchool of Medicine. 'When I look at this incident, it's one too\nmany,'' said Tahmassian, who joined BU after the tularemia cases. 'But\nif some of the other institutions can utilize what went wrong and hear\nthe lessons learned, fantastic.'' Tahmassian has convened a panel of\nspecialists to review the incident and said he expects them to report\nexpeditiously. 'This is not going to be months,'' he said. 'This is\ngoing to be within a week or 2, pinpointing the best we can.''\n\nThe infection of the researcher, who has recovered, came at an awkward\nmoment for BU. A federal health agency is conducting what is probably\nthe final safety review of a controversial USD 200 million lab project\nthe university has built to work with the world's deadliest agents,\nincluding [_Ebolavirus_] and plague. The centerpiece of that project,\na high-security biosafety level-4 lab, is in a completed but\nunoccupied building on Albany Street.\n\nThe exposure of the graduate student -- the university has not\nidentified him, citing patient confidentiality rules -- happened in a\nbuilding next door to the contentious project. He was participating in\nthe hunt for a vaccine against the form of meningitis caused by the\ngerm.\n\nThe researcher was working in a biosafety level-2 lab, which has less\nstringent safety procedures than level-4 labs. When he became ill, the\ngraduate student sought medical attention and notified the director of\nthe lab, concerned that his symptoms might be related to his research.\nUnlike with the tularemia infections, BU alerted city disease\ninvestigators of their suspicions about the student within hours of\nlearning about his illness.

Patients were exposed by\nreading plates (50 percent), making subcultures (50 percent), and\nperforming serogroup identification (38 percent). All patients worked\nin microbiology labs. The risk for infection among microbiologists is\nestimated to be 7 times that among the general population (95 percent\nconfidence interval, 1-19).\n\nComment: Although meningococcal disease is uncommon, microbiologists\nworking with _N. meningitidis_ should take special care, because their\ninfection risk is elevated, and the case-fatality rate is high. Most\nrisk is likely associated with exposure to pure cultures rather than\nto patient samples. Precautions should include using a biosafety hood\nwhen manipulating isolates and wearing splash-guards and masks. When\nsuch protections are not available, isolates should be referred to\nother labs for serotyping. Vaccination of personnel may also be\nconsidered, but current meningococcal vaccines do not protect against\ndisease from _N. meningitidis_ type B and thus will not eliminate risk\nfor infection.\n- C Robert Horsburgh Jr, MD'\n\nThe state of Massachusetts can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail\ninteractive map of the USA at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/00_U>. - Mod.ML]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Tue 10 Nov 2009\n Following the deaths of 2 microbiologists in 2000 from meningococcal\ndisease after occupational exposure, the CDC posted an Internet\nrequest for reports of similar cases of occupationally acquired\nmeningococcal disease [see Laboratory-acquired meningococcal disease -\nUnited States, 2000.

Dr\nMcKenzie said it was the time of year when meningococcal cases were most\nlikely to occur, but in the district's best year in the past 5 years, 2007,\nthere was only one case during the whole year. In 2005, there were 15.\n\nThis season's spike in numbers means that people should be alert to the\nsymptoms and get help without delay. At first the symptoms can be confused\nwith flu, but are more severe, and a tell-tale bruise-like rash that will\nnot fade when pressed develops. 'Anyone with these symptoms should be taken\nto a doctor immediately,' she said. 'Early recognition of the symptoms, and\ntreatment with antibiotics, is the key to stopping the potentially serious\noutcomes from blood poisoning (septicaemia) or meningitis (inflammation of\nthe spinal cord and brain lining).'\n\nThe bugs that cause the disease can live quite harmlessly in the back of\nthe nose or throat of well people, and are passed on to others through\nspit. The key to prevention is not sharing spit. People should not share\nlip balms, drinks or drink bottles or toothbrushes. People most at risk are\nthose under 20, including the very young, and people who live closely\ntogether. Maori and Pacific communities are more frequently affected.\n\nAround New Zealand there were 25 cases of meningococcal disease in August\n[2009], including just one in MidCentral.\n\n[byline: Janine Rankin]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Meningococcal disease is caused by the bacterium _Neisseria meningitidis_,\nwhich is carried in the nasopharynx. The peak incidence of invasive\nmeningococcal disease is between the ages of 6 months and 2 years, and\nranges from mild disease to fulminant septicemia that can lead to death\nwithin a few hours of onset. Immunosuppressed individuals, those with\ncomplement deficiency or hyposplenism and those living in crowded\nconditions (for example, barracks and dormitories) are at increased risk of\ndeveloping meningococcal disease.\n\nThere are at least 13 serogroups of _N. meningitidis_ based on the\nantigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease due to\nserogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common. There are significant\ndifferences in the geographic distribution of serogroups. For instance,\nmeningococci of serogroups B and C cause most disease episodes in Europe,\nwhile serogroup A is commoner in China and among Haj pilgrims. In the\n'meningitis belt' of Africa, group A and C meningococci cause most of the\noutbreaks. Group W135 meningococci have caused several recent epidemics in\nsub-Saharan Africa and during the Haj.\n\nFor about 10 years, beginning in 1991, meningococcal disease activity that\nwas due primarily to a particular strain of serogroup B increased in New\nZealand (<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>). During the\noutbreak, the number of cases grew to about 400 cases each year, with 80 of\nevery 100 cases caused by the epidemic strain. However, the news release\nabove states that the current cases in the MidCentral district of New\nZealand are caused by other 'strains' of _N. meningitidis_.\n\nMeningococcal vaccines that use serogroup-specific meningococcal capsular\npolysaccharide as the immunogen exist for serogroups A, C, W135, and Y.\nDevelopment of a vaccine against group B meningococci has proven difficult,\nbecause its capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic and antibodies\nelicited may cross-react with neural tissue\n(<http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/reprint/160/10/5028>).\n\nSome countries (for example, New Zealand, Cuba, Norway, and Chile)\ndeveloped vaccines against local strains of serogroup B meningococci that\nuse strain-specific outer membrane vesicle protein rather than capsular\npolysaccharide. One such vaccine, the New Zealand MeNZB vaccine only\nprotects against the specific outbreak New Zealand B strain, and will not\nprotect against meningococcal A, C, Y, or W135 or other strains of B\n(<http://www.moh.govt.nz/meningococcal>).

The strain of the meningococcal [serogroup] C,\nwhich was confirmed last week, had infected at least 100 people\nthroughout the port city on the Congo River, said the Minister of\nHealth, August Mopipi, on 7 Dec 2009. He visited the city to assess\nwhat local leaders have called an 'epidemic'. By 6 Dec 2009,\naccording to hospital officials and the UN radio service in\nKisangani, 17 had died from the bacterial infection, all students at\nthe local Maikazo Technical Institute.\n\n'It's a source of hope that this deadly disease remains curable,'\nMopipi said, adding that more than 40 of the cases had been cured.\nThe minister said the government was working on distributing\nvaccinations but warned they could be 'prohibitively' expensive.\nAccording to Kisangani mayor Guy Shilton, crisis meetings between\nhospitals, local government authorities and religious leaders had\nbeen organized and an 'emergency protocol' had been put in place,\nproviding for the distribution of drugs. 'Once the epidemic is\ndeclared, we will attack it in every way possible,' Shilton said.\n\nThe 1st fatalities took place at the Maikazo Technical Institute,\nwhen 9 students from the school died at end-November 2009 after being\nchecked into the local hospital. According to the UN, doctors said\nthe patients all had signs of meningitis, but it could not be\nconfirmed. A 10th student died a week ago, and the school was closed\ndown by the state minister of education. 'It's a preventative and\ntemporary measure,' said Minister Polydor Latigo, 'but we need to\ninvestigate the problem safely.' Andre Kitenge, a press officer for\nthe UN in Kisangani, said that while all deaths related to the\noutbreak were from the school, cases in other parts of Kisangani were\n'prevalent'.\n\nKisangani, one of the largest cities in the Congo, lies in the middle\nof Africa's 'meningitis belt'. During the dry season, it infects\nhundreds more people than the global average of 3 per 100 000.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, an affordable vaccine is\nsupposed to be on the way, but for poor and densely populated areas\nsuch as Kisangani, it still poses a serious threat.

But they say\nthere is no threat of an outbreak and that expectant mothers ready to\ndeliver their babies at the Logan County [Ohio] hospital have no cause for\nconcern. The hospital has pulled batches of any medications the women may\nhave been given and what remains of any supplies that were used and they\nwill be tested as a possible source, said hospital spokeswoman Tammy\nAllison. She did not know whether hospital employees would be tested for\nthe bacteria.\n\nThe 2 women delivered babies on Thursday [?21 May 2009] and showed signs of\nbacterial meningitis on Friday [?22 May, 2009], Allison said. They both\nwere transferred to Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus [Ohio] on\nFriday afternoon, and one died, Allison said. She said the other woman\nremains in critical condition. Both infants were transferred to Nationwide\nChildren's Hospital in Columbus as a precaution, Allison said. She said\nfederal privacy regulations prevent her from releasing the women's names or\nthe condition of the babies.\n\nRiverside spokesman Mark Hopkins said [one of the women], 30, of Huntsville\n[Ohio], was transferred from Mary Rutan and died on Friday. Her daughter,\nwas in good condition yesterday [26 May 2009] at Children's, a spokeswoman\nsaid.\n\nAllison said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the\nlocal and state health departments, have been contacted and an internal\ninvestigation is under way. The maternity unit is licensed for 12 beds,\naccording to the Ohio Department of Health. It remains open, though Allison\nwould not say how many mothers and babies were there yesterday [26 May 2009].\n\nBacterial meningitis is spread from person to person through respiratory\ndroplets. It infects the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord and\ncan be fatal without early treatment. If detected early, it can be\nsuccessfully treated with strong antibiotics. Serious after-effects can\ninclude brain damage, hearing loss, limb amputation, and learning\ndisabilities. However, Allison said that Logan County health commissioner\nDr Boyd Hoddinott advised the hospital that the illness is not contagious\nand represents no danger to patients. Hoddinott was out of the office late\nyesterday [26 May 2009] and could not be reached for comment. Symptoms\ninclude fever, vomiting, an intense headache, and stiffness of the neck.\n\nAbout 2600 people in the United States contract bacterial meningitis each\nyear, according to CDC. In 2006, 634 people died of meningitis, according\nto the latest data from CDC. There were about 58 cases in Ohio last year\n[2008], according to preliminary numbers from the state, said spokesman\nKristopher Weiss. This year [2009], the department has logged 21 cases, not\nincluding the 2 in Logan County. At any given time, an estimated 5 per cent\nto 25 per cent of people are carrying the bacteria but have no symptoms.\nThose people play a major role in transmitting the disease.\n\nTwo vaccines are available for protection against meningitis, and federal\nhealth officials recommend vaccination for young people, especially college\nstudents. The disease is most common in infants, but no vaccine is approved\nfor use in people younger than 2 years old.\n\n[byline: H Zachariah, M Crane]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although not specified in the news report, the cause of meningitis in the\n2 cases in Bellefontaine, Ohio, from the limited information presented, is\npresumably _Neisseria meningitidis_.

It is estimated\nthat between 10 to 25 per cent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at\nany given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic\nsituations.

Centers for Disease Control Deputy Director Chou\nJih-Haw said that 3 of the workers were in stable condition, while one\nhad left Taiwan and the other had not shown any symptoms of illness.\n\nThree of the workers were reported to have been infected with the\nparasitic nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis -- an elongated\ncylindrical worm -- early this month and developed symptoms of\neosinophilic meningitis, including headaches, fever and vomiting, Chou\nsaid. The DOH discovered that the trio and some of their friends had\ncaught apple snails (_Pomacea canaliculata_) in fish ponds in southern\nTaiwan and eaten them raw with sauce.\n\nSnails are usually the primary host of the worm, also known as the rat\nlungworm -- a parasite endemic to Southeast Asia and the Pacific\nregion. Humans become infected by ingesting the parasite's larvae,\nwhich are then carried in the blood to the central nervous system.\nThis can result in eosinophilic meningitis, which is characterized in\nthe early stages by severe and acute headaches, fever, nausea and\nvomiting, and stiffness of the neck, and can result in death or\npermanent brain damage.\n\nChou said that it was once believed that eating giant African snails\ncould cure certain illnesses and that there were frequent reports in\nTaiwan of infections of this type of roundworm.\n\nA 70-year-old man in Kaohsiung was treated for the same conditions in\n2007 after eating raw frogs in an effort to cure back pain. Another\ncase in 2005 saw Hualien's Tzu-Chi Buddhist General Hospital treat a\n48-year-old man who had become infected with the parasite after eating\nraw snails. In 1998, 8 Thai workers came down with eosinophilic\nmeningitis as result of eating raw snails and in 1999, Kaohsiung\nVeterans General Hospital reported that 9 Thai laborers had been\ninfected with rat lungworms.\n\nIn light of the recent case, the DOH said it would contact Thai\nauthorities to step up health education to avoid a recurrence of the\nproblem.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Susan Baekeland\n\n[_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ is transmitted to humans eating raw\nfresh water snails and lettuce contaminated with infected slugs.

'Nigeria is\nthe most affected with 9086 cases and 562 deaths. Niger reports 2620\ncases and 113 deaths. Burkina Faso reports 1756 cases and 250 deaths.\nMali reports 54 cases and 6 deaths.'\n\nUNICEF warned that the authorities in Nigeria, where public health\nfacilities are abysmal and poverty rampant despite its huge oil\nriches, faced an uphill task in tackling the crisis. 'In Nigeria,\ncase management and a mass vaccination campaign are underway. The\nstock of vaccine may be insufficient regarding the epidemiological\ntrends, especially in the districts in the north,' it warned.\n\nHealth authorities placed northern Nigeria on a state of high alert\nin January [2009] following a meningitis outbreak in the town of\nZinder in neighbouring Niger. Nigeria's largest northern state of\nKano has been the worst hit thus far.\n\nMeningitis causes inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal\ncord and has long wracked Africa, the world's poorest region.\nAccording to UNICEF, it can spread through sneezing and coughing. The\ndisease mainly affects children and young adults aged 1-30, it said.\n'The so-called African meningitis belt stretches from Mauritania in\nthe west to Ethiopia in the east and is home to about 350 million\npeople,' UNICEF said. 'Outbreaks occur every year between December\nand May. The dry season, with strong dusty winds and cold nights make\npeople more prone to respiratory infections and facilitates the\nspread of bacteria.'\n\nThe biggest recorded outbreak of epidemic meningitis in Africa\noccurred in 1996 with over 250 000 cases and 25 000 deaths. Even when\nthe disease is diagnosed early, 5 to 10 percent of patients die,\ntypically within one or 2 days of the onset of symptoms, according to\nthe World Health Organisation. Most victims suffer irreversible\nneurological consequences.\n\nThe current WHO recommendation for outbreak control is to mass\nvaccinate every district in an epidemic phase, as well as nearby\nareas in alert phase. It estimates that a mass immunisation campaign\ncan avoid 70 percent of cases. Outbreak response also includes active\nsurveillance and case management and support to community awareness programmes.\n\nOnce the disease is contracted, it can be treated in its early stages\nwith antibiotics. WHO recommends oily chloramphenicol as the drug of\nchoice in areas with limited health facilities.\n\nUNICEF said mass vaccination drives were currently underway in Niger\nand Burkina Faso.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Africa: WHO Meningitis Region\nDate: Wed 11 Mar 2009\nSource: WHO MDSC (Multidisease Surveillance Centre) Meningitis Weekly\nBulletin Week 08 2009 [edited]\n<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/meningococcal/Bulletin%20Meningite%202009_S8.pdf>\n\n\nTable 1: Epidemiological Situation Week 8 (16-22 Feb 2009)\nCountry / Case / Death / Lethality (percent) / District in alert /\nDistrict in epidemic / Complet (percent) / NmA / NmW135 / Other Nm /\nPneum / Hib\nBenin / 11 / 0 / 0.0 / 0 / 0 / 98.7 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 3 / 0\nBurkina Faso / 266 / 35 / 13.2 / 4 / 1 / 100.0\nCameroon / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / -\nCentral African Rep / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / -\nCote d'Ivoire / 7 / 0 / 0.0 / 0 / 0 / 86.0 / - / - / - / - / -\nEthiopia / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / -\nGhana / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / -\nGuinea / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / -\nMali / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / -\nNiger / 621 / 21 / 3.4 / 7 / / 6 / 100.0\nNigeria / 1817 105 / 5.8 / 29 / / 28 / 70.8 / 37 / 7 / 0 / 2 / 0\nCongo DR** / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / -\nChad / 25 / 4 / 16.0 / 0 / 0 / 92.9 / - / - / - / - / -\nTogo / 12 / 0 / 0.0 / 0 / 0 / 100.0 / - / - / - / - / -\nTotal / 2759 / 165 / 6.0 / 40 / 35 / 59.6 / 37 / 7 / 0 / 5 / 0\n* identification by: PCR, latex, culture\n** definition of alert/epidemic thresholds not applicable to this\ncountry outside the meningitis belt.\n\nComments\n--------\nBurkina Faso:\n- district in alert: Toma, Titao, and Ziniare\n- district in epidemic: Solenzo\nNiger:\n- district in alert: Gaya, Loga, Guidan-Roumdji, Magaria, Mirriah,\nKeita, and Zinder\n- district in epidemic: Bilma, Dogon-Doutchi, illela, Matameye\nMadarounfa, and Tessaoua\nNigeria: 28 LGAs [local government areas] in epidemic and 29 LGAs in\nalert (see details on page 3 of the original at the source URL).

He said the trainees quarantined had\nbeen given ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic while those being treated at the\nhospital were given ceftriaxone to recover from the infection. 'I saw that\nthe patients at the ICU and isolation ward were okay. The antibiotics given\nseemed to be working and they (patients) would need 7 days of treatment\nbefore the next step.'\n\nHe said residents, especially in Tiang Dua, should not panic over the\nmeningitis situation as the infection could only be spread by droplets when\nthe carrier coughed or sneezed within a one-metre range. 'The meningitis\nbacteria will not cause an uncontrollable epidemic,' he assured. Liow said\nsamples of the diplococci bacteria had been sent to the microbiology\nlaboratory in Sungai Buloh to ascertain the type as the bacteria had\ndifferent strains.\n\n'We are also investigating the source of the bacteria by obtaining samples\nfrom where the trainees had their practical training, namely in Pedas\n(Negeri Sembilan), Muar (Johor), and Bukit Katil (Malacca).'

Liow said the outbreak was\ninvestigated as soon as possible and it was then discovered that it was not\na viral infection. This enabled the ministry to give the right medication\nto the patients.\n\nAs of yesterday [11 May 2009], there were 32 patients hospitalised with 2\nin intensive care and 29 in the isolation ward in Malacca and another\npatient in Kepala Batas, Penang.

Water samples were taken\nfrom 3 training places in Negeri Sembilan, Johor, and Malacca, and from a\npond in Pedas, Negeri Sembilan, where some of them had swum in, he said.\nLiow also said that the infection was spread through droplets and people\nare advised to close their mouths when they cough or sneeze.\n\nAt present, there are 89 people who are still quarantined. Another 234\ntrainees returned to their hostels but were not allowed to leave the academy.\n\nMeanwhile Bernama [Malaysian National News Agency] quoted Kelantan Health\nDepartment director Dr Lila Mohamed Meeran as saying that the outbreak of\nmeningitis did not originate from the East Coast state [Kelantan].

'We've never had a transmission like this in the United States,'\nsaid Amanda Cohn, a physician who specializes in studying meningitis.\n\nCDC has seen individual cases in the United States of the deadly,\nfast-moving strain, and there have been outbreaks in other parts of the\nworld, including one that hit Muslims on the pilgrimage to Mecca and in the\nAfrican country of Burkina Faso, Cohn said. But the CDC has never seen a\ncase in which 4 people have died and 8 others made ill during a 6-month\nperiod in one area, as has happened in South Florida.\n\nThey're particularly puzzled because there are no obvious connections\nbetween the patients. 'This is very interesting,' said Cohn, an\nAtlanta-based researcher. 'We don't know what's happening.' The strain can\nkill within hours, and anyone experiencing severe headache, fever, nausea,\nvomiting and stiff neck should see a doctor immediately, health officials\nwarned. It's a very scary disease,' when someone gets it, said Cohn, but\n'people don't need to be scared. ... It's not incredibly infectious. You're\nnot going to see hundreds and hundreds of cases.'\n\nW135 is one of the strains covered by the meningitis vaccine, but Cohn said\nshe saw no need for the general population to rush to get a shot. If there\nare certain subgroups that are at high risk and need to be vaccinated, the\nlocal health departments would make that announcement.\n\nMany people may carry one of 13 strains of meningitis within them but not\nget sick. 'We don't understand why some people develop the disease,' Cohn\nsaid. People with colds or the flu might be more susceptible, but the\nconnections are still unclear. 15 or 20 percent of those who get the W135\nstrain will die, Cohn said. 'That's high. This is a very serious disease.'\n\nMiami-Dade health officials revealed the W135 problem at a hastily called\nnews conference Wednesday [22 Apr 2009]. They said the strain could be\ncurable with antibiotics -- but only if patients seek treatment quickly.\n\n[byline: John Dorschner]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is extracted from Mod.ML's comments in ProMED-mail post\narchive number 20090218.0674:\n\nEach year, up to 3000 people in the USA develop meningococcal disease.

No new cases have been reported since 28\nJan [2009],' said Dr Sam Zaramba, the director general of health services.\nHe said there was increased awareness about the disease in the affected\nareas, which saw many people receive treatment and vaccination.\n\nThe outbreak hit the country in December [2008]. Uganda is one of the\ncountries in the African meningitis belt. The epidemic that started in\nHoima and Arua districts also spread to Masindi, Adjumani and Moyo. By 3\nFeb 2009, 336 people had been affected, while 42 had died.\n\nLast month [January 2009], the ministry delivered drugs and financial\nsupport to the affected areas.

The university would not comment\non the investigation but did release a statement saying the 3\nstudents who were hospitalized with the disease last week are showing\nimprovement.\n\nTwo additional students who are from the same social circle were\nhospitalized over the weekend with flu-like symptoms. Their\nconditions are also improving, officials said. Doctors have been\nclosely monitoring their conditions to ensure they did not in fact\ncontract meningitis.\n\nPenn officials believe the disease has been spread through the\nuniversity's Greek [fraternity/sorority] system. As a precaution, all\non and off-campus parties were shut down this past weekend.\n\nMeningitis is spread through close, prolonged contact like sharing\ntoothbrushes or utensils, kissing, or sexual contact. University\nofficials say it is not uncommon for more than one case to pop up on\ncampuses. Early symptoms of infection include fever, severe headache,\nstiff neck, nausea, vomiting, rash, lethargy and sensitivity to bright light.\n\nMore than 2100 students have received preventive antibiotics since\nthe 1st report of a meningitis outbreak was released.\n\n[Byline: Vince Lattanzio]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Each year, up to 3000 people in the USA develop meningococcal\ndisease. The annual incidence generally ranges from 0.5 to 1.1 cases\nper 100 000. The incidence peaks in late winter and early spring.\nMost cases are sporadic; less than 2 percent occur in outbreaks\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm>.\nOutbreaks tend to occur in semi-closed communities, such military\nrecruit camps, college dormitories, schools, and day-care centers.\nCommunity-based outbreaks in towns, cities, and counties may also\noccur among persons who are not close contacts of each other and who\ndo not share a common affiliation.\n\nAlthough the incidence of meningococcal disease in general is highest\nin children less than 2 years of age\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm>,\nmore cases arise among the 5 to 19-year-old group during epidemics\nthan during non-epidemic periods. Currently, serogroups B, C and Y\ncause the majority of infections in the USA; serogroup A is rare in\nthe USA, and W-135 causes a very small proportion of infections;\nserogroup B is the most common serogroup in infants, while serogroup\nY causes the majority of cases in those aged 65 years and older\n<http://www.nfid.org/pdf/meningitis/FINALChanging_Epidemiology_of_Meningococcal_Disease.pdf>.\n\nAn outbreak of meningococcal disease is defined as the occurrence of\n3 or more confirmed or probable cases during a period of less than or\nequal to 3 months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate of at\nleast 10 cases per 100 000 persons, which is approximately 10-fold\ngreater than the normal occurrence\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>.\n\nChemoprophylaxis is given to appropriate contacts whose risk for\nacquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among\nthe total population\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>.\nClose contacts of patients are household members, day care center\ncontacts, and persons directly exposed to the patient's oral\nsecretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not\nclose contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither\noropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are\nuseful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.\n\nIn an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the\nmeningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the\noutbreak as soon as possible after an outbreak has been declared\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>.\nMass immunization campaigns are labor-intensive and costly.\nMeningococcal polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young\nchildren, do not protect unvaccinated population groups, and only\nprovide protection for up to 3 years. As a result, repetitive\nmeningitis outbreak responses can deplete a country's scarce health\ncare finances with comparably little impact. A preventive strategy\nbased on conjugate vaccines could have a significantly larger and\nmore enduring impact.\n\nA quadrivalent A, C, Y and W-135 conjugate vaccine was licensed in\nthe United States in January 2005. The meningococcal conjugate\nvaccines induce a T-cell-dependent response, resulting in an improved\nimmune response in infants, providing long-lasting immunity and\npreventing nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ and thus\nreducing bacterial transmission of this microorganism\n<http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf>.\nThe CDC in any case now recommends the meningococcal conjugate\nvaccination for college students and any persons aged 11 to 18 years,\nmilitary recruits, microbiologists who are routinely exposed to\nisolates of _N. meningitidis_, persons who travel to Mecca during the\nannual Hajj or to countries in which _N. meningitidis_ is\nhyperendemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local\npopulation will be prolonged, persons who have terminal complement\ncomponent deficiencies, and persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia\n<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559807>,\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm>.\n\nDr. Caroline Johnson, Director of the Division of Disease Control for\nthe Philadelphia Department of Public Health reports: That the 3\nculture-confirmed cases were caused by meningococcus serogroup B, for\nwhich there is no effective vaccine; that the 3 isolates were\nciprofloxacin-susceptible (ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococcal\nisolates have been reported in the past, see ProMED-mail Meningitis,\nmeningococcal, drug resistant - USA (MN, ND) 20080215.0601); and that\nthe population at risk is the student population of about 3000\ninvolved in the campus fraternity/sorority system.

Usually, the symptoms last from 7 to 10\ndays, and the patient recovers completely.\n\nMany different viruses can cause meningitis. About 90 percent of\ncases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses. These viruses\nare more common during summer and autumn months. Herpesvirus and\nmumps virus infection can also cause meningitis. Viral meningitis is\nusually diagnosed by laboratory tests of spinal fluid obtained with a\nspinal tap. The specific cause of viral meningitis can be determined\nby tests that identify the virus in specimens collected from the\npatient, but these tests are rarely done. No specific treatment for\nviral meningitis exists at this time. Most patients completely\nrecover on their own.

'It\njust got so intense, nothing took the pain away,'\nsaid a Big Island resident, 36 [patient 1]. 'It\nfelt like they were doing surgery on me and\nripping out my organs.'

The worms migrate through\nthe human body and usually die after several\nweeks. Most people recover fully without\ntreatment, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut sometimes the larvae migrate into cerebral\nfluid, causing inflammation in the brain and\nspinal cord membrane and a form of meningitis,\naccording to a study by the state and CDC\npublished in 2007.

All are children under 15 years old in Hanoi.\n\nThe children caught the disease when the _Angiostrongylus\ncantonensis_ worm got into their brain, causing meningitis. Typical\nsymptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, convulsions, and squinty eyes.\n\n_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ can appear in [cerebrospinal fluid] and\nalso in lens crystallins and lung arteries.\n\nThere are over 20 species of _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_, which\nparasitise mice, 2 of which cause meningitis in humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-MBDS\n<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>\n\n[Background information on _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ infection\nwas excerpted from the parasitic disease information fact sheet of\nthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/angiostrongylus/factsht_angiostrongylus.htm>.\n\n_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ is a nematode (parasitic worm) of rats,\nwhich is also called the rat lungworm. The adult form of the parasite\ncan be found only in rodents. Infected rats pass larvae of the\nparasite in their feces. By ingesting the rat feces, snails and slugs\nget infected with the larvae. Then, the larvae mature in snails and\nslugs but do not develop into adult worms. When rats eat infected\nsnails or slugs, the larvae mature into adult worms in the rats. An\nexcellent diagram demonstrating the life cycle of the nematode can be\nfound at <http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/angiostrongyliasis.htm>,\nwith additional more detail on the organism and clinical manifestations.\n\nPeople can become infected by eating raw or undercooked snails,\nslugs, freshwater prawns, crabs, or frogs infected with this\nparasite, but fish cannot transmit this parasite to humans. There is\nno known human-to-human transmission of this parasite either.\n\nMost of the infected cases do not show any symptoms or have only mild\nsymptoms of short duration. Sometimes, the infection can render a\nrare type of eosinophilic meningitis. The clinical symptoms of\neosinophilic meningitis are caused by the presence of larvae in the\nbrain and by local host reactions. The symptoms of eosinophilic\nmeningitis include headache, stiff neck, tingling or painful\nsensation in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nThe majority of people can fully recover spontaneously with\nsymptomatic treatment. Antibiotics have not been shown to be\neffective for the treatment of eosinophilic meningitis.\n\nSelected references\n-------------------\n1.

To\nour knowledge, this is the 1st description of this infection acquired\non the island of Elba.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nIn Switzerland, aseptic meningitis is frequently encountered and most\noften caused by enteroviruses, flaviviruses (tick-borne\nencephalitis), herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, varicella-zoster\nvirus or mumps and measles viruses. Other arthropod-borne viruses\nthat can cause clinical signs of meningoencephalitis, such as West\nNile virus, have been detected in other parts of Europe and also in\ncountries around Switzerland (e.g. Italy, France), but not as yet in\nSwitzerland itself. Toscana virus (TOSV) was 1st isolated from a\nsandfly (_Phlebotomus peniciosus_) in central Italy in 1971 and\nidentified as a common cause of aseptic meningitis in this country.\nSince then, it has been detected in other countries around the\nMediterranean. Studies carried out in Italy have shown that the virus\ncirculates not only in Tuscany but also in other regions such as\nEmilia Romagna, Marches, Umbria and Piedmont [1]. So far, no data can\nbe found about infections acquired on the islands off the coast of\nTuscany, including Elba.\n\nCase Report\n---------\nOn 10 Aug 2008, a man in his 20s was admitted to the emergency\ndepartment of the Hospital of Lucerne, based in the central part of\nSwitzerland. He suffered from a pronounced headache since the\nprevious day and recurrent vomiting. He had stayed on the island of\nElba for 2 weeks and returned home on 8 Aug 2008. From 27 to 31 Jul\n2008, he had stayed at a campsite east of Portoferraio before moving\nto the southern part of the island (near Marina di Campo) for the\nremaining week. The entire holiday was spent exclusively on Elba,\nwith no major stopovers on the way home from Piombino, the mainland\nport for the ferry to Elba. At the campsite, the patient usually\nslept outside the tent on a canvas chair; the ground was sandy and hard.\n\nOn admission, the patient had neck rigidity without clinical signs of\nencephalitis or fever. White blood cell count and C-reactive protein\nlevels were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), taken on the day of\nadmission, was clear and showed a white blood cell count of 196/mm3\n(85 percent mononuclear cells), protein levels of 0.75 g/L, and\nglucose levels of 3.7 mmol/L (the glucose level in the blood was 6.9\nmmol/L). Gram stain was negative, and culture showed no\nmicroorganisms. PCRs for herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2,\nvaricella-zoster virus and enteroviruses were negative. Serology for\n_Borrellia burgdorferi_ and tick-borne encephalitis virus showed no\nsigns of active infection.\n\nBecause the patient had stayed on the island of Elba, TOSV meningitis\nwas considered and confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence that\nshowed high titres of anti-TOSV IgM and IgG, antibodies\n('Sandfliegenfieber-Viren-Mosaik,' Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany).\nAntibody titres against other sandfly fever viruses (sandfly fever\nNaples virus (SFNV), sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV), and sandfly\nfever Cyprus virus (SNCV)) were found to be low or negative. Although\na PCR of the CSF taken on the day of admission could not detect TOSV\ngenome, the negative PCR result does not exclude an acute infection\nwith TOSV, as the virus rapidly becomes undetectable after the\nappearance of antibodies.\n\nThe patient recovered completely within 3 days. Apart from analgetic\nmedication, no further treatment was necessary.\n\nDiscussion\n---------\nTOSV belongs to the genus _Phlebovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The\ngenus _Phlebovirus_ currently comprises 68 antigenically distinct\nserotypes, 8 of which have been linked to diseases in humans. Three\n_Phlebovirus_serotypes are of importance in Europe: SFSV, SFNV and\nTOSV. While the 1st 2 cause a febrile illness, TOSV is characterized\nby its neurotropism and the clinical characteristics of meningitis,\nmeningoencephalitis and influenza-like illness. As stated in several\nstudies and case reports, TOSV is circulating not only in Italy but\nalso in Algeria, Spain, Portugal, France and Cyprus [2-9]. In central\nItaly, a seroprevalence of approximately 20 percent could be detected\n[10], whereas in Granada, southern Spain, the overall prevalence of\nanti-TOSV IgG antibodies was almost 25 percent [11]. In both\ncountries, the seroprevalence was significantly higher in older age\ngroups and in the rural population, indicating exposure throughout\nlife and a higher vector density in the rural areas.\n\nTransmission of the virus to humans results from the bite of small\nfemale phlebotomine sandflies (_P. perniciosus_ and _P. perfiliewi_).\nThe activity of sandflies is mainly crepuscular or nocturnal. During\nthe summer months, concomitant with the period of maximum activity of\nthe sandfly vectors in August, TOSV appears to be one of the major\nviral pathogens causing aseptic meningitis in tourists as well as in\nthe local population of the Mediterranean countries [12].\n\nTOSV infections have an incubation period of 3 to 6 days. The\nclinical picture is variable: In addition to meningitis and\nmeningoencephalitis, few cases of encephalitis without meningitis\nhave been described [13]. The high seroprevalence suggests that\nasymptomatic infection is rather common and TOSV, therefore, probably\nunder-recognized. In a study performed in the area around Florence,\nSiena and Arezzo, forestry workers with high occupational risk of\nTOSV infection showed a seropositivity rate of over 75 percent, with\nnegative history of neurological symptoms. This confirms that TOSV\ninfection can be very mild or even completely free of symptoms [10].\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st description of TOSV meningitis\nacquired on the island of Elba. However, the geographic proximity to\nareas where the disease is endemic and which have a very similar\nclimate, suggest that phlebotomes occur on Elba. Despite millions of\nvisiting tourists and an increasing number of TOSV infections around\nthe Mediterranean Basin, TOSV is still rarely considered as the cause\nof aseptic meningitis in returning travelers. Either it is not\ndiagnosed, or the manifestation rate of severe infections is very\nlow. Patients returning from the Mediterranean and also from the\nisland of Elba and complaining of CNS symptoms should be tested for\nTOSV infection.\n\nReferences\n--------\n[1] Portolani M, Sabbatini AM, Beretti F, Gennari W, Tamassia MG,\nPecorari M.

The inquiry by\nMartini, an official and former director of the Izquieta Perez\nInstitute of Hygiene, began after 10 patients were diagnosed with\neosinophilic meningoencephalitis, caused by a parasite found in snails.\n\nThe symptoms were: neurological disorders, constipation, vomiting,\nnausea, abdominal pain (see graphics in original). The 1st to be\naffected were from the coastal province. The provincial director of\nLos Rios province, Carlos Paz, confirmed to this newspaper that 10\npeople had been affected, and another 25-year-old man died [of it] in\nthe Luis Vernaza hospital of Guayaquil on 22 Jul 2008.

America -- see\ncomment below. - Mod.JW]\n\nAccording to history, the parasite was 1st described by HT Chen in\n1935 and was the 1st rat lungworm. In 1937, another worm was obtained\nfrom a rat in Taiwan, a new species. This infection has also appeared\nin Egypt and in Southeast Asia, in Pacific Rim countries such as\nThailand, Vietnam, Japan, and in Hawaii.\n\nOn Mon 22 Dec 2008 there was a meeting of all health authorities to\ndetermine what action to take, because the problem also involves\ncommerce, the export of snails. Paz denied that the species which is\nused for human consumption is involved, because only wild-caught\nsnails were infected. Therefore, the official cautioned that he has\nset up an 'epidemiological barrier' to prevent spread of the parasite.\n\nUsually, it lives in the pulmonary arteries of rats. Martini does not\nknow exactly how it came into the country. 'It most likely came in\nsnails imported by the domestic industry. When improperly handled on\nfarms, they were accessible to wild rats which became infected for the\n1st time.'\n\nLos Rios is not only affected but also Santo Domingo de las Tsachilas.\nThe director of the Eugenio Espejo hospital in Quito [the capital],\nMarco Ortega, confirmed yesterday that 3 weeks ago 2 people in that\njurisdiction had this health problem. On 18 Nov 2008, 3 people were\nvisiting an area near Santo Domingo, where they collected at least 3\npounds of snails, which they ate raw with lemon and salt.\n\nDays later, one of them, a 20-year-old man, had abdominal pain, fever\nand pain in knees and hips. He was admitted to Eugenio Espejo hospital\non 26 Nov 2008. After 12 days his symptoms worsened, adding slightly\nstiff neck and alteration of consciousness. Doctors diagnosed severe\nmeningitis caused by the parasite, _A. cantonensis_, which lives in\nsnails. He remains hospitalized.\n\nHis brother, aged 17, entered this hospital on 1 Dec 2008, with\nsimilar symptoms. He, according to Flores, ate fewer snails. 'He was\ndischarged 15 days ago and is out of danger,' doctors said. 'But he\nhas a lot of pain when walking.' The 3rd person was not admitted to\nhospital; he had only tasted the flavored juice of the snails.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-ESP\n<promed-esp@promedmail.org>\n\n[These are the 1st human cases of angiostrongyliasis in humans from\nEcuador.

Meningococcal meningitis, which usually reaches epidemic\nlevels in the region often referred to as Africa's 'meningitis belt'\nbetween December and May, could be especially severe this year [2008]\nas the region is heading toward the peak of a 10- to 12-year cycle of\nmeningitis crises, health forecasters say.\nBetween 1995 and 1997, the last time there was a major epidemic in\nthe region, at least 25 000 people died and 250 000 people were\ninfected. From December 2006 to May 2007, 53 000 cases of meningitis\nwere reported and an estimated 4000 people died across the region.\nSemi-arid Sahelian countries are hit each year by outbreaks during\nthe dry seasons between December and June when strong, dust-laden\nwinds and cold nights make people more prone to respiratory\ninfections. The meningitis bacterium is transmitted by sneezing or\ncoughing. According to Konde, the situation could be worse this year\n[2008] because of high dust levels in the region and the low level of\nimmunity among populations. He said new research by WHO and national\nresearch centres also appears to have shown a new strain of the\nbacterium. 'If you take into account all these factors we find\nourselves in a situation where the risk [of epidemics] is high,' Konde said.\nPreparedness for meningitis epidemics is notoriously difficult\nbecause vaccines cannot be administered until it is known which of\nthe many different forms of the bacterium are spreading. In\n2006-2007, the humanitarian response was further hindered by a\nshortfall of the cheaper vaccines usually used in the region as\nEuropean producers focused on producing newer, longer-lasting but\nmore expensive vaccines. Just 7 million doses were available. In\n2008, between 25 million and 30 million doses could be available,\naccording to WHO. 'We do find ourselves in a more favourable\nsituation than last year [2007],' Konde said.\nEmergency health officials are due to meet in Dakar next week [21-27\nJan 2008] to coordinate responses to the expected epidemic. Hans\nHebbing, regional health coordinator of the International Federation\nof the Red Cross, told IRIN the Federation has already started\ntraining 25 000 volunteers across the region, and is educating people\nabout how to recognise meningitis and the dangers. 'We know this is\nnot really going to prevent a major outbreak. But we're hoping that\nearly activity can prevent some spread of the disease and we do know\nthat training and preparedness can make the response faster,' he said.\nMeningitis is an infection of the thin lining around the brain and\nspinal cord. Even when meningitis is diagnosed early and adequate\ntherapy is available, between 5 and 10 percent of patients die,\ntypically within 24 and 48 hours of experiencing the 1st symptoms.\nMany thousands of survivors are left with brain damage, hearing loss,\nor learning disabilities.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSidi Coulibaly\n<sidi_couly@yahoo.ca>\n[Meningitis due to the _Neisseria meningitidis_ occurs both\nsporadically and as epidemics.

'Even though there are other drugs that can be used to\nprevent meningococcal disease, having one less weapon in our arsenal\nreminds us of the importance of appropriate antibiotic use,' said\nDr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist.\n\nThe 2 Minnesota cases turned up last month [January 2008], one\ninvolving a 53-year-old from Marshall County [Minnesota] who died and\na 2nd involving a 22-year-old student at Minnesota State\nUniversity-Moorhead. The North Dakota case in January 2007 involved a\nchild at a Fargo daycare facility. The bacterial strains in all 3\ncases are similar, but the patients had no known connections. Health\nofficials believe these strains are simply circulating in the region.\nAs many as 15 percent of people can have a meningococcal bacteria in\ntheir throats or noses at any given time, but only a few suffer\nsevere infections.\n\nFederal officials have been anticipating such a case. An official\nfrom the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\ntraveled to the region Thursday [7 Feb 2008] and was taking random\nthroat swabs in an attempt to find someone carrying the\ndrug-resistant bacteria.\n\nClose friends of the patients have been treated as a precaution, so\nthe CDC official will go to college campuses, bars and other\nhigh-traffic locations. The infected student took music lessons, so\nother music students might be tested, said Richard Danila, assistant\nstate epidemiologist. Danila stressed that these 1st cases are\nsignificant but shouldn't worry the general public or cause people to\ndemand preventive treatment.\n\nThat the strain in the 53-year-old who died was drug-resistant didn't\nfactor into the fatality, Danila said, as patients with the infection\naren't treated with ciprofloxacin. All 3 patients developed\nmeningitis, a swelling of the brain and spinal cord, and required\nhospital care. Minnesota is one of a dozen or so states that test\nmeningococcal strains for antibiotic resistance. That partly explains\nwhy the 1st case was discovered here.\n\n[Vaccination for meningococcal meningitis is] recommended for the\n11-18 age group and for college freshmen [age 18-20. - Mod.JW]. While\na vaccine protects against two-thirds of these bacterial infections,\nit wouldn't have worked against this particular strain. The vaccine is\nrecommended for children ages 11 to 18 and college freshmen.\nMeningitis cases are somewhat rare, with an average of 24 per year\nsince 2000 in Minnesota. A total of 22 deaths have been linked to the\nbacterial infection from 2000 through 2006 in the state, 10 of them\ninvolving people 23 or younger.\n\n****The antibiotic-resistant cases reported Friday [8 Feb 2008] were\nthe 1st on\nrecord in the USA.*****\n\n[Byline: Jeremy Olson]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Invasive meningococcal disease (bacteremia and meningitis) is a\ncontagious bacterial infection caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_.\n_N. meningitidis_ colonizes the nasopharynx, and is spread by\nrespiratory droplets. Household members and other close contacts who\nmay be exposed to the index case's respiratory excretions have the\nhighest documented risk of secondary disease during the 1st 7 days of\na case being detected. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for those in\nclose contact with a person with a meningococcal infection to prevent\nsecondary cases by eradicating _N. meningitidis_ from the\nnasopharynx. Chemoprophylaxis is also used to cover the delay between\nvaccination and the development of protective antibodies.\n\nChemprophylactic agents include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and\nceftriaxone. Emergence of rifampin-resistance has been reported\nfollowing chemoprophylactic use of rifampin (Fraser A, et al.\nAntibiotics for preventing meningococcal infections. Cochrane\nDatabase Syst Rev. 2006 Oct 18;(4):CD004785). These authors raised\nconcerns about the clonal spread of these resistant isolates;\nhowever, rifampin-resistant isolates are rarely reported (Taha M-K,\net al. Rifampin-resistant Neisseria meningitidis. (LETTERS). Emerging\nInfectious Diseases 2006; 12:859-60).\n\nFluoroquinolone-resistance is usually due to accumulation of point\nmutations in the genes (e.g., gyrA and parC genes) encoding DNA\ngyrase and topoisomerase IV, the targets for these antimicrobial\nagents. There are 5 previous reports of sporadic instances of\ndecreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin due to point mutations in\nthe quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene:\n1) Serogroup B isolate with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin\nin the nasopharynx of a Parisian STD clinic patient in 1999 and 2) in\nthe CSF of a child in Spain in 2002 (Alcala B, et al. _Neisseria\nmeningitidis_ showing decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin: 1st\nreport in Spain. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2004;53:409); 3) Serogroup C\nisolate in blood and CSF of a nursing student in Australia in 1998\n(Shultz TR et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2000; 44:1116); 4)\nSerogroup Y and B from 2 patients in Argentina in 2002 (Corso A, et\nal. Emergence of _Neisseria meningitidis_ with decreased\nsusceptibility to ciprofloxacin in Argentina. J Antimicrob Chemother\n2005;55:596-7); and 5) Serogroup A in 12 of 14 strains from a 2005\noutbreak in Delhi, India\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/10/1614.htm>).\n\nThe above news release states that infection due to the strain\ninvolved in the 3 U.S.A. cases could not be prevented by vaccination.\nBecause vaccines are available for serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135, we\ncan assume that the strain involved in these 3 cases was serogroup B\nfor which there is no an effective vaccine.

Viral or 'aseptic'\nmeningitis, which is the most common type, is caused by an infection\nwith one of several types of viruses. In the United States, there are\nbetween 25 000 and 50 000 hospitalizations due to viral meningitis\neach year. The more common symptoms of meningitis are fever, severe\nheadache, stiff neck, bright lights hurting the eyes, drowsiness or\nconfusion, and nausea and vomiting. In babies, the symptoms may\ninclude fever, fretfulness or irritability, difficulty in awakening\nthe baby, or the baby refuses to eat.\nViral meningitis is serious but rarely fatal in persons with normal\nimmune systems. Usually, the symptoms last from 7 to 10 days, and the\npatient recovers completely. Bacterial meningitis, on the other hand,\ncan be very serious and result in disability or death if not treated\npromptly. Often, the symptoms of viral meningitis and bacterial\nmeningitis are the same. For this reason, healthcare specialists\nadvise that whenever there is suspicion of meningitis in a child, a\ndoctor should be consulted without delay.\nMany different viruses can cause meningitis. About 90 percent of\ncases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses, such as\ncoxsackieviruses and echoviruses. But herpesviruses and mumps virus\ncan also cause viral meningitis. There is no specific treatment for\nviral meningitis other than supportive care. Enteroviruses are\ntransmitted by contact predominantly through direct contact with\nrespiratory and other secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal\nmucus) of an infected person. The incubation period for enteroviruses\nis usually between 3 and 7 days. Frequent and thorough hand washing\nis the best protection from infection.\nOutbreaks of viral meningitis are frequently indicative of fecal\ncontamination of food products, deficiencies in the supply of clean\ndrinking water or the inadequate treatment and disposal of sewage. In\nthe case of the Missouri outbreak, the source of the infection has\nnot been established so far.\nFurther information can be obtained from the U.S. CDC (Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention) website at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/enterovirus/viral_meningitis.htm>.\nFor the location of Perry County, Missouri, see:\n<http://www.perryvillemo.com>.\n- Mod.CP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n [Byline: C.

Among the\nhelminths, of special importance is the _Angiostrongylus\ncantonenesis_, a nematode that has the rat (urban and wild) as its\ndefinitive host. The intermediary hosts in nature are mollusks, among\nwhich are conch (caramujos) and slugs (lesmas). Humans are accidental\nhosts, being infected through ingestion of mollusks or coming in\ndirect contact with their secretions.\nIn the identified cases, the probable source of infection was\ningestion of slugs. A 3rd case, under investigation, still hasn't had\na definitive epidemiologic association identified, not withstanding,\nthe literature does support the possibility of transmission of the\nhelminth through ingestion of vegetables and fruits that have been\ninfested with infectious larval forms of _A. cantonensis_ or through\nthe ingestion of other hosts of the helminth such as crabs and\nshrimp. These forms of transmission have been reported in eastern\n(Asian) countries where the disease is endemic. The occurrence of\nthis agent has not been reported in Brazil, suggesting a new\nintroduction of this species into the Brazilian territory.\nThe confirmation of the etiologic agent in both of the cases was made\nby polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of cerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from both patients, as well as through verification of\nreproduction of the agent in laboratory rats, in addition to the\nidentification of _A. cantonensis_ in slugs and conches and other\nmollusks collected around the household where the ingestion of the\ncited animals occurred.\nPathophysiology\n----------------\nThe infection occurs through the ingestion of infective larvae (L1)\npresent in the mollusks, by contact of the oral mucosa with\nsecretions of mollusks or maybe though fomites (contaminated\nobjects). The larvae, after having been ingested, enters the blood\nsystem, and, as a result of its tropism, is localized in the central\nnervous system (CNS) where it goes on to develop meningitis or infect\ncerebral tissue and cause encephalitis. In this way, through the\ninfectious process involving these different sites, the clinical\npicture of meningoencephalitis is produced. It is not known if the\nadult worm, due to an inability to migrate to the lungs, dies inside\nof the CNS or in another location.\nClinical picture\n-----------------\nIncubation period -- from one to 6 days after ingestion of the L1.\nSigns and Symptoms -- headache, nausea, nuchal rigidity, fever, rash,\nabdominal pain\nSpecific neurological signs -- can be absent or can evolve into\nparesthesias, hypotonia, and compromise of the 4th and 6th cranial\nnerves. It can lead to death, although this is rarely reported.\nLaboratory tests\n----------------\nIt is mandatory to collect CSF. The CSF normally has a leukocytosis\nwith eosinophilia reaching 10 percent that can persist for months.\nGlucose can be normal and for some time can be decreased. Sometimes\nthe larvae can be identified in the CSF at the time of the lumbar puncture.\nThere is usually an eosinophilia in the peripheral blood, concomitant\nwith the neurological picture. Serologic tests have not as yet been\nstandardized commercially.\nTherapy\n--------\nThe use of an anti-helminthic has not been demonstrated to be\neffective at any time during the course of the disease.\nTreatment of signs and symptoms during the course of the illness is\nrecommended to reduce the symptoms (headache and other signs of\nincreased intracranial pressure), as well as the use of analgesics\nand antiemetics.\nThe usual clinical course evolves over 2 months but in some cases can\nlast longer.\nDefinition of a suspected case: a patient of any age and sex, with a\nhistory of fever, headache nuchal rigidity, with a history of\ningestion or manipulation of landed mollusks in the preceding 1-15 days.\nDefinition of a confirmed case: a suspected case with a CSF\neosinophilia of 10 percent or a CSF positive for _A. cantonensis_.\nPrevention and control measures to be implemented in Espirito Santo State:\na) All suspected cases of eosinophilic meningitis should be reported\nimmediately to the Municipal and/or State Secretariat of Health (to\nthe Rapid Response Unit -- URR) and/or to the Center for Strategic\nInformation for Disease Surveillance of the Ministry health\n(CIEVS/SVS) through e-mail <notifica@saude.gov.br>;\nb) Seek immediate medical assistance at the primary signs and\nsymptoms of fever, accompanied by vomiting and nuchal rigidity;\nc) remove unnecessary materials by emptying the garbage adequately in\norder to reduce the rodent populations;\nd) avoid manual contact or ingestion of whatever species of landed\nmollusks, until there are studies of these fauna in the region and\none is able to identify the transmission risks;\ne) ingest fruits and vegetables only after adequate washing and use\nof sodium hypochlorite 2.5 percent disinfectant;\nf) mollusks and terrestrial and/or aquatic crustaceans should only be\ningested after adequate cooking;\ng) special attention should be paid to children, teaching them the\nrisks and keeping them in clean environments less hospitable to the\nmollusks (care should be taken with yards, pre-schools and daycare centers;\nThe Municipal and State Secretaries of Health should:\n1.

Our aim was to investigate the\noccurrence of Toscana virus (TOSV) meningitis in\nchildren and young adults in a metropolitan area\nin the north of Portugal. Cerebrospinal fluid\nsamples from 308 patients with the diagnosis of\nmeningitis and with negative bacterial culture\nwere tested for enteroviruses and herpesviruses\nby reverse transcription PCR. Those samples that\nproved negative for enterovirus and herpesviruses\nwere tested for Toscana virus with a commercial\nreverse transcription nested PCR assay. In total,\nwe investigated 106 samples, collected between\nMay and September during the 4-year period\nbetween 2002 and 2005 from patients younger than\n30 years old. Toscana virus was the cause of\nmeningitis in 6 (5.6 percent) of the cases, 3\nchildren and 3 young adults. All had a benign\ncourse and self-limited disease. Since a 1st case\nreport of TOSV infection 1985 and another in\n1996, both in foreign tourists, these 6 cases of\nToscana virus meningitis are, to our knowledge,\nthe 1st diagnosed in Portuguese inhabitants, and\nthey underline the need for more studies on the\nprevalence of this virus in Portugal.\nIntroduction\n-------------\nWith the improvement of diagnostic techniques\nsuch as PCR, it is now possible to rapidly\ndiagnose viral meningitis through identification\nof the pathogen [1]. In Portugal, enteroviruses\nare the most frequent cause of aseptic meningitis\nbut, despite thorough testing, a significant\nnumber of patients are discharged from hospital\nwithout an etiological diagnosis [2,3]. The\ninclusion of Toscana virus (TOSV) diagnosis in\nthe laboratory tests for enterovirus- and\nherpesvirus-negative samples was an attempt to\nimprove the knowledge about aseptic meningitis.\nViral meningitides, including TOSV meningitis,\nare non-notifiable diseases in Portugal and are\ncharacterised by non-specific symptoms.\nConsequently, their seroprevalence is unknown.\nTOSV belongs to a group of sandfly fever viruses\ntransmitted by the sandfly (genus _Phlebotomus_),\nand classified in the family _Bunyaviridae_,\ngenus _Phlebovirus_. Three sandfly fever viruses\nhave been identified in Mediterranean area:\nsandfly fever Naples virus, sandfly fever\nSicilian virus, and Toscana virus. The latter is\nendemic in central Italy and described as the\nmost frequent cause of aseptic meningitis in\nchildren in that region [4,5]. As a consequence\nof the life cycle of _Phlebotomus_, TOSV is more\nfrequent during summer, with a peak in August.\nThe most common presentation is an acute febrile\nillness or meningitis, and more rarely a\nmeningoencephalitis [5-7]. Most of the studies on\nTOSV have been done in central Italy, but the\noccurrence of TOSV in other countries, such as\nFrance, Spain, Slovenia, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey\nand Egypt, has also been reported recently [8].\nTOSV can be identified by culture of\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a time-consuming\nmethod with low sensitivity, but very useful for\nvirus characterisation and genetic studies [8].\nImmunoenzymatic tests, (IgM by IFA or ELISA) are\nrapid and sensitive; however cross-reactivity can\noccur. Nowadays, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR\nis considered the method with the highest\nsensitivity and specificity for virus detection\n[8,9]. Many vectors implied in human diseases,\nincluding _Phlebotomus_, are present in Portugal\n[10]. The aim of this study was to investigate\nthe occurrence of TOSV meningitis in children and\nyoung adults in an urban area in the north of\nPortugal.\nMethods\n-------\nDuring the period 2002 to 2005, we have\ninvestigated the occurrence of TOSV in CSF\nsamples of aseptic meningitis patients. Aseptic\nmeningitis was defined by a CSF cytosis greater\nthan 6 leukocytes/ml and a negative bacterial\nculture. RNA was extracted from the samples with\nthe Qiamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen). Samples\nthat were PCR-negative for enterovirus and herpes\nvirus and that had been taken from patients\nyounger than 30 years and hospitalised between\nMay and September each year were tested for TOSV\nwith a nested RT-PCR assay purchased from\nAmplimedical SpA (Toscana, N prot Kit). Each run\nincluded a negative control (water) and a\npositive control (Toscana virus positive control,\nAmplimedical SpA). Some negative samples (n=26)\nwere tested with an in-house\ufffd nested RT-PCR\nprotocol with published outer and inner primers\n[11].\nResults\n-------\nOver the 4-year period (2002-2005), 308 patients\nwere admitted to the emergency department of our\nhospital with aseptic meningitis and hospitalised\nfor observation and study. They were analysed by\nRT-PCR for the presence of a number of viruses\nknown to cause meningitis (enterovirus, herpes\nsimplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),\ncytomegalovirus (CMV), and West Nile virus)\nduring the acute phase of the disease. The\nresults are tabulated as follows:\nPCR / No. positive / No. negative\nEnterovirus / 110 / 178\nHerpes simplex virus / 20 / 178\nEpstein-Barr virus / 5 / 173\nCytomegalovirus / 3 / 175\nWest Nile virus / 0 / 15\nToscana virus / 6 / 100\nTotal meningitis cases 144 (47 percent)\nRT-PCR for enterovirus and herpes simplex virus\nwere done in an order determined by the patient's\nmental status at admission. CSF samples from\npatients with a normal level of consciousness or\nwith somnolence (Glasgow Coma Scale >=14) were\nanalysed 1st for enterovirus, and, if this was\nnegative, subsequently for HSV. Samples from\npatients with further impaired mental status\n(Glasgow Coma Scale <14) were 1st analysed for\nHSV, and then, if negative, for enterovirus.\nRT-PCR for CMV and EBV was performed only in\ncases with a negative result for HSV and\nenterovirus. RT-PCR for West Nile virus was done\nonly in 15 patients aged over 60 years without\netiologic diagnosis. It was negative in all of\nthem.\nFor this study, we chose 106 of those 308 samples\nto be tested for TOSV using the Amplimedical SpA\nnested RT-PCR assay. This included only samples\nfrom patients who had been admitted between May\nand September in the years from 2002 to 2005 and\nhad been negative for enterovirus, HSV, EBV and\nCMV when tested upon hospital admission. All\npatients were younger than 30 years of age (range\n2.5 months to 30 years). TOSV was detected in 6\n(5.6 percent) of those 106 samples. Three were\nchildren, one aged 4 years and 2 aged 8 years,\nand 3 were young adults, aged 16, 23 and 30\nyears. Three of the patients were male. All 6\npatients live in an urban area, and none of them\nhad a recent history of traveling abroad.\nAll cases had occurred between May and July, 2\ncases in 2002, 3 in 2003 and one in 2005.\nAdmission symptoms were fever, headache and\nvomiting and lasted between one and 5 days. On\nadmission, meningeal symptoms were present in all\npatients and somnolence in 3. Two of them had\nbrain-computed tomography that was normal. CSF\ncytosis ranged from 70 to 1,090 cells/ul, with\nnormal glucose and protein levels. The blood\nleukocyte count varied from 5.6 to 11.8x109/L,\nand C-reactive protein was normal in all\npatients. All underwent only supportive treatment\nwith antipyretics and intravenous fluids and had\na benign and self-limited disease. They were\ndischarged between 4-7 days after admission. 26\nof the 106 samples were examined only by an\nin-house\ufffd RT-PCR assay. The sensitivity of this\nassay was comparable to the commercial RT-PCR\nwhen tested using TOSV-positive clinical samples.\nAll 26 samples that were only tested by this\nmethod were negative.\nDiscussion\n----------\nIn the Mediterranean countries, especially Italy\nand Spain, the interest in TOSV has increased in\nrecent years [12-14]. PCR is the most frequent\nmethod used for TOSV diagnosis. It can be\ncomplemented by immuno-enzymatic tests, which are\nrapid and sensitive [8,11], or culture, which in\ncombination with PCR is useful for genetic\ncharacterisation of the virus. Most of the\nreported cases of TOSV infections occur\nthroughout the summertime in the central region\nof Italy, particularly in the Siena province, in\nchildren [4,5,9,15]. A study by Valassina et al.\n[5] describes the analysis of 277 meningitis\ncases that occurred in Tuscany between 1995 and\n1998. TOSV was identified as the cause for 58\npercent of the cases admitted in the period\nbetween June and September, and for 10 percent of\nthe cases admitted from May to October,\nreflecting the seasonality of the infection.\nOther studies investigate the seroprevalence of\nTOSV in humans in southern Europe [8]. More\nrecent reports have demonstrated the occurrence\nof TOSV in Spain, in the Granada and Madrid\nprovinces [8,16-18]. A study by Navarro et al.\nshows that this virus is responsible for 7\npercent of aseptic meningitis cases in Spain\n[16]. In another Spanish study using samples\ncollected between 1988 and 1996, TOSV was the\ncause of 8 percent of aseptic meningitis cases;\nthese authors analysed 1268 serum samples from\nadults and children for the presence of\nantibodies against TOSV, and found a prevalence\nof 26.2 percent [17].\nEchevarria et al. [18] identified TOSV as the\ncause of 8.6 percent of aseptic meningitis cases\nin the region of Madrid, where 5 percent of the\nhealthy population were shown to have had a past\ninfection. Another Spanish publication on the\nseroprevalence of TOSV in the community of\nMadrid, comparing 2 periods (1993 to 1994 and\n1999 to 2000) found past infections in 7.2\npercent and 5.7 percent, respectively. It further\nshowed that seroprevalence is age dependent, with\nthe antibody prevalence increasing with age [14].\nTwo TOSV cases have been identified in southern\nFrance, one of aseptic meningitis and the other\nof influenza-like illness [19,20]. In addition,\nseveral reports have been published on TOSV\ninfection in travelers returning from\nMediterranean countries [21-24].\nThe climate conditions in Portugal favor\n_Phlebotomus_ survival. Two infections with TOSV,\nacquired in Portugal, have been reported in the\npast. Both were in male tourists, one Swedish and\none German, returning from their holidays in\nPortugal in 1985 and in 1996, respectively [25,\n26]. One of them had documented meningitis.\nStudies on the occurrence of TOSV in Portugal\nhave so far not been done, and the 6 cases of\nTOSV meningitis reported here are the 1st cases\ndiagnosed in Portuguese inhabitants. Thus, in our\nopinion, the investigation of TOSV in summer\ncases of meningitis in Portugal should be\ncontinued in the future, as it is done in other\nMediterranean countries, even though the\nprevalence of TOSV appears to be lower in\nPortugal. Serological surveys are planned to\ndocument the prevalence of antibodies against\nTOSV in all age groups of the Portuguese\npopulation, in order to gain a clearer picture of\nthe occurrence of this form of viral meningitis.\nAuthors: L Santos <lursantos@net.sapo.pt>)1, J\nSimoes2, R Costa2, S Martins2, H Lecour3. 1.\nInfectious Disease Service, School of Medicine\nand Hospital S.

In another Spanish study using samples\ncollected between 1988 and 1996, TOSV was the\ncause of 8 percent of aseptic meningitis cases;\nthese authors analysed 1268 serum samples from\nadults and children for the presence of\nantibodies against TOSV, and found a prevalence\nof 26.2 percent [17]. Samples\nthat were PCR-negative for enterovirus and herpes\nvirus and that had been taken from patients\nyounger than 30 years and hospitalised between\nMay and September each year were tested for TOSV\nwith a nested RT-PCR assay purchased from\nAmplimedical SpA (Toscana, N prot Kit). They were analysed by\nRT-PCR for the presence of a number of viruses\nknown to cause meningitis (enterovirus, herpes\nsimplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),\ncytomegalovirus (CMV), and West Nile virus)\nduring the acute phase of the disease. A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n The\ninclusion of Toscana virus (TOSV) diagnosis in\nthe laboratory tests for enterovirus- and\nherpesvirus-negative samples was an attempt to\nimprove the knowledge about aseptic meningitis. [Toscana virus infection may be one of the\narboviruses extending its range into Europe as a\nconsequence of climatic change and may contribute\nincreasingly to viral meningitis in children and\nyoung adults in coming years. [18] identified TOSV as the\ncause of 8.6 percent of aseptic meningitis cases\nin the region of Madrid, where 5 percent of the\nhealthy population were shown to have had a past\ninfection. Cerebrospinal fluid\nsamples from 308 patients with the diagnosis of\nmeningitis and with negative bacterial culture\nwere tested for enteroviruses and herpesviruses\nby reverse transcription PCR. This included only samples\nfrom patients who had been admitted between May\nand September in the years from 2002 to 2005 and\nhad been negative for enterovirus, HSV, EBV and\nCMV when tested upon hospital admission. TOSV was identified as the cause for 58\npercent of the cases admitted in the period\nbetween June and September, and for 10 percent of\nthe cases admitted from May to October,\nreflecting the seasonality of the infection. In Portugal, enteroviruses\nare the most frequent cause of aseptic meningitis\nbut, despite thorough testing, a significant\nnumber of patients are discharged from hospital\nwithout an etiological diagnosis [2,3]. In total,\nwe investigated 106 samples, collected between\nMay and September during the 4-year period\nbetween 2002 and 2005 from patients younger than\n30 years old. The aim of this study was to investigate\nthe occurrence of TOSV meningitis in children and\nyoung adults in an urban area in the north of\nPortugal.\n CSF samples from\npatients with a normal level of consciousness or\nwith somnolence (Glasgow Coma Scale >=14) were\nanalysed 1st for enterovirus, and, if this was\nnegative, subsequently for HSV. It can be\ncomplemented by immuno-enzymatic tests, which are\nrapid and sensitive [8,11], or culture, which in\ncombination with PCR is useful for genetic\ncharacterisation of the virus. Serological surveys are planned to\ndocument the prevalence of antibodies against\nTOSV in all age groups of the Portuguese\npopulation, in order to gain a clearer picture of\nthe occurrence of this form of viral meningitis. Another Spanish publication on the\nseroprevalence of TOSV in the community of\nMadrid, comparing 2 periods (1993 to 1994 and\n1999 to 2000) found past infections in 7.2\npercent and 5.7 percent, respectively. Thus, in our\nopinion, the investigation of TOSV in summer\ncases of meningitis in Portugal should be\ncontinued in the future, as it is done in other\n Most of the\nreported cases of TOSV infections occur\nthroughout the summertime in the central region\nof Italy, particularly in the Siena province, in\nchildren Most of the studies on\nTOSV have been done in central Italy, but the\noccurrence of TOSV in other countries, such as\nFrance, Spain, Slovenia, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey\nand Egypt, has also been reported recently [8].

Those samples that\nproved negative for enterovirus and herpesviruses\nwere tested for Toscana virus with a commercial\nreverse transcription nested PCR assay. Over the 4-year period (2002-2005), 308 patients\nwere admitted to the emergency department of our\nhospital with aseptic meningitis and hospitalised\nfor observation and study.

By 27 Sep 258 cases had been registered in the 2\nregions of Rezekne and Daugavpils. Enterovirus has been isolated from\nsamples taken from 54 patients from these regions. In Latvia, surveillance\nof aseptic meningitis is based on mandatory clinical notification.\nRezekne city and region: epidemiological and microbiological investigation\n---------------------------------------------------\nFrom 5 Aug to 27 Sep 2006, 105 cases of aseptic meningitis were registered\n(71 in Rezekne city, 21 in Rezekne district, and 13 in Ludza district). The\npatients included 89 children aged up to 18 years and 16 adults. The cases\nof aseptic meningitis in children were registered in 12 pre-school\nfacilities and in 13 schools in Rezekne city, Rezekne district and Ludza\ndistrict, and in a boarding school. To date, no cases have been severe and\nno sequelae have been reported in any of the patients.\nBy 27 Sep 2006, the national reference laboratory had isolated identical\nstrains of echovirus 30 from samples from 24 patients. Additionally,\nenteroviruses have been isolated from 11 patients, but the strains have not\nyet been serotyped.\nAn epidemiological investigation was launched by the Rezekne public health\nauthorities, and this determined that initial transmission was associated\nwith attending a sports centre in Rezekne, where several childrens' sports\nteams simultaneously use a common changing room. The changing room is very\nsmall and there was close contact between children. During the breaks, the\nchildren reported drinking non-potable water from a tap intended for\ncleaning the facilities. All the initial cases were associated with the\nsports centre. Secondary transmission to the initial patients' household\nand social contacts occurred. For the majority of subsequent cases it was\npossible to trace a link to an earlier case.\nDaugavpils city and district and Kraslava district: epidemiological and\nmicrobiological investigation\n----------------------------------------------------\nA rapid increase in number of cases of aseptic meningitis has been observed\nsince the beginning of September 2006. By 27 Sep 2006, 153 cases had been\nreported (104 in Daugavpils city, 38 in Daugavpils district, and 11 in\nKraslava district). Several cases reported in Kraslava are\nepidemiologically linked to the outbreak in Rezekne. Most of the patients\nare children. Cases have been registered in 12 pre-school facilities, 41\nschools, 4 vocational schools, one children's home and one university. All\nthe patients were admitted to hospital. By 27 Sep 2006, the microbiological\ninvestigation at the national reference laboratory had confirmed the\ncirculation of 3 serotypes of enterovirus: echovirus 6 (6 cases in August\n2006), and echovirus 20 (4 cases in August 2006) and echovirus 30 (4 cases\nin September 2006). Enterovirus has so far also been isolated from 5\npatients, but not yet serotyped. [The distribution of cases of aseptic\nmeningitis by age group, sex and location are tabulated in the original text.]\nDiscussion\n----------\nIn comparison with this year's numbers, in the period August to September\nin the previous 3 years, less than one case (average 0.7, range 0.3 to 1)\nwas registered per week in the affected regions. The national Public Health\nAgency is continuing to collect epidemiological data.

Viral and bacterial meningitis have been mandatorily notifiable\ndiseases in the Autonomous Region of Madrid since 1997. Clinical and\nepidemiological data are collected through a structured questionnaire\nfor every case. No changes in the reporting pattern have been\nobserved in recent years.\nThe cumulative incidence detected for the period was 7 cases per 100\n000 inhabitants (compared with 3/100 000 for the same period in\n2005). Three quarters of the cases were in children under 15 years of\nage, and 58 percent of all cases were male. The patients' ages ranged\nfrom 1 month to 73 years (median age = 5 years). The age group with\nthe highest incidence is 1-4 years (55 cases per 100 000), in\nchildren younger than 1 year (53 cases per 100 000) and in children\naged 5-9 years (46 cases per 100 000) (Figure. 1). Eleven per cent of\ncases were linked to other cases, particularly through household and\nschool contact. [These data are presented as a histogram in the text\nof the original report].\nNo sequelae have been reported in any of the patients, but 2 deaths\nhave been recorded. Both the patients who died had\nmeningoencephalitis, the cause of which was not identified.\nEnterovirus has so far been confirmed by serological or polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) in samples from 49 patients (11 percent).\nStrains identified were mainly echovirus 30 (62 percent) and\nechovirus 6 (19 percent). Both of these serotypes are frequently\nreported in Spain.\nThis increase has also been observed in other regions of Spain. The\nnumber of cases of viral meningitis notified in 2006 in the\nAutonomous Region of Madrid has been greater than that observed\nannually from 2001 to 2005, but not as great as the outbreak due to\nechovirus 13 in 2000 [1]. Incidence in 2006 peaked in weeks 21-25\n(late spring), which is the usual pattern observed in this region. In\nthe original text these data are presented in the form of a figure\nplotting number of cases per week in 2006 against the minimum, median\nand maximum case numbers for the period 2001-2005.\nMany different viruses can cause aseptic meningitis, but\nenteroviruses are responsible for more than 80 percent of cases in\nwhich the cause is identified [2]. Enteroviruses are typically\ntransmitted through the faecal-oral or oral-oral routes and through\nrespiratory droplets and fomites. Outbreaks of enteroviruses have\noccurred frequently in a wide variety of places and years and\ncontinue to do so [3-14]. No specific prevention or control measures\nare available. Good hygiene is recommended: frequent and thorough\nhand washing (especially after changing babies' nappies),\ndisinfection of contaminated surfaces with household cleaners (such\nas diluted bleach solution), and avoidance of sharing utensils and\ndrinking containers [15].\nControl measures\n----------------\nMeasures implemented as a result of this detected increase have been\nenhanced surveillance (spreading of weekly epidemiological reports to\nthe Epidemiological Surveillance Network of the Region of Madrid),\nimprovement of diagnosis confirmation (recommendation of specimen\ncollection and transport to the Enteroviruses Reference Laboratory)\nand distribution of information leaflets on the main control measures\nrecommended to the schools affected.\n[By MA Gutierrez Rodriguez1 (<angeles.gutierrez@salud.madrid.org>), L\nGarcia Comas1, I Rodero Garduno1, C Garcia Fernandez1, M Ordobas\nGavin1, R Ramirez Fernandez1, on behalf of the Red de Vigilancia\nEpidemiologica de la Comunidad de Madrid (Epidemiological\nSurveillance Network of the Autonomous Region of Madrid). 1Instituto\nde Salud Publica de la Comunidad de Madrid, Madrid, Spain]\nReferences\n----------\n(1) Trallero G, Casas I, Avellon A, Perez C, Tenorio A, de la Loma A.\nFirst epidemia of aseptic meningitis due to echovirus type 13 among\nSpanish children.

Since January it has afflicted 411 people, almost\n3 times more than the total for the same period in 2005. Eighty per cent of\nthe patients are under 15 years of age, and 2 have died.\nThe disease generally takes a benign form and cyclical epidemic outbreaks\noccur every 5-6 years There is neither a vaccine nor specific treatment.\nThe last [large outbreak] occurred in 2000 and affected 994 people. A\nreport of the Regional Department of Health reveals that the [current\noutbreak] is exhibiting great virulence, with an average of 25 cases per week.\nThe term meningitis embraces a wide range of viral and bacterial infectious\nagents which affect the membranes that cover the brain. The most serious\nform, against which there is a vaccine, is meningitis C, caused by a\nbacterium which can kill 15-25 per cent of patients, according to data from\nthe [Spanish (presumably. - Mod.SH)] Department of Health. More benign\nforms of meningitis are associated with viral infection. Viral meningitis\ncan be caused by more than 20 different viruses which can infect the\nmeninges, such as chickenpox virus and herpes simplex virus. The Department\nof Health has stated that the great majority of the cases of viral\nmeningitis take a mild course with no complications.\nIldefonso Hernandez, president of the Spanish Society of Epidemiology, said\nthat: 'Cyclical outbreaks of viral meningitis, like the present one, are\ncaused by enteroviruses, usually producing mild forms of disease.'\nEnteroviruses, like the other viruses that can cause meningitis, are\nwidespread and many people can be in contact with them without developing\nhealth problems. By causes that are not fully understood, every few years\n[such] viruses may undergo changes that enable them to reach and infect the\nmeninges.\n'Perhaps as in the case of the influenza viruses, an accumulation of small\ngenetic changes enables the virus to escape previously acquired [host]\nimmunity. After the 2000 outbreak, the incidence in the region declined to\nan average of between 200 to 300 annual cases, or about 4-5 cases a week.\n[In the present outbreak] by the end of February/beginning of March, there\nwas a sharp increase to 18 weekly cases, follow by a decrease in incidence\nto the more usual numbers. Subsequently, from the beginning of the last\nweek of May the [number] of cases of viral meningitis has [increased\nagain], reaching an average of 25 cases weekly, according to medical\nreports. (The most recent data are for the week 16-23 Jul 2006).\nThe viral meningitis outbreaks of 2000 and the present one follow similar\npatterns: mainly affecting younger people -- 81 per cent of the first 312\npatients were younger than 15 years, with an average of age of 5 years; 61\nper cent of patients are male. The symptoms of all the meningitis cases\ninclude fever, headache, and neck stiffness.\nEven in a mild case of viral meningitis physicians recommend a brief\nhospital stay, to allow exclusion of the more serious meningitis B or C by\nlaboratory diagnosis. If the meningitis is confirmed as viral, the patient\nis sent home with symptomatic treatment against the fever and the pains.\nVery rarely the disease lasts more than 10 or 15 days.\nTwo people have died in the present outbreak: males of 5 and 45 years,\naccording to the report of the Department of Health. A spokesman of the\ncouncil said that: 'Virus meningitis fatalities are usually patients who\npresented/displayed other ailments or that had impaired immune systems. It\nis very unusual for enteroviral meningitis to cause death.'\nThe disease is present in a dozen schools and nurseries. The Department of\nHealth has kept parents informed. 'It is important to [reassure] parents,\nwho are usually scared when they hear the word meningitis, and inform them\nthat the disease is mild, has a limited spread capacity, although there is\nno vaccine available.'\n--\nPablo Nart\n<pablo.nart@terra.es>\n[The identity of the enterovirus responsible for the increased incidence of\nmeningitis in the Madrid region is not stated. Further information would be\nwelcomed.

No deaths have\nbeen reported.\nAs it can take as long as a month after eating for symptoms to\nappear, some diners may not link their headache with the snails, and\ndoctors may not be able to find the real reason for the illness.\nAfter local media reported the news, the Beijing Friendship Hospital\nreceived more than 90 people over the weekend, all worried they might\nget the disease since they had eaten snail dishes in the past 2 months.\nThe hospital claimed 17 of them were suffering from meningitis. The\nyoungest patient was 13 years old, the Beijing Evening News reported yesterday.\nCurrently the [involved] restaurant is not selling the dish while\ndiners elsewhere are refusing to eat Amazonian snails.\nAccording to the bureau, other seafood may also contain parasites but\nthe Amazonian snail can host more than others.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[It is not clear what 'parasitic eel worms' refers to.\n_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ is known to cause eosinophilic\nmeningitis.

Midsummer is the\npeak season for viral meningitis, said Pam Davenport, spokeswoman for the\nHealth Department.\n[Viral meningitis caused by enteroviruses] is believed to be transmitted\nthrough human contact with water, such as rivers, lakes, and wading pools.\n'It is often transmitted through fecal-oral [contact] when you get little\nkids in diapers in some of these water recreational places.'\nThe viruses that cause viral meningitis are 'very common during the summer\nand early fall, and many people are exposed to them,' said Dagmar Vitek,\nmedical officer for the Health Department. 'However, most infected persons\neither have no symptoms or develop only a cold or rash with low-grade\nfever. Only a small portion of infected persons actually develop meningitis.'\nViral meningitis is a common -- but rarely serious -- disease. The illness\nlasts from 7 to 10 days. Symptoms often include headache, fever,\nsensitivity to light, stiff or sore neck, and nausea and vomiting.\nEnteroviruses, the commonest cause of viral meningitis, are often spread\nthrough direct contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva or\nmucus, from an infected person, according to Ilene Risk, an epidemiologist\nwith the Health Department. The virus can also be found in the stool of\ninfected people. In the summer, the high number of young children in\nfountains or wading pools is believed to increase the spread of viral\nmeningitis, Risk said.

We can talk about a meningitis outbreak only after 10\nregistered cases occur in the same district, whereas an epidemic is\n[declared] when the number of cases is 10 times greater. For\nexample, in the Sverdlovsk region, an epidemic was not declared\neven although 200 cases of meningitis were registered.\nMost of the infected are children. According to Sosnizkiy, the\nchildren probably contracted infection after swimming. The fact that\nthe epidemic occurred in September can be explained by the long\nincubation period of the illness. According to Sosnizkiy, enteroviral\ninfections [resulting in meningitis] are caused by coxsackieviruses\nor echoviruses.\nMeningitis morbidity has been sporadic during recent years. The\ndisease starts acutely, with high fever, severe headache, and\nfrequent vomiting not associated with food intake.

Other\nsymptoms include headache, muscle soreness and low-grade fever, all of\nwhich can be West Nile virus infection symptoms.\nDr. Adrienne LeBailly, director of the Larimer County health department, is\nworking with state officials and the CDC to identify the virus. She said it\nis probably transmitted by fecal matter, unlike mosquito-borne West Nile.\nIt also could be transmitted through respiratory secretions such as saliva\nor nasal mucus. The virus is not at this time considered a public health\nthreat, LeBailly said. Gershman said the number of non-West Nile\nvirus-associated meningitis cases is at a record level in Colorado.

Enteroviruses are the commonest cause of aseptic\nmeningitis (2). Echovirus 9 (E9) and echovirus 30 (E30) have been\nassociated frequently with outbreaks of aseptic meningitis (3,4,5).\nDuring March 2003, several state public health departments noted increased\nreports of aseptic meningitis and, as of 7 Aug 2003, 7 states (Arizona,\nCalifornia, Georgia, Idaho, Oregon, South Carolina, and Texas) had reported\noutbreaks associated with either E9 or E30. This report summarizes the\nepidemiologic features of the aseptic meningitis outbreaks in 5 states\n(Arizona, California, Georgia, Idaho, and South Carolina) and provides an\noverview of enterovirus activity in the US during the period 1 Jan to 7 Aug\n2003. Enteroviruses, E9 and E30 in particular, should be considered in the\ndifferential diagnosis of people with aseptic meningitis.\nAseptic meningitis is not a nationally notifiable disease, and no\nnationally accepted case definition exists for this condition (6).\nTherefore, cases of aseptic meningitis described in this report represent\nphysician diagnoses based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings.\nThe enterovirus surveillance data were obtained from reports to the\nNational Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS), a passive voluntary\nsurveillance system based on reporting by state public health and private\nlaboratories of enterovirus detections by serotype and basic demographic\ninformation, specimen type, and date of collection.\nAseptic Meningitis Outbreaks\n----------------------------\nArizona:\n-------\nFrom 1 Jan to 7 Jul 2003, a total of 465 cases of aseptic meningitis\n(rate: 8.6 per 100 000 population) were reported to the Arizona Department\nof Health Services, compared with 104 cases (rate: 1.9) reported for the\nsame period in 2002. The highest rate during this period was reported in\nMaricopa County (rate: 12.7, compared with 2.7 during the same period in\n2002). As of 31 Jul 2003, the Arizona State Health Laboratory had reported\n62 enterovirus isolates, the majority (66 per cent) from cerebrospinal\nfluid (CSF) specimens. Of the 62 isolates, E30 accounted for 47 isolates\nand E9 for one isolate.\nCalifornia:\n----------\nAs of 5 Aug 2003, a total of 1753 cases of aseptic meningitis (rate: 8.0\nper 100 000 population) had been reported to the California Department of\nHealth Services (CDHS). During 1999 to 2003, the annual reported rate of\naseptic meningitis in California ranged from 4.5 to 7.3. Specimens from 148\npatients with aseptic meningitis were submitted to CDHS for diagnostic\ntesting from 24 counties throughout the state. Serum and CSF specimens from\nall patients were tested for enteroviruses and arboviruses (West Nile virus\n[WNV], St. Louis encephalitis virus, and western equine encephalitis virus)\nat CDHS. Of the 148 patients, 82 (55 per cent) had evidence of enterovirus\ninfection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture; E30 was identified\nfrom 29 (85%) of the 82 culture-positive cases, and E9 was identified from\nfour (12%) cases.\nGeorgia:\n-------\nDuring March, an outbreak of aseptic meningitis associated with E9\ninfection began in Augusta, Georgia. During the period 10 Mar to 23 Jul\n2003, a total of 320 cases were reported from 50 of Georgia's 159 counties,\ncompared with 227 cases reported statewide during 2002. E9 has been\nisolated from CSF, throat swab, and/or rectal swab specimens of 24\npatients. Enteroviruses (untyped) were isolated from an additional 24 CSF\nspecimens, and 52 CSF specimens tested positive for enteroviruses by PCR.\nPatients commonly reported headache, fever, nausea or vomiting, stiff neck,\nand photophobia. As of 7 Aug 2003, the outbreak was ongoing.\nIdaho:\n-----\nFrom 2 May to 17 Jul 2003, an outbreak of viral meningitis occurred in\nnorth central Idaho, with 38 cases from 3 adjacent counties reported to the\nIdaho Division of Health, compared with 4 cases reported statewide during\nthe previous year. Of the 32 patients for whom clinical information was\navailable, 17 were hospitalized with clinical signs and symptoms consistent\nwith aseptic meningitis. E30 was isolated from 2 of 4 patients who\nunderwent virologic investigation. Two cases of aseptic meningitis reported\nsubsequently from the same area are under investigation by the North\nCentral District Health Department.\nSouth Carolina:\n--------------\nFrom 6 Apr to 31 Jul 2003, a total of 82 cases of viral meningitis were\nidentified by the Aiken County Health Department. The outbreak peaked in\nMay, when 38 cases were reported. E9 was isolated from CSF of 2 of these\npatients. At the same time, adjacent counties in Georgia also experienced\nan outbreak of aseptic meningitis associated with E9. In June, cases began\nto appear in multiple counties. The number of reports and CSF specimen\nsubmissions to the South Carolina State Laboratory continued to increase in\nJuly. As of 31 Jul 2003, a total of 130 cases of aseptic meningitis had\nbeen reported; E9 was isolated from 20 specimens (18 CSF and 2 throat\nwashings) from 8 different counties, and no other enteroviruses were\nidentified. Because viral meningitis is not a notifiable disease in South\nCarolina, comparative data are not available for previous years.\nEnterovirus surveillance data\n-----------------------------\nAs of 7 Aug 2003, NESS had received reports of 365 enterovirus detections\nin 25 states; source specimens for these isolates were collected from 5 Jan\nto 30 Jul 2003. The most commonly detected serotypes were E9 and E30, with\nE30 accounting for 132 (36 per cent) and E9 accounting for 108 (30 per\ncent) reports. E9 was isolated in 14 states, mainly in the East (for\nexample, Georgia, Florida, New Jersey, and South Carolina), and E30 was\nisolated in 10 states, mainly in the West (for example, Arizona,\nCalifornia, Colorado, and Texas). For both serotypes, CSF was the source\nspecimen in the majority of cases (72 [67 per cent] for E9 and 107 [81 per\ncent] for E30).\nOther enterovirus serotypes reported most frequently include coxsackievirus\nB1 (29 [8 per cent] of all reports), echovirus 7 (10 [3 per cent]),\ncoxsackievirus A9 (10 [3 per cent]), enterovirus 71 (nine [3 per cent]),\ncoxsackievirus B4 (12 [4 per cent]), and echovirus 5 (seven [2 per cent]).\n(Reported by: R Cheshier, Arizona Dept of Health Svcs.

The disease\noccurs both sporadically and in outbreaks, and >90 per cent of cases with\nan identified cause are associated with enteroviruses (2). Many aseptic\nmeningitis outbreaks occurring during the current enterovirus season\nreflect high levels of E9 and E30 activity. In 2003, E9 has been involved\npredominantly in the outbreaks in the East, and E30 has been linked\nexclusively with outbreaks in the West.\nFrom 1970 to 2001, both E9 and E30 were among the 15 enteroviruses\nreported most commonly each year, accounting for 10.2 per cent and 8.2 per\ncent of all enterovirus isolates reported to CDC, respectively (CDC,\nunpublished data, 2003). However, these enteroviruses have been relatively\nquiescent in recent years; E9 has not been the predominant enterovirus\nisolated from clinical specimens since 1995, and E30 has not been\nwidespread since 1998 (7,8). This probably has resulted in an accumulation\nof cohorts of susceptible persons who have not been exposed previously to\nthese agents.\nThe increase in aseptic meningitis cases associated with high activity of\nE9 and E30 is consistent with the historic data; during the period 1988 to\n1999, peak years for viral meningitis hospitalizations in the United States\ncoincided with periods of high activity of either E9 or E30 (1).\nAlthough most cases of enterovirus infections are asymptomatic or result in\nmild febrile illnesses, aseptic meningitis is the main diagnosis reported\nwith the current E9 and E30 activity in the US because patients with\nmeningitis are more likely to be tested for enteroviruses than those with\nless severe manifestations. In a small proportion of cases, more severe,\nlife-threatening diseases (such as encephalitis, paralysis,\nmyopericarditis, and neonatal enteroviral sepsis) might occur.\nEnteroviruses typically demonstrate a marked seasonality in temperate\nclimates, with a typical enterovirus season in the United States occurring\nduring June to October (9). In 2003, the enterovirus season appears to have\nstarted early, with the first isolations of E9 reported in January (in\nLouisiana), the first outbreaks of E9-associated aseptic meningitis\nreported in March, and the first isolations of E30 reported in April (in\nArizona). WNV has the same seasonal pattern as enteroviruses, and is also\nassociated with neurologic signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis.\nHowever, WNV-associated meningitis tends to occur among older people\n(median age: 46 years) (10), whereas children and young adults (median age:\n13 years) are at highest risk for enteroviral meningitis (1). The\ninvestigation of an aseptic meningitis outbreak in an area of high WNV\nepizootic activity in 2001 indicated that enteroviruses were the leading\ncause of aseptic meningitis in this area, and no evidence of WNV infection\nwas detected (10). For this reason, diagnostic testing of specimens from\nyounger patients with aseptic meningitis should include testing for\nenteroviruses, even during a documented WNV outbreak (10).\nEarly etiologic diagnosis of aseptic meningitis helps to avoid unnecessary\nantibiotic treatment and additional testing. Although virus culture is the\nstandard technique for enterovirus detection, it consumes time and\nresources and has limited clinical use. Molecular methods of enterovirus\ndetection (such as PCR and typing based on genomic sequences) are\nincreasingly becoming available. Serotype-specific PCR primers have been\ndeveloped by CDC for several enteroviruses, including E30 (5). These\nserotype-specific primers are useful for rapid differentiation of cases in\npatients infected with the outbreak strain from sporadic infections with\nother enteroviruses.\nAseptic meningitis is a benign, self-limiting illness, and severe illness\nand death are uncommon. The treatment is symptomatic and most patients\nrecover in about 1 week. Enteroviruses typically are spread person to\nperson through the fecal-oral or oral-oral routes and through respiratory\ndroplets and fomites. No specific prevention or control measures are\navailable for nonpolio enteroviruses including E9 and E30. Adherence to\ngood hygienic practices, such as frequent and thorough hand washing\n(especially after diaper changes), disinfection of contaminated surfaces by\nhousehold cleaners (such as diluted bleach solution), and avoidance of\nshared utensils and drinking containers, are recommended to help interrupt\ntransmission.\nReferences\n----------\n(1) Khetsuriani N, Quiroz E, Holman R, Anderson L.

One died. A fourth case is under investigation.\nMethylprednisolone is a corticosteroid administered by injection to treat\njoint pain [by decreasing inflammation - Mod.LL]. All 3 of the patients who\ndeveloped meningitis had received an injection of the drug in their spine\nbetween April and July 2002. A total of 3 North Carolina facilities\nreceived shipments of the contaminated drug: FirstHealth Moore Regional\nHospital Pain Clinic in Pinehurst, Wayne Memorial Hospital in Goldsboro,\nand Johnston Pain Management in Jacksonville. (The drug supply was not used\nat FH Moore Regional Hospital but was limited only to the hospital's pain\nclinic.) The 3 facilities are contacting all of their patients who may have\nbeen treated with the drug, either through spinal injection or injection\ninto a joint or trigger point area.\nPhysicians investigating the cases traced the cause of the infections to\nthe drug, which was provided by a single supplier in South Carolina. The\ndrug was contaminated with _Wangiella dermatitidis_, a fungus. An\ninvestigation is being conducted to determine how the drug became contaminated.\nThe drug was shipped to clinics and hospitals in 5 states, including North\nCarolina. The drug from that manufacturer is no longer being used; that\npharmacy has issued a recall on 17 Sep 2002 and no longer manufactures the\nproduct.\nPatients were injected with the recalled drug as recently as 12 Sep 2002.\nOne of the cases developed meningitis 10 weeks after the injection, so it\nis possible that new cases may subsequently develop.\nPatients who may have been infected through an injection into other parts\nof their body, such as their knee or other joint, may experience symptoms\nof a localized infection: pain, redness, a joint that is hot to the touch,\nswelling, or difficulty with movement of the joint. Patients of any of the\n3 facilities who are experiencing any of these symptoms, or who suspect\nthat they may be developing an infection, should immediately contact their\nprimary care physician, the pain clinic where they were treated, or the\nnearest hospital emergency department.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Wangiella is a dematiaceous, cosmopolitan fungus that inhabits the soil\nand plant material. Wangiella may cause various infections in humans. The\nonly species included in the genus Wangiella is _Wangiella dermatitidis_.\nThe taxonomic position of this species is not fully consistent. While some\nauthorities classify it in the genus Wangiella as _Wangiella dermatitidis_,\nothers prefer to classify it in the genus Exophiala as _Exophiala\ndermatitidis_. _Wangiella dermatitidis_ is an occasional causative agent of\nphaeohyphomycosis. Subcutaneous phaehypomycosis is the commonest clinical\npicture. The infection develops after traumatic implantation of the fungus\nthrough the skin. _Wangiella dermatitidis_ is a neurotropic fungus. Central\nnervous system infections have been reported. It may also cause keratitis,\notitis, pneumonia, and endocarditis. Disseminated infections may develop\nparticularly in immunocompromised patients. _Wangiella dermatitidis_ may\ncause bovine abortion and still birth. - Mod.TG\n_Wangiella dermatitidis_ has been associated with various human infections,\nusually related to traumatic or iatrogenic wounds.

In September 2002, the North Carolina Division of\nPublic Health (NCDPH) was notified of 2 cases of meningitis caused by\na rare fungus in patients who had received epidural injections at\noutpatient pain management clinics. This report describes 5 cases of\nfungal infection associated with contaminated drugs prepared at a\ncompounding pharmacy. Clinicians should consider improperly\ncompounded medications as a possible source of infection in patients\nafter epidural or intra-articular injections.\nCase Reports\nCase 1. On 5 Jul 2002, a woman aged 77 years with chronic low back\npain was admitted to hospital A in North Carolina with a 4-day\nhistory of progressive diffuse headache, fever, chills, and malaise\nwith subsequent development of vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. She was\nfebrile (100.4 F [38.0 C]) and had slight nuchal rigidity. Analysis\nof cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was consistent with meningitis: 979\nwhite blood cells (WBC)/mm3 (normal: <10 WBC/mm3) with 63 percent\nneutrophils, protein of 134 mg/dL (normal: 15-45 mg/dL), and glucose\nof 38 mg/dL (normal: 40-80 mg/dL).\nThe patient showed no improvement on antibacterial drugs, and a\nfollow-up CSF analysis on 18 Jul 18 2002 revealed yeast-like elements\non microscopic examination. The patient was treated with amphotericin\nB and transferred to hospital B in North Carolina. On 24 Jul 2002, a\nfungus cultured from CSF was identified as _Exophiala (Wangiella)\ndermatitidis_. Amphotericin B was discontinued, and voriconazole and\nflucytosine were started. The patient's condition continued to\ndeteriorate, and she died 51 days after hospitalization.\nThe patient had been treated at pain management clinic A in North\nCarolina and had received lumbar epidural injections with\nmethylprednisolone acetate 100 and 35 days before hospital admission.\nThe injectable methylprednisolone had been prepared by compounding\npharmacy A in South Carolina.\nCase 2. On 14 Aug 2002, a woman aged 61 years who was being treated\nfor chronic low back pain at pain management clinic A was admitted to\nhospital A after CSF obtained during a myelogram was consistent with\nmeningitis (820 WBC/mm3 with 52 percent neutrophils, protein of 108\nmg/dL, and glucose of 57 mg/dL). The patient had a 3-5 day history of\nmild headache, subjective fever, chills, sweats, and mild neck\nstiffness. The patient had received lumbar epidural injections at\npain management clinic A 84 and 34 days before hospital admission.\nThe injections contained methylprednisolone acetate prepared by\ncompounding pharmacy A. CSF grew yeast, later identified as _E.\ndermatitidis_, 27 days after collection. The patient was begun on\nintravenous voriconazole and later switched to oral voriconazole; as\nof 5 Dec (70 days into therapy), her condition had improved.\nAdditional cases: Clinicians from hospital A notified NCDPH of the 2\ncases of _E. dermatitidis_ meningitis; 3 additional cases have been\nidentified.\nCase 3 occurred in a woman aged 71 years who had _E. dermatitidis_\nmeningitis. She was admitted to hospital B in North Carolina on 8 Jul\n2002 and had received epidural methylprednisolone acetate injections\nat pain management clinic B 82, 55, and 35 days before\nhospitalization.\nCase 4 occurred in a woman aged 65 years who had _E. dermatitidis_\nmeningitis. She was admitted to hospital C in North Carolina on 8 Oct\n2002 and had received epidural methylprednisolone acetate injections\nat pain management clinic A 116 days before hospitalization.\nCase 5 occurred in a woman aged 52 years who had _E. dermatitidis_\nsacroiliitis. She was admitted to hospital D in North Carolina on 4\nNov 2002 and had received intra-articular methylprednisolone acetate\ninjections at pain management clinic B 103 and 152 days before\nhospitalization.\nInvestigation of Compounding Pharmacy A\nCompounding pharmacy A was the source of the methylprednisolone\nacetate administered to all 5 patients with _Exophiala_ infections.\nThe pharmacy had been supplying the compounded product to hospitals\nand pain management clinics in 5 states after a proprietary form of\nmethylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension (Depo Medrol\u00c6,\nPharmacia Corp., Peapack, New Jersey) became difficult to obtain from\nthe manufacturer. An investigation of compounding pharmacy A by the\nSouth Carolina Board of Pharmacy (SCBP) found improper performance of\nan autoclave with no written procedures for autoclave operation, no\ntesting for sterility or appropriate checking of quality indicators,\nand inadequate clean-room practices as outlined in the American\nSociety of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidance for\npharmacy-prepared sterile products (2).\nMicrobiologic culture at CDC and the Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) of unopened vials from 3 separate lots of injectable\nmethylprednisolone obtained from compounding pharmacy A yielded _E.\ndermatitidis_. On 27 Sep 2002, SCBP ordered the pharmacy to halt\nfurther sale of compounded drug products. Injectable drugs had been\ndistributed to physicians, hospitals, clinics, and consumers in 11\nstates (Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana,\nMassachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South\nCarolina, and Virginia). FDA inspection of the compounding facility\nrevealed that the firm failed to have adequate controls to ensure\nnecessary sterility, including the absence of appropriate testing for\npotency and sterility before distribution. On 15 Nov 2002, based on\nthe lack of assurance that the pharmacy's products were sterile, FDA\nannounced a nationwide alert about all injectable drug products\nprepared by the pharmacy.\nAll sites that received injectable methylprednisolone prepared by\ncompounding pharmacy A have been contacted and have returned all\nunused products for testing. Treating clinicians were informed of the\ninvestigation of the adulterated product. In 2 states, patients who\nmight have received the product were sent letters directing them to\nseek medical attention if they developed symptoms, and laboratories\nwere instructed to notify state officials if they isolated _E.\ndermatitidis_ from clinical specimens.\n[MMWR] Editorial Note:\nAs of 5 Dec 2002, 5 cases of _Exophiala_ infection associated with\ninjectable medication from compounding pharmacy A had occurred. Cases\noccurred up to 152 days following an injection.\nPharmacy compounding is the process of combining drug ingredients to\nprepare medications that are not commercially available or to alter\ncommercially available medications to meet specific patient needs\nsuch as dye-free or liquid formulations (3). The practice of\ncompounding has been reported to be increasing, with an estimated 43\n000 compounded medications prepared daily in the United States (4,5).\nPharmacists traditionally have prepared medications to fulfill\nindividual prescription requests or manipulated reasonable quantities\nof human drugs on receipt of a valid prescription for an individually\nidentified patient from a licensed practitioner. Some compounding is\nlegal under state laws, and, when appropriate, FDA can exercise its\nenforcement discretion regarding new drugs and certain other\nrequirements of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (6).\nOn-site investigation of compounding pharmacy A by state and federal\nregulators identified several instances of nonadherence to sterile\ntechnique. Microbiologic cultures at CDC and FDA of\nmethylprednisolone from unopened vials prepared by compounding\npharmacy A yielded isolates of _E. dermatitidis_. This fungus caused\nthe death from meningitis in one patient, sacroiliitis in another,\nand meningitis in 3 other patients who had received either epidural\nor intra-articular injections of methylprednisolone compounded at\npharmacy A. Other recent clusters of infections associated with\nproducts prepared by compounding pharmacies include _Serratia_\nmeningitis from epidural injections of betamethasone in California\n(Contra Costa Health Services, unpublished data, 2002) and\n_Chryseomonas_ meningitis from epidural injections of\nmethylprednisolone in Michigan (CDC, unpublished data, 2002). These\nmeningitis clusters all occurred among patients who received epidural\ninjections for chronic pain management.\n_E. dermatitidis_ is a neurotropic, dark pigment-forming fungus found\nin soil and is an uncommon cause of human illness (7). Limited data\nare available on treatment; however, in vitro data suggest that\namphotericin B, itraconazole, terbinafine, and voriconazole might be\neffective (8). Isolates from 4 of the 5 infected persons reported\nwere tested in vitro and were susceptible to voriconazole,\nitraconazole, and amphotericin B. Voriconazole was chosen for\ntreating the 5 persons reported because of in vitro susceptibility\nresults and availability of an oral form of the drug.\nClinicians or laboratorians diagnosing any cases of Exophiala should\ndetermine whether the patient had received injections of\nmethylprednisolone in the last year. Although the implicated product\nhas been recalled, clinicians should be aware that cases might still\noccur because of the possible long incubation period of the fungal\ninfection. Patients with possible injection-associated Exophiala\ninfections should be reported to their state health department and to\nCDC, telephone 800-893-0485; such information should be exchanged\nrapidly with other state and local health departments. Clinicians\nshould consider the possibility of contaminated medication as a\nsource of infection in patients after epidural or intra-articular\ninjections. Compounding pharmacies should ensure that pharmacy staff\nare trained appropriately and that proper sterile technique is\nfollowed in accordance with existing standards from ASHP (2) and the\nUnited States Pharmacopeia (<http://www.usp.org>). FDA has outlined\nspecific activities that help distinguish the role of compounding\npharmacies from that of pharmaceutical manufacturing (4).\nSome health-system pharmacists might not realize that they are\npurchasing injectables prepared through compounding (1). Purchasers\nof pharmaceuticals should determine whether supplies are provided\nfrom a compounding pharmacy that is licensed in their state and that\nfollows appropriate measures to ensure that injectable products are\nfree of contamination. In most states, compounding pharmacies are not\nrequired to report adverse events associated with their products to\nstate or federal agencies. Such reporting to FDA is required for\npharmaceutical manufacturing companies. Health-care professionals and\ncompounding pharmacies are urged to report contaminated compounded\ndrug products or adverse events associated with compounded drug\nproducts to their state boards of pharmacy and health departments. To\nhelp prevent further cases, practitioners also are encouraged to\nsubmit such reports to FDA's MedWatch program by telephone at\n1-800-332-1088 or at\n<http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm>.\nReferences\n1.Young D.

Patients with possible injection-associated Exophiala\ninfections should be reported to their state health department and to\nCDC, telephone 800-893-0485; such information should be exchanged\nrapidly with other state and local health departments. Pharmacists traditionally have prepared medications to fulfill\nindividual prescription requests or manipulated reasonable quantities\nof human drugs on receipt of a valid prescription for an individually\nidentified patient from a licensed practitioner. Clinicians\nshould consider the possibility of contaminated medication as a\nsource of infection in patients after epidural or intra-articular\ninjections. FDA inspection of the compounding facility\nrevealed that the firm failed to have adequate controls to ensure\nnecessary sterility, including the absence of appropriate testing for\npotency and sterility before distribution. Although the implicated product\nhas been recalled, clinicians should be aware that cases might still\noccur because of the possible long incubation period of the fungal\ninfection. Limited data\nare available on treatment; however, in vitro data suggest that\namphotericin B, itraconazole, terbinafine, and voriconazole might be\neffective (8). She was admitted to hospital C in North Carolina on 8 Oct\n2002 and had received epidural methylprednisolone acetate injections\nat pain management clinic A 116 days before hospitalization. The injections contained methylprednisolone acetate prepared by\ncompounding pharmacy A. CSF grew yeast, later identified as _E.\ndermatitidis_, 27 days after collection. This report describes 5 cases of\nfungal infection associated with contaminated drugs prepared at a\ncompounding pharmacy. (Contra Costa Health Services, unpublished data, 2002) and\n_Chryseomonas_ meningitis from epidural injections of\nmethylprednisolone in Michigan (CDC, unpublished data, 2002). Microbiologic cultures at CDC and FDA of\nmethylprednisolone from unopened vials prepared by compounding\npharmacy A yielded isolates of _E. dermatitidis_. These\nmeningitis clusters all occurred among patients who received epidural\ninjections for chronic pain management. Additional cases: Clinicians from hospital A notified NCDPH of the 2\ncases of _E. dermatitidis_ meningitis; 3 additional cases have been\nidentified. The injectable methylprednisolone had been prepared by compounding\npharmacy A in South Carolina.\n In most states, compounding pharmacies are not\nrequired to report adverse events associated with their products to\nstate or federal agencies. Clinicians should consider improperly\ncompounded medications as a possible source of infection in patients\nafter epidural or intra-articular injections.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2002-09-27 00:00:00", "2002-11-15 00:00:00", "2002-03-26 00:00:00", "2002-08-14 00:00:00", "2002-12-26 00:00:00", "2002-12-05 00:00:00", "2055-03-26 00:00:00", "2002-07-24 00:00:00", "2002-07-05 00:00:00", "2002-09-26 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Peapack", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "North", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Carolina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Connecticut", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "North Carolina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "South \n Carolina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Exophiala", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Massachusetts", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Michigan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Louisiana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mississippi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Virginia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Illinois", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Indiana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Hampshire", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kentucky", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Jersey", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2202880", "headline": "PRO> Fungal meningitis, contaminated drug - USA: alert (02)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2202880", "date": "2002-11-17 23:50:00", "main_text": "FUNGAL MENINGITIS, CONTAMINATED DRUG - USA: ALERT (02)\n*************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail, a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n[1]\nDate: 16 Nov 2002\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: AP Online 16 Nov 2002 09:36 EST (edited)\n\nFDA issues warning on injected drugs\n------------------------------------\nWASHINGTON (AP): Pain clinics and other health facilities should\nimmediately quit using all injectable drugs made by a South Carolina\npharmacy after one of that company's drugs was linked to deadly meningitis,\nthe [United States] government said on Friday, 15 Nov 2002.\nThe Food and Drug Administration () issued a nationwide alert warning\nhealth workers that injectable antibiotics, pain medications and hormones\nmade by Urgent Care Pharmacy of Spartanburg, SC, may be dangerous.

Viral meningitis\nis a less severe form of meningitis than bacterial, which has a higher\nmortality rate and more severe symptoms. The viral form is rarely fatal\nfor people with normal immune systems, according to the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention.\n'It's an unusual amount that we're seeing at the hospital right now,'\nsaid Dr. Robert Lozano, a Brownsville neurologist. 'We're a little\nconcerned about it. I've been practicing here 10 years, and I have never\nseen a peak like this.' One of the unusual features of the cases is that\nthey involve 2 sets of family members, Lozano said. 'Usually, whole\nfamilies don't get it,' Lozano said. Lozano said the patients are expected\nto recover fully.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The diagnosis does not identify a specific virus as the etiologic agent.\nVarious enteroviruses have been associated with meningitis in the past,\nbut other viruses are not excluded. The early timing of this outbreak\n(enteroviruses tend to peak in their activity in the late summer and early\nfall in the USA) and the concern raised by the neurologist starts one to\nthink of some other alternative diagnoses. For example: Why does\nWest Nile virus spring into my mind (a left-field diagnosis)? (In the\nWNV outbreaks in Romania in recent years have presented as virla\nmeningitis -- see refs below. - Mod.JW) While WNV has not been\nreported in Texas as yet, it doesn't mean it hasn't managed to 'sneak in\nthe back door'.

The Capital Health Region's 50 cases of meningitis since Dec 1999\n-- 3 fatal -- make an 'outbreak' for an urban area the size of Edmonton's,\nsaid Theresa Tam, medical epidemiologist for Health Canada.\n'Nationally the rate for meningitis is one per 100 000 people, so for a\ncity like Edmonton you would expect to see maybe 8 cases a year,' Tam\nsaid. '50 is a much higher than usual number. That is about 6 cases per\n100 000 people in a year when the national average was 0.7 per 100\n000. That isn't a cluster of the disease -- it's an outbreak.'\nLast November, Capital Health immunized 59 600 children and young adults\nwith meningitis vaccines to try to curb the disease. 'The campaign was\nbecause the numbers were so much higher than we would normally see,' Tam said.\nDr. Vinod Dhawan, chief of infectious diseases at the Martin Luther King\nJr. General Hospital in Los Angeles, said 6 meningitis cases per 100 000\npeople is cause for concern. 'That seems to be very high . . . we haven't\nseem numbers like that in a while,' Dhawan said.\nAlthough none of the Capital Health Region's cases were connected by a\nneighbourhood or school, the disease was being spread from person to person\nthroughout the region, Tam said. 'It was being spread around some way and\nit's not a bacterium that is spread easily.' In 1992 there were cluster\noutbreaks in Ottawa and Montreal that sparked vaccination campaigns, but\nthe numbers weren't as bad as in Edmonton over the last year, Tam added.\nDr. Gerry Predy, medical officer of health for the Capital Health Region,\nsays he hopes we've seen the last of the outbreak here. 'We had an unusual\nnumber of cases for many months and then the numbers dropped off in the\nsummer and picked right back up again,' Predy said. 'We are hoping to see\nthe end of it in the next few weeks.'\nTests done on Edmonton's meningitis cases show there was a unique strain of\nmeningitis being spread throughout the city, he said. 'The organism\ncirculating here was different than we have seen before. The subtle\ngenetic changes may have led to the situation we had last year.' Local\nmeningitis experts are conducting tests on the Edmonton strain of disease.\n'Meningitis is something we will never get rid of but hopefully the test\nresult will be of value fighting the disease.'\n[Byline: Kevin Connor]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[ProMED-mail would like to receive more information on the outbreak.

Thessaloniki coroner\nDimitris Psaroulis has not yet determined the cause of death but believes\nit was brought on by a virus. 'I believe [the cause of death] is a viral\ninfection,' he said. 'I don't know where it originated from,' he added,\nnoting that he would have to wait for the laboratory test results to\nascertain the exact cause.\nReports stated yesterday that the woman was transferred to the Panagia\nclinic in Thessaloniki 3 days after developing flu symptoms. Efthymios\nSofianos, head of the\nambulance service (EKAV) in Thessaloniki, told reporters that when the\nhusband called them, his wife's symptoms had not caused them any particular\nconcern as they seemed to be associated with the common cold. 'He spoke of\na temperature and weakness then 3 days later told us she was also\nvomiting,' said Sofianos.\nWhen she arrived at Panagia, Aristidis Grammatikopoulos, the clinic's chief\nadministrator, said that the wife was unable to breathe. He said that she\nwas taken to intensive care but died 5 hours later. Her husband, 4-year-old\nson and 7-year-old daughter were hospitalised yesterday morning at the\nThessaloniki Hospital for Infectious Diseases after developing a high fever\nand headaches.\nPsaroulis is also investigating the deaths of another woman & a man who\nalso succumbed to a viral infection in Thessaloniki this week. He said that\nthe deaths could have been caused by meningitis though he did not exclude\nthe possibility of influenza.\nA 20-year-old man brought to hospital in Thessaloniki from the northern\nGreek town of Kozani was reported to have died from meningitis yesterday,\nwhile another 2 cases of this viral infection were reported on the Ionian\nisland of Corfu. A 16-year-old boy and 17-year-old girl diagnosed with the\ndisease were transferred to a Ioannina hospital and to Athens' Evangelismos\nhospital respectively, where doctors are hopeful they will recover.\nScores of individuals flocked to Sotiria hospital complaining of breathing\ndifficulties brought on by colds and viral infections. They were\nhospitalised but due to the increased demand on the facility, were forced\nto sleep in the hospital's corridors on camp beds.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@promedmail.org\n[In the midst of the current influenza epidemic in Greece some sudden\ndeaths from influenza are to be expected, but the medica authorities\napparently suspect these cases to be viral meningitis.

The phenotype (serogroup, serotype and\nserosubtype) and antibiotic susceptibility of 343 isolates of _Neisseria\nmeningitidis_ from invasive cases of meningococcal disease were determined\nin 1997. Ninety six percent of the invasive isolates were serogroup B or C.\nSerogroup B strains predominated in all States and Territories and were\nisolated from sporadic cases of invasive disease. Phenotypes B:4:P1.4 and\nB:15:P1.7 were prominent.\nSerogroup C isolates were most often encountered in New South Wales,\nespecially in adolescents and young adults, and in that State were nearly\nas numerous as serogroup B strains. C:2a:P1.5 was the most frequently\nencountered phenotype and C:2b:P1.2 strains were also distributed widely. A\nnumber of clusters of cases of serogroup C disease were noted, mainly with\nphenotype C:2a:P1.5. About three-quarters of all isolates showed decreased\nsusceptibility to the penicillin group of antibiotics (MIC 0.06 to 0.5\nmg/L).

Echo 4 has not been\nisolated in Israel since 1980. Specimens were sent from all parts of Israel\nand from Gaza and Hebron. 145 isolates (61% of all isolates) were\nidentified as Echo 4 by neutralization with specific antibodies and/or by\nimmunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies. However, WHO standard\nantibody pools failed to identify the isolates. 13.4% of the isolates were\nother enteroviruses and the remaining 25.6% are still untyped. 11% of the\nEcho 4 isolates were from infants (<1yr); 15% from 1-4 yr old; 54% from\nschool age children (5-17 yrs); and 20% from adults. 64.2% were from males\nand 35.8% were from females. Molecular analysis was performed by sequencing\nof a 435 bp fragment from the 5' non-coding region which was amplified by\nRT-PCR using common primers. The sequences of 25 of 28 isolates from all\ngeographical regions and throughout the time course of the outbreak were\nrelated (>95% homology). The remaining 3 isolates were <95% homologous to\nthese and to each other. Interestingly, the sequence of the 5' non coding\nregion of the Echo 4 isolates was more closely related to a previously\npublished Echo 6 sequence rather than Echo 4 sequence. Our data suggest\nthat the virus was apparently a new variant of Echo 4, a fact which\nfacilitated its massive circulation in the community.\n--\nDr. Lester M.

Since 1990, the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control (LCDC) in\nOttawa has confirmed five cases of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A in Canada,\nwith no laboratory-confirmed cases in the past 3 years. In Ontario, _N.\nmeningitidis_ serogroup A has not been confirmed since 1990. In early\n1997, we identified _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A isolated from a case of\nmeningitis in the greater Toronto area. A 30-year-old male returning to\nCanada in January 1997 from the northern state of Punjab, India, became ill\nwith symptoms of a high fever and headache during the flight back to\nToronto. The patient was admitted to hospital where cultures of both blood\nand cerebrospinal fluid were positive for _N. meningitidis_...\nDiscussion: Meningococcal disease is a serious public-health concern\nworldwide. In Europe and North America, the annual incidence of\nmeningococcal disease is one to three per 100,000 population and epidemics\nhave virtually disappeared, except for limited outbreaks and clusters of\ncases. In developing countries and specific areas such as the 'meningitis\nbelt' of sub-Saharan African, epidemics of meningococcal disease occur\napproximately every 8 to 10 years and can affect 1% of the population. The\nannual incidence of disease is about 10 to 50 cases per 100,000 in these\nhyper-epidemic areas, and can rise to more than 500 cases per 100,000\nduring epidemics. In the early 1980s, serogroup A:4:P1.9/clone III-1\ncaused epidemics in China and Nepal before spreading to the north of India\nin 1985. In the summer of 1987, the same strain of _N. meningitidis_ was\ncarried by Muslim pilgrims from southern Asia to Mecca and Medina, Saudi\nArabia, resulting in 7,000 cases. The relatively small number of cases\nassociated with this epidemic that were detected in Europe and North\nAmerica were linked to pilgrims returning home. Continued spread of this\nstrain to Africa following the return of Muslim pilgrims to\n'meningitis-belt' countries has continued into 1996. In Ontario, the\nmajority of cases of meningococcal disease are due to _N. meningitidis_\nserogroups B, C, Y, and occasionally W135. We have described an isolated\ncase in Ontario of meningococcal disease associated with the same strain of\n_N. meningitidis_ A:4P1.9/clone III-1 that has been linked to the major\noutbreaks in Africa, China, Nepal, the Middle East, and North India.\nAlthough only sporadic cases of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A may occur in\nCanada, laboratory staff dealing with such specimens should be aware of the\npossible occurrence of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A, particularly in\npatients with a recent travel history to pandemic or epidemic regions.\n--\nJames Chin, MD, MPH\nCDCP-mail\ne-mail: jchin@cdpc.com\n....................................................................jw/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The background incidence of meningococcal disease\nwas about 50 cases a year in 1989-90 (1.5 per 100,000). Rates have increased\nsteadily since then with 473 cases in 1996, a rate of 14.0 per 100,000.\nDisease incidence increased by a further 27% during the first 6 months of\n1997. Most cases (73% in 1996) occur in the winter and spring months.\nAs expected, highest rates are in the young (142.0 per 100,000 in those\nunder one year of age, 72.9 for those 1-4 years). There are also marked\nethnic differences in incidence with Maori having rates that were 1.5 times\nhigher than Europeans in 1996, and Pacific Islands people having rates that\nwere 5.3 times higher. This disease is particularly concentrated in young\nPacific Island children (570.7 cases per 100,000 for Pacific Island children\nunder one year of age). The case fatality rate has been about 5.0% for a\nnumber of years.\nSerogroup B accounted for 77.6% (215/277) of isolates obtained in 1996, with\nserogroup C accounting for most of the rest (18.8% or 52/277). One\nserosubtype (P1.4) has become dominant among the serogroup B cases,\naccounting for 87.4% (188/215) in 1996. A serogroup B vaccine which\neffectively targets this antigen (P1.4) could have a major role in\ncontrolling this epidemic.\nMonthly updates on meningococcal disease incidence are published in the New\nZealand Public Health Report, which can be accessed on the New Zealand\nMinistry of Health's Web site <http://www.moh.govt.nz/pubs_on.htm>\n---\nMichael Baker, Public Health Physician\nESR, Box 50348, Porirua, New Zealand\nTEL: (64 4) 2370 149\nFAX: (64 4) 237 2370\ne-mail: <michael.baker@esr.cri.nz>\nSue Walker, Scientist\nESR, Box 50348, Porirua, New Zealand\nTEL: (64 4) 2370 149\nFAX: (64 4) 237 2370\ne-mail: <sue.walker@esr.cri.nz>\n[Thanks to both of you for this marvelous summary. -- Mod CHC]\n............................................................................\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

A programme\nof mass chemoprophylaxis and vaccination was implemented on 29 November and\nthe outbreak was declared over on 9 December. The final report of the\noutbreak control team was referred to the PHLS Meningococcus Working Group,\nwhich was asked to consider whether guidance on the management of university\nand college outbreaks published in January 1997 needed to be revised or\nexpanded following the investigation of the outbreak in Cardiff. The Working\nGroup has advised that there is no need to modify this recent guidance. In\nparticular no change is recommended to guidance on the management of cases\nseparated by four or more weeks. The current guidance states: 'if cases are\nseparated by more than four weeks or the denominator population is large =96\nfor example in university clusters without links between cases =96 seek=\nadvice\non further action.'\n\nApril 7, 1997 -CDR Review -UK - Vol 7 No. 4 (April 4, 1997)=20\nChanging patterns of case ascertainment and trends in meningococcal disease\nin England and Wales; Ramsay M, et al:\nSummary: We have reviewed data on meningococcal disease routinely collected\nin England and Wales from 1989 to 1995 to illustrate and explain changing\npatterns and guide future surveillance. Statutory notifications of\nmeningococcal meningitis and epticaemia, laboratory confirmed infections,\nand death registrations coded as eningococcal disease were analysed in terms\nof their numbers, the age of cases, season of the report, and (if available)\nsite of isolation, serogroup, and serotype. Case fatality rates were\nestimated for clinically diagnosed and culture confirmed cases.\nThe number of cases notified each year, in particular those notified as\nsepticaemia, rose significantly over the period (p<0.0001) but there was no\nnet change in the number of culture confirmed cases. Case fatality rates\nestimated from routine data fell, most markedly for cases notified as\nsepticaemia, but the true case fatality rate of culture confirmed cases did\nnot change between 1993 and 1995. These data suggest that reporting practice\nchanged between 1989 and 1995 and that the ascertainment of clinically\ndiagnosed disease improved, particularly for meningococcal septicaemia. Late\nin 1995, reports from all data sources increased and the age distribution of\nboth notified and laboratory confirmed cases changed. These changes were\naccompanied by an increase in the proportion of infections due to Neisseria\nmeningitidis of serogroup c and a significant increase in serotype c2a\ninfections (p<0.0001).=20\nContinuing efforts to reconcile data from several sources will be needed to\nensure that routine data can be interpreted accurately to provide evidence\nfor the development of future vaccination policy and to monitor vaccination\nprogrammes. In addition, the role of non-culture diagnosis will be crucial\nin enhancing sveillance based on clinical diagnoses.\n...........................................mhj\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The vaccines in question are\nBiocine-Kiron's Vaxem-Hib which had been previously recalled voluntarily by\nthe firm, and Hib-titer produced by Cyanamid-Praxis Lederle. The ban does\nnot affect ACT-Hib produced by Merieux-Pasteur which is produced without\nusing BHI. The ban also affects Mempovax Kiron's meningococcal vaccine. The\narticle points out that the publicity surrounding the ban has created a\nreluctance to vaccinate agaianst other diseases.\nThe basis for the ban is a fear that BSE might be transmitted via BHI. After\na detailed discussion of BSE and prions, the article points out that since\n1991 care was taken that the materials used for the production of vaccines\ncame from animals from the U.S. and Australia and thus considered to be free\nof the BSE-causing agent. It further points out that in January 1997 the\nEuropean Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products had concluded that\nthe procedures used in the production of the vaccines were such that there\nwas no risk of transmitting BSE.\nThe article reports that Italy is the only country where the vaccines have\nbeen banned, and points to the fact that USFDA has not banned them. The ban\nwas reported in English by K. McKenzie in BMJ 314:397 1997.\n--\nAbramo Ottolenghi\nProfessor Emeritus\nDept.

The first\ncases were reported in late December 1996 and the epidemic threshold was\nreached on 5 January 1997 in Tone District. Mass immunization activities\nhave covered 159 000 persons (100% of the population) in the Tandjouare\nand Oti areas neighbouring Tone District. In other areas, efforts are\nbeing made to convince the population still reluctant towards\nvaccination.\nBurkina Faso: The epidemic threshold has been reached in 5 districts\nsince the second week of 1997. The weekly reported number of cases\ncontinued to increase; the epidemic has extended to more than 10\ndistricts and continues to spread. Intensive vaccination campaigns are\nunder way, as well as social mobilization to convince more people to be\nvaccinated in the affected areas.\nGhana: Cases have been reported from northern Ghana since the beginning\nof November 1996. The threshold was reached during the last week of\nJanuary. Since then, the epidemic has continued to spread. The weekly\nattack rates are over 15 per 100 000 population in 6 districts in the\nUpper East and Northern Regions. The population at greatest risk is\nestimated at more than 1.7 million. The national crisis committee\nmonitors the epidemic situation and determines the needs. Intensive\nvaccination campaigns are in progress. Other countries [in the region]\nhave reported sporadic cases. National health authorities have been re-\nquested to reinforce disease surveillance and initiate vaccination\nactivities as soon as the epidemic threshold is reached.\n(Based on: A report from the WHO Regional Office for Africa.)\nWER Editorial Note: An international Appeal has been launched by WHO\njointly with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\nSocieties, Medecins sans Frontieres and UNICEF to raise funds for the\ncontrol of meningitis in Africa in the 1997 epidemic season. The funds\nare being used to purchase vaccine, treatment drugs and autodestruct\ninjection material.

Requests for vaccine are evaluated according to\ncriteria set by an International Coordinating Group, to ensure that\noptimal use is made of the vaccine currently available.\n The first\ncases were reported in late December 1996 and the epidemic threshold was\nreached on 5 January 1997 in Tone District. Three countries (Togo, Ghana and Burkina Faso) have reached the epidemic\nthreshold since the beginning of the 1997 meningitis season in early\n National health authorities have been re-\nquested to reinforce disease surveillance and initiate vaccination\nactivities as soon as the epidemic threshold is reached. The weekly reported number of cases\ncontinued to increase; the epidemic has extended to more than 10\ndistricts and continues to spread. Mass immunization activities\nhave covered 159 000 persons (100% of the population) in the Tandjouare\nand Oti areas neighbouring Tone District. The weekly\nattack rates are over 15 per 100 000 population in 6 districts in the\nUpper East and Northern Regions. Intensive vaccination campaigns are\nunder way, as well as social mobilization to convince more people to be\nvaccinated in the affected areas. In other areas, efforts are\nbeing made to convince the population still reluctant towards\nvaccination. The funds\nare being used to purchase vaccine, treatment drugs and autodestruct\ninjection material.

The connection between\nthe outbreak and the social habits of the people studied was unexpected.\nMore research is needed to confirm the implication that the consumption of\nalcohol and smoking may have the effect of causing bacteria in the nose to\ncolonize, perhaps invading the body more deeply, and kill within 24 hours.\nHowever, the leader of the study (Peter Imrey) has been quoted saying that\npublic health officials dealing with future outbreaks of meningococcal\ndisease in otherwise healthy persons, young adults in particular, may want\nto consider patterns of alcohol consumption and bar patronage.\n--\nDorothy B.

This does not apply to general medical personnel\n(i.e. emergency room personnel) without intimate respiratory contact.\nIn developing countries with ongoing epidemics, as is currently occurring\nin West and Central Africa, chemoprophylaxis a limited role and generally\nis not a useful public health intervention. The reason is that carriage\nof epidemic strains is common under these circumstances and reinfection\nor infection after chemoprophylaxis frequently occurs. Widespread\nprophylaxis will only hope to increase drug-resistance rates for a\nvariety of infections and also increase drug-related toxicity.\nFor group A and C epidemics in developing countries, rapid mass\nvaccination is required to reduce attack rates.\nThe vaccine has a limited duration of protection but short-term, high\nefficacy rates in children and adults (even down to 1 year\nof age) can be expected from the polysaccharide vaccine. Threshold\nrates are being evaluated to discriminate\nepidemic from endemic disease to guide vaccination programs (a rate\ngreater than 15 cases/100,000/week averaged over a two week period is\nthe standard). However, in the case where a clear epidemic is ongoing in\na region (as is the case for Chad, Nigeria and Burkina Faso), then\nvaccination should be instituted immediately in any near-by\npopulation in which new cases are starting to appear regardless of the\nincidence rate.\nIs the current West African pandemic known to be due to the group III-1\nclonal complex or is it a new clone(s)?\n--\nPatrick S.

I am an advisory member of a committee of expatriate Nigerians and\nfriends of Nigeria, who have recently organized a fund drive to help\nfight the current meningitis epidemic in the northern part of the\ncountry. While CSM is acknowledged to be a perennial dry-season problem in\nthis region, many see in the scale of this year's affliction a\nreflection of the military government's absolute dysfunction. The Nigeria Meningitis Appeal Fund began just over two weeks ago on\none of the main Nigeria newsgroups on the Internet, under the\ncommitted inspiration of O. Kasirim Nguwe of Boston University. We would\nlike to contact such organizations to determine immediate medical needs\nof the vaccination campaign.
