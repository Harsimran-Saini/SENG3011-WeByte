About 127 people have been affected and 38 hospitalized by the _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ outbreak since it 1st appeared in September 2014.\n\nFoodstuffs, the company which owns New World, Pak'n Save and Four Square, said it had viewed the report which named 2 of its products, Pam's fresh express mesclun salad lettuce and Pam's fresh express lettuce, as possible sources. The company is investigating this and did not believe any of the potentially affected products were still on its shelves.\n\nMeanwhile, a Canterbury health official has accused the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) of risking public health over the outbreak. Canterbury medical officer of health Dr Alistair Humphrey said a draft report from Environmental Science and Research (ESR) last week identified lettuce and carrots from a particular supermarket chain as the source.\n\n'Everybody involved in this work, including MPI, ESR, all the public health units and the Ministry of Health, have seen the results of the ESR study, which is quite clear. It is unequivocal, and it does name the types of food that have led to this problem, and it also names one particular product,' Humphrey told Radio New Zealand.\n\nHe claimed MPI asked public health officials to keep the name of the supermarket and the products involved a secret, but he decided to name the vegetables to protect the public.\n\n'[MPI] felt they should work with the industry rather than naming the foods but, of course, that leaves the New Zealand public slightly at risk, in my view. The problem is we have a regulator of the production of our domestic food who is also responsible for the promotion of the industry itself,' he said.\n\nLabour's food safety spokesman, Damien O'Connor, said MPI seemed 'more concerned' about protecting the reputation of supermarkets than the health of Kiwi consumers. 'MPI either lacks the resources or is incapable of dealing with what should be a relatively minor food safety issue. This will be a concern to our export sectors.'\n\nO'Connor said MPI had a conflict of interest between promoting New Zealand products and protecting consumers. 'It is time the ministry put Kiwi consumers 1st and publicly released the cause of this nasty bug,' he said.\n\nHowever, MPI deputy director general Scott Gallacher said the initial findings into the outbreak were withheld to avoid causing a public scare with limited information. He admitted lettuce and carrots had been associated with the outbreak in the draft report last week, but the information was 'not a slam dunk.'\n\nGallacher said MPI did not want to force consumers into making ill-informed decisions or steer them towards other products that may have been responsible. 'It is not a simple situation where we can recall a single product. It is not definitively linked to any one supermarket chain,' he said.\n\nHe said of 96 affected people who were surveyed, 8 could recall the specific brand. He also said that while 87 people affected by the illness purchased lettuce, only 17 identified a brand asked about in the survey.\n\nGallacher said MPI would reveal the cause of the outbreak once it was known for certain.\n\n[Byline: Nicole Mathewson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Mon 13 Oct 2014\nSource: 3 News [edited]\nhttp://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/mpi-insufficient-proof-on-stomach-bug-source-2014101318\n\n\nThe Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) says it still hasn't gotten enough information to name the food products and outlets thought to be responsible for an outbreak of a nasty tummy bug. Last week, the Christchurch medical officer of health blamed bagged vegetables, but MPI insists it still hasn't gotten enough proof.\n\nBagged lettuces and carrots were initially blamed as the cause of the outbreak of _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_. But a week on since that report was released, the agency leading the investigation says it still doesn't know. 'We are unsure whether they are the definitive cause from our perspective,' says deputy director general regulation and assurance Scott Gallacher. 'The health and wellbeing of consumers is in the uppermost of our minds, and it's the top priority we have.'\n\nMr Gallacher says the reason they haven't established an exact cause is because of the 96 people with the bug that they surveyed, 87 said they'd recently eaten lettuce, but only 17 could identify which brand.\n\nLabour's spokesman for food safety says MPI has been dragging its feet on the investigation and potentially put consumers at risk by not identifying a definitive cause sooner. 'If they're putting the interests of the supermarkets 1st, then they've got their priorities wrong,' says Damien O'Connor. 'They need to look after consumers and the health and wellbeing of them, above all else.'\n\nThe Canterbury medical officer of health has also criticised the MPI, saying tests indicated bagged carrots and lettuces were to blame, and the public should have been told sooner. But MPI says it won't name names or supermarket chains until it's sure.\n\n'We are absolutely focused on getting to the bottom of what has caused this outbreak and making sure we can provide the clarity to all consumers and all interested parties as soon as we have clear and definitive links,' says Mr Gallacher. But the ministry will give no indication when that could be.\n\n[Byline: Annabelle Tukia]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It remains unclear whether the 1st suggested vehicle of bagged carrots and lettuce is indeed the vehicle.

Lettuce has a short shelf life, and the relevant lettuce products are probably no longer on the market, says senior researcher Umaer Naseer at the National Institute of Public Health.\n\nThe outbreak of _Yersinia enterocolitica_ O3 started in mid-November 2020. In total, as of 21 Dec 2020, there are 10 confirmed cases. Everyone became ill in the period from mid to late November 2020. The last person became ill on 26 Nov 2020. The persons live in Oslo (2), Viken (3), Innlandet (2), Vestland (2) and Telemark and Vestfold (1). They are all women aged 11-59 years.\n\nThe National Institute of Public Health's analysis of patient interviews shows that everyone stated that they had eaten a pre-cut salad product the week before illness.\n\nIn collaboration with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, we conducted interviews to map what the people had eaten before they became ill and have found that ready-cut lettuce stands out, says Umaer Naseer.\n\nSalad products have also on previous occasions caused outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease in this country. In the spring of 2018 and 2020, outbreaks with _Yersinia enterocolitica_ were investigated, where ready-washed lettuce was the probable source of the outbreak.\n\n_Yersinia enterocolitica_ O3 usually causes symptoms such as diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, nausea and possibly fever, which go away on their own. In rare cases, diarrhea can be long-lasting and severe.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nIrene Lai\n<irene.lai@internationalsos.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Irene Lai for supplying this post regarding the source of this outbreak of _Yersinia enterocolitica_. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nNorway: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/107]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nIrene Lai\n<irene.lai@internationalsos.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Irene Lai for supplying this post regarding the source of this outbreak of _Yersinia enterocolitica_. \n\n\nThe source of infection of the national outbreak with _Yersinia enterocolitica_ is probably a pre-cut lettuce product, according to the investigation of the outbreak.

To date [Sat 7 Jul 2018], 18 people from several counties have been diagnosed with the infection. The patients are between 13 and 60 years old and 60 percent of them are women. They are residents from Troms, Oslo, Akershus, Tr\u00f8ndelag, Vestfold, Rogaland, Nordland, Hordaland and M\u00f8re og Romsdal, and are tested in May and early June [2018]. Bacteria with similar DNA profiles have been detected in all 18 individuals.\n\nHealth and Food Safety officials are trying to determine if there is a common source of infection. Interviews are conducted with the patients, and samples from the homes are taken to find the source of infection, if possible. 'Investigations can be complicated and take time, and in many cases you will not be able to find the source of infection or to clarify if there is a common source', says Solveig Jore Senior Adviser.\n\nThe most common symptoms of yersiniosis are diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain, usually of 1-3 weeks duration. The reservoir for the bacterium is primarily pig. Dogs and cats can also be carriers of the bacterium. _Yersinia_ bacteria mainly contaminate food, usually via infected pork products, contaminated vegetables or salads, and the use of non-disinfected drinking water.\n\nEvery year, between 40 and 80 cases are reported to the Public Health Institute of Yersiniosis.

From January until the beginning of February 2021, twice as many people fell ill with _Yersinia_ infection as did during the same period in a normal year.\n\nFrom 53 cases of _Y. enterocolitica_, 33 lived in Stockholm, Vastra Gotaland, and Halland. Isolates from 24 of these cases were typed by whole genome sequencing and 16 outbreak patients with clustered isolates of sequence type 18 could be identified. Of these 16, 11 were women and 5 were men aged 7 to 34 years old. All fell ill between [4 and 18 Jan 2021].\n\nRikard Dryselius, a microbiologist at Folkhalsomyndigheten (Public Health Agency of Sweden), said collection and typing of _Yersinia_ isolates is not done routinely in the country. 'Instead, individual counties can ask for help with typing _Yersinia_ when they see a need. Alternatively, we may ask the laboratories to send in isolates if we see an increase in cases nationally that should be investigated,' he said.\n\n'Due to the strained situation for infection control units and clinical laboratories during the pandemic, we chose to request interviews/questionnaire responses and collection of isolates only from the counties where the increase was highest. It is therefore very likely that there were more than 16 outbreak cases but the lack of additional isolates to sequence means that we cannot confirm this.'\n\nFolkhalsomyndigheten, infection control units in the Stockholm, Vastra Gotaland, and Halland regions, and Livsmedelsverket (Swedish Food Agency) investigated the incident. Health officials interviewed sick people and compiled questionnaire responses about what and where they ate before illness onset. A case-case study where questionnaire responses from outbreak cases were compared with answers from people with _Yersinia_ infection that did not belong to the outbreak was done.\n\nThe investigators found the outbreak cases had, to a greater extent, visited a certain restaurant chain. Follow-up interviews about what they had eaten led to iceberg lettuce being suspected as the source of infection. According to the trawling questionnaire sent to outbreak cases, 7 out of 12 mentioned they had visited the restaurant chain before falling ill, while 7 out of 72 cases with yersiniosis who responded to the same questionnaire in 2019 mentioned that they had done so.\n\nThe suspicion of a contaminated batch of iceberg lettuce distributed to a restaurant chain was strengthened by the outbreak timeline, which suggested that a product with a wide geographical spread and a limited shelf life was the underlying cause.

The Public Health Agency (Folkhalsomyndigheten) reported there had been an increase in the number of cases of yersiniosis in the country since the start of March 2019. Since the outbreak strain of _Y. enterocolitica_ type O3 had been found in different parts of the country, it is likely a foodborne infection, added the agency.\n\nA total of 26 cases have been confirmed, and another 30 infections are being investigated. Onset dates for confirmed cases range between 10 Feb 2019 to 3 Apr 2019. There have been no deaths reported, and information on hospitalization is not collected at the national level. Confirmed cases have a median age of 28 years (range 6-62 years old); 60% are women, and they live in different areas from the county of Halland in the south to Vasterbotten in the north.\n\nInfection with _Yersinia_ is relatively rare in Sweden with between 200 and 300 cases reported annually. In 2004 more than 800 were recorded. A spokeswoman for Folkhalsomyndigheten told Food Safety News that cases have been confirmed as belonging to the outbreak, thanks to the use of whole genomic sequencing (WGS).\n\n'When the number of cases increased, a request was sent out to the local clinical microbiological laboratories to send in _Y. enterocolitica_ isolates to the Public Health Agency of Sweden for typing using WGS. WGS could clearly either confirm or exclude cases,' she said. 'Patients have been interviewed, and most cases have also completed a trawling questionnaire. A case control study is ongoing, and we are also collecting receipts from grocery stores with the hope of finding a common denominator.'\n\n'It is too early to say (if the outbreak is over or not) since we still await WGS results from possible cases with more recent onset of disease. The incubation period is 3-7 days, generally under 10 days.'\n\nOne link being investigated is from sampling during an official food control in Latvia in mid-March 2019, which found _Yersinia_ in snack carrots also sold in Sweden. The batch has already been sold out and is presumed to be no longer available to buy. The raw carrots came from Sweden and were packed in Denmark.\n\nThe Folkhalsomyndigheten spokeswoman said the only link to the snack carrots is the timing, and it has no information as yet that several cases ate this type of carrot. The agency is continuing to investigate the source of infection with affected municipalities and the National Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket).\n\nRaw or undercooked meat consumption is often the cause of infection. Direct transmission from other animals such as pets or through contaminated food or drink is also possible. After an incubation period of 3-7 days, symptoms include fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in the right lower part of the abdomen.\n\n[Byline: Joe Whitworth]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with food-borne disease are _pseudotuberculosis_ and _enterocolitica_.

Foodstuffs, which owns Pak 'n Save and New World supermarkets, announced today [16 Oct 2014] that the source of the recent _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ outbreak appeared to be farm-based. The bacterium is uncommon in New Zealand with only 13 cases notified last year [2013], but about 127 people have been affected and 38 hospitalized during last month's [September 2014] outbreak.\n\n'In exploring our own supply chain, should the contamination have come from Pam's Lettuce, we can confirm we have been able to narrow our investigation down to a single paddock from the supplier Living Foods,' the company said in a statement. 'This paddock has been quarantined at our request and further independent testing has been commissioned alongside the MPI [Ministry of Primary Industries] investigation.'\n\nFoodstuffs said all Pams Fresh Express products on shelves now, or those already bought that were not past their best before dates, were safe for consumption. 'We do understand the frustration those who have suffered from yersiniosis feel and their desire to get answers quickly as to how they became unwell. To ensure the safety of the food sold to our customers, we remain determined to get to the bottom of the cause of the outbreak, regardless of whether our products were involved or not.'\n\nFoodstuffs expected to have the results from its initial supplier audit review early next week, while sample analysis results from an independent laboratory were expected by the end of the month [October 2014]. 'We hope our results along with the findings of the MPI investigation will give all parties clarity as to how such an incidence could occur.'\n\nA Foodstuffs investigation had excluded Pams bagged carrots as a likely source of contamination because no one supplier of Pams was responsible for distribution across the country where sickness had been reported. MPI deputy director-general Scott Gallacher said the ministry was drawing on the 'best available' expertise and information from around the world as it continued to investigate the origins of the outbreak.\n\nHealth data showed the contamination event happened in August 2014 and was identified as an outbreak of illness on 23 Sep 2014. There had been no further confirmed cases since the 1st week of October [2014].\n\nCanterbury medical officer of health Alistair Humphrey had criticised MPI's refusal to release the full list of products under investigation, saying the ministry seemed more concerned about the industry than protecting public health.\n\nGallacher said MPI released 2 reports from ESR [Institute of Environmental and Scientific Research] today [16 Oct 2014] to 'stop the speculation' about what foods were being investigated. 'It is not a simple situation where we can recall a single product. It is not definitely linked to any one provider, distributor, wholesaler or retailer.'\n\nHorticulture New Zealand chief executive Peter Silcock said releasing the reports was 'the right thing to do at this time', but statements from Humphrey earlier this week had been 'very unhelpful' as they had affected the industry's reputation. 'It's targeted parts of the industry quite unfairly. We're keen to obviously get to the bottom of this as well.'\n\nInitial information presented by ESR and public health units associated the illness with a range of fresh produce, including lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, apples, cold ready-to-eat meats and dairy products.\n\nESR's initial report, dated 6 Oct 2014, found those who became ill were more likely to have eaten raw lettuce or carrots, including those bagged and marketed under the Pams brand, than those who were not ill. A 2nd report, dated 8 Oct 2014, said those who purchased lettuce from Foodstuffs supermarkets were 2.33 times as likely to become ill than those who bought from Progressive Enterprises supermarkets (including Countdown and Supervalue), while those who bought lettuce from independent supermarkets were 4.08 times as likely to become ill than those buying from Progressive Enterprises.\n\n'This information is not definitive and should lead to investigation of possible supply or processing in Foodstuffs New Zealand and independent supermarkets,' the report said. Investigations into the outbreak were continuing.\n\n[Byline: Nicole Mathewson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most individuals affected with _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ are children or young adults. The most common presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis, with fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be confused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also occur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late complications may be a reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.\n\nAlthough many associations had been previously made, one of the strongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and food was published in 2004 from Finland (1). The editorial commentary (2) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of infections associated with fresh produce.\n\nThe diagnosis of infection with this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from lymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but cross-reactions are found between yersiniae and other enteric organisms, including some salmonellae.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Swedish officials said they were not able to analyse food samples since no case had spinach left at home and their case-control study did not identify a specific food item. Infection with yersinia is relatively rare in Sweden, with between 200 to 300 cases reported annually. Previous outbreaks have been caused by raw or undercooked meat consumption and contaminated ready-to-eat vegetables. After an incubation period of 3 to 7 days, symptoms includes fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in the right lower part of the abdomen.\n\n[byline: Joe Whitworth]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is not specifically stated whether the strains in Denmark and Sweden are genetically related.\n\nThe 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with foodborne disease are _pseudotuberculosis_ and _enterocolitica_.

There is a total of 101 confirmed cases and 41 presumptive (suspected but yet to be confirmed) nationwide. A total of 38 people have been hospitalized.

Nationwide, more than 100 people have been reported as suffering from symptoms mimicking appendicitis, including from the Bay of Plenty.\n\nToi Te Ora (Public Health Service) has recorded 5 people from the Bay of Plenty suffering from the stomach bug, caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_.\n\nThe bacterium can cause painful stomach pain with or without diarrhea and can be extremely unpleasant for the person involved.\n\nChief medical officer of health Phil Shoemack said Toi Te Ora recorded 4 cases in the Lakes district and 1 from the coastal Bay. 'This is an unusual cause of food poisoning. That's why it sticks out -- to have more than 100 cases around the country within 2 weeks is most unusual,' he said. 'It appears to be related to consumption around carrots and packaged lettuces but we haven't managed to track an actual suspect yet.'\n\nDr Shoemack said Toi Te Ora was working collaboratively with Wellington health officials in finding the exact cause behind the outbreak but there was still a lot of information unknown. 'We've spoken to each of the cases about what food they consumed in the days prior to getting ill and it appears the most likely risk factors are the carrots and lettuces which are pre-packaged.\n\n'It appears loose fruit and vegetables are not involved. It's very much a day by day investigation and hopefully we are getting closer to nailing what it is.'\n\nDr Shoemack said the issue was likely to be a batch problem, and if so it should dissipate soon.\n\nFor now, he reminded people to take extra care with personal hygiene when preparing and consuming food and washing any raw fruit and vegetables thoroughly.\n\nThe symptoms of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ include:\n- abdominal pain (often on the lower right), which may mimic appendicitis,\n- fever,\n- sometimes diarrhea.\n- About 1-3 weeks later, you may get a rash and joint pain. The joint pain can last up to 6 months.\n\nIn rare cases _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ infection can lead to sepsis (infection in the blood). This is more common in people with weakened immune systems.\n\n[Byline: Kiri Gillespie]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is extracted from Tauxe RV: Salad and pseudoappendicitis: _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ as a foodborne pathogen.

It causes enteric illness in domesticated sheep and has been problematic enough among farmed deer to lead to the development of a vaccine for those animals in New Zealand. In addition, the organism has been isolated from the feces of healthy swine and from a variety of other mammals and birds in Eurasia. Thus, it would not be unexpected to find this organism in the deer or hares that inhabit the areas near the fields where the implicated lettuce was grown.\n\nThis natural history may provide a glimpse into the evolutionary origins of another major pathogen, _Y. pestis_, which is exceedingly close to _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ genetically.

Preliminary investigations\nconducted at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute strengthened this\nsuspicion. The manufacturer has therefore withdrawn a further 9\nlettuce mixes from the market. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority\nrecommends that consumers should not eat these lettuce mixes. The\nNorwegian Institute of Public Health is continuing the investigation\nin co-operation with the Food Safety Authority and Veterinary\nInstitute.\n\nEach year, 50-100 cases of yersiniosis are reported to the Norwegian\nInstitute of Public Health. Most cases occur sporadically and several\ncases with a common source rarely occur in Norway.\n\nYersiniosis is transmitted primarily through food but can transmit\nbetween people in rare cases. The most common symptoms are diarrhea,\nfever and abdominal pain, usually lasting for 1-3 weeks. In most\ncases, the disease clears up without treatment.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with food-borne disease are\n_pseudotuberculosis_ and _enterocolitica_.

Food Control 2013; 31(1): 251-62). The paper is available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.09.035.\n\nThe abstract, introduction, and conclusions are given below with the citations removed.\n\n'Abstract\n---------\nIn the context of the prevailing trend toward more natural products, there seems to be an increasing preference for raw milk consumption as raw milk is associated with several perceived health benefits that are believed to be destroyed upon heating. However, many human pathogens can be isolated from raw cow milk. The prevalence of foodborne pathogens in raw cow milk varies, but their presence has been demonstrated in many surveys and foodborne infections have been repeatedly reported for _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_ spp. and human pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ [VTEC]. In industrialized countries, milk-borne and milk product-borne outbreaks represent 2-6 percent of the bacterial foodborne outbreaks.\n\nThe aim of this review is to present scientifically sound data regarding the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw and heated cow milk. Both microbiological aspects (such as, the prevalence of milk-borne pathogens, pathogen growth inhibition by antimicrobial systems and by lactic acid producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria, etc.) and nutritional or health aspects (nutritional value, immunity, allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, milk digestibility, etc.) are considered.\n\nAs such, it is demonstrated that consumption of raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. With the exception of an altered organoleptic profile [taste], heating (in particular ultra high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nThe consumption of raw milk is not well-documented, but in the context of the current trend toward 'consuming natural' and 'purchasing locally', raw milk consumption is becoming more popular. This is nourished by the perception that heating destroys the nutritional and health benefits of milk, and can even induce some detrimental effects. However, due to its high nutritional value together with the neutral pH and high water activity [content?], raw milk serves as an excellent growth medium for different micro-organisms, whose multiplication depends mainly on temperature and on competing micro-organisms and their metabolic products. In order to guarantee its microbial safety and to prolong its shelf-life, milk is heat treated.\n\nThe impact of milk pasteurization on public health can be clearly illustrated by means of historical data. Before 1938, an estimated 25 percent of all foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks in the USA were associated with milk, whereas nowadays, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk is estimated to be below 1 percent. Between 1880 and 1907, 29 milk-borne outbreaks were reported on average each year in the USA. With the adoption of pasteurization in 1938, milk-borne diseases dropped to only 46 outbreaks during the 19-year period from 1973 to 1992, corresponding to an average of 2.4 outbreaks each year. A recent report of the USA CDC indicates that the vast majority of milk-borne outbreaks in the USA are in states that permit the sale of raw milk. In England and Wales, the great majority of milk-borne outbreaks during the 1980s were attributed to the consumption of raw milk. In Scotland, a similar situation existed until the sale of unpasteurized milk was prohibited in 1983, which led to a significant drop of the incidence of diseases related to liquid milk consumption.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the main illnesses associated with raw milk consumption were brucellosis and tuberculosis. These have been eradicated as milk-borne diseases in developed countries, mainly through herd certification programs which included culling of infected animals, the installation of refrigerated bulk tanks for milk collection on farms, and the introduction of pasteurization. In the past, pasteurization conditions were standardized based on the destruction of _Mycobacterium bovis_, a relatively heat-resistant non-sporogenic bacterium that formerly was among the most serious pathogenic bacteria present in milk. Pasteurization standards today are based upon the destruction of _Coxiella burnetii_ the most heat-resistant milk-borne zoonotic pathogen known. In the past 30 years, several previously unrecognized foodborne bacterial infections, including infection with _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Escherichia coli_ strain O157 (or more general verocytotoxin-producing pathogenic _E. coli_ [VTEC]), have emerged as significant causes of human morbidity and mortality. Pathogens mainly present in raw milk today are, among others, _C. jejuni_, _Salmonella_ spp., _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, pathogenic _E. coli_ and _Yersinia enterocolitica_.\n\nIn Europe, the current regulatory microbial criteria for raw cow milk are less than or equal to 100 000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for plate count (at 30 deg C/86 deg F) and less than or equal to 400 000 cfu/ml for somatic cells, as is stipulated in Regulation (EC) 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs. In this Regulation, health requirements for production animals and hygienic requirements on milk production holdings (such as, regarding premises and equipment, hygiene during milking, collection, and transport, staff hygiene) are established as well. In general, raw milk intended for human consumption must meet the requirements of the General Food Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002) and be free of pathogens. Even though improvements in hygiene resulted in routine production of raw cow milk with less than 20 000 cfu (total flora)/ml), this does not guarantee raw milk to be free of pathogens. In approximately 1-6 percent of the human outbreaks reported in developed countries, milk has been identified as the vehicle of infection. An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 percent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 percent attributed to milk, 53.1 percent to cheese, and 7.8 percent to other milk products.\n\nWhereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw cow milk at one hand, and to evaluate the effect of heat treatments of milk on these risks and benefits on the other hand, considering the microbiological as well as the nutritional (health) aspects.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nIn this evaluation it is clearly demonstrated that the consumption of raw milk poses a realistic and unnecessary health threat because of its possible contamination with pathogenic bacteria. It is therefore recommended to heat [raw] milk before consumption, especially when served to young children, pregnant women, or any person suffering from a chronic disease or a suppressed immune system. In this context the attention is drawn to raw milk provided on farms to the general public (such as during a school visit) and raw milk distributors allowing the automatic supply of raw milk from a bulk reservoir to the consumer. From a nutritional point of view, infants should only be given 'infant formula' since unprocessed milk does not fulfill the nutritional needs of this age group.\n\nHistorical data show that the pasteurization of milk has led to improved public health and more recent data on occasional raw milk consumption indicate the hazard of bacterial infections, which could be avoided by a heat treatment. At present, thermal treatment remains the most frequently used and most effective method to increase the microbiological safety of milk without substantially changing the nutritional value of milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption. Table 4 [see original URL above] summarizes the main (claimed) benefits of raw milk consumption and the (claimed) detrimental effects of heating discussed in the present paper. Almost all arguments put forward by raw milk proponents for not heating milk, can be refuted, and the only substantial disadvantage of heating is the change in the organoleptic profile [taste] of milk. It is clear that this 'detrimental' effect of heating does not countervail the risk posed by raw milk consumption, namely of a milk-borne pathogen infection, which can have serious health consequences.' - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38705.]", "summary": "An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 percent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 percent attributed to milk, 53.1 percent to cheese, and 7.8 percent to other milk products.

Dr Ramon Pink says\ncocktail sausages (also known as cheerios or saveloys) should be\nheated before they are eaten and should not be offered cold to\nchildren at butcher shops or delicatessens.\n\nAn investigation by the Canterbury District Health Board's Community\nand Public Health division has found 6 children under 5 years old\nwith yersiniosis had eaten cocktail sausages. Symptoms of the\ninfection usually last about 48 hours and include diarrhea, possibly\nstomach pains, but usually no vomiting.\n\nMost of the children lived in the south Christchurch area and the\nsuspected food was purchased in this area.

This warning does not extend to other types of\nfood purchased from or distributed by the farm, including cheese,\nwhich is made elsewhere.

The illnesses 1st began to be reported last\nweek.\n\nThe dairy about 25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh is certified to\npasteurize milk, but has temporarily stopped production.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 1st 3 paragraphs below are adapted from the FDA's Bad Bug Book\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm070040.htm:\n\nBecause of the degree of abdominal pain, yersiniosis has been\nmisdiagnosed as Crohn's disease as well as appendicitis. Diagnosis of\nyersiniosis begins with isolation of the organism from the feces or\nblood and sometimes at the time of appendectomy. Confirmation occurs\nwith the isolation, as well as biochemical and serological\nidentification, of _Y. enterocolitica_ from both the human host and\nthe ingested foodstuff. Diarrhea is reported to occur in about 80\npercent of cases; abdominal pain and fever are the most reliable\nsymptoms. Because of the difficulties in isolating yersiniae from\nfeces, several countries rely on serology.\n_Y. enterocolitica_ can be found in meats (pork, beef, lamb, etc.),\noysters, fish, and raw (not usually pasteurized) milk. The exact cause\nof the food contamination is unknown. However, the prevalence of this\norganism in the soil and water and in animals such as beavers, pigs,\nand squirrels, offers ample opportunities for it to enter our food\nsupply. Poor sanitation and improper sterilization techniques by food\nhandlers, including improper storage, cannot be overlooked as\ncontributing to contamination.\n\nThe major 'complication' is the performance of unnecessary\nappendectomies, since one of the main symptoms of infections is\nabdominal pain of the lower right quadrant. Yersiniosis may also be\nassociated with reactive arthritis, which may occur even in the\nabsence of obvious symptoms. The frequency of such post-enteritis\narthritic conditions is about 2-3 percent.\n\nProMED has periodically posted on human infections associated with the\ningestion of 'raw' unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization) is a process of\nheating a food, usually liquid, to a specific temperature for a\ndefinite length of time, and then cooling it immediately.\nPasteurization, unlike sterilization, is not intended to kill all\nmicro-organisms in the food. Instead pasteurization aims to reduce the\nnumber of viable pathogens so they are unlikely to cause disease\n(assuming the pasteurized product is stored as indicated and consumed\nbefore its expiration date). Although known in China and Japan, the\nmodern version was created by Louis Pasteur, after whom it is named,\nconceived as a way of preventing wine and beer from souring.\n\nIt is not the case, however, that pasteurized milk or milk products\nare never able to transmit infection. In response to a cluster of\nappendectomies in an area of New York State in the fall of 1976,\ninvestigators found that an epidemic of _Y. enterocolitica_ had\noccurred and that it was associated with the drinking of school-bought\nchocolate milk (1). The pasteurization technique in the dairy was\nfound to be satisfactory and the investigation suggested that the\norganism was introduced at the dairy during mixing by hand of\nchocolate syrup and pasteurized milk, a post-pasteurization\ncontamination. An huge outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis in the USA\noccurred in 1994 when ice cream pre-mix, already pasteurized, was\ntransported by tanker trailers that had just carried non-pasteurized\neggs (2) and an estimated 224 000 infections occurred.\n\nPost-pasteurization contamination of milk is thought to underly most\nof these outbreaks associated with pasteurized milk, although the\nmechanism of contamination may not be elucidated. Such outbreaks\ninclude more than 16 000 culture-confirmed cases of _Salmonella_\nTyphimurium in Illinois reported in 1987 (3), a multistate outbreak of\n_Y. enterocolitica in 1982 (4), as well an outbreaks of listeriosis in\nMassachusetts in 1983 (5). The listeriosis outbreak, however, was one\nin which the investigators raised questions about the ability of\npasteurization to eradicate a large inoculum of certain organisms from\nraw milk.\n\nThe persistence of small numbers of pathogenic organisms may not be\nrelevant since the milk is kept at refrigerator temperatures for most\norganisms, but for _L. monocytogenes_ and _Y. enterocolitica_ this may\nnot be the case. Certain organisms like these can be referred to as\npsychrotrophs, defined as bacteria that may grow at 7 degrees C [44.6\ndegrees F] or below, irrespective of their optimal temperature for\ngrowth (6). These organisms, if remaining at some number after\npasteurization or inoculated after pasteurization, can then replicate\nin the refrigerated milk.\n\nAlthough the risk from pasteurized milk is quite small, there is some.\nSome, if not most, of this risk is from post-pasteurization\ncontamination but not all. Be that as it may, unpasteurized milk has a\nmuch higher risk.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Most\nindividuals affected are children or young adults. The commonest\npresentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis presenting with\nfever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be confused with\nacute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also occur, which has\nbeen described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late complications may be a\nreactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.\nCutaneous manifestations of yersiniosis include the above-mentioned\nerythema nodosum and erythema multiforme as well. Both of these can be\nfound with a variety of infectious stimuli. erythema nodosum presents as\npainful, indurated erythematous circular lesions usually on the shins.\nErythema multiforme, as the name implies, results in multi-form lesions\nincluding classical target-like lesions. Weber (1) describes erythema\nmultiforme in yersiniosis that tends to coalesce into plaques with a\nvesicular component in its periphery. This may also be associated with\nconjunctivitis. Scarlet fever-like rashes with erythroderma and subsequent\ndesquamation can also occur. This manifestation can also resemble Kawasaki\nsyndrome (2).\nAlthough many associations had been previously made, one of the strongest\nstudies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and food was\npublished in 2004 from Finland (3). The editorial commentary (4) with the\npaper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of infections\nassociated with fresh produce. The diagnosis of infection with this\nbacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from lymph node or\nstool.

The Japanese\nRed Cross Society is looking into the contamination and the\npatient's death, the officials said.\nIf it is confirmed that the woman died of _Yersinia_ contamination,\nshe will be the first person in Japan to have died of bacterial\ncontamination from a transfusion. Hospital officials said the\nhospital had taken care in handling the blood and the patient, and\nthat it was 'an accident which could not have been prevented.'\nOfficials from the hospital and the Health, Labor and Welfare\nMinistry said the woman was admitted to the hospital with a bone\nfracture. While she was undergoing dialysis treatment for chronic\nkidney failure on 22 Sep 2003, she received a transfusion of red\nblood cells to prevent anemia, the officials said. Shortly after the\ntransfusion, however, her condition deteriorated and her condition\nbecame critical, they said. She died on 25 Sep 2003 of\ncomplications of _Yersinia_ bacteremia.\nThe hospital contacted the Red Cross and the Osaka Prefectural\nPolice on Sept. 25, and the Red Cross notified the health ministry,\naccording to the officials.\nThe Red Cross said the blood used for the transfusion came from\nblood donated from one person. As it has recalled other blood\nproducts made from the same blood, there is no danger of the\nblood being used for transfusions involving other patients, it added.\nAlthough the hospital had refrigerated the blood at between 0 C and\n4 C, the bacteria can still grow at temperatures below 5 C.\nYoichi Yasuno, head of the hospital, told the press conference,\n'There was no problem with how we kept blood within the hospital\nnor in how we responded after the patient's condition deteriorated.'\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Bacterial infection transmitted by blood transfusion remains a\npersistent but underemphasized problem that has existed since\nblood transfusion therapy began. As reviewed by Krishnan and\nBrecher (1), in the USA between 1986 and 1991 there were 29\ndeaths related to the bacterial contamination of blood or blood\nproducts. This represented about 16 percent of the transfusion-\nrelated fatalities during that time period. 8 of the 29 deaths (1-2\nfatalities per year) were related to contaminated red cell products,\na risk of 1 death per 9 million red cell transfusions. Relevant to this\ncase, 7 of the 8 episodes were due to _Yersinia enterocolitica_\n(1,2). Other Gram-negative bacilli that have been implicated are\n_Serratia_, _Enterobacter_, and _Pseudomonas_ spp. The\nsource of the organism is thought to be [asymptomatic] transient\nbacteremia [in the donor].\nOf note, most of the episodes occurred in blood older than 25\ndays. It has been demonstrated that at 4 C storage, _Yersinia_ can\nmultiply to high concentrations (3).\nTypically, fever and rigors occur within 30 minutes of the\ntransfusion and may rapidly progress to hypotension, disseminated\nintravascular coagulation, renal failure, and death. As in the\nJapanese case, the organism was isolated from the patient's blood\nand the red cell transfusion (2). In a report from New Zealand, the\nfatality rate was 1 per 104 000 per red cell transfusion, a rate 80\ntimes higher than in the USA (4).\nThe other 21 deaths were related to platelet transfusions,\ntranslating into a fatality rate of 1 per 1 million platelet transfusions.\nThe microbiology of these episodes was more variable, including a\nvariety of Gram-negative bacilli (but not _Y. enterocolitica_),\nstaphylococci, and streptococci.\n1.

While she was undergoing dialysis treatment for chronic\nkidney failure on 22 Sep 2003, she received a transfusion of red\nblood cells to prevent anemia, the officials said. Hospital officials said the\nhospital had taken care in handling the blood and the patient, and\nthat it was 'an accident which could not have been prevented.' As in the\nJapanese case, the organism was isolated from the patient's blood\nand the red cell transfusion (2). In a report from New Zealand, the\nfatality rate was 1 per 104 000 per red cell transfusion, a rate 80\ntimes higher than in the USA (4). Officials from the hospital and the Health, Labor and Welfare\nMinistry said the woman was admitted to the hospital with a bone\nfracture. If it is confirmed that the woman died of _Yersinia_ contamination,\nshe will be the first person in Japan to have died of bacterial\ncontamination from a transfusion. The hospital contacted the Red Cross and the Osaka Prefectural\nPolice on Sept. 25, and the Red Cross notified the health ministry,\naccording to the officials. The Japanese\nRed Cross Society is looking into the contamination and the\npatient's death, the officials said. Typically, fever and rigors occur within 30 minutes of the\ntransfusion and may rapidly progress to hypotension, disseminated\nintravascular coagulation, renal failure, and death. Shortly after the\ntransfusion, however, her condition deteriorated and her condition\nbecame critical, they said. The microbiology of these episodes was more variable, including a\nvariety of Gram-negative bacilli (but not _Y. enterocolitica_),\nstaphylococci, and streptococci.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "yersiniosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2003-09-22 00:00:00", "2021-09-25 00:00:00", "2003-09-26 00:00:00", "2003-09-25 00:00:00", "2003-03-26 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Suita", "country": "Japan"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "New Zealand"}, {"location": "Osaka", "country": "Japan"}, {"location": "Krishnan", "country": "Malaysia"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "Japan"}, {"location": "Theakston EP", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2191524", "headline": "PRO/AH> Yersiniosis, infants - USA (Texas) (04)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2191524", "date": "1997-07-31 23:50:00", "main_text": "[See Yersiniosis, infants - USA (Texas) 970723133356\nYersiniosis, infants - USA (Texas) (02) 970724163819\nYersiniosis, infants - USA (Texas) (03) 970725231807]\nYERSINIOSIS, INFANTS - USA (TEXAS) (04)\n***************************************\nFrom: 'David Bergmire-Sweat' <dbergmire-sweat@DISCON.TDH.STATE.TX.US>\nDate: Mon, 28 Jul 1997 08:57:53 -0600 (CST)\nSeveral people have responded to the posting about Texas' investigation of\nYersinia in infants with suggestions/observations about the link between\nchitterlings (chitlins) and Yersinia enterocolitica outbreaks in Georgia,\nNew York, etc. We are aware of this established link and have included\nquestions about chitterlings on our questionnaire.\nThe group of infants we are studying right now includes 2 Hispanic infants,\n8 white non-Hispanic infants, and one black infant.

[How many cases is the holiday peak?\nIs the increased incidence actually due to outbreaks or a general rise in\noccurence with increased purchase of chitlins? - Mod. pc]\nChitlins are the small intestine of pigs from which the inner lining has\nbeen stripped; this leaves the muscle and the 'crown,' (the ileal-cecal\nvalve area). They are purchased raw in grocery stores or at meat\nprocessing plants. The USDA requires that chitlins be washed out, but this\nis not well enforced so the intestines can contain traces of digesta and\nfecal matter and can be the source of harmful bacteria.\nWhen the consumer prepares them at home, they are washed and dried, often\nby stretching them around something like the legs of a table. Later they\nare cooked according to traditional recipes. Children can touch them where\nthey are stretched to dry or come in contact with fecal matter on the hands\nof adults who have handled the intestines and have not adequately washed\ntheir hands afterwards. It is not clear why the outbreaks are most often\nseen in children and not so much in adults.\nNYS Agriculture and Markets officials have met to help plan food safety\npublicity about this health issue and their Department of Food Safety and\nInspection has prepared educational leaflets for grocers to drop into the\nshopping bags of patrons who purchase chitlins. Agriculture and Markets\nofficials would prefer that people buy chitlins precooked, but so far\nconsumers have resisted this proposed change in the traditional preparation\nof the product.\nAnn Peterson of the Georgia Department of Health recently reported a study\nin which they assessed the effect of preboiling chitlins before cleaning\nand preparing them on texture and flavor (No adverse effect). They also\nstudied effective, appropriate ways to get out this educational message to\ntheir test groups; the messages were liked by the target audience, were\nsimple and low cost, and addressed the barriers to behavior change and the\naudience concerns. The targets were the chitlin preparers, community\nleaders and gatekeepers, and health care providers.\n--\nDonna L.

All cases have occurred in African-American infants\nresiding in the same neighborhood in downtown Buffalo. Interviews with\nfamily reveal that most handled chitterlings (chitlins - pork intestine)\nin the days before the infants became ill. We have also cultured\nY. enterocolitica 0:3 from several chitterling samples. During\na similar outbreak in the same neighborhood last year we conducted\na case control study which also implicated chitterlings (p=.003; RR=17).\nThe infants are obviously not eating the chitterlings but are\nbeing exposed via cross contamination from hands to baby bottle. On\ninterview 4/5 admitted that the baby's bottle was in the sink at\nthe same time the chitterlings were being rinsed. Different stores\nand suppliers are involved. Chitterlings are sold raw-frozen, raw-\nunfrozen, or precooked-frozen in 5 or 10lb plastic buckets with\nsnap lids. They do in fact have the standard USDA safe food handling\nlabel printed on the top.\nCDC and Georgia Dept of Health investigated a chitterling-associated\nyersiniosis outbreak also in African-Amer. infants in 1988 in Atlanta's\ndowntown (Lee, LA et al JID 1991; 163:660-663).\nOur control measures have included a press release\nto warn consumers, notification of health care providers in Buffalo,\ncontact with community church leaders and distribution of a\nsafe food handling notice specifically on chitterling preparation\nto the meat markets in the affected area. Physicians and laboratories\nshould consider yersinia in the differential diagnosis of children with\nfebrile diarrhea. Labs in areas where yersiniosis is occasionally\nfound should either routinely screen for it (CIN or MacConkey media)\non all stools or test only if negative for more common enteric\npathogens (salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, E. coli 0157). (The\nlatter is more cost effective.)\nChitterlings are generally eaten around the\nwinter holiday period from Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year.

The most\ncommon presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis,\nwith fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be\nconfused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also\noccur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late\ncomplications may be a reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.\nCutaneous manifestations of yersiniosis include the above-mentioned\nerythema nodosum and erythema multiforme as well. Both of these can\nbe found with a variety of infectious stimuli. Erythema nodosum\npresents as painful, indurated erythematous circular lesions, usually\non the shins.\nErythema multiforme, as the name implies, results in multi-form\nlesions including classical target-like lesions. Weber (1) describes\nerythema multiforme in yersiniosis that tends to coalesce into\nplaques with a vesicular component in its periphery. This may also be\nassociated with conjunctivitis. Scarlet fever-like rashes\n(Far-Eastern scarlatine fever) with erythroderma and subsequent\ndesquamation can also occur. This manifestation can also resemble\nKawasaki syndrome (2).\nAlthough many associations had been previously made, one of the\nstrongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and\nfood was published in 2004 from Finland (3). The editorial commentary\n(4) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of\ninfections associated with fresh produce. The diagnosis of infection\nwith this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from\nlymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but\ncross-reactions are found between yersiniae and other enteric\norganisms, including some salmonellae.\nKhabarovsk is an area in eastern Russia. Its capital city (also\nKhabarovsk) is located some 30 km [18.64 miles] from the Chinese\nborder and is the 2nd largest city in the Russian Far East, after\nVladivostok.
