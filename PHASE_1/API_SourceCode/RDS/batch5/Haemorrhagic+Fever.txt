The 55 year old\nSouth African citizen, who lives in Malawi, arrived at the hospital on\nThursday [6 Nov 2008] at 7 pm and was brought in to the trauma and\nemergency unit before being placed in an isolation unit as a precaution,\nsaid hospital spokeswoman Marietjie Shelly yesterday.\n\n'He had high temperature, severe abdominal and kidney pain, and vomiting.\nInitial blood tests gave no indication of internal bleeding,' she said.\n'Even though no diagnosis has as yet been made for the patient's condition,\nas is routine full infection control protocols were immediately implemented\nand he was placed in an isolation unit.'\n\nThis was done as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of hospital\nstaff, patients and visitors. 'He walked into the hospital, he wasn't flown\nin or brought in by ambulance,' said Shelly.\n\nThe National Institute of Communicable Diseases had been informed about the\nlatest admission, she said. A broad range of blood tests and screenings\nwere currently in progress as these symptoms may also be indicative of\nother non-infectious conditions.\n\nJust a month ago, American scientists identified a new type of arenavirus\nwhich caused the deaths of 4 people since September [2008]. A name was\nstill being chosen for the virus. The 1st person known to have died from\nthe virus was a woman who was flown from Zambia to South Africa in\nSeptember for emergency treatment. 3 previous visits to health facilities\nhad failed to determine what was wrong with her. Since then the paramedic\nwho accompanied her, a nurse at the Morningside Medi Clinic, and a contract\ncleaner have died. Another nursing sister is currently receiving treatment\nat the Morningside Medi Clinic after presenting with symptoms. However, she\nhad since been moved from the intensive care unit. 'She's improved that\nmuch... however, she's is still in isolation,' said hospital spokeswoman\nMelinda Pelser. Pelser said doctors indicated that the nursing sister was\nnot infectious anymore. As a precautionary measure the woman would be kept\nin isolation for 3 more weeks.\n\nA total of 39 people who had been in contact with her were still being\nmonitored for signs of the virus.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report provides additional details of the patient's symptoms and\nhistory, but does not greatly advance understanding of the patient's\ncondition, which may not be due to infectious disease.\n\nMalawi lies to the east of Zambia and can be located using the\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at\n<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=-13.2,34.3,5> - Mod.CP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Sat 08 Nov 2008\n \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< [6 Nov 2008] at 7 pm and was brought in to the trauma and\nemergency unit before being placed in an isolation unit as a precaution,\nsaid hospital spokeswoman Marietjie Shelly yesterday. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report provides additional details of the patient's symptoms and\nhistory, but does not greatly advance understanding of the patient's\ncondition, which may not be due to infectious disease.
