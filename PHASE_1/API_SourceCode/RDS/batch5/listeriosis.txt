Following confirmation of a 4th case last week, Dr Phil Shoemack says they are continuing to work with MPI [Ministry for Primary Industries] to locate a common source of each case. 'As yet, we have not managed to confirm whether there is a common source, such as a particular food.'

This bacterium, a Gram positive bacillus, is psychrotrophic, that is, it can grow at refrigerator temperatures and, therefore, can become an issue for refrigerated foods such as cheese, fresh cut fruit, and cold cuts. Infection with _L. monocytogenes_ can be asymptomatic but diarrhea can occur. However, in those with defects in cellular immunity, such as from chemotherapy or in organ transplant recipients, the gastrointestinal infection (which can be asymptomatic) can cause bacteremia and meningitis. Infection can also occur during pregnancy and may cause fetal loss.

The purpose of this study was to develop primary, secondary, and tertiary predictive models for the growth of _L. monocytogenes_ in queso fresco and to validate these models using nonisothermal time and temperature profiles. A mixture of five strains of _L. monocytogenes_ was used to inoculate pasteurized whole milk to prepare queso fresco. 10 grams of each fresh cheese sample was vacuum packaged and stored at 4, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 C. From samples at each storage temperature, subsamples were removed at various times and diluted in 0.1% peptone water, and bacteria were enumerated on _Listeria_ selective agar. Growth data from each temperature were fitted using the Baranyi model as the primary model and the Ratkowsky model as the secondary model. Models were then validated using nonisothermal conditions. The Baranyi model was fitted to the isothermal growth data with acceptable goodness of fit statistics (R2 = 0.928; root mean square error = 0.317). The Ratkowsky square root model was fitted to the specific growth rates at different temperatures (R2 = 0.975). The tertiary model developed from these models was validated using the growth data with 2 nonisothermal time and temperature profiles (4 to 20 C for 19 days and 15 to 30 C for 11 days). Data for these 2 profiles were compared with the model prediction using an acceptable prediction zone analysis; over 70% of the growth observations were within the acceptable prediction zone (between -1.0 and 0.5 log CFU/g). The model developed in this study will be useful for estimating the growth of _L. monocytogenes_ in queso fresco. These predictions will help in estimation of the risk of listeriosis from queso fresco under extended storage and temperature abuse conditions. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]", "summary": "\n\nCDC is advising people at higher risk for severe Listeria illness to not eat Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses (like queso fresco) until we learn more and to contact their healthcare provider right away if they have any symptoms of severe Listeria illness after eating Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses.\n\n--\n \n\nThe following article highlights risk factors for _Listeria_ growth in queso fresco cheese:\n\nThomas M, Tiwari R, Mishra A: Predictive model of _Listeria monocytogenes_ growth in queso fresco. \nConnecticut / 1\nMaryland / 4\nNew York / 1\nVirginia / 1\n------------------------ A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \nTotal / 7\n\nThe true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. ------\n_Listeria monocytogenes_ is a hardy, psychrotrophic pathogen that has been linked to several cheese-related outbreaks in the United States, including a recent outbreak in which a fresh cheese (queso fresco) was implicated. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hispanic style fresh, soft cheese often called queso fresco ('fresh cheese') is a classical vehicle for listeriosis.

It was concluded that the safety of products produced by this process could not be guaranteed, leading to the recall,' the NVWA spokesman told Food Safety News. Furthermore, steps have been taken by the producer to remove possible sources of contamination. As all involved food business operators have voluntarily taken all expected actions, no measures towards them were taken by the NVWA.

The advisory was directed specifically to local and tribal health departments, hospitals, clinics, other facilities and any other healthcare providers. The advisory was not issued to the public as the outbreak is not believed to be linked to any products currently on the market.\n\nThe advisory notes that Minnesota experiences approximately 8 cases of listeriosis (invasive _Listeria monocytogenes_ disease) per year. Recently, 2 seemingly separate cases of listeriosis, one a previously healthy teenager and the other, a person over the age of 60 years-old, have been confirmed in the state of Minnesota.\n\nAfter further investigation, the cases of listeriosis were found to have zero allele differences in an entire genome sequence, indicating that they share a common strain of _Listeria_. After extensive questioning, officials discovered that both ill persons had eaten at China Buffet restaurant in Alexandria on [15 Feb 2020], before falling ill.\n\nUpon investigating China Buffet, no fault has been found with their food safety procedures. Officials believe that the _Listeria_ contamination may be the fault of a preceding supplier instead. China Buffet's transactions are being tracked and each possible location investigated in order to pinpoint the source of the outbreak.\n\nHealth care providers and facilities were given the advisory in an effort to spread awareness for the detection of any future cases. Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, and confusion. People at a higher risk for listeriosis infection include pregnant women and their infants, elderly, and any other immunocompromised persons.\n\nIf the source of the _Listeria_ outbreak of Minnesota is found to be linked to a public supplier of grocery stores or markets, the public will be immediately notified through the Food and Drug [Administration] (FDA).\n\n[Byline: Tony Coveny]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Two individuals were found to be infected with _Listeria monocytogenes_, both of which had identical genotypes, suggesting a common source for their infections.

Listeriosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. Symptoms include fever, muscle pain, septicemia (blood poisoning) and meningitis. The incubation period is usually 1 to 2 weeks but can vary between a few and 70 days. The elderly population, pregnant women, newborn infants and people with weak immune systems are more susceptible to infections.\n\nHigh-risk foods include pre-packed sandwiches, deli and ready-to-eat meat products such as cooked, cured and/or fermented meats and sausages, soft cheeses and cold smoked fishery products.\n\nBetween March and May [2020], 4 suspected foodborne outbreaks were reported in the country, compared with an average of 18 in previous years, according to the THL.\n\nThe agency believes this is because of the coronavirus pandemic and associated limitations and recommendations. When hands are washed and food prepared for smaller groups, there are fewer epidemics.

PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.\n\nAs of [9 Mar 2020], 36 people infected with the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_ have been reported from 17 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page [available at the source URL above].\n\n_Listeria_ samples from ill people were collected from [23 Nov 2016] to [13 Dec 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 to 97 years, with a median age of 67. Fifty-eight percent of ill people are female. Of 32 ill people with information available, 30 hospitalizations have been reported. 4 deaths have been reported from California, Hawaii, and New Jersey. 6 cases are pregnancy-associated and 2 resulted in fetal loss.\n\nInvestigation of the outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that enoki mushrooms labeled as 'Product of Korea' are the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nState and local public health officials interviewed ill people about the foods they ate in the month before they became ill. 12 out of 22 (55%) reported eating mushrooms, including enoki, portobello, white, button, cremini, wood ear, maitake, and oyster.\n\nMichigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development collected mushrooms for testing from a grocery store where an ill person purchased enoki mushrooms. 2 samples of enoki mushrooms yielded the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_. These mushrooms are labeled as 'Product of Korea' and were distributed by Sun Hong Foods, Inc. Additional product testing is ongoing in California.\n\nOn [9 Mar 2020], Sun Hong Foods, Inc. recalled enoki mushrooms (UPC 7 426852 625810) labeled as 'Product of Korea'.

Enoki mushrooms distributed by Sun Hong Foods, Inc. do not account for all illnesses in this outbreak. FDA is working to identify the source of the enoki mushrooms distributed by Sun Hong Foods, Inc. and determine if other distributors received the same enoki mushrooms.\n\nCDC is concerned that enoki mushrooms labeled as 'Product of Korea' may be contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_ and are advising people at higher risk -- pregnant women, adults ages 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems -- to avoid eating any enoki mushrooms labeled as 'Product of Korea', until investigators determine the source of contamination and if additional products are linked to illness.\n\nCDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the USA, the CDC identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes based on whole genome sequencing.

The FDA is warning that consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not eat, sell, or serve El Abuelito brand queso fresco cheese.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration [FDA] has been working on the outbreak investigation with agencies in several states. This evening [Wed 17 Feb 2021], the FDA announced that the Connecticut Department of Public Health collected product samples of El Abuelito-brand Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses from a store where an outbreak patient bought cheeses.\n\n'Sample analysis showed the presence of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in samples of El Abuelito Queso Fresco sold in 10-ounce packages, marked as Lot A027 with an expiration date of 26 Feb 2021,' according to the FDA's outbreak update. 'Samples are currently undergoing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis to determine if the _Listeria monocytogenes_ found in these samples is a match to the outbreak strain. At this time, there is not enough evidence to determine if this outbreak is linked to El Abuelito Queso Fresco.\n\n'FDA and state partners are working with the firm to recall the affected lot and to determine if additional products should be recalled. Additional information will be provided as it becomes available.'\n\nAlthough the FDA is stopping short of saying there is a concrete link to the El Abuelito cheese, it is warning consumers to not eat it. The agency also warns that other soft, Hispanic-style cheese may be implicated in the multi-state outbreak.\n\n'Consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not eat, sell, or serve El Abuelito Queso Fresco cheese until more information is known,' FDA warns. 'If you are at higher risk for severe _Listeria_ illness -- if you are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system due to certain medical conditions or treatments -- do not eat any Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses, including El Abuelito-brand queso fresco cheese, until we identify which cheeses are making people sick in this outbreak.'\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 7 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported in Connecticut, Maryland, New York, and Virginia.\n\nAll 7 patients have required hospitalization. Six of the 7 ill people are Hispanic. Of the 4 people interviewed, 3 reported eating at least one type of Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses, and each of the 3 reported eating queso fresco.\n\n[Byline: Coral Beach]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A particular brand of queso fresco cheese is suspected as a source for the multistate outbreak of listeriosis involving 4 cases in Maryland, and one case each in New York, Connecticut, and Virginia (ProMED post Listeriosis - USA: queso fresco cheese, archive number 20210214.8190625). Linkage of this cheese to the outbreak awaits whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis to determine if the _Listeria monocytogenes_ found in the cheese samples matches the WGS of the outbreak strain isolated from the patients.\n\nQueso fresco ('fresh cheese'), Hispanic-style soft, unaged white cheese, is made by curdling milk; it can be made with either pasteurized or unpasteurized (raw) milk. It is considered safe when made with pasteurized milk, but multiple types of soft cheeses have been implicated in listeriosis outbreaks, with most outbreaks linked to Latin-style soft cheese (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6004860/).\n\nCheeses made from unpasteurized milk can be sold within US states that permit sale of raw dairy products. However, the US FDA prohibits interstate commerce of fresh, unaged (uncured) cheeses made from unpasteurized milk. FDA regulations do permit interstate distribution of raw milk cheeses, if aged (cured) for more than 60 days at a temperature of not less than 35 deg F [1.7 deg C], because aging/ripening of cheese for at least 60 days is thought to reduce bacterial contamination (http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/02/publishers-platform-60-day-rule-the-facts/#.WMWFxLGZPjA). However, aging raw milk cheese for 60 days may not totally ensure safety when _L. monocytogenes_ is introduced as a post-processing contaminant (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18724749).\n\nIn the US, the CDC identifies clusters of possibly related cases of listeriosis based on clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes based on whole-genome sequencing. These isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html).\n\nWhen PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the _Listeria_ case report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.\n\nFood items likely to be contaminated with _Listeria_, in addition to soft cheeses, include ready-to-eat refrigerated meat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon, sushi, and cold cut meats. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease.\n\nPeople at increased risk for disseminated listeriosis, which include pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems, should avoid eating food potentially contaminated with _Listeria_.\n\nOnce a cluster is identified, PulseNet works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food-monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as the common source. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]", "summary": "If you are at higher risk for severe _Listeria_ illness -- if you are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system due to certain medical conditions or treatments -- do not eat any Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses, including El Abuelito-brand queso fresco cheese, until we identify which cheeses are making people sick in this outbreak.' promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A particular brand of queso fresco cheese is suspected as a source for the multistate outbreak of listeriosis involving 4 cases in Maryland, and one case each in New York, Connecticut, and Virginia (ProMED post Listeriosis - USA: queso fresco cheese, archive number 20210214.8190625). \n\nQueso fresco ('fresh cheese'), Hispanic-style soft, unaged white cheese, is made by curdling milk; it can be made with either pasteurized or unpasteurized (raw) milk.

The company issued a recall and informed its buyers to remove the products from shelves. One of the buyers is a supplier to the Centre Hospitalier du Valais Romand (CHVR). This supplier told the CHVR purchasing manager on [30 Apr 2020] about the problem. He instructed the immediate withdrawal of implicated cheeses. The last delivery was [8 Apr 2020], but it has not been ruled out that previous lots were also contaminated.\n\nFrom [30 Mar to 2 Apr 2020], a diagnosis of invasive listeriosis infection was made in 4 CHVR patients who could have contracted illness from eating these cheeses during their hospital stays. According to information from meal cards, the infected patients did consume cheese during their hospitalization but it is not possible to be certain that it was the cheeses in question. 3 of the people have recovered but one person with underlying health conditions has died.\n\nKaeserei Vogel informed the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) in Switzerland about the contamination.\n\nFSVO, also known by its French acronym OSAV, Italian name USAV, and under the German name BLV, told people not to consume the products concerned by the recall as they may pose a health hazard.\n\nMore than 20 items including sheep and goat cheese, brie, and organic cheese sold across Switzerland have been recalled by the company. Cheeses can be identified as they have number CH-5707 on the packaging. Distribution also includes Belgium and Germany, according to the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) portal.\n\nDenner, a supermarket in Switzerland, has recalled all expiration dates of 'Denner Fromage de montagne de la Suisse centrale' because of detection of _Listeria_ at the site of the dairy producer.\n\nMigros, another retailer in the country, recalled all batches of 5 cheese products sold at different stores because of the problem.\n\nFood contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products and developed symptoms of _Listeria_ infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible _Listeria_ exposure.\n\nAlso, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled product should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.\n\nSymptoms of _Listeria_ infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose _Listeria_ infections, which can mimic other illnesses.\n\nPregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.\n\n[Byline: Joe Whitworth]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news article above reports that a cheese manufacturer, Kaserei Vogel AG, based in Steinerberg, a town in central Switzerland, found _Listeria_ in semi-hard cheese and at its production site. One of their buyers was the Sion Hospital (part of the Centre Hospitalier du Valais Romand). The city of Sion (population 35 000 residents) is the capital of the canton of Valais, in southwestern Switzerland (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sion,+Switzerland). From 30 Mar to 2 May 2020, 4 patients were infected by _Listeria_ and 1 died after eating potentially contaminated cheese during their hospital stays. More than 20 items including sheep and goat cheese, brie, and organic cheese are sold in Switzerland and identified by number CH-5707 on the packaging. Distribution also included Belgium and Germany.\n\nWe are not told if any of the implicated cheeses were made from raw milk or the aging process for these cheeses. Typically, semi-hard cheeses are aged anywhere between one and six months depending on type. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rule requires cheese made from unpasteurized milk to age for a minimum of 60 days before sale. Disease-causing pathogens are thought not to survive the acidifying process of aging for more than the 2-month aging process (https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/02/is-the-60-day-rule-still-valid-for-raw-milk-cheese/). Of course, even if made from pasteurized milk, the cheese could have become contaminated with _Listeria_ as a result of environmental contamination at the production site.\n\nThe news report says that it is not known if the cheese eaten by the 4 patients was the _Listeria_-contaminated cheese produced by Kaeserei Vogel AG. However, if genotyping is done and genotypes of the 4 patient isolates match each other, then a common source outbreak can be established, and if the genotype of the outbreak strain matches that of the cheese isolate, then the source can be established.

More than 20 items including sheep and goat cheese, brie, and organic cheese are sold in Switzerland and identified by number CH-5707 on the packaging. \n\nMigros, another retailer in the country, recalled all batches of 5 cheese products sold at different stores because of the problem. \n\nPregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections and other complications. From [30 Mar to 2 Apr 2020], a diagnosis of invasive listeriosis infection was made in 4 CHVR patients who could have contracted illness from eating these cheeses during their hospital stays. \n\nWe are not told if any of the implicated cheeses were made from raw milk or the aging process for these cheeses. However, if genotyping is done and genotypes of the 4 patient isolates match each other, then a common source outbreak can be established, and if the genotype of the outbreak strain matches that of the cheese isolate, then the source can be established. According to information from meal cards, the infected patients did consume cheese during their hospitalization but it is not possible to be certain that it was the cheeses in question. \n\nDenner, a supermarket in Switzerland, has recalled all expiration dates of 'Denner Fromage de montagne de la Suisse centrale' because of detection of _Listeria_ at the site of the dairy producer. \n\nFSVO, also known by its French acronym OSAV, Italian name USAV, and under the German name BLV, told people not to consume the products concerned by the recall as they may pose a health hazard.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2020-05-26 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Steinerberg", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SWITZERLAND", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "FATAL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Switzerland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Valais", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Belgium", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6852412", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - USA (03): fatal, bulk hard-boiled eggs, 2017-2019, alert", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6852412", "date": "2019-12-21 17:34:03", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - USA (03): FATAL, BULK HARD-BOILED EGGS, 2017-2019, ALERT\n**********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 18 Dec 2019\nSource: CDC Food Safety Alert [abridged, edited]\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/eggs-12-19/index.html\n\n\nThe CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections linked to hard-boiled eggs.\n\nAt a glance\n-----------\nReported cases: 7\nStates: 5\nHospitalizations: 4\nDeaths: 1\nRecall: No\n\nAdvice for retailers, food service operators, and consumers\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThe CDC is concerned that bulk, fresh hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods of Gainesville, Georgia, are contaminated with _Listeria_ and have made people sick. These products were packaged in plastic pails for use nationwide by food service operators. These products have not been recalled. However, because _Listeria_ can cause severe infections, the CDC is warning against selling, serving, or using these eggs to make other food products.\n\nRetailers and food service operators should know who supplies their bulk hard-boiled eggs. Consumers will not be able to tell if products they've purchased from stores contain these eggs, so it is important that people at higher risk for _Listeria_ infections follow the advice listed below.\n\nAdvice for retailers and food service operators:\n- Retailers and food service operators should not use bulk hard-boiled eggs produced at the Almark Foods Gainesville, Georgia facility, regardless of use-by date.\n- These eggs were peeled, hard-boiled, and packaged in plastic pails of various sizes. Food processors and manufacturers should not use these eggs to make ready-to-eat foods, such as egg salad, deviled eggs, or salads.\n- These fresh hard-boiled eggs were packaged in plastic pails and have a 49-day shelf-life.\n- Wash and sanitize any surfaces that may have come in contact with the eggs or the pail packaging. _Listeria_ can easily spread to other foods and surfaces.\n- Retailers and food service operators should be aware of the following: This advice does not include Almark Foods hard-boiled eggs sold directly to consumers (https://www.almarkeggs.com/product-category/retail/hard-boiled-eggs/), or any other brands of hard-boiled eggs or products made with hard-boiled eggs. The data collected to date [have] not indicated that these products are linked to illness. This advice does not include eggs hard-boiled by retailers or restaurants.\n\nAdvice for people at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection, such as pregnant women and their newborns, adults ages 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer or on dialysis:\n- Until we learn more, CDC advises that people at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection throw away any store-bought hard-boiled eggs or products containing hard-boiled eggs, such as egg salad. If you have these products at home, don't eat them. Throw them away, regardless of where you bought them or the use-by date.\n- Wash and sanitize drawers or shelves in refrigerators and freezers where the products were stored. Follow these 5 steps to clean your refrigerator (see https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/clean-refrigerator-steps.html). This advice does not include eggs hard-boiled at home or homemade products made with those eggs, such as egg salad or deviled eggs.\n- If you buy products with hard-boiled eggs, or order or eat items with hard-boiled eggs at a restaurant: Before you buy, order, or eat, confirm with the store or restaurant that they do not use hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods. If they use hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods, don't buy or order the product. If they don't know where their hard-boiled eggs are from, don't buy or order the product.\n- People at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection are much more likely than the general public to get sick after eating a food contaminated with this bacteria. People on dialysis are 50 times more likely to get a _Listeria_ infection. People with cancer and pregnant women are 10 times more likely than other people to get a _Listeria_ infection. Adults 65 and older are 4 times more likely to get an infection.\n\nLatest outbreak information\n-------------------------\n- Seven people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 5 states. Four hospitalizations have been reported. One death has been reported from Texas.\n- Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that bulk hard-boiled eggs from Almark Foods are a likely source of this outbreak.\n- This investigation is ongoing to determine the source of contamination and if additional products are linked to illness.\n- The CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\nInvestigation details\n---------------------\nPublic health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by the CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.\n\nAs of 17 Dec 2019, a total of 7 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 5 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/eggs-12-19/map.html).\n\n_Listeria_ specimens from ill people were collected from 10 Apr 2017 to 12 Nov 2019. Ill people range in age from less than 1 to 82 years, with a median age of 75. Seventy-one percent of ill people are male. Of 6 ill people with information available, 4 hospitalizations have been reported. One death has been reported from Texas. One illness was reported in a newborn who was infected with _Listeria_ while the mother was pregnant, but the newborn survived.\n\nInvestigation of the outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that bulk hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods of Gainesville, Georgia, are a likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the month before they became ill. Of the 5 people for whom information was available, 4 (80%) reported eating products containing eggs. Three of these people reported eating hard-boiled eggs in deli salads purchased from grocery stores and in salads eaten at restaurants.\n\nIn the PulseNet database, CDC noted 2 environmental samples from February 2019 that are closely related genetically to bacteria from ill people in this outbreak. The FDA reports that these samples were taken during a routine inspection of the Almark Foods facility (https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/almark-foods-inc-576633-07222019). These results provide additional evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods.\n\nInvestigators are continuing to collect records from grocery stores and restaurants where ill people reported eating hard-boiled eggs. Investigations are ongoing to determine and document the distribution and production chain, as well as the source of hard-boiled eggs to the locations reported by ill people.\n\nThe CDC is concerned that bulk, fresh hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods of Gainesville, Georgia, are contaminated with _Listeria_ and have made people sick. These products were packaged in plastic pails for use nationwide by food service operators.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing to determine the source of contamination and if additional products are linked to illness. The CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the USA, the CDC identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes based on whole genome sequencing. These isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.\n\nOnce a cluster is identified, PulseNet also works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as a common source.\n\nThe above alert issued by the CDC concerns 7 people who have been infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in 5 states from 10 Apr 2017 to 12 Nov 2019. One of the 7 people has died. Of cases for which information was available, 80% reported eating products containing eggs. Two 'environmental samples' taken at the Almark Foods facility of Gainesville, Georgia, a producer of bulk hard-boiled eggs, during a routine inspection in February 2019 are reported above to be closely related genetically to the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_, which provided additional evidence that 'that people in this outbreak got sick from eating [bulk] hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods.' The FDA report (https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/almark-foods-inc-576633-07222019) specifies that one swab was collected at the Almark Foods facility from the peeling room floor drain and the other from 'the egg counter entrance and stainless-steel area at the end of the conveyor belt', a location in contact with food. The FDA reports 'the 2 isolates are genetically identical to 2 cases of human illness dating back to 2017.' However, the CDC report above notes that these products have not been recalled. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]", "summary": "\n\nAdvice for people at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection, such as pregnant women and their newborns, adults ages 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer or on dialysis:\n- Until we learn more, CDC advises that people at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection throw away any store-bought hard-boiled eggs or products containing hard-boiled eggs, such as egg salad. \n- Retailers and food service operators should be aware of the following: This advice does not include Almark Foods hard-boiled eggs sold directly to consumers (https://www.almarkeggs.com/product-category/retail/hard-boiled-eggs/), or any other brands of hard-boiled eggs or products made with hard-boiled eggs.

All are thought to have become ill after eating meat products from the Offerman company over the past 2 years, the agency said.\n\nIn total, at least 20 people have become ill after eating Offerman cold cuts. The company issued a health warning on Friday [4 Oct 2019], and Jumbo, which stocks 135 different products from Offerman, ordered an immediate recall. Aldi too has recalled its Offerman products, which were also widely sold to company canteens.\n\nThe source of the infection was traced by the RIVM and product safety board NVWA [Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety] after an analysis of the different types of _Listeria_ infection this week. 'It has only been recently possible to use this technique and without it, we would not have been able to identify the source,' the RIVM said. [Probably they are referring to whole genome sequencing. - Mod.ML]\n\nThe factory where the bacteria originate[d] is located in Aalsmeer and has been closed pending a thorough clean-up, the AD reported on Friday afternoon [4 Oct 2019].

'But this would appear not to have done the job,' an NVWA spokesman told the broadcaster.\n\n_Listeria_ is found in meat that has not been properly cooked and in raw foods [that] have been kept [refrigerated?] for a long time, the RIVM said. Most people suffer mild flu-like symptoms, but the bacteria can cause serious symptoms in the elderly, newborns and people with weak immune systems.

This year [2019], 8 more patients became ill with the last disease onset date in mid-July. 3 people are reported to have died with listeriosis as a contributing factor.\n\nThe Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) looked at supply chains and food samples. Investigations compared a _Listeria_ isolate from the Wilke Waldecker Fleisch- und Wurstwaren company near Hesse with patient isolates from the outbreak, finding a close relationship between them.\n\nThe United States was one of more than 20 countries that may have received meat from this German company but no illnesses were recorded in other nations.\n\nIssues were raised about the speed of communication between different authorities, scrutiny of Wilke and decision making around the timing of closing the business.\n\nReinhard Kubat, district administrator in Waldeck-Frankenberg, a county in Hessen, said the focus should not be on blame but on actions for the future.\n\n'We know that there have been mistakes... and we are ready to protect consumers to jointly improve food monitoring to regain consumer confidence. As we know, there have been failures at all levels of government. All authorities must work together to prevent a repeat of the Wilke case, if possible. There cannot be 100 percent certainty. All authorities, however, collectively share the duty of learning from what happened and to do everything possible to rule out such incidents.'\n\nA 40-page review of the Wilke case by authorities in Waldeck-Frankenberg was given to the Hessian Ministry for the Environment, Climate Protection, Agriculture and Consumer Protection.\n\nIt was agreed food monitoring would be improved with unannounced inspections in manufacturing companies to be stepped up and carried out at fixed intervals together with technical supervision. Businesses' self-control systems are also going to be looked at more intensively.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n----------------\nPriska Hinz, Hessen consumer protection minister, said the food business operator is primarily responsible at all stages of production, processing, and distribution in ensuring food meets requirements of the law.\n\n'These include in particular food safety, traceability, prevention, transparency and emergency measures, as well as cooperation with the authorities. Food inspection ensures that employers comply with their responsibilities and that only safe food comes onto the market,' she said.\n\n'In the case of Wilke, the food business operator obviously did not fulfill his obligations. Nevertheless, it is also important in the future to recognize such cases at an early stage and to act consistently.'\n\nBased on EU regulation, food firms are sorted into risk levels that equate to a certain frequency of checks. Wilke was classified as risk level 4 which should have meant the firm had to be inspected 12 times a year but a mistake saw the company reduced to quarterly inspections.\n\nFor a company the size as Wilke, a regular review of all operating rooms is necessary. However, control reports from 2018 show that inspections only took place in different areas of the site. Between 2015 and 2018 it could also not be shown that controls on self-checks at Wilke took place.\n\nListeria positives\n------------------\nBetween May 2018 and May 2019, _Listeria monocytogenes_ was found in 7 of 131 product samples examined by Wilke so the company told authorities it had strengthened hygiene controls.\n\nDespite _Listeria_ findings by authorities from Hamburg and Baden-Wuerttemberg, no further official sampling seems to have taken place for the next 4 months, based on investigations in April this year [2019].\n\nThe 31 tests from April are environmental samples of which 5 detected _Listeria monocytogenes_ and 2 samples contained other _Listeria_. However, despite this, there was no increase in the number of official samples.\n\nThe Hessian Ministry of Consumer Protection was informed by the BVL on [12 Aug 2019] that Wilke had supplied food to wholesalers in 6 of 9 health facilities where people suffering from the _Listeria_ outbreak strain were present. But authorities in Waldeck-Frankenberg, who are responsible for food monitoring at Wilke, were not informed until [20 Aug 2019].\n\nAfter an inspection in early September [2019], the company was told to sample all 5 slicers on a daily basis and thoroughly clean and disinfect all production rooms. Product samples were negative for _Listeria_. In mid-September [2019] a link between the company and the illness cluster was established after further analysis of the samples from April [2019]. _Listeria_ was found in environmental samples taken this month [November 2019].\n\nOfficials stopped production at the Wilke facility in early October [2019], with the company's inventory still at about 300 tons, and a criminal complaint was made to the public prosecutor in Kassel. The company has since filed for bankruptcy.\n\n[Byline: Joe Whitworth]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The news report above goes into greater detail concerning the listeriosis outbreak in Germany than the prior ProMED-mail post (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - Europe (16): (Germany) fatal, WGS, meat, healthcare facilities 20191019.6736570), which described a listeriosis outbreak that affected 37 people, 3 of whom died, in 12 German states between 2014 and 2019, due to _Listeria_-contaminated meat products manufactured at a processing facility in the German state of Hesse and widely distributed to more than 20 European countries.\n\nWe were told in the prior ProMED-mail posting that most people infected in this outbreak ate the contaminated meat products at healthcare facilities. Such people are at increased risk of disseminated listeriosis if they eat _Listeria_-contaminated food that is not adequately cooked before eating.

The Hessian Ministry of Consumer Protection was informed by the BVL on [12 Aug 2019] that Wilke had supplied food to wholesalers in 6 of 9 health facilities where people suffering from the _Listeria_ outbreak strain were present. Between May 2018 and May 2019, _Listeria monocytogenes_ was found in 7 of 131 product samples examined by Wilke so the company told authorities it had strengthened hygiene controls. \n\nIt was agreed food monitoring would be improved with unannounced inspections in manufacturing companies to be stepped up and carried out at fixed intervals together with technical supervision. \n\n'These include in particular food safety, traceability, prevention, transparency and emergency measures, as well as cooperation with the authorities. \n\nBased on EU regulation, food firms are sorted into risk levels that equate to a certain frequency of checks. \n\n'In the case of Wilke, the food business operator obviously did not fulfill his obligations. \n\nThe United States was one of more than 20 countries that may have received meat from this German company but no illnesses were recorded in other nations. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) looked at supply chains and food samples. In mid-September [2019] a link between the company and the illness cluster was established after further analysis of the samples from April [2019]. \n\nIssues were raised about the speed of communication between different authorities, scrutiny of Wilke and decision making around the timing of closing the business. \n\nA 40-page review of the Wilke case by authorities in Waldeck-Frankenberg was given to the Hessian Ministry for the Environment, Climate Protection, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. But authorities in Waldeck-Frankenberg, who are responsible for food monitoring at Wilke, were not informed until [20 Aug 2019]. After an inspection in early September [2019], the company was told to sample all 5 slicers on a daily basis and thoroughly clean and disinfect all production rooms. Food inspection ensures that employers comply with their responsibilities and that only safe food comes onto the market,' she said. Despite _Listeria_ findings by authorities from Hamburg and Baden-Wuerttemberg, no further official sampling seems to have taken place for the next 4 months, based on investigations in April this year [2019]. [Byline: Joe Whitworth]\n\n--\n Such people are at increased risk of disseminated listeriosis if they eat _Listeria_-contaminated food that is not adequately cooked before eating. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease. \n\nReinhard Kubat, district administrator in Waldeck-Frankenberg, a county in Hessen, said the focus should not be on blame but on actions for the future. Wilke was classified as risk level 4 which should have meant the firm had to be inspected 12 times a year but a mistake saw the company reduced to quarterly inspections.

Those infected with the same strain of _Listeria_ were identified by the National Reference Center for Listeria, with an 8th case still under investigation.\n\nSante Publique France [Public Health France] reported 2 people have died, but the agency does not have any evidence to attribute the deaths to _Listeria_ infection.\n\nPeople fell ill between February 2018 and August 2019 and are aged between 36 and 93 years old; 5 are women. Four live in Alsace, while Burgundy, Ile-de-France, and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur all have one case.\n\nInvestigations by Sante Publique France found these people had consumed organic dairy products in the weeks before contracting listeriosis. Analysis of food samples from a company, based in Bas-Rhin, Alsace confirmed contamination with _Listeria_. Raw milk cheeses are the suspected source of the contamination.\n\nTesting by the National Reference Center for _Listeria_ confirmed strains found in products had the same genetic characteristics as those isolated in the patients. Consumption of Ferme Durr products was also confirmed by several patients.\n\nFerme Durr recalled all dates of Durr brand organic dairy items, including natural yogurt and yogurt with fruit, cream, cottage cheese, and cheese. Products were sold directly at the firm, in markets and stores throughout France. Products were also distributed in Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg.\n\nThe action was extended a few days later to include puddings and food such as cheese and cold meats resold but not produced at the site.\n\nAll production by the company has been stopped until further notice, according to French authorities after an investigation revealed 'serious shortcomings,' and results of official controls found 'widespread contamination' of the facility and food products.\n\nIt can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of the infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness.\n\nPregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people who have weakened immune systems are more at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications.\n\nMeanwhile, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission has released a Certified Reference Material (CRM) to be used as quality assurance for analysis of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in food control laboratories. The aim is to support EU member states when monitoring listeriosis and ensure collection of comparable data on the disease.\n\nEvaluating the subtype of _Listeria monocytogenes_ is essential in epidemiological investigations or source tracking contamination from food factories. One of the methods used by labs for subtyping is pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The material was certified using an interlaboratory comparison study, in which all participants used PFGE.\n\nIn the EU, 2480 cases were reported in 2017, with a mortality rate of 14%. The disease is often severe with high hospitalization and mortality rates. Consumption of ready-to-eat foods such as smoked fish, deli meats and soft cheeses are the main routes of transmission.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The 7 patients infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ live in eastern France: 4 in Alsace, an historical region located in Grand Est (Grand Est is one of the 12 mainland regions of France) and 1 each in the regions of Burgundy, Ile-de-France, and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur.

A man has reportedly died after eating tainted meat in Spain. This is the 3rd fatality in the outbreak, which comes on top of the deaths of 2 elderly women. The outbreak has also seen 5 women lose their babies due to the food-borne bacteria.\n\nThe 1st possible case of listeriosis outside of Spain as part of the current outbreak has also been reported. The potential victim is a Briton who may have become infected with the bacteria while in the focal point of the ongoing outbreak, Andalusia, before traveling to France, where he was diagnosed with listeriosis and spent several days in hospital, then returning to his home country.\n\nThe source of the outbreak has been traced to a pork product stuffed with garlic and other condiments sold under the commercial name 'la Mecha', which is made by the company Magrudis, based in Seville. Its factory has since been closed and its meat recalled from shops.\n\nAccording to EL PAIS [Spanish newspaper], the oven cart used at the company has tested positive for the bacteria _Listeria monocytogenes_. Last week [25-31 Aug 2019], the news outlet revealed that tests carried out on larding needles used by Magrudis also returned positive results for the presence of the bacteria.\n\nThe company said they are 'in a state of shock,' and 'couldn't explain what happened' in a press release reportedly released by Magrudis. The company also claims to have been in compliance with all sanitary regulations, with recent lab reports proving negative test results from just days before the product in question was packaged.\n\nShowing her solidarity with the people affected by the outbreak, the families of the deceased, and women who have suffered abortions or intrauterine fetal deaths, Maria Luisa Carcedo, the Minister of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare, has expressed her 'most sincere solidarity and deep regret in the name of the Government of Spain. I know that this is not enough and that the fundamental reparation that we are obliged to give [the victims and their families] is the determination of the causes and circumstances in which this outbreak has occurred and the adoption of decisions that prevent this from happening again.'\n\nThe 1st official report on the outbreak was on 16 Aug 2019 by Andalusian health authorities, said Carcedo: 'Since [16 Aug 2019], the protocols of the national alert network and the EU have worked,' said the minister. 'Spain is one of the most demanding countries in food security, and outbreaks such as [the one in] Andalusia should serve to further improve our action and response protocols.' Carcedo also thanked the health professionals of the National Health System and food safety 'who have worked both in patient care and in the containment of the outbreak'.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 6 Sep 2019\nSource: El Pais [in Spanish, machine trans., abridged, edited]\nhttps://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=https://elpais.com/sociedad/2019/09/06/actualidad/1567770709_618948.html&prev=search\n\n\nThe listeriosis outbreak, the largest recorded in Spain to date, has so far caused 3 deaths, 7 abortions and affected more than 200 people. The authorities considered it controlled. Now this new front opens. Dr. Jose Miguel Cisneros has reported on Friday morning [6 Sep 2019] of a new confirmed case, which brings the number of people affected in Andalusia to 207, and another abortion, the 6th in the community and the 7th in the whole country. This is a pregnant woman from Seville, 23 weeks of gestation, and who had ingested the Mecha meatloaf a few weeks ago, without presenting symptoms. The number of hospitalized is 45 versus 40 on the previous day [5 Sep 2019], of which 19 are pregnant women. Two patients remain in the ICU.\n\n_Listeria_ is an almost harmless pathogen for most healthy people, but it can be lethal for those with weakened immune systems and for babies in gestation, as confirmed in the outbreak recorded so far by contaminated brand products La Mecha, from the Sevillian company Magrudis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This listeriosis outbreak is now reported to extend throughout Spain, although most cases have occurred in Seville. The 2nd news report above says that the outbreak has now involved 7 miscarriages, and a case in a tourist from the UK who was hospitalized in France with listeriosis acquired in Seville.\n\n_Listeria_ have been identified in 3 meat products and in needles used to inject lard into the meat before it is cooked at a meat processing facility in Seville; after cooking, the meat is usually served cold and in thin slices. Proper cooking of the meat at the processing facility should have killed _Listeria_, which suggests either that the meat may have been improperly cooked or that contamination may have also occurred after cooking.

The Austrian National Reference Laboratory for _Listeria_ (NRL) is responsible for whole genome sequence (WGS)-based typing of all isolates.\n\nOutbreak investigation\n----------------------\nIn late December 2018, the local health authority of Styria and the NRL confirmed an outbreak of febrile gastroenteritis, including one case of culture-confirmed _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteremia, among 32 people at a tavern in mid-December [2018] as part of a celebration. They had consumed mixed platters with several meat products and p\u00e2t\u00e9s originating from an unnamed local production facility.\n\nAt the end of January this year [2019], the Austrian Ministry of Health imposed a mandate on the Austrian Agency of Health and Food Safety (AGES) to investigate the outbreak to identify the causative agent and likely source of infections, to detect and prevent further cases. The delay was due to closure of the tavern over the Christmas [2018] period.\n\nInformation from the local food authority on those involved restricted the incident to one local meat producer and three grocery shops. Items from this producer were offered at 6 locations, including the affected tavern and sold directly from the factory.\n\nOf 19 stool specimens from people with febrile gastroenteritis, 10 were positive for _L. monocytogenes_.\n\nA total of 73 food and environmental samples were analyzed for _Listeria monocytogenes_ with 2 food and one environmental sample positive. The food samples, smoked meat (Geselchtes) and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 (Leberstreichwurst) were collected at the tavern. It was learned that they were produced by the same company. A gully water sample from January 2019 by Styrian health authorities at the production facility of this company also tested positive.\n\nActive case finding identified 2 more people with invasive listeriosis. They lived in the same 2 geographical districts as the tavern and production company. The 1st isolate was from a person in their early 80s who had not visited the tavern but developed symptoms in November 2018. This person, who died from the infection, had repeated consumption of liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 from the production company that was bought at a local market.\n\nThe 2nd isolate was from a case in their mid-50s with endophthalmitis, with onset of clinical symptoms in December 2018 but this person had not visited the tavern. They had regular consumption of liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 so it is possible this may have been produced at the implicated company.\n\nIn total, 7 females and 6 males aged 4 to 84 years old living within 24 km [15 mi] of Styria, were confirmed as outbreak cases.\n\nAfter the outbreak was confirmed in December [2018], cleaning of the tavern and at the production company was done by sanitation firms, under supervision of the local health authority. Only heat-treated products could be sold until _L. monocytogenes_ was not detected after repeated sampling. No more illnesses were found by the end of December [2018] and the outbreak was declared over.\n\nUse of epidemiological data and WGS-based typing confirmed the local outbreak due to a _Listeria monocytogenes_ IVb-CC4-ST4-CT7652 strain, not previously detected in Austria or anywhere else.\n\nA tavern offers a limited selection of traditional food, especially local meat products and cheese, in a buffet-like manner but has a functioning kitchen including fridge and freezer.\n\nThe researchers said it was possible that the time between food preparation and service might have been long, increasing the possibility for _Listeria_ to multiply. Traditional Austrian meat products such as liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 and jellied pork do not need heating prior to consumption and have been identified as potential risky food due to growth potential for _Listeria_.\n\n[Reference\n----------\n1.

According to the latest info, 26 people across Europe have already contracted the bacteria, 6 of whom have died -- among them 9 people in Estonia, 2 of whom have died, according to a longer story to air on ETV investigative program Pealtn\u00e4gija on Wednesday night [25 Sep 2019].\n\nGenetic analysis ordered by the Veterinary and Food Board (VTA) revealed that the aggressive and contagious ST1247 strain of _Listeria_ can be traced back to the factory owned by M.V.Wool, Estonia's largest fish producer. Bacteria from this specific strain have been found both in the plant's production building as well as from people that have fallen ill.\n\nVTA deputy director general Olev Kalda said that the fish plant is under the watchful eye of inspectors, and each product batch to leave the plant is currently being thoroughly inspected. 'Clearly some fairly innocuous _Listeria monocytogenes_ ended up at that business, possibly 3 or 4 years ago, but it's possible that as a result of insufficient [cleaning] measures, this mutation occurred there and it developed into a persister strain, that is, a strain unique only to that specific place,' Kalda explained.\n\nM.V.Wool factory owner and board chairman Mati Vetevool has categorically denied that the dangerous bacteria came from their factory, pointing the finger instead at Norwegian and Finnish farms from which he claims the bacteria ended up in their plant. 'I absolutely do not agree that these bacteria are our bacteria,' Vetevool said. 'It comes in from the fish farm; it hasn't developed here. We can also end up stuck with a strain originating from a fish farm. Every night, our fish plant is thoroughly washed, and we destroy absolutely all bacteria in the cleaning process. It's not possible that we are poisoning anyone. Nothing of the sort is possible -- this is simply sheer libel.'\n\nAccording to Kalda, however, Vetevool's story doesn't add up. 'The studies show that this specific strain has been found only in products to be produced by this company, it has been found in this company's environment -- that is, in its production facilities, on its production equipment -- but it, as I mentioned, did not enter this company in this form, with this current strain of DNA,' the VTA official said.\n\nLast year [2018], Estonia was hit by an unexpected _Listeria_ outbreak as a result of which 28 people fell ill; it claimed 7 lives. Taavi Riit, head of the Department of Molecular Analysis at the Veterinary and Food Laboratory (VTL), said that based on the latest analyses, some of these cases could be tied to the M.V.Wool specifically.\n\n'Everyone certainly knows that DNA can be used to identify people, specifically in deaths, identify criminals, and identify genetic kinship between individuals,' Riit said. 'This exact principle applies to bacteria as well. We currently have no reason to doubt that this particular producer's products have caused this outbreak.'\n\nListeriosis is a serious transmissible disease caused by the bacteria _L. monocytogenes_, which is especially dangerous to pregnant people, newborns, the elderly, and others with a compromised or weak immune system.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above concerns a multinational European _Listeria_ outbreak associated with contaminated smoked salmon produced by a processing facility in Estonia. When last posted by ProMED-mail in June 2019, there were a total of 22 cases since 2014: Denmark has 9 cases, Estonia 6, Finland 2, France 1, and Sweden 4. Now there are a total of 26 affected people across Europe, 6 of whom have died -- among them 9 people in Estonia, 2 of whom have died.\n\nThe outbreak _Listeria_ strain, ST1247 clonal complex 8, has been found both in the plant's production building as well as from affected people. The strain was also detected at wholesale and retail stores in France, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden from cold smoked or gravad salmon and from 6 batches of cold smoked trout products.

Listeriosis can cause severe illness, including severe sepsis, meningitis and sometimes results in lifelong harm or even death.\n\nTwo of the miscarriages happened in Seville and the other in Madrid. One devastated mother lost her baby at 32 weeks, while the others lost their little ones just 8 weeks into pregnancy. Most of the 197 cases have occurred in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia, but people have fallen ill across the country, from Madrid to the island of Tenerife.\n\nSpanish authorities have said that as many as 5 pregnant women may have lost their babies to the outbreak, and 3 people may have died, but stats are yet to be confirmed. At least 67 people have been hospitalised, the majority in Seville. Of these, 23 are pregnant women who are under antibiotic treatment, and 3 are patients admitted to intensive care units.\n\nAuthorities are investigating whether a pork product sold by Seville-based Magrudis could be the source of the outbreak after several of those struck down were found to have eaten it. The product under investigation is a pack of meat called 'Mecha,' of which a batch of 2000 are thought to be the source of the contamination.\n\nPregnant women are especially vulnerable to listeria, when bacteria may cross the placenta to infect the baby, who has no immunity. Spain's Health Minister Maria Luisa Carcedo said: 'We are monitoring this; alerts have been sent out, and we've ordered that all products (that have come) from this factory since May 2019 be pulled from shelves.' She said an investigation is looking into how the meat evaded what she called 'strict food safety controls.'\n\nA spokesman for the firm said recalls had been put in place and an investigation launched into the possible source.\n\nThe Spanish consumer organisation FACUA warned that the outbreak could get worse, as many people don't show symptoms straight away. It can take up to 4 weeks for people to fall ill.\n\nSpanish officials are also investigating whether a Brit tourist may be the 1st foreign national to become infected with _Listeria_, as an outbreak of the infection is gripping the country's holiday spots. According to local media, the man consumed meat while on holiday in Seville. The man, whose name and age have not been revealed, was later diagnosed with the bacterial infection listeriosis after he arrived in France where he was hospitalised.\n\nListeriosis can cause severe illness, including severe sepsis, meningitis, and sometimes results in lifelong harm or even death.\n\n[Byline: Lucy Domachowski]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The listeriosis outbreak is now reported to extend throughout Spain, although most cases are occurring in Seville.

A 72 year old man with cancer died on Thu 22 Aug 2019. On Tue 20 Aug 2019, a 90 year old woman passed away. Both victims lived in Sevilla, the centre of the outbreak.\n\nAt the moment, there is no confirmation that the man had eaten the La Mecha branded 'carne mechada' that has been traced as the source of the outbreak that has so far affected 186 people. An investigation is under way to determine whether his death from listeriosis is linked. The outbreak has been traced to utensils used in the preparation of the food products.\n\nNow experts say that the bacteria may be present in other products from the Magrudis factory in Sevilla. All its production has been recalled, with experts saying that at least 2 other products are at high risk of having been infected.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Junta de Andalucia regional government, 186 cases of listeriosis have been detected. Of these, 161 have occurred in Andalucia. The bulk (82 per cent) are in the province of Sevilla, with 153 cases. In the last 24 hours, there have been 25 more cases in total.\n\nOf the 99 people in hospital on Fri 23 Aug 2019, 18 have been confirmed as having listeriosis, with 4 in intensive care. The rest are suspected cases and are under observation.\n\nMedical authorities say this strain of the bacterium is particularly virulent, taking 3 days to incubate. Normally, the incubation period is up to 70 days. [The incubation period, that is, the duration it takes for symptoms to develop, varies from 3-70 days, with an estimated median incubation period of 3 weeks. - Mod.ML]\n\n[byline: Dilip Kuner]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 23 Aug 2019\nSource: El Pais [edited]\nhttps://elpais.com/elpais/2019/08/23/inenglish/1566555905_085334.html\n\n\nTests carried out on larding needles used by the Seville-based company Magrudis to make a pork loin product called carne mechada have returned positive results for the presence of the bacteria _Listeria monocytogenes_, according to documents to which El Pais has had access. This confirms that its processing plant is one of the infected sites behind the current outbreak of listeriosis that has so far affected 200 people throughout Spain, most of them in Andalusia.\n\nA 90 year old woman died in the early hours of Monday [19 Aug 2019] in a Seville hospital after having contracted the bacterial infection, while it emerged on Friday [23 Aug 2019] that a terminal cancer patient had died with listeria in his bloodstream. It is not yet clear, however, whether that patient's death was related to the outbreak.\n\nCarne mechada, the product produced by Magrudis that is thought to be behind the outbreak, the biggest ever seen in Spain, is made by cooking pork loin in its own fat. The lard is introduced into the meat using larding needles before it is cooked. It is then usually served cold and in thin slices. The company sells the carne mechada, along with other similar products -- such as lomo, preserved pork loin, and chicharrones, pork belly -- under the brand name La Mecha. Seville City Hall confirmed on Fri 23 Aug 2019 that 2 other La Mecha products have been found to be contaminated: pork loin with sherry, and pork loin with paprika.\n\nSpain issued an international alert on Thu 22 Aug 2019 with European authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) 'given the possibility that cases might be detected in other countries' should tourists visiting the country have consumed the affected products. So far, no cases have been detected outside Spanish territory.\n\nIt also emerged on Fri 23 Aug 2019 that the carne mechada produced by Magrudis had been sold on to a firm called Comercial Martinez Leon for resale with a different brand name. The authorities were not aware of this fact until Tue 20 Aug 2019, 5 days after the initial health alert was raised. These products were in circulation until they were ordered to be withdrawn on Wed 21 Aug 2019.\n\nSamples were taken from the company's production plant last Friday [16 Aug 2019?], and the results were returned on Monday [19 Aug 2019?]. The analysis of the larding needles was the 1st to become public knowledge.\n\n'If the larding needles were contaminated, there is no doubt that other areas of the production line were too,' said Juan Jose Rodriguez, a professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and a member of the Spanish Society of Food Safety. Rodriguez explained that the 'larding needle is an instrument used to fill raw meat, meaning that the bacteria should not survive the roasting process, and the final contamination may have taken place during another moment on the production line.' He added that the results were 'worrying, because they reveal widespread contamination that was unknown to the heads of the company.'\n\nThis new information points to a 2-fold failure in the Magrudis production line, according to experts consulted by El Pais. The 1st, which has now been confirmed, implies a lack of hygiene in the processing plant itself. The 2nd is the failure to detect the contamination of the final meat products, despite existing legislation obliging such producers to carry out tests on at least 5 samples of every batch produced.\n\nThese rules mean that food-production companies must design and execute a plan to guarantee that their products are put on the market with no risks to human health. Each firm has the freedom to carry out such plans however they see fit, but they are subject to regular inspections from the health authorities.\n\nAs well as carne mechada, Magrudis also produces 8 more products at its plant. The regional government in Andalusia, known as the Junta, requested that Seville City Hall carry out tests on these products on Mon 19 Aug 2019 and ordered them to be taken off the market on Wed 21 Aug 2019, a move that sources from the Junta said were precautionary. The central Health Ministry in Madrid advised on Thu 22 Aug 2019 that consumers should not eat any of the products made by the Seville-based firm.\n\nOn Fri 23 Aug 2019, it was reported that 82% of new cases in Andalusia were registered in Seville. In total, there were 99 people receiving hospital treatment, 17 more than on Thu 22 Aug 2019. Of these, 31 are pregnant women. Four people are currently being treated in intensive care, one more than the previous day. Of those in hospital, 18 have been confirmed to have listeriosis, while the remainder of patients are still being tested.\n\nSocial alarm over the listeriosis outbreak has seen emergency rooms in Seville overwhelmed by an increase in potential patients. On Wednesday [21 Aug 2019] night, medical staff from the Virgen del Rocio hospital, one of the biggest in the Andalusian capital, dealt with 100 more people than usual, 23% above the average. The majority had symptoms of the bacterial infection, according to a spokesperson from the Junta committee managing the crisis. The pressure on medical teams is such that doctors are resorting to WhatsApp groups to request help to cover shifts and draft in reinforcements.\n\nDespite extra staff being drafted in, the wait times in the emergency room at Virgen del Rocio on Thu 22 Aug 2019 evening were as high as 4 hours, and the personnel at the hospital were overwhelmed. Zahara Palos, a 28-year-old woman, arrived at 3pm with symptoms of diarrhea and fever. She was not seen by doctors until 7pm. 'I'm desperate,' she complained. 'I want to leave here with a solution.'\n\n[byline: Simon Hunter]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The listeriosis outbreak, which was previously reported to have affected 114 people (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - Europe (07): (Spain) meat, recall, fatal 20190821.6634032), is now said to involve 200 people, in many of whom the diagnosis of listeriosis may be as yet unconfirmed.

'The federal government must know where the weak points are on the local level,' said food and agricultural minister Julia Klockner.

A spokesman said the agency was not aware of any potential recalls related to sausages imported from Germany, and Wilke is not certified as eligible to export to the US.\n\nOther affected nations include Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nProducts made by Wilke have been recalled. German authorities are updating a document with affected products that is now 13 pages long. They can be recognized by the oval identification mark 'DE EV 203 EG,' which identifies the manufacturer regardless of the brand. Items could have been sold loose and to hospital kitchens and canteens.\n\nOfficials in the Waldeck-Frankenberg district of Germany stopped production at the facility in Twistetal, Berndorf in early October [2019]. The company has since filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAccording to the German branch of consumer organization Foodwatch, there was suspicion of _Listeria_ in mid-August [2019] and hygiene deficiencies at the factory found at the end of August [2019], but a follow-up inspection in September [2019] revealed these issues were mostly corrected. The group accused authorities of being too slow in crisis management and not sharing sufficient information.\n\nAtria, a retailer in Sweden, recalled all the dates of 6 products from the Wilke range. None of the salami products have tested positive for _Listeria_. Deli Drengene ApS in Denmark recalled snack sausages, as _Listeria_ was found at the production company in Germany.\n\nIn Luxembourg, some of the products were marketed in catering establishments. Authorities contacted the institutions concerned to check compliance with withdrawal measures, and initial results show recalls have been made. Official samples are being taken to do lab tests on these items. Based on current information, the direct distribution of products to the consumer did not take place.\n\nThe outbreak involves a _Listeria monocytogenes_ sequence cluster type 2521 (serogroup IIa). It was identified last year [2018] by whole-genome sequencing, and 37 people are involved from 12 German states. So far, no related illnesses have been reported from other European countries.\n\nIn 2014, 2016, and 2017, a few sporadic cases were found, which have been retrospectively assigned as belonging to the outbreak. One infection was recorded in 2014, 3 in 2016, and 4 in 2017.\n\nGenome sequences of the _Listeria_ isolates are closely related, so it can be assumed that patients have become infected by a common source, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).\n\nIn mid-2018, there was an increase with 21 cases detected by genome sequencing at RKI. This year, 8 more infections were found with the last known disease onset date being 13 Jul 2019. Most people were infected by eating food in healthcare facilities.\n\nThe age range of affected people is between 31 and 91 years. There are 18 women and 19 men but no pregnancy-related cases. Three people are reported to have died with listeriosis as a contributing factor. Ten other people infected with _Listeria_ died but not as a consequence of listeriosis, and for one patient the cause of death could not be determined.\n\nThe Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) looked at supply chains and food samples. Investigations compared a _Listeria_ isolate from a food of the company near Hesse with patient isolates of the outbreak, finding a close relationship between them.\n\nIn 2018, 701 reports of invasive listeriosis in Germany were submitted to the RKI.\n\nElderly and immunocompromised people, expectant mothers, and newborn babies have an increased risk of contracting listeriosis. Symptoms of the infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. The time between becoming infected and developing symptoms varies from a few to 70 days with an average of 3 weeks.\n\n[Byline: Joe Whitworth]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news reports above describe a listeriosis outbreak that has affected 40 people, 3 of whom have died, in 12 German states between 2014 and 2019, due to _Listeria_-contaminated meat products manufactured at a processing facility in the German state of Hesse and widely distributed to more than 20 European countries, Switzerland, Russia, Lebanon, Japan, and possibly the US.

Authorities have closed the pork meat supplier's plant and recalled all of its products. Cisneros said roughly half of the 114 people affected by the bacteria remain hospitalized.\n\nHealth minister Maria Luisa Carcedo said an investigation is looking into how the meat evaded what she called 'strict food safety controls'.\n\nListeria is a bacteria that usually causes mild illness in healthy people but can be dangerous to pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The listeriosis outbreak, which was previously reported to have affected 44 people mainly in the cities of Huelva and Seville (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - Europe (06): (Spain) meat, recall, alert 20190817.6627473), is now said to involve 114 people.\n\nHuelva, with a population of 144 258 residents, is a city located along the Gulf of Cadiz coast in south western Spain in the autonomous community of Andalusia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huelva). Seville, with a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million, is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Andalusia, located about 80 km (50 mi) inland from the Gulf of Cadiz coast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville).

Adequate cooking of the meat before eating should have markedly reduced the risk for listeriosis. However, refrigerated ready-to-eat cold cut meats are well-recognized sources for listeriosis. Even if initial contamination added only a few listeria organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _Listeria monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to sufficient number to cause disease. Refrigerated ready-to-eat meat products should not be served to people who are likely to be at increased risk for listeriosis, such as pregnant women, adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems.\n\nThe meat ('La Mecha' made by the Magrudis company, based in Seville) suspected to be the source has been recalled, but because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop, more cases can be expected.\n\nIn the USA and Europe, clusters of related cases are identified based on clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_ that have similar genotypes.

Rosemount cooked diced chicken was supplied to institutions (including cafeterias, hospitals and nursing homes) where many of the individuals who became sick resided or visited before becoming ill.\n\nOn [18 Aug 2019] the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) issued a food recall warning for Rosemount brand cooked diced chicken meat '13mm - \u00bd' (hash 16305), packdate - 01/21/2019'. During the food safety investigation, the CFIA identified additional affected products, and updated food recall warnings have been issued. For additional details on all recalled product names and lot codes, please consult CFIA's website.\n\nCanadians are advised not to eat any of the recalled products or any foods containing the recalled products. Food service establishments are advised not to sell or serve any recalled products, or any items that may have been prepared or produced using recalled products.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, and it is possible that more products linked to the outbreak investigation will be identified. The CFIA is continuing its food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated food recall warnings.\n\nThis public health notice will be updated as the investigation evolves.\n\nInvestigation summary\n---------------------\nAs of [23 Aug 2019], there have been 7 confirmed cases of _Listeria monocytogenes_ illness in 3 provinces: British Columbia (1), Manitoba (1) and Ontario (5). Individuals became sick between November 2017 and June 2019. A total of 6 individuals have been hospitalized. Individuals who became ill are between 51 and 97 years of age. The majority of cases (86%) are female.\n\nThe collaborative outbreak investigation was initiated because of an increase of listeria illnesses that were reported in June 2019. Through the use of a laboratory method called whole genome sequencing, 2 listeria illnesses from November 2017 were identified to have the same genetic strain as the illnesses that occurred between April and June 2019. It is possible that more recent illnesses may be reported in the outbreak because of the period of time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported to public health officials. In national _Listeria monocytogenes_ outbreak investigations, the reporting time period is usually between 4 and 6 weeks.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also investigating an outbreak of listeria illnesses occurring in several states. The type of listeria identified in the USA is closely related genetically (by whole genome sequencing) to the listeria making people sick in Canada. Canada and US public health and food safety partners are collaborating on these ongoing investigations.\n\nEpidemiological information\n---------------------------\nFigure 1 [at the source URL] is an epidemiological curve for this outbreak. This information is used by outbreak investigators to show when illnesses begin, when they peak, and when they trail off. It can take several weeks from the time a person becomes ill to when the illness is reported and testing confirms a link to the outbreak. Data are available for 7 cases.\n\n[The Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health Notice above has been abridged.

CDC is not recommending that consumers avoid any particular food at this time. Restaurants and retailers are not advised to avoid serving or selling any particular food. We will update our advice if a source is identified.\n\nLatest outbreak information:\n- Reported cases: 24\n- States: 13\n- Hospitalizations: 22\n- Deaths: 2\n\nA total of 24 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 13 states. Of 23 ill people with information available, 22 hospitalizations have been reported. In addition, 2 deaths have been reported.\n\n_Listeria_ specimens were collected from ill people from 20 Jul 2017 to 1 Aug 2019. Ill people range in age from 35 to 92 years, with a median age of 72. Sixty-three per cent of ill people are female.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada is also investigating an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections in several Canadian provinces linked to cooked diced chicken. Whole genome sequencing showed that the type of listeria making people sick in Canada is closely related genetically to the listeria making people sick in the USA.\n\nState and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures they had before their illness started. CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.\n\n[The CDC Investigation Notice above has been abridged. The complete report is available at the source URL. - Mod.ML]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the USA and Canada, clusters of possibly related cases are identified based on genotypes of their clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ that match. In the USA, these isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the listeria case report from patients in the cluster to identify a common food source.\n\nOnce a cluster is identified, PulseNet also works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as a common source.\n\nIn Canada, a cluster of 7 cases, aged 51 to 97 years, of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection, identified by whole genome sequencing, occurred in 3 provinces between November 2017 and June 2019. Cooked diced chicken from 2 producers has been recalled and is identified as a likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn the USA, a cluster of 24 cases, aged 35 to 92 years, of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection, identified based on whole genome sequencing, occurred in 13 states between July 2017 to August 2019. The outbreak strain of listeria identified in the USA is closely related genetically by whole genome sequencing to the Canadian outbreak strain. However, the specific food item has not been identified as yet in the USA as the source of the infections.\n\nWe await further developments as the investigations proceed. Because of delays in reporting and the long incubation period of listeriosis of up to 70 days after exposure to listeria for symptoms to develop, more cases can be expected. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106\nCanada: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12]", "summary": "\n\nLatest outbreak information:\n- Reported cases: 24\n- States: 13\n- Hospitalizations: 22\n- Deaths: 2\n\nA total of 24 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 13 states. \nBrand name / Common name / Size / UPC / Code(s) on product\n- Reuven International Ltd / Natural Proportion Cooked Chicken Meat (Diced) (hash 15307) / 4.54 kg / 907 63572 15307 1 / Packdate: 21 Jan 2019\n- Reuven International Ltd / Natural Proportion Cooked Chicken Meat (Diced) (hash 15807) / 4.54 kg / 907 63572 15807 6 / Packdate: 21 Jan 2019\n- Sysco / Natural Proportions Cooked Shredded Chicken (hash 15885) / A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\n ML]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the USA and Canada, clusters of possibly related cases are identified based on genotypes of their clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ that match.

The 3 cases happened in different states.\n\nLocal media reports that the contamination is believed to originate in Tasmania, which produces most Australian salmon.\n\nHealth officials warned people most at risk to avoid certain foods.\n\nThe people who died were both aged above 70 [years] and had underlying health conditions, said Australia's chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy.\n\nThe Tasmanian government said the state's salmon producers had been cleared of food safety breaches following the _Listeria_ cases in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.\n\nOfficials said pregnant women, the elderly, infants, and those with weakened immune systems were most at risk of severe symptoms. 'This is a timely reminder for people to ensure that food is handled, prepared and stored safely, and that those most at-risk of listeriosis avoid certain foods,' Prof Murphy said in a statement on Wednesday [24 Jul 2019].\n\nWhat is listeriosis? It can be caught from food containing _Listeria_ bacteria, or close contact with farm animals. Cases usually involve unpasteurised milk or dairy products, such as Camembert and brie. Pre-packed foods, including sandwiches and pate, can also contain _Listeria_. Symptoms include high temperature, flu-like symptoms, vomiting and diarrhoea. Most people infected display no symptoms, but elderly and very young people are vulnerable.\n\nLast year [2018], a _Listeria_ outbreak traced to rockmelons killed 7 people across Australia. Other nations have also seen recent outbreaks.

Some of these people were hospitalized. As reported by the Ministry, the alert has been issued after verifying that this product, manufactured by the Magrudis firm, domiciled in Seville, is the causative agent of the listeriosis outbreak. The health alert, activated after the development of the protocols and the appropriate inspections, means the withdrawal of said product from the sale and consumption.\n\nThe company that manufactures this meat, which according to the Ministry has maintained a close collaboration with Public Health during the investigation, has already communicated these facts to its clients.\n\nThe meat company La Mecha reported on Thursday [15 Aug 2019] that it has found anomalies in some items: 'After having detected anomalies in the preparation of some batches of our product, Mecha meat, La Mecha brand, we communicate that said product should not be consumed by our customers or final consumers.'\n\nListeriosis is an infection caused by bacteria that may be present in uncooked meats.

Adequate cooking of the meat before eating should have markedly reduced the risk for listeriosis. However, refrigerated ready-to-eat cold cut meats are well-recognized sources for listeriosis. Even if initial contamination added only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _Listeria monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to sufficient number to cause disease.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late [Wed 17 Apr 2019] announced a state and federal investigation into the _Listeria_ outbreak is underway.\n\nBoth the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have joined the effort.\n\n_Listeria_ specimens from ill people were collected from [13 Nov 2016], through [4 Mar 2019]. People confirmed with _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections range in age from 40 to 88 years, with a median age of 57 [years]. 38 percent are female. All 8 confirmed patients were hospitalized. Michigan officials reported 1 patient in their state died.\n\nEpidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that deli-sliced meats and cheeses might be contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_ and could make people sick, according to the CDC.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the 4 weeks before they became ill. Of 6 patients who have been interviewed by public health officials, 5 reported eating products sliced at a deli counter, including meats and cheeses. Delis where ill people shopped served many different brands of products and there is limited information available about the brands' ill people bought.\n\nFSIS and FDA evaluated records state inspectors collected from delis where the ill people ate to determine whether a common meat or cheese product was served at the delis. The analysis of the available documentation could not identify a common product. The FSIS and FDA will continue to assist with the investigation should additional information become available.\n\nThe outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_ has been identified in samples from meat sliced at a deli, and from deli counters in multiple retail locations in New York and Rhode Island. Whole genome sequencing showed that the _Listeria_ strain from these samples is closely related genetically to the _Listeria_ strain from ill people. This result provides more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating deli-sliced products. At this time, the investigation has not identified a common product that was sliced or prepared in the delis.\n\nCDC's advice to consumers and retailers\n---------------------------------------\n- People who are at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection should avoid eating lunch meats, cold cuts, or other deli meats unless they are heated to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] just before serving.\n- If you develop symptoms of a _Listeria_ infection after eating deli-sliced products, contact a healthcare provider and tell them you ate deli-sliced products. This is especially important if you are pregnant, age 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system.\n- If you have eaten deli-sliced products and do not have any symptoms of a _Listeria_ infection, most experts believe that tests or treatment are not needed, even for people who have a higher chance of _Listeria_ infection.\n- _Listeria_ bacteria can survive at very low temperatures and can spread easily to other foods and surfaces. Consumers should clean refrigerators, kitchen countertops, utensils, and other surfaces that touch deli-sliced products.\n\nYou can take steps to prevent _Listeria_ infection\n--------------------------------------------------\n- Don't let juice from lunch meat and hot dog packages get on other foods, utensils, and food preparation surfaces.\n- Wash hands after handling deli meats, lunch meats, deli cheeses, and hot dogs.\n- Store opened packages of meat sliced at a local deli no longer than 3 to 5 days in the refrigerator.\n- Retailers should clean and sanitize deli slicers frequently and other areas where deli products are prepared, stored or served. Staff should follow the manufacturer's recommendations for sanitizer strength and application to ensure they [are] effective.\n- Regularly clean food contact surfaces, equipment, and utensils in direct contact with deli products, such as cutting boards, tables, cheese slicers, and knives.\n- Make sure food contact surfaces, such as cutting boards, are smooth, sealed, non-porous, and easily cleanable.\n- The FDA website has printable materials and more information about sanitizing commercial deli slicers [https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/IndustryandRegulatoryAssistanceandTrainingResources/ucm240554.htm].\n- CDC will update the advice to consumers and retailers if more information comes available, such as a supplier or type of deli product linked to illness.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the USA and Europe, the CDC identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes based of whole genome sequencing.

It builds on an assessment from March this year [2019] when 18 cases were identified. At that time, the Estonian fish processor, a firm called MV Wool, denied the link.\n\nOutbreak cases yearly since 2014: Denmark has 9 cases, Estonia 6, Finland 2, France 1, and Sweden 4. The 1st case had symptom onset in July 2014 in Estonia. The most recent occurred in Denmark in February this year [2019].\n\n'Outbreak cases have been reported every year since 2014, with a small clustering of cases between the end of 2015, 2016, and 2018, and the start of the following year. Estonia, Finland, and Sweden reported cases in the 1st 2 years of this outbreak; since January 2017, all cases with the exception of 1 case in France in 2018 have been reported in Estonia and Denmark,' according to ECDC.\n\nOut of 12 patients for whom a food consumption history was available, 8 confirmed eating cold-smoked fish products.\n\nInformation on age and gender is available for 20 patients, with the median age being 76 years; most are older than 50, except for 1 neonatal case reported in 2014. 11 patients are male and 9 are female.\n\nFood and environmental investigations: _L. monocytogenes_ food isolates, matching the human outbreak strain by WGS, were detected at wholesale and retail level in France, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden from 13 batches of cold smoked or gravad salmon and from 6 batches of cold smoked trout products.\n\nIn 16 batches, _Listeria_ was detected at less than 10 colony forming units per gram (cfu/g), in one batch at less than 40 cfu/g, and in 2 cold-smoked trout batches, it was enumerated at 400 cfu/g and 570 cfu/g.\n\nTraceability information pointed to the Estonian firm MV Wool as the common manufacturer of fish products. Raw fish was received from suppliers in Norway and Finland.\n\nAs of [20 Mar 2019], the processing company can only release cold-smoked and salted fish products after the verification of 'absence of _L. monocytogenes_ in 25 gram', following a request from the Estonian authority.\n\nEnvironmental investigations and food testing at the Estonian processing plant showed _L. monocytogenes_ that matched the outbreak strain in 2 samples on the processing line and in 4 batches of final product.\n\n'The presence of _L. monocytogenes_ matching the outbreak strain over several years in the fish products suggests the persistence of the microorganism at the Estonian company's premises.

Cold-smoked fish products imported from Estonia are the source of the long-lasting outbreak, which had made 9 people sick and linked to 2 deaths since 2016.\n\nStatens Serum Institut (SSI), the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestyrelsen), and DTU Food - National Food Institute reported that 2 of the 9 cases that became ill with the same type of _Listeria_ were in 2019. Luise Muller from SSI told Food Safety News that the 1st case fell sick in December 2016; 5 cases were reported in 2017, one in 2018, and 2 in 2019.\n\n'_Listeria_ found in product from the Danish importer is produced in Estonia; we don't know what happened in the production facilities there. We know it is at the Estonian producer, as it is not handled or repackaged in Denmark; it is only relabelled and sent to the Danish consumer. We cannot exclude that more cases could come, due to the long incubation period of listeriosis [up to 70 days],' Muller said.\n\nCold-smoked fish products have now been recalled by 2 Danish retailers. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration advised consumers that the items should be discarded or returned to the store where they were purchased.\n\nThe Danish importer, Food With You, issued a recall of smoked trout after _Listeria_ was found. All dates of 'Vores Koldroget Roget Orred,' 200 g [7 oz], sold at Bilka and Fotex across the country, are affected. Dagrofa also recalled smoked trout due to the presence of _Listeria_. All dates from 14-27 Mar 2019 of Blue Ocean roget orred, 200 g [7 oz], sold at Meny stores throughout Denmark are involved.\n\nPatients include 4 women and 5 men aged 52-90 years who are spread across the country. Two people died. All patients in the outbreak had serious illnesses that put them at high risk for serious infections.\n\n'We know they died within 30 days from the positive test for listeriosis, but since they are all immuno-suppressed people or people with underlying disease, we don't know if they died from listeriosis,' said Muller.\n\nBased on interviews with patients and after finding _Listeria_ in samples taken from the Danish importer, the source of infection was traced to cold-smoked trout and salmon produced in Estonia. These items were sold in Denmark through 2 retailers: Salling Group and Dagrofa.\n\nMuller said whole-genome sequencing was used in the investigation.\n\n'The outbreak was declared in January 2017 when we had 3 matching cases. It is a part of our regular surveillance that we sub-type all human isolates to see if any of them are within the same cluster, and we interview all patients with listeriosis in Denmark regardless of the subtyping. So all this information has been revised along the way, but it is not until now that we have the exact source,' she said.\n\n'We are in dialogue with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and other countries to find out if there are any human cases or findings from food isolates in other countries, but this is ongoing at the moment.'\n\n[Byline: Joe Whitworth]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 21 Mar 2019\nSource: SalmonBusiness [edited]\nhttps://salmonbusiness.com/danish-agency-traces-fatal-listeria-outbreak-to-estonian-fish-processor/\n\n\nIn a call to SalmonBusiness, a spokesperson for the authority confirmed it believes it has traced an outbreak of listeriosis from 3 years ago to its source. The agency alleges that fish from Estonian company M.V.Wool are behind [the outbreak].\n\nThe prolonged _Listeria_ outbreak has been confirmed by Statens Serum Institut (SSI), the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, and the DTU Food Institute in a press release. The outbreak included 9 people aged 52-90 who, since 2016, have become ill with the same type of _Listeria_, including 2 people who died in 2019.\n\nAn inspection from September of 2018 showed that the Estonian processor's smoked trout products showed a _Listeria_ contamination of 40-570 units, while the maximum is 100.\n\nBased on interviews with patients and after finding _Listeria_ in samples taken from the Danish importer, the source of infection has been designated to be cold-smoked trout and salmon products produced in Estonia. The product -- Blue Ocean roget orred 200 g [7 oz] -- were sold in Denmark through 2 Danish supermarket chains, Salling Group and Dagrofa. Denmark sent Estonia a message through the European food and feed safety alerts system, according to which it has ordered a recall of M.V.Wool's frozen smoked fish products through its Danish reseller.\n\nLuise Muller from SSI told Food Safety News that '_Listeria_ was found in product from the Danish importer, which is produced in Estonia; we don't know what happened in the production facilities there. We know it is at the Estonian producer, as it is not handled or repackaged in Denmark; it is only relabelled and sent to the Danish consumer. We cannot exclude that more cases could come due to the long incubation period of listeriosis [up to 70 days],' Muller said.\n\nSalmonBusiness spoke to a representative from M.V.Wool who strongly disagreed with the accusation. This publication has sent the company several follow-up questions about the Danish authorities' findings.\n\n[Byline: Owen Evans]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This outbreak illustrates the power of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) performed on _Listeria_ isolated from ill persons to identify a cluster of cases that have a common source, as well as the power of WGS performed on suspected food and environmental isolates to confirm the source.

Listeriosis is a relatively rare but potentially severe food-borne disease that has been reported in increasing numbers in the EU/EEA countries since 2008. In 2016, 2536 cases were reported, including 247 deaths.

However, the trend has been upward over the past 5 years. The group most affected by the disease in 2017 was the elderly, particularly those over 84. In this age group, the listeriosis fatality rate was 24%, while overall in the EU, the infection was fatal for one in every 10 patients.

But in the CDC's Emerging Infectious Diseases issue for [March 2019], a _Listeria monocytogenes_ outbreak associated with pasteurized chocolate milk in Ontario, Canada is the subject (1). That outbreak took place from [November 2015] through [June 2016].\n\nThe article states that listeriosis outbreak[s] associated with pasteurized milk are rare in North America, but, like all foods, dairy products can be contaminated with pathogens after pasteurization.\n\nA study conducted in the U.S. reviewed 83 fluid milk-associated outbreaks from 1990 to 2006; only one was attributed to _Listeria monocytogenes_ (2).\n\n[In the referenced journal article (1)], 34 people were sickened during this outbreak, but only people who lived in Ontario were studied. Illness onset dates ranged from [14 Nov 2015] through [14 Feb 2019] [sic, 14 Feb 2016]. A 2nd wave of illnesses occurred during the time frame of [11 Apr to 20 Jun 2016].\n\nPublic health officials considered several other foods during the initial investigation. The 1st [thought] was leafy greens were the problem, since a _Listeria monocytogenes_ outbreak associated with that food was ongoing in the U.S. and Canada at that time. Cheddar cheese was suspected, but the investigation ruled out that food. Finally, investigators suspected coleslaw, but that was ruled out too.\n\nFinally, investigators isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ from expired bagged chocolate milk collected from the home of one patient. The outer packaging was discarded, so officials weren't sure of the brand name. The investigation revealed that exposure to pasteurized milk was reported by 60% of case patients in the 1st wave, and 75% in the 2nd wave.\n\nOn [3 Jun 2016], a retail sample of brand B chocolate milk produced at facility C was confirmed positive for _Listeria monocytogenes_. The brand was recalled. Isolates from the original sample and 3 positive samples of chocolate milk matched the outbreak strain by PFGE and whole genome sequencing. Investigators found the outbreak strain within a post pasteurization pump dedicated to chocolate milk.\n\nThe conclusions of this study [were] that more attention should be given to the design of equipment and maintenance programs. _Listeria monocytogenes_ can be persistent in an environment, and 'harborage sites' that contain the pathogen can be undetected by routine monitoring. Officials stressed the importance of obtaining thoroughly food histories and collecting food that patients ate or drank during the incubation period. Finally, officials also stated that any food product sold in bags, especially food with an inner and outer bag, should be labeled on both bags to facilitate traceback.\n\n(1).

Finally, officials also stated that any food product sold in bags, especially food with an inner and outer bag, should be labeled on both bags to facilitate traceback. Usually, when we write about an outbreak associated with milk, the subject is raw milk. Isolates from the original sample and 3 positive samples of chocolate milk matched the outbreak strain by PFGE and whole genome sequencing. The article states that listeriosis outbreak[s] associated with pasteurized milk are rare in North America, but, like all foods, dairy products can be contaminated with pathogens after pasteurization. In past listeriosis outbreaks, _Listeria_ contamination of food products occurred in parts of the machinery 'well beyond the [manufacturer's] recommended sanitation process' and was 'found only after the devices were completely disassembled' (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/maple-leaf-eyes-meat-slicers-in-outbreak/article1060898/).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2006-03-26 00:00:00", "2019-03-26 00:00:00", "2019-02-14 00:00:00", "2016-02-14 00:00:00", "2015-11-26 00:00:00", "2016-06-26 00:00:00", "1990-03-26 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "cheddar", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ontario", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6294098", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - USA: ready-to-eat pork patties, end of outbreak", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6294098", "date": "2019-02-04 12:50:01", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - USA: READY-TO-EAT PORK PATTIES, END OF OUTBREAK\n*************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 31 Jan 2019\nSource: Barfblog [edited]\nhttps://www.barfblog.com/2019/01/4-sickened-outbreak-of-listeria-linked-to-pork-products/\n\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control reports that an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections linked to pork products produced by Long Phung Food Products appears to be over.\n\nOn [20 Nov 2018], 165368 C Corporation of Houston, Texas, doing business as Long Phung Food Products, recalled ready-to-eat pork products because they might have been contaminated with _Listeria_ bacteria.\n\nDo not eat, sell, or serve recalled products from Long Phung Food Products.

Health officials are working to identify if there is a common food source linked to the increase in cases.\n\nListeriosis is usually transmitted through food, especially long-life foods that are refrigerated and eaten without further heat treatment. Many of these food products are popular as Christmas foods and can be found at many Christmas parties.\n\nPeople in the risk groups for listeriosis (i.e., pregnant women, persons with impaired immune systems, and the elderly with impaired general condition) should, as usual, avoid food products that may pose a risk to _Listeria_ infection, says consultant Hans Blystad at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.\n\nExamples of such food products are\n- Rakfisk;\n- Products made from unpasteurized milk; and\n- Soft and semi-soft cheeses, such as brie, camembert, and other molds, whether or not they are made from pasteurized milk.\n\nConsumption of food contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_ can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.\n\nListeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn.\n\nIn addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within 2 months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the healthcare provider about eating the contaminated food.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hedmark is a county in southeastern Norway, bordering Sweden to the east and Oppland to the west. Hedmark is one of the less urbanized areas in Norway; about half of the inhabitants live on rural land (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedmark). Hedmark and Oppland are the only Norwegian counties with no coastline.

Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk are other frequent sources of listeriosis. However, the source in some outbreaks has been contamination with _Listeria_ only after pasteurization.\n\nSerotyping of _L. monocytogenes_ strains, based on variations in the somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens, has determined that only 3 (1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b) of the 12 serotypes of _L. monocytogenes_ cause 95% of human cases; serotype 4b is most commonly associated with outbreaks (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/pdf/listeriainitiativeoverview_508.pdf).

'They have tracked it to facility, which provides meals on wheels,' Heidi Murphy explained.' They have closed the facility until they are satisfied it is safe.'\n\nThe potentially deadly contamination made headlines last year [2018] after being linked to rockmelon nationwide.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 22 Feb 2019\nSource: The Age [edited]\nhttps://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/meals-on-wheels-service-hit-with-listeria-outbreak-20190222-p50zlp.html\n\n\nA woman has died and thousands of people are at risk of _Listeria_ infection after the bacteria was detected in food from a southeast Melbourne catering company that supplies food to hospitals, aged care homes and Meals on Wheels.\n\nThe catering service 'I Cook Foods' has been shut down after the woman, who was in her 80s and from the eastern suburbs, died in Knox Private Hospital on 4 Feb 2019. The woman contracted a listeria-related illness while in hospital after being admitted for an unrelated condition in late January [2019], a health department spokesman said.\n\nA total of 6 positive samples of _Listeria_ were found at the company's Dandenong South kitchen during an investigation into the cause of the woman's death over the past 2 weeks. The I Cook Foods kitchen provides meals to patients at private hospitals including St Vincent's, Frankston and Knox, as well as Mercy aged-care homes and many Meals on Wheels providers across the state [Victoria, Australia].\n\nVictoria's acting Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said the potentially contaminated food was in circulation until Thursday night [21 Feb 2019?], meaning people may have been eating the food on Friday [22 Feb 2019?] morning. 'People who might've eaten it [on Thursday] or in recent weeks might still develop illness,' Dr Sutton said. 'Potentially thousands of people have been exposed. I don't want to see any more [deaths].' People who may have eaten the food have been urged to be alert for early flulike signs of the bacteria, which can cause blood poisoning and meningitis.\n\nSt Vincent's confirmed the 'potential receipt of listeria-contaminated food from a catering provider,' saying an alternative food source had been organised. In a statement, St Vincent's said its hospitals at Kew and East Melbourne had discarded all potentially contaminated food, and had started compiling a list of patients who had eaten the food between 13 Jan and 21 Feb [2019]. The hospital said it would begin contacting all patients immediately, prioritising elderly persons, noting the 'potential delay in _Listeria_ symptom development.'\n\nMelbourne Private, Knox Private, Frankston Private, Holmesglen and North Park private hospitals have also been affected. All the hospitals are run by Healthscope, which confirmed on Friday [22 Feb 2019] afternoon that aged care facilities at Ivanhoe and Clayton South had also been hit.\n\nAll affected sites have been ordered to throw out remaining food from 'I Cook Foods.' Dr. Sutton said health authorities were taking no risks in ensuring the potential outbreak was contained. 'We're taking an abundance of precaution ... this was a production facility for so many vulnerable people,' he said. Healthscope said all food deliveries from 'I Cook Foods' had been thrown out and any patients who may have eaten a contaminated meal were being contacted. Acting chief health officer Brett Sutton says one-third of people who are infected can die of [listeriosis] and the elderly or pregnant women are at risk.\n\nDr. Sutton said the health department was taking all necessary steps to ensure 'I Cook Foods' passed all tests before reopening. He said this could take weeks. Dr. Sutton was reluctant to lay blame at the feet of 'I Cook Foods,' saying an investigation was underway to determine exactly which part of the food-handling process was at fault for spreading the bacteria. He said potential compensation for relatives of the woman would be a matter for the caterer, adding the family was being supported by authorities in the wake of the tragic incident.\n\n[Listeriosis's] gestation period is about 2 weeks [actually, listeriosis has a long incubation period of up to 70 days. - Mod.ML], according to health authorities, meaning those who have eaten the supplier's food in the past fortnight are particularly at risk. Dr. Sutton said the bacteria was usually found in foods such as soft cheeses, sliced meats and fruits.\n\nThe department has started alerting other catering companies that their food may be contaminated. Yarra Ranges Council told The Age it had contacted about 100 people who received Meals on Wheels supplied by 'I Cook Foods' and told them to throw out the meals. Knox City Council said it had begun assisting Meals on Wheels customers with disposing of any food received since 13 Jan [2019], providing _Listeria_ fact sheets detailing symptoms.\n\nThough Mercy Place Rosebud was supplied with contaminated meals, none of the residents have fallen ill. 'No one's sick and all we had to do was get rid of the food,' a spokesperson for the aged care provider said. 'We would have known in a few hours if they'd had _Listeria_ so luckily it's all under control here. They'll just have a new menu for a few days while we find an alternative.'\n\nI Cook Foods did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n_Listeria_ is rare, but it can be extremely dangerous -- particularly to pregnant women and the elderly. Symptoms include fever, tiredness, aches and pains and headaches, but the infection can become life-threatening if not treated appropriately. Last year [2018] 6 people died and one woman miscarried after a [listeriosis] outbreak linked with rockmelon grown in NSW. There have been 2 cases of listeriosis in Victoria this year [2019] compared with 2 in the same period last year [2018], with 27 in total during 2018.\n\n'I Cook Foods' provides meals to the following organizations:\nMEALS ON WHEELS -- City of Ballarat, City of Booroondara, City of Whitehorse, Glen Eira Council, Kingston Council, Knox City Council, Monash Council, Yarra Ranges Council.\nHOSPITALS -- Frankston Private, Holmesglen Private, Knox Private, Melbourne Private, Northbank Private, St Vincent's East Melbourne, St Vincent's Kew.\nAGED CARE HOMES -- Fairway Hostel Aged Care Sandringham, Healthscope Independent Living Moorabbin, Mercy Health Ballarat, Mercy Health Rosebud, Yallambee Aged Care Traralgon.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news reports above report the death of an elderly woman with listeriosis after hospitalization in late January 2019 for an unrelated condition.

These items were shipped to distributors and retail locations nationwide.\n\nAdvice\n------\n- Return any recalled pork products to the store for a refund or throw them away. Even if some of the product was eaten and no one got sick, do not eat it. If you do not know if the pork product you purchased was recalled, ask the place where you purchased it or throw it away.\n- Wash and sanitize drawers or shelves in refrigerators and freezers where recalled pork products were stored. Follow the 5 steps [at https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/clean-refrigerator-steps.html] to clean your refrigerator.\n- Retailers should clean and sanitize deli slicers and other areas where recalled pork products were prepared, stored, or served. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for sanitizer strength and application to ensure it is effective.\n- If you develop symptoms of a _Listeria_ infection after eating recalled pork products, contact a healthcare provider and tell them you ate recalled pork products. This is especially important if you are pregnant, age 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system.\n\nLatest outbreak information\n---------------------------\n- 4 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 4 states.\n- _Listeria_ specimens from ill people were collected from [1 Jul 2017], to [24 Oct 2018].\n- 4 people have been hospitalized.

Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products recalled ready-to-eat pork products because they might be contaminated with _Listeria_.\n- This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\nGeneral _Listeria_ information\n------------------------------\n- If you have eaten recalled pork products and do not have any symptoms of a _Listeria_ infection, most experts believe that tests or treatment are not needed, even for people who have a higher chance of _Listeria_.\n- In general, people who are at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection should not eat refrigerated pate or meat spreads from a deli or meat counter or from the refrigerated section of a store. Avoid eating hot dogs, lunch meats, cold cuts, other deli meats (such as bologna), or fermented or dry sausages unless they are heated to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] or until steaming hot just before serving.\n- Foods that do not need refrigeration, like canned or shelf-stable pate and meat spreads, are safe to eat. Refrigerate these foods after opening.\n- Learn more about how you can take steps to prevent _Listeria_ infection.\n\nSymptoms of _Listeria_ infection\n--------------------------------\n- Listeriosis can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the person and the part of the body affected.\n- Pregnant women: pregnant women typically experience only fever and other flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle aches. However, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn.\n- People other than pregnant women: symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions in addition to fever and muscle aches.\n- People with invasive listeriosis usually report symptoms starting 1 to 4 weeks after eating food contaminated with _Listeria_; some people have reported symptoms starting as late as 70 days after exposure or as early as the same day of exposure. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics.\n- Pregnant women and their newborns, adults age 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get sick with listeriosis.\n\nInvestigation details\n---------------------\n21 Nov 2018\n-----------\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections.\n\nPublic health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a technique called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS performed on bacteria isolated from ill people showed that they were closely relatedly genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.\n\nAs of [20 Nov 2018], 4 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from four states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page [at https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/porkproducts-11-18/map.html].\n\n_Listeria_ specimens from ill people were collected from [1 Jul 2017 to 24 Oct 2018]. Ill people range in age from 35 to 84 years, with a median age of 60 years. All 4 ill people are female, and all 4 ill people were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 10 weeks. Please see the Timeline for Reporting Cases of _Listeria_ Infection for more details.\n\nInvestigation of the outbreak\n-------------------------------------\nEpidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that pork products from 165368 C. Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products in Houston, TX is a likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the 4 weeks before they became ill. 4 people were interviewed and all 4 reported eating Asian-style foods. 3 ill people reported shopping at stores where Long Phung Food Products are sold.\n\nWhole genome sequencing results of samples collected at the Long Phung Food Products facility showed that _Listeria_ identified in the facility was closely related genetically to _Listeria_ from ill people. These results provide more evidence that ill people became sick from eating contaminated pork products.\n\nOn [20 Nov 2018], 165368 C. Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products recalled ready-to-eat pork products (https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2018/recall-116-2018-release) because they might be contaminated with _Listeria_ bacteria. Recalled pork products were produced from [21 May 2018], through [16 Nov 2018]. Consumers should return them to the store for a refund or throw them away. Restaurants and retailers should not serve or sell recalled Long Phung Food products.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Listeria_-contaminated, refrigerated ready-to eat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon or cold cut meats, like ham or pork, are well-recognized sources for listeriosis, due to the fact that _Listeria_ is able to multiply at refrigerator temperatures.\n\nAn epidemiologic investigation has identified 4 confirmed cases of listeriosis, in 4 states linked to ready-to-eat pork patties.

Seven people died, and one case resulted in a miscarriage.\n\nGovernment officials said the outbreak was linked to one grower named as Rombola Family Farms (RFF), based in Nericon in the state.\n\nThe strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ that caused infections was related by whole genome sequencing to isolates from samples taken from 37 rockmelons from the farm. _Listeria_ also was found on the floor around the melon packing area and from a composite swab of washed melons. All _Listeria_-positives were identified as the outbreak strain.\n\nRockmelons are grown off the ground on plastic sheeting but are in the open farm environment and subject to rain, wind and other natural contamination.\n\nA NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) report found that hygiene and sanitation practices at Rombola Family Farms were on par with, or better than, most other rockmelon growers in Australia.\n\nAdverse weather events listed as heavy rainfall in December 2017 prior to harvest, followed by dust storms, were blamed for increasing the organic load and amount of _Listeria_ on rockmelons prior to harvest. Another issue is the netted skin of the fruit, making it harder to clean and sanitize.\n\n'Prior to the detection of the outbreak, RFF utilized a one minute and 30-40 second pre-wash and scrubbing step to reduce organic load, followed by a 35 second sanitizing step of 100 ppm chlorine sprays and scrubbing,' said the NSW DPI report.\n\n'It is likely that the 35 seconds at 100 ppm sanitizing step was effective in reducing _Listeria monocytogenes_ to a very low level, but these levels still resulted in illness when rockmelons were consumed by immunocompromised individuals.'\n\nWash water was not recirculated; sanitizer was constantly monitored and applied through an auto-dosing system, and all water coming into the facility was treated and considered potable, the report says.\n\nDirty fans used to reduce moisture levels on melons after washing and some spongy material on packing tables that was not easily cleaned may have been contributing factors to the outbreak but are not considered to be major underlying causes, investigators reported.\n\nNSW Food Authority inspections found that there was an opportunity for introduction of _Listeria_ after washing through contact with surfaces or equipment that may have had traces of the pathogen. This included dust blown from fans to dry the fruit after washing and from porous material on packing tables that was not able to be effectively cleaned.\n\n'During the investigation, there was an allegation of raw organic fertilizer use on the rockmelon crop, which was found to be incorrect,' the agency report said.\n\nThe business resumed harvesting and packing in early April 2018, and no _Listeria monocytogenes_ has been detected on any fruit since then.\n\nRombola Family Farms has made line modifications to improve cleaning, increased cleaning and sanitizing of the packing line environment and sanitizer concentration during washing of melons.\n\n'The rockmelon pre-wash was dosed with 200 ppm chlorine water during use. Similarly, the concentration of chlorine in the sanitizer wash step was increased to 200 ppm. This gives a total contact time for chlorine of over 2 minutes,' according to the NSW DPI report.\n\n'The fungicide tank and post wash drying fans have been made more accessible and easily cleaned. Black sponge material on the packing table has been removed and replaced with more suitable material.'\n\n[Byline: Joe Whitworth]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report says heavy rainfall and dust storms resulted in _Listeria moncytogenes_ contamination of rockmelons (also called cantaloupe) produced by a specific grower, Rombola Family Farms in southern New South Wales, Australia. As a result, 22 individuals in Australia were infected between Jan and April 2018 by eating the contaminated melons. Seven infected individuals died, and one miscarried.\n\n_Listeria_ is a fecal organism of farm animals and humans and is found in grazing land and farmland that has been fertilized with manure. _Listeria_ can survive for up to 84 days in some soils (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075969). Raw organic fertilizer was reportedly not used at the Rombola farm. However, because cantaloupes grow on vines on the ground, even if separated from the soil by plastic sheeting as was the case at the Rombola farm, cantaloupe could possibly be susceptible to contamination with bacteria from animal feces in soil that was carried from surrounding grazing land or farmland by heavy rainwater runoff or dust storms.\n\nCantaloupe could also become contaminated in processing facilities if _Listeria_ are brought into the facility by a dust storm or on the soles of workers' shoes, or if the facility is flooded by heavy rain runoff. In fact, the outbreak stain of _Listeria_ was found on the floor around the Rombola melon packing area. Cantaloupe's rough surface could then impede effective cleaning. However, inspectors at the Rombola farm found there was an opportunity for introduction of _Listeria_ after washing cantaloupe through contact with surfaces or equipment that may have had traces of the pathogen. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nAustralia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/186]", "summary": "\n\n'Prior to the detection of the outbreak, RFF utilized a one minute and 30-40 second pre-wash and scrubbing step to reduce organic load, followed by a 35 second sanitizing step of 100 ppm chlorine sprays and scrubbing,' said the NSW DPI report.

A previous investigation and new WGS findings suggests a common source of contamination, states the latest report by ECDC and the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA).\n\nWGS-based analysis identified 12 patients with onset of symptoms between October 2015 and May 2018: 6 in Denmark, 1 in France, and 5 in Germany. The 1st cluster of cases reported by Denmark in September 2017 was linked to the consumption of salmon products produced in Poland.\n\nInitial investigations suggested that contamination may have taken place at a Polish processing company but the lack of recent WGS data on the _Listeria monocytogenes_-isolates collected at the processing plant make it impossible to confirm this is the case.\n\nAlthough control measures were implemented following the Danish outbreak investigation in September 2017, the same strain was found in a salmon product in France in October 2017 and in a patient in Germany in May 2018. This suggests that the source of contamination may still be active and that contaminated products may have been distributed to more EU countries. Until the source of contamination is identified and controlled, new invasive _L. monocytogenes_ infections associated with this outbreak may still occur.\n\nIt is likely that the extent of the outbreak is underestimated, since the use of sequencing to characterise _L. monocytogenes_ isolates is only used by a few EU countries. A recent EU-wide study coordinated by ECDC revealed that more than half of the severe listeriosis cases in the European Union belong to clusters, many of which are not being picked up fast enough by the current surveillance system.\n\nListeriosis is a relatively rare but potentially severe food-borne disease that has been reported in increasing numbers in the EU/EEA countries since 2008. In 2016, 2536 cases were reported, including 247 deaths. Pregnant women, the elderly and immunocompromised people are at higher risk of contracting listeriosis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Refrigerated smoked salmon is a recognized potential source for listeriosis, similar to other cold cut meats and non-heat treated cured smoked meats, being a ready-to-eat product, that is, does not require further cooking before eating.

The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has identified 12 cases, 2 of which are fatal.\n\n'What is unusual is that it is all cases of the same subtype of bacteria. We counted 12 cases, which is not that much, but 12 of the same type in a short time, it's not normal,' said Daniel Koch, director of the Division of Communicable Diseases at the FOPH, told SRF [Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen, German-language broadcaster in Switzerland].\n\nResearch is being conducted to find the sources of the infection. Currently 6 cantons are affected by the listeriosis outbreak. In Neuchatel, 3 cases were reported, 4 in Valais and others in Ticino, Zurich, Aargau and Schwyz.\n\nListeriosis is a rare infectious disease caused by a bacterium that spreads especially through the ingestion of contaminated food. Charcuterie, soft cheeses and salads are all foods that are possible sources of infection.\n\n'We can talk about an epidemic and this disease can be deadly, but the population is not at risk. These germs benefit from flaws, a decrease in immunity, in the defenses of individuals. This therefore concerns especially pregnant women and the elderly,' Raffaele Malinverni, head of the Department of Medicine at the Neuchatel Hospital, told RTS on its Tuesday [16 Oct 2018] 12:45 broadcast.\n\nThe FOPH reminds that people at risk should avoid raw vegetables, raw or undercooked meat, raw fish and seafood, soft cheese and unpasteurized milk.\n\n'Our survey is all the more difficult because the cases are spread all over Switzerland; it's not easy, people have probably been infected with the same food, but it's a food that had to be distributed in many places,' said Daniel Koch.\n\nSeveral people infected by the same source of bacteria -- the case is not new. In 1987, more than 120 people became ill after eating Vacherin-Mont-d'or, and 30 of them died.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enable them to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that are difficult to access. In past outbreaks, contamination occurred in parts of the machinery 'well beyond the [manufacturer's] recommended sanitation process' and was 'found only after the devices were completely disassembled' (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/maple-leaf-eyes-meat-slicers-in-outbreak/article1060898/). Because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, _Listeria_-contaminated, refrigerated ready-to-eat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon or cold cut meats (e.g., ham), are recognized potential sources for listeriosis. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk are other frequent sources of listeriosis. However, the source in some outbreaks has been contamination with _Listeria_ only after pasteurization.\n\nSerotyping of _L. monocytogenes_ strains, based on variations in the somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens, has determined that only 3 (1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b) of the 12 serotypes of _L. monocytogenes_ cause 95 percent of human cases; serotype 4b is most commonly associated with outbreaks (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/pdf/listeriainitiativeoverview_508.pdf). We are told in the news report above that all 12 cases have the same 'subtype,' but we are not told what that subtype is. Genotyping the clinical isolates from ill people, if they match, will establish that we are dealing with a common source.\n\nA map of Swiss cantons can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nSwitzerland: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/105]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enable them to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that are difficult to access.

Most cases have been reported from Gauteng Province (58 percent, 612/1064) followed by Western Cape (13 percent, 139/1064) and KwaZulu-Natal (8 percent, 84/1064) provinces. Cases have been diagnosed in both public (64 percent, 683/1064) and private (36 percent, 381/1064) healthcare sectors. Outcome is known for 828/1064 (78 percent) patients, of whom 218 (26 percent) have died (Figure 4).\n\nFemales account for 56 percent (576/1039) of cases where gender is reported. Where age was reported (n=1043), ages range from birth to 93 years (median 19 years) - Figure 5. Neonates aged 28 days and less account for 43 percent (444/1043) of cases. Of neonatal cases, 95 percent (424/444) had early-onset disease (birth to 6 days or less).\n\nAlthough outbreak-related cases have declined sharply, sporadic cases (that is, not epidemiologically linked) continue to be reported, as expected. Therefore, healthcare workers are encouraged to continue providing risk reduction guidance to persons at high risk for developing listeriosis (pregnant women, neonates 28 days of age and younger, persons older than 65 years of age, and persons with immunosuppression (due to HIV infection, cancer, diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy). Such guidance includes advice on food hygiene (the World Health Organization's 5 keys to safer food [http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/5keysmanual/en/] is a useful resource for generic food hygiene advice) and avoidance of at-risk food.\n\nThe end of the outbreak is approaching, and the activities of the listeriosis Incident Management Team are nearing completion. The following actions have been taken to strengthen health and environmental systems to ensure prevention and early detection of future outbreaks, particularly in ready-to-eat processed meat:\n1. Listeriosis has been declared a notifiable medical condition under an amendment to the National Health Act.\n2. The NICD has developed a system of surveillance and investigation of listeriosis cases including whole genome sequencing (WGS) of all isolates from laboratory-confirmed cases. This allows timeous identification of clusters which may represent outbreaks.\n3. The NHLS has strengthened capacity to conduct food and environmental testing for _Listeria monocytogenes_.\n4. Almost 900 environmental health practitioners in all health districts have been re-trained in inspection procedures, food safety systems, legislative aspects of food control and tools to support inspections including risk assessment tools and inspection checklists.\n5. All production facilities that manufacture ready-to-eat processed meat in South Africa have been identified (n=158) and all but 9 have been inspected by district environmental health practitioners, supported by a core incident management team.\n6. An amendment to the Regulations pertaining to the application of the hazard analysis and critical control system (HACCP), (R908 of 2003) was published on 14 Jun 2018 requiring all producers of ready-to-eat processed meat to be HACCP certified by externally accredited agencies within 9 months of publication of this act.\n7. Risk communication activities including the dissemination of information pertaining to food safety, avoidance of certain foodstuffs by persons who are at risk for listeriosis, and training of health promoters have been conducted.\n\nFurther resources on listeriosis can be found on the NICD website at http://www.nicd.ac.za, Diseases A-Z, under 'Listeriosis'.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 2nd news report above, which is from the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), says that a total of 1064 cases of the listeriosis were identified between January 2017 and 14 Aug 2018.\n\nOver 90 percent of isolates from listeriosis cases linked to the South African 'polony' outbreak were sequence type 6 (ST6) (see ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - South Africa (11): fatal, ST6, WHO response 20180330.5718496).

Such guidance includes advice on food hygiene (the World Health Organization's 5 keys to safer food [http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/5keysmanual/en/] is a useful resource for generic food hygiene advice) and avoidance of at-risk food. \n\nThe listeriosis outbreak has been costly for Tiger Brands, with recall-related costs amounting to Rand 365 million [about 23.9 million] for the initial insurance claims, spokesperson Nevashnee Naicker said. As of 14 Aug 2018, a total of 1064 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases has been reported to NICD since [1 Jan 2017 (Figure 3 [all figures are available at the source URL above]). All production facilities that manufacture ready-to-eat processed meat in South Africa have been identified (n=158) and all but 9 have been inspected by district environmental health practitioners, supported by a core incident management team. And the Enterprise factory in Limpopo, identified as the source of the outbreak, could reopen in October [2018], health minister Aaron Motsoaledi said in Johannesburg on [Mon 3 Sep 2018]. \n\nOf the 645 _Listeria_ clinical isolates that have been sequence typed, no ST6 isolates have been identified since the 1st week of June 2018 (see Figure 3 from the NICD report above at the source URL). Almost 900 environmental health practitioners in all health districts have been re-trained in inspection procedures, food safety systems, legislative aspects of food control and tools to support inspections including risk assessment tools and inspection checklists.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-06-14 00:00:00", "2017-01-01 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2018-08-14 00:00:00", "2018-08-26 00:00:00", "1060-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-10-26 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Limpopo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gauteng Province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Johannesburg", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "st6", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5888338", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - South Africa (14): fatal, ST6", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5888338", "date": "2018-07-04 20:19:09", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - SOUTH AFRICA (14): FATAL, ST6\n*******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 2 Jul 2018\nSource: Food Safety News [edited]\nhttp://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/07/new-listeriosis-cases-down-newborns-remain-hardest-hit/#.Wz0klS2ZNao\n\n\nNew information out of South Africa shows that 1053 people have been confirmed with listeria infections in the past 18 months.

As of 8 Jun 2018, 47 cases including 9 deaths had been reported.\n\nThe same strains of _L. monocytogenes_ have been detected in frozen vegetables produced by the same Hungarian company in 2016, 2017, and 2018. This suggests that the strains have persisted in the processing plant despite the cleaning and disinfection procedures that were carried out.\n\nThe available information confirms the contamination at the Hungarian plant. However, further investigations, including thorough sampling and testing, are needed to identify the exact points of environmental contamination at the Hungarian plant. The same recommendation applies to other companies belonging to the same commercial group if environmental contamination is detected.\n\nOn 29 Jun 2018, the Hungarian Food Chain Safety Office banned the marketing of all frozen vegetable and frozen mixed vegetable products produced by the affected plant between August 2016 and June 2018, and ordered their immediate withdrawal and recall. This last measure is likely to significantly reduce the risk of human infections and contain the outbreak. All freezing activity at the plant has been stopped.\n\nNew cases could still emerge due to the long incubation period of listeriosis (up to 70 days); the long shelf-life of frozen corn products; and the consumption of frozen corn bought before the recalls and eaten without being cooked properly.\n\nTo reduce the risk of infection, consumers should thoroughly cook non ready-to-eat frozen vegetables, even though these products are commonly consumed without cooking (such as in salads and smoothies). This applies especially to consumers at highest risk of contracting listeriosis -- such as the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and adults with weakened immune systems.\n\n[Byline: Josh Fensterbush]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When last reported by ProMED-mail in March 2018 (Listeriosis - EU: fatal, ST6, frozen corn, 2015-18, recall 20180325.5708506), there was a total of 32 confirmed listeriosis cases, including 6 deaths, between December 2015 and 8 Mar 2018, in a multi-country outbreak in 5 EU member states (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) linked by whole genome sequencing (genotyping) of clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ to frozen corn that was packed in Poland and processed/produced in Hungary. As of 8 Jun 2018, there are now 47 reported cases, including 9 deaths.\n\nPossibly other frozen vegetables produced by the Hungarian facility are also being implicated and on 29 June 2018, the Hungarian Food Chain Safety Office ordered recall and banned further the marketing of all frozen vegetable and frozen mixed vegetable products produced by the affected facility between August 2016 and June 2018. All freezing activity at the plant has been stopped.\n\n_Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enables them to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of equipment that are difficult to access. In a prior ProMED-mail report of a listeriosis outbreak in Canada, the design of a commercial meat slicer responsible for contamination of deli meat made its regular cleaning difficult and costly for the food processor (Listeriosis - South Africa (04): comment 20180126.5586393). The contamination occurred in parts of the machinery 'well beyond the [manufacturer's] recommended sanitation process' and was 'found only after the devices were completely disassembled' (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/maple-leaf-eyes-meat-slicers-in-outbreak/article1060898/). Perhaps a similar situation is responsible for this prolonged multicountry EU outbreak.\n\nSerotyping of _L. monocytogenes_ strains, based on variations in the somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens, has determined that only 3 (1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b) of the 12 serotypes of _L. monocytogenes_ cause 95 per cent of human cases; serotype 4b is most commonly associated with outbreaks (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/pdf/listeriainitiativeoverview_508.pdf). The serotype of the strain of _L. monocytogenes_ responsible for this multi-country European outbreak is 4b, multi-locus sequence type 6 (ST6).

The manufacturer says that a machine that made the mashed potatoes was responsible for the contamination, but we are not told how the linkage was established. Did genotypes of clinical _Listeria_ isolates match genotypes of _Listeria_ isolates from the contaminated products? Also, were there any cases of listeriosis linked to the contaminated products who survived their illnesses?\n\nWhat were the instructions for preparation of the _Listeria_-contaminated products before eating? Were the contaminated products ready-to-eat without further preparation or were they to be reheated or cooked before serving? Cooking or reheating in a microwave oven can leave areas that are inadequately cooked if contamination with an enteric pathogen such as _Listeria_ is present. The US CDC suggests microwaving to internal temperatures of about 165 F [74 C]; also, stirring food in the middle of heating and letting microwaved food sit for a few minutes after cooking to help distribute the heat from hotter areas of food, because microwaving is an uneven process (https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/cook/index.htm).

Between 1 Jan 2017 through 24 Apr 2018, 1024 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases have been reported to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) from all provinces. The majority of cases have come from 3 provinces: 601 (59 percent) from Gauteng, 128 (13 percent) from Western Cape and 73 (7 percent) from KwaZulu-Natal provinces, with the remaining cases coming from the other provinces in South Africa. The outcome of illness is known for 700 patients, of whom 200 (28.6 percent) of them died; this case fatality rate is comparable to other recorded listeriosis outbreaks worldwide. Most of the cases are persons who have higher risks for a severe disease outcome, such as neonates, pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons. In this outbreak, 42 percent of the cases are neonates who were infected during pregnancy or delivery.\n\nWhole genome sequencing was performed on 521 isolates from patients. 85 percent of the strains belonged to _Listeria monocytogenes_ sequence type 6 (ST6) and 15 percent (83/521) representing 19 other sequence types (ST1, ST54, ST876, ST2, ST5, ST204, ST219, ST224, ST71, ST101, ST121, ST155, ST3, ST403, ST515, ST7, ST8, and ST88). The same ST6 sequence type was identified in a widely consumed ready-to-eat processed meat product called 'Polony' [Bologna sausage]. The same strain was also found in the processing environment of the manufacturer of the implicated product. On 4 Mar 2018, the Ministry of Health, announced that this product was believed to be the source of the outbreak and initiated a countrywide recall of the implicated products. Since the recall, the number of cases has dropped significantly.\n\nThe food processing company and 3 of its retailers export to 15 countries (1) in the African region. All of these countries have been informed about the implicated lots imported through the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) and have issued recalls for the implicated products.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe country has activated a national multisectoral task force to coordinate investigation and response activities.\n\nEmergency response activities that have been conducted by various stakeholders are continuing and intensifying, including surveillance (detection and investigation of cases), risk communication activities, and food safety legislative review and reform. To inform and support these activities, additional activities will be implemented in a phased approach as follows:\n\n- Phase 1: identification of at-risk food processing plants, development of material and training of staff to support inspections of facilities (completed).\n- Phase 2: inspection of at-risk food processing plant and strengthening of district environmental health practitioners.\n- Phase 3: reporting and consolidation of health system strengthening activities, and after-action review.\n\nA multisectoral incident management team (IMT) has been strengthened under the leadership of the Department of Health with support from WHO. An updated Listeriosis Emergency Response Plan (ERP, April 2018) has been developed to intensify response activities to control and end the current listeriosis outbreak and strengthen health and food safety systems to prevent future outbreaks.\n\nA WHO Listeriosis Regional Technical Meeting took place in Johannesburg from 19-21 Apr 2018, attended by delegates from 16 countries from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region and beyond. The aim of the meeting was to share experiences from South Africa on the management of a listeriosis outbreak and increase awareness of listeriosis in the region. The meeting also guided countries in preparing contingency plans to respond and control listeriosis as part of an overall strengthening of their food safety systems.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nGlobally, this is the largest outbreak of listeriosis that has been detected. With the implicated food source identified and removed from the market, the number of cases is declining, but due to the potentially long incubation period of listeriosis (one to three weeks and up to 70 days) further cases are expected before the impact of the food recall will be fully observed.\n\nRecently, Namibia reported a confirmed case of listeriosis. The isolated _Listeria_ strains has been sequenced to determine potential links to the outbreak in South Africa. It belongs to a different sequence type and is therefore not linked to the outbreak in South Africa.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nCountries should strengthen national food safety and disease surveillance systems as a prerequisite to prevent similar events in the future and to ensure a safe food supply for their populations. Additionally, countries are urged to pay closer attention to common foodborne pathogens such as _Salmonella_ species, _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Escherichia coli_ and _Listeria monocytogenes_, to make listeriosis a notifiable disease if not yet done, to make the best use of a new 'WHO manual to strengthen surveillance of and response to foodborne diseases', which was published on November 2017 and to refer to the 'WHO Factsheet on Listeriosis'. See below, in the 'Further Information' section for links to these documents.\n\nResponsible authorities are encouraged to proactively provide public health advice on the prevention and control of listeriosis, including, strengthened risk communication especially to at-risk population groups, to address public concerns and promote outbreak control measures.\n\nWHO does not currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions in relation to this outbreak, other than the continuous recall and safe disposal of the implicated processed meat products as indicated by the South African Government.\n\nWhile WHO understands the desire by sovereign governments to take measures to protect the health of their populations, States Parties to the IHR are required not to take actions that significantly interfere with international travel and trade, which are not based on scientific principles, and which may be viewed as excessive. Indeed such measures contravene the spirit and purpose of the IHR, and can impede public health objectives.\n\nCurrently, 13 out of the 15 countries to which South Africa exported food products have recalled the processed meat products implicated in the listeriosis outbreak, and banned imports of the same. Two of these countries have additionally banned imports of other food products, which are not directly linked to the current listeriosis outbreak. WHO continues to monitor the travel and trade measures taken by countries in relation to this outbreak and their compliance with requirements under the IHR.\n\nFor travelers, it is advisable to practice good food hygiene, such as avoiding uncooked food, avoiding food that has been kept at room temperature for several hours, and always washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing or consuming food.\n\n1. The 15 countries include: Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Cases continue to be reported.

According to the complaint, a 2017 investigation by FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determined Vulto Creamery cheese was the source of a multistate listeriosis outbreak that sickened at least 8 people, 2 of whom died. The defendants agreed to be bound by a consent decree filed with the complaint in US District Court for the Northern District of New York.\n\n'L. mono is a serious health threat that can prove fatal,' said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A Readler of the Justice Department's Civil Division. 'Consumers should be able to trust that the food they buy is safe, and we will continue working with FDA to take action against manufacturers that employ substandard practices.'\n\n'The presence of these dangerous bacteria at a cheese manufacturing facility in Upstate New York is of grave concern,' said US Attorney Grant C Jaquith for the Northern District of New York. 'We will continue to use all available tools to ensure that our food supply is safe and violations of laws protecting public heath are addressed.'\n\nThe complaint alleged that the defendants' cheeses were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions. According to the complaint, company records revealed positive tests for a type of _Listeria_ in the Vulto facility, but the defendants never attempted to identify the species of _Listeria_ or its source. The complaint alleged the defendants also failed to conduct microbial testing of finished cheese products despite finding indications of _Listeria_ on food contact surfaces. Vulto Creamery used raw, or unpasteurized, milk to make its ready-to-eat cheese.\n\nThe consent decree entered by the court permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the FDCA. Under the order, the defendants may not manufacture or distribute food unless they comply with specific remedial measures set forth in the decree. Among other requirements, the defendants must hire a qualified independent expert to develop an effective sanitation control program to adequately control for the risk of L. mono. Before manufacturing or distributing any food, defendants must first receive FDA's written determination that their manufacturing practices comply with the law.\n\nThis matter was handled by Trial Attorney Natalie Sanders of the Civil Division's Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant US Attorney Michael Gadarian of the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York, with the assistance of Associate Chief Counsel for Enforcement Leslie Cohen of the FDA's Office of General Counsel, Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In 2016-2017, a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections (listeriosis) involved 8 people, including 2 deaths, infected with the outbreak strain in 4 states (New York, Florida, Connecticut, and Vermont) was linked to eating soft cheeses made from unpasteurized milk and aged for 60 days by Vulto Creamery in Walton, New York.

All of the cases were hospitalized and there have been 7 deaths and 1 miscarriage associated with the outbreak. All of the outbreak cases have had illness onset since 17 Jan 2018.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nEpidemiological investigations suggested that the source of the outbreak was rockmelon (cantaloupe melons) from a single grower in Australia. Epidemiological and environmental investigations were undertaken, which led to the recall of rockmelons produced by the single grower on 27 Feb 2018.\n\nOn 1 Mar 2018, the Australian NFP was notified that international distribution of the affected product had occurred. Australian authorities received information from trace forward investigations on 2 Mar 2018 that the rockmelons from this grower were exported to 8 countries; Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (China), Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Singapore, and United Arab Emirates. The Australian NFP directly advised these countries on 3 Mar 2018 about the export of rockmelons from Australia to their country. In parallel, a notification via the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) was also sent on 3 Mar 2018.\n\nFurther trace forward investigations on 7 Mar 2018 identified that Bahrain also received an export of the rockmelons from this grower and on 8 Mar 2018, investigations further identified that the affected rockmelons may have been included in a consignment to the Seychelles. The Australian NFP advised the Bahrain NFP directly on 8 Mar 2018 and the Seychelles NFP directly on 9 Mar 2018. As of 8 Mar 2018, trace forward activities have been concluded.\n\nThe INFOSAN emergency contact points in the importing countries were provided with specific distribution details of the rockmelons to their respective countries by the INFOSAN emergency contact point in Australia, as they became available.\n\nOn 4 Apr 2018, it was reported that more than 30 samples of melons from the grower through the supply chain, including retail and on farm, tested positive to _L. monocytogenes_. Additional testing found _L. monocytogenes_ in the packing area. All _L. monocytogenes_ samples had the same genetic sequence as the human cases. It is believed that the cause of the outbreak was a combination of environmental conditions and weather contaminating the surface of the fruit, with low levels of the bacteria persisting after the washing process. The grower continues to work closely with the relevant authorities and has returned to supply rockmelons (during the week starting 2 Apr 2018) after testing cleared the property.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nThe prompt epidemiological and environmental investigation carried out led to the identification of the outbreak source and enabled the issuing of a recall. Due to the potentially long incubation period of _L. monocytogenes_, further outbreak cases may be reported.\n\nImport details have been provided though INFOSAN to the affected countries to enable them to take appropriate management measures including local recalls and risk communication. Cases in the affected countries may still be identified.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nPregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals should take precautions to avoid infection by _Listeria_ by avoiding the consumption of high-risk foods including dairy products made of unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, deli meat products (ready-to eat meat cuts, p\u00e2t\u00e9, etc.); ice creams, raw seafood, crustaceans, and shellfish. These are the most common foods associated with _Listeria_ infection. In recent years, melon, and other fruits and vegetables have been implicated on rare occasions in outbreaks of listeriosis. To reduce the risk, it is important to thoroughly wash all fruits and vegetables.\n\nIt is recommended that risk communication messages regarding listeriosis be targeted to at-risk groups, primarily pregnant women, older persons and people with weakened immune systems, for example people with cancer, HIV, diabetes, kidney, or liver disease or those taking immunosuppressive medications. These messages should recommend avoiding the consumption of high-risk foods.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteurs Marianne Hopp and Mary Marshall\n\n[The listeriosis outbreak linked to rockmelons (cantaloupes) has been traced to a specific grower in the Australian state of New South Wales.

Between 1 Jan 2017 through 14 Mar 2018, 978 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases have been reported to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) from all provinces. The majority of cases have come from 3 provinces: 581 (59 percent) from Gauteng, 118 (12 percent) from Western Cape and 70 (7 percent) from KwaZulu-Natal provinces, with the remaining cases coming from the other provinces in South Africa.\n\nThe outcome of illness is known for 674 patients, of whom 183 (27 percent) of them died; this case fatality rate is comparable to other recorded listeriosis outbreaks worldwide. Most of the cases are persons who have higher risks for a severe disease outcome, such as neonates, pregnant women, the elderly and immunocompromised persons. In this outbreak, 42 percent of the cases are neonates who were infected during pregnancy or delivery.\n\nWhole genome sequencing was performed on isolates from a large subset of patients. 91 percent of the strains belonged to _Listeria monocytogenes_ Sequence Type 6 (ST6). The same ST6 sequence type was identified in a widely consumed ready-to-eat processed meat product called 'Polony' [Bologna sausage]. The same strain was also found in the processing environment of the manufacturer of the implicated product.\n\nOn 4 Mar 2018, the Ministry of Health, announced that this product was believed to be the source of the outbreak.\n\nThe food processing company and 3 of its retailers export to 15 countries (1) in the African region. All of these countries have issued recalls for the implicated products.\n\nEnvironmental samples from other food production companies in South Africa have also tested positive for _Listeria_, but with strains different from the outbreak strain. These companies have also issued food recalls. Some of their products have been exported to some of the countries mentioned above.\n\n9 percent of the reported cases in the present outbreak in South Africa were infected with different strains of _Listeria_ than the predominant ST6 outbreak strain. This may indicate that more than one outbreak is ongoing. Comprehensive investigations to identify the source of infection of these cases should be conducted.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe country has activated a national multisectoral task force to coordinate investigation and response activities:\nThe Minister of Health, South Africa, held a press conference on 4 Mar 2018 to announce the source of the outbreak. Following the source identification, the national authorities have taken measures to limit further infections and associated mortality, including but not limited to the issuance of safety recall notices, compliance notices, and measures related to exportation of implicated products and risk communication with vulnerable groups.\n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) Health Ministers held a meeting in Johannesburg on 15 Mar 2018, to share information and to enhance preparedness and response for listeriosis. Health Ministers were further reminded about their rights and obligations under the International Health Regulations (IHR) with regards to additional health measures for international travel and trade.\n\nListeriosis has been made a notifiable medical condition in South Africa since December 2017. National risk communication activities have been initiated since December 2017 around the 'WHO five keys to safer food messages.'\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nGlobally, this is the largest outbreak of listeriosis that has been detected. Due to the potentially long incubation period of listeriosis (1 to 3 weeks and up to 70 days) further cases are expected before the impact of the food recall is observed.\n\nFollowing the identification of the source of this outbreak, WHO is now concerned that the export of implicated products may have resulted in listeriosis cases in other countries. Detailed information on the implicated product batches exported to each of the identified 15 countries should be shared with WHO and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) Secretariat. This will help to facilitate efficient recalls of these products.\n\nRecently, Namibia reported a confirmed case of listeriosis. It is important that this case and other possible cases be properly investigated and the implicated food sources identified.

Additionally, countries are urged to pay closer attention to common foodborne pathogens such as _Salmonella_ species, _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Escherichia coli_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_, to make listeriosis a notifiable disease if not yet done, to make the best use of a new 'WHO manual to strengthen surveillance of and response to foodborne diseases,' which was published in November 2017 and to refer to the 'WHO Factsheet on Listeriosis'. Following the identification of the source of this outbreak, WHO is now concerned that the export of implicated products may have resulted in listeriosis cases in other countries. The country has activated a national multisectoral task force to coordinate investigation and response activities:\nThe Minister of Health, South Africa, held a press conference on 4 Mar 2018 to announce the source of the outbreak. For travellers, it is advisable to practice good food hygiene, such as avoiding uncooked food, avoiding food that has been kept at room temperature for several hours, and always washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing or consuming food. The majority of cases have come from 3 provinces: 581 (59 percent) from Gauteng, 118 (12 percent) from Western Cape and 70 (7 percent) from KwaZulu-Natal provinces, with the remaining cases coming from the other provinces in South Africa. Following the source identification, the national authorities have taken measures to limit further infections and associated mortality, including but not limited to the issuance of safety recall notices, compliance notices, and measures related to exportation of implicated products and risk communication with vulnerable groups. \n\nWHO does not currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions in relation to this outbreak, other than the recall of processed meat products indicated by the South African Government. \n\nThe food processing company and 3 of its retailers export to 15 countries (1) in the African region. \n\nEnvironmental samples from other food production companies in South Africa have also tested positive for _Listeria_, but with strains different from the outbreak strain. \n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) Health Ministers held a meeting in Johannesburg on 15 Mar 2018, to share information and to enhance preparedness and response for listeriosis. \n\nWhile WHO understands the desire by sovereign governments to take measures to protect the health of their populations, States Parties to the IHR have obligations not to take actions that significantly interfere with international travel and trade which are not based on scientific principles and which may be viewed as excessive. The 15 countries include: Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n\n--\n Due to the potentially long incubation period of listeriosis (1 to 3 weeks and up to 70 days) further cases are expected before the impact of the food recall is observed. \n\nPublic health response\n Detailed information on the implicated product batches exported to each of the identified 15 countries should be shared with WHO and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) Between 1 Jan 2017 through 14 Mar 2018, 978 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases have been reported to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) from all provinces. \n\nAn increase in public concern about the outbreak has been reflected in media reports and discussions in various social media platforms. In such cases, WHO is ready to provide support and has reached out to 16 African nations (2 West African countries and 14 members of SADC) to provide support for preparedness and response. WHO continues to monitor the travel and trade measures taken by countries in relation to this outbreak and their compliance with requirements under the IHR. \n\nWHO risk assessment\n Some of these countries may not have well-established surveillance systems and laboratory diagnostic services in place to detect cases of listeriosis. \n\nWHO advice\n \n\nListeriosis has been made a notifiable medical condition in South Africa since December 2017. It is important that this case and other possible cases be properly investigated and the implicated food sources identified. In this outbreak, 42 percent of the cases are neonates who were infected during pregnancy or delivery. Health Ministers were further reminded about their rights and obligations under the International Health Regulations (IHR) with regards to additional health measures for international travel and trade.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) jointly published a rapid outbreak assessment today [Thu 22 Mar 2018] that says frozen corn is the 'likely source of an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_' involving Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom since 2015.\n\nThe 5 European Union (EU) countries have reported 32 confirmed listeriosis cases with 6 deaths between December 2015 and 8 March 2018, according to the EFSA-ECDC assessment. Whole genome sequencing was used to define the multi-country outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ serogroup IVb multi-locus sequence type [ST] 6. Investigators also used it to identify the implicated food source.\n\nOther current listeriosis outbreaks in Australia, South Africa, and Europe are not related events.\n\nInvestigations point toward frozen corn packed in Poland and processed and produced in Hungary. The report recommends further investigation to identify the exact point of contamination in the food chain. Food business operators in Poland, Finland, Sweden and Estonia have withdrawn and recalled the implicated products. These measures are likely to reduce the risk of human infections in these countries.\n\nHowever, new cases may be identified due to the long incubation period of listeriosis, which is up to 70 days, the long shelf-life of frozen corn, and the possible future consumption of frozen corn bought before the recall was implemented. To reduce the risk of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection from frozen corn, consumers should adequately heat frozen vegetables to kill pathogens. This applies especially to consumers at the highest risk of contracting listeriosis -- such as the elderly, pregnant women, newborns, and adults with weakened immune systems.\n\nCoordination across the EU is crucial when there are multi-country foodborne outbreaks. One aspect of this coordination is the production of a rapid outbreak assessment (ROA) by EFSA and ECDC in close cooperation with affected countries. The ROA gives an overview of the situation in terms of public health and identifies the cause of the infections. It also includes trace-back and trace-forward investigations to identify the origin of the outbreak and where contaminated products have been distributed. These help to identify measures that will prevent further spread of the outbreak.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate Thu 22 Mar 2018\nSource: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control/European Food Safety Authority [edited]\nhttps://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/22-02-2018-RRA-Listeria-Finland.pdf\n\n\nMulti-country outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ serogroup IVb, multi-locus sequence type 6, infections probably linked to frozen corn -- joint ECDC-EFSA rapid outbreak assessment\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion\n----------\nAn outbreak of invasive _Listeria monocytogenes_ (_L. monocytogenes_) infections defined by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and probably linked to frozen corn has been ongoing in five European Union member states (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom) since 2015. As of 8 March 2018, 32 cases have been reported and 6 patients have died due to or with the infection.\n\nWGS analysis of 6 non-human _L. monocytogenes_ isolates detected from 2016 to January 2018 in Austria, Finland, France and Sweden found these isolates closely related to the multi-country cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ serogroup IVb, multi-locus sequence type 6 (ST6). The non-human isolates were detected in 2 different samples from mixed frozen vegetables; 3 samples from frozen corn, and one sample from a surface where various vegetables could have been processed. The only common food item in all non-human samples was corn.\n\nThe WGS analysis provides a strong microbiological link between the human and the non-human isolates and is suggestive of a potential contaminated food source related to frozen corn persisting in the food chain at least since 2016. Traceability information for the 3 frozen corn samples pointed to frozen corn products packed in Poland and processed/produced in Hungary. Two additional non-human strains isolated in Austria from frozen vegetable mixes with corn as an ingredient were traced back to the same common origin in Hungary. Further investigations are needed to verify the point of contamination in the food chain.\n\nConsumption of frozen corn has been confirmed by 2 patients, one in Finland and one in Sweden. In addition, a Danish patient reported consumption of mixed frozen vegetables, which could have included corn. The Finnish patient confirmed consumption of frozen corn of one suspected brand, supporting an epidemiological link between the outbreak cases and frozen corn. However, no traceability and microbiological information was available for the corn consumed by the Finnish and the Swedish patients.\n\nFood business operators in Estonia, Finland, Poland and Sweden have withdrawn and recalled the implicated frozen corn products from the market. These measures are likely to significantly reduce the risk of human infections in these countries. However, new invasive listeriosis cases may be identified due to the long incubation period (1-70 days), long shelf-lives of frozen corn products and potential consumption of frozen corn bought by the customers before the recalls and eaten without being properly cooked. Furthermore, until the root source of contamination is established and control measures implemented, new cases may occur.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A total of 32 confirmed listeriosis cases, including 6 deaths, between December 2015 and March 8 2018, in a multi-country outbreak in 5 EU member states (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have been linked by whole genome sequencing (genotyping) of clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, to isolates of the organism from frozen corn that was packed in Poland and processed/produced in Hungary. Although the corn has been recalled in some EU states, more cases are expected due to the long incubation period (1-70 days), long shelf-lives of frozen corn products, and potential consumption of frozen corn bought by the customers before the recalls and eaten without being properly cooked.\n\nThe means by which the frozen corn in the EU outbreak was contaminated is yet to be determined. _L. monocytogenes_ widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enables them to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove. It is found in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and is found in soil and water, especially in regions in close proximity to cattle farms, indicating that these animals may contribute to its dispersal in the environment through their fecal matter. The organism can be also found in agricultural land fertilized with sewage, and in silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw milk, soft cheeses, and kitchen premises, as well as in birds, crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects.\n\nSerotyping of _L. monocytogenes_ strains, based on variations in the somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens, has determined that only 3 (1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b) of the 12 serotypes of _L. monocytogenes_ cause 95 per cent of human cases; serotype 4b is most commonly associated with outbreaks (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/pdf/listeriainitiativeoverview_508.pdf).\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of European Union: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11767. - Mod.ML]", "summary": "promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A total of 32 confirmed listeriosis cases, including 6 deaths, between December 2015 and March 8 2018, in a multi-country outbreak in 5 EU member states (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have been linked by whole genome sequencing (genotyping) of clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, to isolates of the organism from frozen corn that was packed in Poland and processed/produced in Hungary.

They are destined for incineration and staff are deep-cleaning the factory as local and international experts privately conduct investigations for the company to confirm the NICD's findings.\n\nThis was after the NICD had analysed swabs taken at the factory in Polokwane, after tracing the source of a food believed to have been consumed by a group of sick creche children, who are being treated at the Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, Gauteng.\n\n_Listeria monocytogenes_ were also found at Tiger Brands's Germiston plant, but it has not yet been confirmed that they were the ST6 strain. Tiger Brands is at present not supplying any of these chilled meat products and has embarked on an extensive campaign to alert the public to return the products to retailers for a full refund, even if the packet has already been opened. Rainbow Chicken Limited (RCL) has also recalled its polony as a precaution.\n\nThe NICD said in its latest bulletin that 748 of the known cases were reported in 2017, and 230 in 2018. Of the cases they managed to get more information on:\n\n- 532 of those affected were women (where gender was reported);\n- the ages of those affected ranged from birth to 92 years;\n- 398 of the people who became ill were babies younger than 28 days;\n- 96 percent of the affected babies became sick between birth and 6 days old;\n- most cases have been reported from Gauteng (581), followed by the Western\nCape (118) and then KwaZulu-Natal (70)\n- 639 cases were diagnosed in public health facilities; and\n- 342 were diagnosed in private health facilities.\n\nThe NICD added that cases were still expected to be reported up to 4 weeks or longer after the recall of the implicated foodstuffs, as the incubation period for listeriosis can be 21 days, with a reported maximum of 70 days.\n\n'Health care workers are urged to continue with vigilance for new cases as people who have consumed implicated processed meat products over the past few weeks may continue to present with listeriosis,' said the NICD.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabinet extended its 'heartfelt condolences' to the friends and families of those who lost their lives after contracting listeriosis, and wished those who were recuperating a speedy recovery. Motsoaledi was also expected to meet representatives of the SA Nursing Council on [Thu 15 Mar 2018].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are now a total of 978 cases of listeriosis, including 183 deaths, reported since January 2017 in this outbreak in South Africa linked to contaminated ready-to-eat meat produced by Tiger Brands's Enterprise factory in the Limpopo capital, Polokwane.

This country is experiencing the worst epidemic in the world of listeriosis, which has killed at least 183 people since January 2017, according to the latest assessment of the South African authorities. After months of investigation, the source of the infection was finally identified on [4 Mar 2018], the Enterprise Food in South Africa.\n\nThe bacterium that causes listeriosis was also found in a sample from one of South Africa's Rainbow Chickens plants. The South African authorities have since temporarily suspended the export licenses of these 2 companies.\n\nListeriosis is caused by bacteria in soil, water, vegetation, and animal excrement, and can contaminate food, including meat, dairy products, and seafood.\n\nThe most vulnerable people include premature babies and pregnant women.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Multiple countries in Africa that have imposed restrictions on South African meat imports include Namibia, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (https://www.thesouthafrican.com/listeriosis-namibia-records-first-case-after-sa-outbreak/).\n\nThe 41-year-old Namibian man who was diagnosed with listeriosis was said in the news report above to have eaten Vienna sausages in Tsumeb, a city of 15 000 residents in northern Namibia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsumeb).

This is because it received new information from Australian authorities indicating that more _Listeria_-affected consignments had been exported to Singapore.\n\nThe _Listeria_ outbreak has so far been traced to a specific grower in the state of New South Wales. AVA had a few days ago recalled 2 consignments of rockmelon from this grower. Rockmelons from those 2 consignments were sold at Sheng Siong[*] stores and wet markets between 12 Feb and 2 Mar 2018. 'We expanded the recall to include all rockmelons from Australia immediately after receiving the latest updates from the Australian authorities,' said AVA in a media release.\n\n'The Australian authorities confirmed that the farm had stopped production on 23 Feb [2018] and that there are no other affected farms in Australia.

The environmental health practitioners (EHPs) were informed and on the same day visited the cr\u00e8che, and obtained samples from 2 unrelated polony brands (manufactured by Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken Limited (RCL) respectively) and submitted these to the laboratory for testing.\n\n'_Listeria monocytogenes_ was isolated from stool collected from one of the ill children, and from both of the polony specimens collected from the cr\u00e8che. These isolates were sent to the NICD Centre for Enteric Diseases, and underwent whole genome sequencing and genomic analysis. The ST6 sequence type was confirmed on all 3 isolates on [Sat 27 Jan 2018]. Remember that in the last press conference I informed you that from clinical isolates obtained from patients (patient blood), 9 sequence types of _L. monocytogenes_ were isolated and 91 percent were of sequence type 6 (ST6). We had then concluded that time that this outbreak is driven by ST6.\n\n'I wish to further remind you that we had then taken a decision to visit all food-processing sites, food-packaging sites, as well as food production sites where possible.\n\n'Following the lead from the tests performed on these children from Soweto and the food they had ingested, the EHPs, together with the NICD and DAFF representatives, accompanied by 3 technical advisors from the World Health Organisation in Geneva, visited a food-production site in Polokwane and conducted an extensive food product and environmental sampling.\n\n_L. monocytogenes_ was isolated from over 30 percent of the environmental samples collected from this site, which happens to be the Enterprise factory in Polokwane.\n\nTo conclude the investigation, whole genome sequencing analysis was performed from this Enterprise factory and the results became available midnight or last night [3 Mar 2018]. The outbreak strain, ST6, was confirmed in at least 16 environmental samples collected from this Enterprise facility.\n\n'The conclusion from this is that the source of the present outbreak can be confirmed to be the Enterprise food-production facility in Polokwane.\n\n'Additionally, preliminary results show that several ready-to-eat processed meat products from the Enterprise facility located in Germiston contain _L. monocytogenes_, but the sequence type is not known as yet.\n\n'Investigation of the RCL Wolwehoek production facility is also underway. Polony products have tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_, but the sequence types of the isolates are NOT ST6. However, such contamination of ready-to-eat processed meat products constitutes a health risk. Also, over 10 percent of environmental samples collected by EHPs at this facility have tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_. The sequence types of these isolates are not known as yet.\n\n'With the information at our disposal, we have decided on the following course of action:\n'1. The National Consumer Commission (NCC) has in terms of Section 60(2) of the Consumer Protection Act this morning [4 Mar 2018] issued the manufacturers concerned with safety recall notices.\n\n'Section 60(2) of the Consumer Protection Act states that:\nIf the NCC has reasonable grounds to believe that any goods may be unsafe, or that there is a potential risk to the public from the continued use of or exposure to the goods, and the producer or importer of those goods has not taken any steps required by an applicable code contemplated in subsection the Commission, by written notice, may require that producer to:\n(a) conduct an investigation contemplated in subsection (1); or\n(b) carry out a recall programme on any terms required by the Commission.\n\n'The NCC will prepare a recall strategy in conjunction with the manufacturers and make further announcements to the public in due course.\nThe safety recall will affect the manufacturers' entire distribution networks, both domestic and international.\n\n'2. Compliance notices will be issued to facilities in terms of the National Health Act.\nEnvironmental Health Practitioners appointed in terms of section 80(1) of the Act and duly registered as such in terms of section 83(5) of the National Health Amendment Act, 2013 (Act No. 12 of 2013) should upon finding that there are in terms of section 83 (1) and (2), existing conditions which:\n(a) constitutes a violation of the right contained in section 24(a) of the Constitution;\n(b) constitutes pollution detrimental to health;\n(c) is likely to cause a health nuisance; or\n(d) constitutes a health nuisance,\n\n'3. In terms of registration for exports by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), the respective processing or manufacturing establishments namely RCL Foods with an export registration number ZA32 and Enterprise Foods with an export registration number ZA 33 have been temporarily suspected [suspended?] till further notice.\n\n'4. We advise members of the public to avoid all processed meat products that are sold as ready-to-eat. While we know that polony is definitely implicated, there is a risk of cross-contamination of other ready-to-eat processed meat products, either at production, distribution or retail. This is because _Listeria_ on the exterior casing (packaging) of polony can be transferred to other products it comes into contact with, including viennas, russians, frankfurters, other sausages, and other 'cold meat' products that are typically not cooked before eating.\n\n'Just a reminder that people at high risk for listeriosis include:\n- pregnant women;\n- neonates (1st 28 days of life);\n- very young infants;\n- elderly persons, older than 65 years of age, and\n- anyone with a weakened immune system (due to HIV infection, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, people with transplants and those on immunosuppressive therapy such as oral corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or anti-TNF therapy for auto-immune disease).\n\n'The recall of these products does not mean that members of the public must now relax and stop the 5 food-safety rules, which we have recited many times, that is, washing your hands before handling food or when coming back from the bathroom; making sure that food is well cooked; isolating raw food from cooked food; making sure that food is at an appropriate temperature; and washing non-cooked food with clean running water; as well as using only pasteurised or boiled milk products.\n\n'It means that the general status of hygiene of the population must still be a matter of priority to society as a whole, and must remain like that forever.'\n\n'For media enquiries, please contact:\nMr Popo Maja\nHead of Communications\nNational Department of Health\nCell: 0725853219/012 395 9591\nFoster Mohale\nDirector: Media Relations\nNational Department of Health\nCell: 0724323792/012 395 8180\n<Foster.mohale@health.gov.za>'\n\n--\nCharlene Jacobs\n<charlenea.jacobs@westerncape.gov.za>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Charlene Jacobs for the official press conference media statement from Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa Minister of Health on the listeriosis outbreak in South Africa. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap: South Africa: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/179]", "summary": "\n\n'Just a reminder that people at high risk for listeriosis include:\n- pregnant women;\n- neonates (1st 28 days of life);\n- very young infants;\n- elderly persons, older than 65 years of age, and\n- anyone with a weakened immune system (due to HIV infection, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, people with transplants and those on immunosuppressive therapy such as oral corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or anti-TNF therapy for auto-immune disease). should upon finding that there are in terms of section 83 (1) and (2), existing conditions which:\n(a) constitutes a violation of the right contained in section 24(a) of the Constitution;\n(b) constitutes pollution detrimental to health;\n(c) is likely to cause a health nuisance; or\n(d) constitutes a health nuisance,\n\n'3. \n\n'The recall of these products does not mean that members of the public must now relax and stop the 5 food-safety rules, which we have recited many times, that is, washing your hands before handling food or when coming back from the bathroom; making sure that food is well cooked; isolating raw food from cooked food; making sure that food is at an appropriate temperature; and washing non-cooked food with clean running water; as well as using only pasteurised or boiled milk products.

As a precaution, consumers [particularly those who are elderly, pregnant or immune compromised] who may have rockmelon already in their home are advised to discard it.\n\nListeria is found widely in the environment and rarely causes serious illness in the general population but for vulnerable people, such as those who are over 70, pregnant, or have diabetes, cancer or suppressed immune systems, it can be extremely serious or even life threatening.\n\nAll states and territories are working together to investigate the outbreak and to date they have identified 10 cases in elderly patients in NSW (6), Victoria (1) and Queensland (3) with onset of illness notification dates between [17 Jan and 9 Feb 2018]. All 10 cases consumed rockmelon prior to their illness.\n\nThe outbreak has been linked to a grower in Nericon NSW. The company voluntarily ceased production on [Fri 23 Feb 2018], shortly after being notified of a potential link to illness and is working proactively with the authority to further investigate how any contamination could have occurred in order to get back into production as soon as possible. Any affected product is being removed from the supply chain, so consumers can be assured rockmelons currently available on shelves are not implicated in this outbreak.\n\nListeriosis starts with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, and sometimes diarrhoea. The symptoms can take a few days or even up to 6 weeks to appear after eating contaminated produce. People at risk should consult their local doctor as early as possible should symptoms appear.\n\nThe NSW Food Authority and NSW Health will continue to work with other jurisdictions to monitor the situation.\n\nThe 6 NSW cases linked to consumption of rockmelon form only a portion of the increased listeriosis cases in NSW so far this year, with 15 people affected, mainly elderly with underlying health conditions. Vulnerable people are reminded to avoid all foods that pose a risk of listeriosis, including: pre-cut melons such as rockmelon or watermelon; pre-packed cold salads including coleslaw and fresh fruit salad; pre-cooked cold chicken, cold delicatessen meats, p\u00e2t\u00e9; raw seafood, uncooked smoked seafood (such as smoked salmon); unpasteurised milk or milk products, soft cheeses (for example brie, camembert, ricotta or blue-vein); [and] sprouted seeds or raw mushrooms.\n\nThe NSW Food Authority and NSW Health are continuing investigations into other possible sources of the remaining recent listeriosis cases.\n\nFurther food safety advice relating to the safe preparation and storage of rockmelon can be found at <www.foodauthority.nsw.gov.au/foodsafetyandyou/special-care-foods/rockmelons/media release>.\n\n[Two of the 6 who became ill in NSW reportedly died (https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/01/australians-told-to-throw-out-rockmelon-after-two-deaths-in-listeria-outbreak). - Mod.ML]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The melon with sweet orange flesh and a rough skin, known as a cantaloupe in the USA, is called a rockmelon in much of Australia.

'Avoid all processed meat products that are sold as ready-to-eat\u201a' Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi told journalists at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) on Sunday afternoon [4 Mar 2018]. He told pregnant women to avoid any processed meat 'like the plague', reported Times Live.\n\nMore than 16 environmental samples from the Enterprise Polokwane factory tested positive for the _Listeria monocytogenes_ strain ST 6 -- a particularly virulent strain. Mr Motsoaledi said a ready-to-eat sausage known as polony, made by Enterprise Food and RCL Foods, would be recalled from stores.\n\nA shortage of the solution used for testing for the _Listeria_ bacteria meant the results of the tests at the Polokwane factory were delayed by 2 weeks, NICD's Dr Juno Thomas told Times Live.\n\nIt is believed that the factory will be closed down.\n\nThe _Listeria_ bacterium is hard to test for, as it is not homogenously distributed in food. It can also 'hide away' in cracks or niches in factories.

'We can now conclude scientifically that the source of the present outbreak is the Enterprise Food production facility located in Polokwane,' he said at the offices of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg.\n\n_Listeria_ has [also] been traced to another Enterprise facility in Germiston on the East Rand, and a Rainbow chicken facility in the Free State, but further tests were needed as the sequence type was not yet known.\n\nThe National Consumer Commission has issued safety recall notices to those manufacturers and facilities, and the companies are now responsible for coming up with the recall plan. The plan must be sufficient to cover their entire distribution chain, and the facilities will also have to resource and pay for the implementation.\n\nMotsoaledi said several children presented with gastroenteritis in Soweto [Johannesburg metropolitan municipality, Gauteng] earlier in the week. Tests were done, and it was found that they had listeriosis. The strain they were affected with, which was the same for the larger outbreak, was traced to Enterprise's Polokwane facility.\n\nMotsoaledi said statistics on [2 Mar 2018] show that the outbreak has claimed about 180 lives and 948 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported to the NICD.\n\nHe said while polony was a definite source, other products such as Viennas, Russians, Frankfurters, other sausages and cold meats not typically cooked could also be affected due to the risk of cross-contamination.\n\nPregnant women, neonates, elderly people and anyone with weakened systems should 'not go near' these products.\n\nMotsoaledi said retailers must clean their fridges, meat slicers, and either remove the ready-to-eat meat products or place them in plastic bags in separate fridges -- ahead of the recall. 'I've already emptied [out] my fridge this morning... I woke up my wife -- [and told let's] just take these things out,' he said. 'Any human being in the country who has these products in their fridge must take them out immediately.'\n\n_Listeria_ is a bacterium that is naturally found in the environment -- it commonly occurs in soil, water, vegetation, and in the faeces of some animals. It can contaminate a wide variety of food types, including meat and meat products, dairy products (unpasteurised and pasteurised), fresh and frozen produce (fruits, vegetables, and sprouts) and ready-to-eat products.\n\n[Byline: Tammy Petersen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Sun 4 Mar 2018\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-disease-listeria/south-africa-traces-deadly-listeria-to-processed-meat-issues-recall-idUSKBN1GG0OF\n\n\nSouth Africans were told on [Sun 4 Mar 2018] not to consume ready-to-eat processed meat as the government identified the source of a [listeriosis] outbreak that has killed 180 people as a cold meat product made by the country's biggest consumer foods group.\n\nThe meat, known as 'polony', made by Tiger Brands unit Enterprise Food and by RCL Foods, would be recalled from stores, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said.\n\n'We advise members of the public to avoid all processed meat products that are sold as ready-to-eat,' Motsoaledi said, adding that, due to the risk of cross-contamination, all such foods were a potential health hazard.\n\n'We can now conclude scientifically that the source of the present outbreak is the Enterprise Food production facility located in Polokwane,' Motsoaledi told a briefing at the offices of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases.\n\nTiger Brands said it was cooperating with authorities and RCL Foods said it would suspend all production of its Rainbow Polony brand.\n\nMotsoaledi said although RCL Foods had not been identified as a source of the outbreak, a facility owned by the firm was under investigation. Inquiries were ongoing at a second facility run by Enterprise Foods to establish if it too had contributed.\n\nThe outbreak has caused 180 fatalities and 948 reported cases since January 2017.\n\nTiger Brands spokeswoman Nevashnee Naicker said: 'We are all extremely concerned by listeriosis -- we all want to find the source or sources of listeriosis, together with the government.'\n\nRCL Foods chief legal officer Stephen Heath said the company was recalling its polony products even though test results were still pending. 'RCL Foods is sharing all results from its testing, both internally and externally, with the relevant authorities,' Heath said. 'We will continue to take every precaution to safeguard our products as well as our consumers.\n\nSouth African supermarket operator Pick n Pay said it had withdrawn the products from its shelves. 'All fridges and food preparation areas in our stores will now be re-cleaned to prevent any cross-contamination.

Now the outbreak involves 948 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 180 deaths, which is said to be the world's biggest documented listeriosis outbreak.\n\nThe news reports above say that the outbreak strain, _Listeria monocytogenes_ strain ST 6, has been recovered from the Enterprise factory in Polokwane (Tiger Brands unit), definitely involving a ready-to-eat sausage known as polony, but possibly could also involve other ready-to-eat meat products such as Viennas, Russians, Frankfurters, other sausages and cold meats due to cross-contamination. According to another news report, preliminary, results show that other ready-to-eat products at Enterprise's Germiston plant\u201a as well as Rainbow Chickens' (RCL) Wolwehoek plant, also contain _Listeria_\u201a but the sequence type has yet to be confirmed (https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/consumer-live/2018-03-04-listeriosis-what-to-do-with-your-enterprise-or-rainbow-polony/).\n\nWe are told that polony, made by Enterprise Food, would be recalled from stores, but are not given identification markings.

In the last week alone, 57 people died from the food-borne disease, bringing the death toll to over 160. The source of the outbreak remains unknown.\n\nThe manner in which food is prepared in businesses and in homes has been under the spotlight since the outbreak of the disease in December 2017. Fruit and vegetables must be washed well and meat cooked thoroughly.\n\nBut awareness of the outbreak remains low. 'Somebody preparing food in Pretoria to a small group of people will not have that food available in the Northern Cape, for example, so I doubt very much that it's a preparation process in a home kitchen. I believe this is a processed product of some sort that is distributed across the entire country,' said food safety expert Dr Lucia Anelich. Anelich believes processed foods and cold meats and ready-made salads found at local delis could be the culprit for the outbreak. 'Environmental hygiene from an industry perspective is really important ... to find it and to kill it so it doesn't continuously contaminate different products.'\n\nAnother expert believes taking charge of how your food is being prepared is the safest bet. 'If it's been made outside of your control, keep yourself away from that. Get into the habit of cooking thoroughly and make sure you have handled your own food, because that is the only way you can be under control until we hear more about sources of infection,' said Unisa researcher, Dr Prudence Kayoka-Kabongo.\n\nWhile the National Institute for Communicable Diseases tries to locate the source of the outbreak, over 800 cases in all 9 provinces have been confirmed. The majority of deaths, 98, have occurred in Gauteng.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 16 Feb 2018\nSource: Food Safety News [edited]\nhttp://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/listeria-south-africa/#.Womo98aZPjA\n\n\nIn the midst of the largest listeriosis outbreak to date in the world, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) is asking victims in South Africa to list everything they can remember eating in the past month with the hopes of identifying a source.\n\nOf the 872 confirmed cases, 164 people have died, 43 percent of whom were babies less than a month old.\n\n'Given the scale of our mystery outbreak, it has led to what one delegate termed 'listeria hysteria', at a listeriosis workshop hosted by the South African Association of Food Science and Technology (SAAFoST) in Johannesburg on Wednesday [14 Feb 2018],' according to a story from The Times in Johannesburg.\n\nLucia Anelich, SAAFoST president, said given that a single, unique 'homegrown' strain of listeriosis was identified in more than 90 percent of the confirmed cases, it was likely that the source was a single food product or range of food products consumed often and by both rich and poor across South Africa; 'Cold meats, for example, range from Viennas and polony to more expensive slices of ham.'\n\nSince proper cooking temperatures kill _Listeria_, the food source is thought to be a fruit, vegetables, or a ready-to-eat food item.

A commercial meat slicer, the design of which made its regular cleaning difficult and costly for the food processor, contaminated the deli meat products. The contamination occurred in parts of the machinery 'well beyond the [manufacturer's] recommended sanitation process' and was 'found only after the devices were completely disassembled' (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/maple-leaf-eyes-meat-slicers-in-outbreak/article1060898/). The contaminated ready-to eat meat products were distributed to institutions that included hospitals and long-term care homes, where ready-to eat meat products were served to vulnerable populations. Of the 57 cases, 54 were elderly people in hospitals and long-term care homes. Cultures at the processing plant were positive for _Listeria_ for months before the outbreak started, and authorities weren't alerted to suspect the plant's deli meats for more than 2 months after the outbreak began. ProMED-mail reported on this outbreak in several posts in 2008 and one in 2009 (see also's below).\n\nThe following is extracted from the Executive Summary of the 'Report of the independent investigator into the 2008 listeriosis outbreak, July 2009.' Interested readers are encouraged to access the full report at http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2009/agr/A22-508-2009E.pdf.\n\n'1. The focus on food safety among senior management in both the public and private domains.\nOur key findings are:\nMaple Leaf Foods\n----------------\n- Maple Leaf Foods' Bartor Road plant was aware that it had occurrences of _Listeria_ in the plant in 2007 and 2008, and tried to correct the problem with sanitation procedures standard in the industry. The plant's management thought _Listeria_ was under control. (Chap 5, Rec 5, 15 a to d)\n\n- Maple Leaf Foods did not conduct the trend analysis required under its _Listeria_ control policy. The recurring positive results were not known nor were the positive results verified to determine the presence/absence of _L. monocytogenes_. At the same time, the company was producing larger packages of deli-meat products for sale to institutions, including hospitals and long-term care homes. They had created a recipe that used less sodium, which was attractive to the institutional market as many of its clients benefited from reduced-sodium diets. This combination of circumstances exposed vulnerable populations to risk. (Chap 5, Rec 15 e, 21)\n\n- Maple Leaf Foods staff notified their superiors of the repeated presence of _Listeria_ beyond the Bartor Road plant into the Head Office. However, this information did not reach the office of the Chief Executive Officer because it was thought that the plant's interventions had controlled the problem. (Chap 5, Rec 1)\n\n- Employees in the Maple Leaf Foods Bartor Road plant were not required to, nor did they volunteer, information concerning the repeated occurrences of _Listeria_ in the plant to the CFIA Inspectors. (Chap 5, Rec 6)\n\nCanadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)\n--------------------------------------\n- A new federal inspection approach, the Compliance Verification System (CVS), was put into effect in the spring of 2008, at the same time Maple Leaf Foods' environmental testing was identifying _Listeria_ at the Bartor Road plant (Chap 5, Rec 10)\n\n- Although the CVS is regarded as a sound system and has broad support, it needs critical improvements related to its design, planning, and implementation. (Chap 5, Rec 10)\n\n- The CFIA inspectors had no obligation to request or examine the company's _Listeria_ testing results under their CVS tasks. (Chap 5, Rec 20)\n\n- In the lead-up to the outbreak the number, capacity, and training of inspectors assigned to Maple Leaf Foods Bartor Road plant appear to have been stressed due to their responsibilities at other plants, the complexity of the Bartor Road plant, including its size and hours of operation, and necessary adjustments required by the implementation of the CVS. (Chap 5, Rec 7)\n\n- Due to the lack of detailed information and differing views heard, the investigation was not able to determine the current level of resources as well as the resources needed to conduct the CVS activities effectively. For the same reason, we were also unable to come to a conclusion concerning the adequacy of the program design, implementation plan, training and supervision of inspectors, as well as oversight and performance monitoring. (Chap 5, Rec 7)\n\n- The latest CFIA _Listeria_ controls do not distinguish between foods at much lower risk of harbouring _Listeria_ (such as dried sausages) and those that are much higher risk (such as hot-dogs). Furthermore, they do not establish 'test and hold' product controls. (Chap 5, Rec 15 d)\n\n- There is a need for increased coordination and improved communication about food processing equipment among the manufacturer, the food processor, and the CFIA regarding design specifications and the validation of sanitation procedures. (Chap 5, Rec 14)\n\nHealth Canada\n-------------\n- The Health Canada _L. monocytogenes_ policy (currently under review) does not provide adequate direction on expected outcomes leaving room for interpretation by industry. The lack of integration with the CFIA policies creates gaps and overlaps. (Chap 5, Rec 11)\n\n- In approving food additives and technologies, Health Canada has not been taking into account food safety considerations when assigning priorities or fast-tracking for approval these substances and processes. (Chap 5, Rec 12)\n\nMulti-jurisdictional emergency response\n---------------------------------------\nNational foodborne outbreaks are rare in Canada. Nevertheless, the Foodborne Illness Outbreak Response Protocol (FIORP) and complementary agreements are in place to manage such events but they were not widely known or understood by senior leadership at the time of the 2008 outbreak. (Chap 5, Rec 24)\n\n'2. The state of readiness of the various governments.\nOur key findings are:\nMulti-jurisdictional emergency response\n---------------------------------------\n- The 2008 outbreak first emerged in Ontario and was therefore under provincial leadership.\n\n- At the outset, the outbreak was not considered a severe foodborne emergency. This led to a void in leadership in managing the crisis. It took close to 3 weeks before senior executives in all key organizations became fully engaged in the event. (Chap 7, Rec 24 b-i)\n\n- The protocol (FIORP), which is in need of updating, was not recognized as the protocol to be used. The lack of a clear understanding about which organization or level of government was responsible for doing what -- including which organization should lead the response to the crisis -- contributed to the inconsistent management of the outbreak. Few of those involved in the 2008 outbreak, especially senior executives, were familiar with the FIORP. (Chap 7, Rec 24)\n\n- Since national foodborne illness outbreaks of this magnitude are rare in Canada, opportunities to practice this emergency management approach are very limited. (Chap 7, Rec 24 c)\n\n- Public health labs are not formally networked and could be more effectively used during a foodborne illness emergency. (Chap 7, Rec 33)\n\n- The Public Health Agency of Canada is making headway in epidemiological data collection and analysis in cases of human illness (such as H1N1), but improvements are still required in integrating the data collection, and analysis, of food samples (such as listeriosis). (Chap 7, Rec 35 c)\n\n- Enhanced coordination of various testing (such as cross-coding of human and food samples linked to the same patient) could further accelerate the analysis and decision-making necessary in the management of foodborne emergencies. (Chap 7, Rec 35 a)\n\n- Based on our investigation, to maintain confidence in the food safety system, there is a need for independent review after all national foodborne emergencies, in addition to each organization's lessons learned review. (Chap 7, rec 27)\n\n- Most organizations involved in the response to the 2008 outbreak had very limited pre-planned surge capacity. (Chap 7, Rec 24 b-iii and 34 b)\n\n'3. The sense of urgency at the outset of the outbreak.\nOur key findings are:\nMaple Leaf Foods\n----------------\n- Maple Leaf Foods did not initially report the presence of _Listeria_ at the Bartor Road plant or provide product distribution records. (Chap 5, Rec 6)\nPublic Health Agency of Canada\n\nPublic Health Agency of Canada\n-------------------------------\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada did not consider it had the federal leadership role, therefore there was a delay in identifying the outbreak as a public health emergency. (Chap 7, Rec 24 b-i)\n\nHealth Canada\n-------------\n- Health Canada's Health Risk Assessment team was not operating on a 24/7 basis during the summer of 2008, leaving gaps in coverage during the response to the emergency. (Chap 9, Appendix C)\n\nPublic health and food safety sectors\n-------------------------------------\n- There are differing views on the quality of evidence needed to advise the public about potential food contamination and/or to recall the food product. Some advocate specific laboratory confirmation to ensure the correct product is removed from the market. Others advocate for a precautionary approach, based on epidemiological evidence, to protect the public from potential harm. (Chap 7, Rec 24 b-iv, 29)\n\n'4. National communications with the public.\nOur key findings are:\n- Canadians were seeking reassurance from governments that public health was being protected.\n\n- Information about the outbreak did not provide the public with what they needed; it was sometimes inconsistent given the many jurisdictions involved, sometimes hard to find and sometimes difficult to understand. (Chap 8, Rec 26, 40)\n\n- The majority of Canadians were unaware which segments of the population were at greater risk of becoming ill if exposed to _Listeria monocytogenes_, and what foods these vulnerable groups should avoid (such as pointing to the need for precautionary labelling). (Chap 8, Rec 42)\n\n- There was an absence of an 'advance' communications strategy and related implementation plan, that should have included ready-made information products and the use of traditional and new media vehicles. (Chap 8, Rec 41)\n\n- Federal communications to the public were slow off the mark, and were not sustained for a sufficient period of time. In addition, there was no designated communications coordinator, which resulted in a fragmented approach and seemingly inconsistent messaging.\n\n- Having the Minister responsible for Agriculture and Agri-food and the CFIA serve as the lead ministerial spokesperson, was considered by some to be a 'conflict of interest' even though the minister has a legitimate role in relation to the food industry. It appeared to limit government's capacity to communicate health information sought by the public. The perceived lack of federal public health leadership during the outbreak attracted many comments. (Chap 8)\n\n- The greatest challenges for physicians in educating patients about minimizing risks of foodborne illness are lack of patient-friendly materials (77 percent), lack of knowledge about the outbreak (69 percent), and lack of time (69 percent).

Earlier this month [January 2018], there had been speculation that one of South Africa's major poultry producers, Sovereign Foods, based at Hartbeespoort in the Eastern Cape, could be involved in the outbreak. Environmental health officers visited Sovereign Foods' abattoirs to collect food samples, but these samples did not pick up the ST6 strain, although the tests found other strains with the potential to cause disease.\n\nSouth Africa's Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said that as the abattoir had _Listeria_, the abattoir was prohibited from further preparing food pending a deep clean. The abattoir was closed on 22 Dec 2017 but reopened on 9 Jan [2018]. Blaine van Rensberg, Sovereign Foods' head of production, said the company was further strengthening steps to render products safer than 'they already are.'\n\nFood safety experts Dr Lucia Anelich said the 'culprit' was most likely a product consumed 'extremely often' across the country.

This would eliminate the bacteria from the food production environment, otherwise, the contamination would continue until investigations provided clues as to the likely source.\n\nThomas and her team at the NICD have identified the ST6 strain of the disease as the main [one] for the current outbreak, out of 8 other sequence types. According to Motsoaledi, this confirmed the current working hypothesis of a single source of food contamination causing the outbreak.\n\nExplaining the strain's particular impact on humans, Thomas said: 'In persons who develop meningitis (infection of the brain) due to _Listeria monocytogenes_, the ST6 in particular causes more severe disease than the other sequence types.'\n\nBut the disease's main victims have been babies. Infants less than 28 days old account for close to 40 percent of cases so far in the country. Infants are especially vulnerable from birth to 6 days after birth.\n\nDue to the rapid spread and the unusual behaviour of the disease, it has now been classified as a priority, which requires medical professionals to immediately report it to the department. Prior to this outbreak, medical staff treated about 80 cases annually that were not severe.\n\nLast month [December 2017], environmental health practitioners from the City of Tshwane investigated a Tshwane patient hospitalised with listeriosis and collected a chicken sample from the fridge at the patient's home. It tested positive for _Listeria monocytogenes_. The sample was traced back to the store and back to the Sovereign Foods' abattoir from which it was sourced. As a precaution, the abattoir was served with a prohibition notice pending further investigations.\n\nHowever, following whole-genome sequencing on the abattoir-related samples (a DNA-fingerprinting analysis to see whether particular organisms are related and were of the same sequence type), experts didn't pick up the outbreak strain (ST6). 'At this juncture, we cannot conclude that the abattoir called Sovereign Foods is the source of the present outbreak,' Mostoaledi explained.\n\nThe department said it was also an arduous process tracking the patients with confirmed cases of the disease. Currently, of the 748 lab-confirmed cases, the outbreak team has only traced the outcomes of 160 patients. According to the department, tracking the patients from the health facility that had the specimen was not easy because some did not have traceable physical addresses.\n\nMostoaledi said food premises within Gauteng -- with the highest number of cases at 442 -- would be inspected, targeting the food processing areas such as abattoirs and food retail shops.\n\nThe Director-General of the National Department of Health has formally requested food industry stakeholders to submit details of _Listeria_-positive food items, environmental swabs, and _Listeria_ isolates to the NICD.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When last reported by ProMED-mail (Listeriosis - South Africa: fatal, increasing incidence, ST6 Archive Number: 20180108.5545556), there were a total of 720 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases, including 61 deaths.

Most cases have been reported from Gauteng Province (62%, 345/557) followed by Western Cape (13%, 71/557) and KwaZulu-Natal (7%, 37/557) provinces. In the majority of cases, diagnosis was based on the isolation of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in blood culture (69%, 386/557), followed by CSF (26%, 146/557). Where age was reported (n=540), ages range from birth to 93 years (median 26 years) and 37% (203/540) are neonates aged 28 days and under (Figure 2). Of neonatal cases, 96% (195/203) had early-onset disease (birth to 6 days or less). Females account for 53% (286/538) of cases where gender is reported. Provincial distribution of cases by district is shown in Figure 3.\n\nClinical findings\n---------------------\nAs of 29 Nov 2017, case investigation forms (CIFs) of variable completeness have been received for 192 cases. Apart from neonates (28 days and under) and the elderly (over 65 years), additional risk factors for listeriosis reported include pregnancy (10/39 females aged 15-49 years) and HIV infection status. In non-neonatal cases where HIV status was known (n=63), 62% (39/63) were HIV positive. Maternal HIV status is known for 57 neonatal cases, of which 22/57 (38%) were HIV positive. Final outcome data is available for 12% (70/557) of cases, of which 51% (36/70) died. Limited food consumption history data are available, and indicate that a wide variety of food items documented to have caused previous outbreaks/clusters of listeriosis (including dairy products, meat products, vegetables, fruit, and ready-to-eat products) were commonly consumed, and no specific food item/s or food consumption patterns that could guide targeted environmental investigations have been identified as yet.\n\nReference laboratory findings\n-----------------------------\nTo date, whole genome sequencing has been performed on 189 clinical _L. monocytogenes_ isolates. 15 sequence types (STs) have been identified; however, 71% (134/189) belong to a single ST (ST6). Isolates in this ST6 cluster are very closely related, showing under 20 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences. This suggests that most cases in this outbreak have had exposure to a widely available, common food type/source.\n\nNarrative summary of actions to date\n------------------------------------\nEpidemiology and surveillance\n- The line list database of listeriosis cases is updated daily with data from NHLS Central Data Warehouse (CDW) downloads as well as direct reports of listeriosis cases detected at private sector laboratories.\n- Case investigations forms (CIFs) are currently being completed by numerous healthcare workers in public and private sectors, including GERMS-SA surveillance officers at enhanced surveillance site hospitals (public sector), clinical microbiologists (public sector), IPC practitioners at private sector hospitals, and Department of Health officials. Data from CIFs are entered into the database. All healthcare practitioners (clinicians, nurses, IPC practitioners, pathologists, Department of Health officials etc.) are encouraged to complete CIFs where possible, since identification of possible contaminated food types/sources will be guided by analysis of this data. The CIF with accompanying instruction sheet can be found on the NICD website at http://www.nicd.ac.za, and completed CIFs emailed to <outbreak@nicd.ac.za>.\n- A team of NICD epidemiologists has compiled a comprehensive food item checklist and is conducting in-depth interviews of case-patients in Gauteng Province when feasible in order to ascertain detailed food consumption histories. To date, 5 such interviews have been conducted. This information will hopefully assist us in drafting a concise food consumption questionnaire, which can easily be administered by an interviewer or completed by case-patients themselves.\n\nClinical management\n- Clinical listeriosis management guidelines have been drafted and are currently under review. If you would like to view the draft and provide comment, please email <outbreak@nicd.ac.za>.\n\nLaboratory diagnostics and investigations\n- Private and public sector laboratories are submitting clinical isolates to the NICD Centre for Enteric Diseases (CED). Please email <arvindas@nicd.ac.za>, <junot@nicd.ac.za> or <karenk@nicd.ac.za> should you have queries or require assistance.\n- For cases where there is a high clinical index of suspicion for listeriosis but specimens (blood culture or CSF) are culture negative, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test can be performed at the NICD. Please contact <anthonys@nicd.ac.za>, <arvindas@nicd.ac.za>, <junot@nicd.ac.za> or <karenk@nicd.ac.za> for further details.\n- All _L. monocytogenes_ isolates from food samples tested at the NHLS Infection Control Services Laboratory are routinely submitted to the CED.\n- Selected private sector food testing laboratories have voluntarily submitted _L. monocytogenes_ isolates (from anonymised food samples and food processing facilities) to the CED.\n- All isolates of _L. monocytogenes_ received at the CED are subjected to confirmatory identification tests, and are stored.\n- Whole genome sequencing is being performed on all clinical isolates and selected food/environmental isolates.\n\nFood control and environmental health\n- The Director General of the National Department of Health has formally requested food industry stakeholders to submit _Listeria_ isolates to the NICD, along with details of _Listeria_-positive food/food processing environmental samples.\n- Environmental health practitioners have been requested to visit homes of persons diagnosed with listeriosis and sample food from their refrigerators. These specimens must be submitted to the NHLS Infection Control Services Laboratory in Johannesburg. Please email Rob Stewart (<rob.stewart@nhls.ac.za>) or Teena Thomas (<teena.thomas@nhls.ac.za>) for details regarding specimen submission.\n\nCommunications\n- The NICD has made information available on the website regarding listeriosis, including Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), clinical management guidance, and laboratory testing methodology. These can be accessed at http://www.nicd.ac.za/index.php/listeriosis/.\n- The Food Control Division within the National Department of Health has distributed information about the outbreak to food industry stakeholders.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nEpiCore Global Surveillance Project member\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Irene Lai, from SOS International, and an EpiCore member for their submissions of the above reports in response to the RFI.\n\nIn summary, most laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis in South Africa have been reported from Gauteng Province (62%, 345/557), where cases started to increase around epidemiological week 23 (4-10 Jun 2017) when 5 cases occurred in that week to epidemiological week 46 (12-18 Nov 2017) when over 20 cases occurred (item 1, figure 9 at the source URL.) 37% (203/540) are neonates aged 28 days or less.

The Conversation Africa's Health and Medicine Editor Candice Bailey spoke to Kerrigan McCarthy from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases about listeriosis and why it needs attention.\n\nIn South Africa, the 1st documented outbreaks of listeriosis were in 1977. Between August 1977 and April 1978, 14 cases were reported in the Johannesburg area. Since then, sporadic cases have occurred throughout the country. For example, between January 2015 and September 2015 7 cases were reported at a tertiary hospital in the Western Cape province.\n\nOver the last few months the National Institute for Communicable Diseases has received reports of a marked increase in the number of cases across the country, but particularly in the Gauteng Province, South Africa's smallest but most densely populated province.\n\nThere have been 190 confirmed cases across the country. In Gauteng, the population incidence rates have increased from 2 per million to 8 per million. The highest incidence has been recorded in the City of Johannesburg at 12 cases per million. This is not as high as the number of people who get meningococcal meningitis or pulmonary tuberculosis, but the consequences are just as serious.\n\nOf the 122 cases in Gauteng, over 60 percent are newborn babies that have been infected.\n\nThe institute is trying to establish what the source of the infection is so that measures can be put in place to prevent further cases. Mothers who have been infected with the bacteria are being interviewed and the institute is also engaging with the food service quality industry.\n\nOutbreaks of _Listeria_ in food are common across the world. Outbreaks of listeriosis across the world present the same problem: that the source of contaminated food is difficult to identify. There are 2 reasons for this:\n- firstly, the incubation period of 70 days makes it difficult to track what the patient ate and therefore to identify the contaminated food;\nand\n- secondly, once the food source is narrowed down, tests need to be conducted on the range of possible foods to establish which is the implicated one. Only once authorities are able to identify the source are they able implement measures to prevent further cases.\n\nThere is no vaccine or pre-exposure prophylaxis that can prevent infection. The main preventive measure is good basic hygiene, and proper, safe food preparation and storage.\n\nUnlike most other foodborne pathogens, _Listeria monocytogenes_ can grow in refrigerated foods that are contaminated. To prevent this, fridge temperatures should be set below 4 deg C [about 39 deg F]; and freezer temperatures below -18 deg C [about 0 deg F].\n\nThose at high risk of listeriosis should avoid: raw or unpasteurised milk, or dairy products that contain unpasteurized milk; soft cheeses like feta, goat cheese, and brie; foods from delicatessen counters like prepared salads and cold meats that have not been heated and reheated adequately; [and] refrigerated p\u00e2t\u00e9s.\n\nAdditional measures include thoroughly cooking raw foods from animal sources, such as beef, pork, or poultry. Raw fruit and vegetables should be thoroughly washed before eating. And surfaces where food is prepared should be decontaminated regularly, particularly after preparing raw meat, poultry, and eggs, including industrial kitchens.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Gauteng, one of the 9 provinces of South Africa, is the smallest and most populous, with a population of over 13 million residents, containing the country's largest city, Johannesburg, its administrative capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauteng).\n\nGenotyping _Listeria_ isolates is important to identify transmission pathways.

'Of the documented outbreaks globally that we know of ... our numbers are way above any of those other cases,' said Dr Lucia Anelich, who runs her own food safety consultancy.\n\nThe Department of Health said it had closed a poultry abattoir operated by Sovereign Foods in the capital Pretoria after detecting _Listeria_ there, and had banned it from preparing food. The department said it did not yet know whether this abattoir was the source of the outbreak, which the NICD said was still unknown.\n\nNo one at Sovereign Foods, which delisted from the Johannesburg stock exchange in November [2017], was immediately available for comment.\n\n_Listeria_ food poisoning is a bacterial infection that can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed in time. The bacteria can be found in animal products including cold cut meats, poultry and unpasteurised milk, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables. The disease can cause flu-like symptoms and diarrhoea, and in more severe cases spread from the intestine to the blood, causing bloodstream infections, or to the central nervous system, causing meningitis.\n\nAnelich said a listeriosis strain known as ST6 had been identified in 9 out of 10 of the South African cases. That should make tracing the source easier, 'because now we know that it probably originates from one processing facility'.\n\nA health department official said the strain was not drug-resistant and that the deaths were due to delays in diagnosis, meaning cases were not treated in time.\n\n[Byline: Mfuneko Toyana, Kate Kelland, John Stonestreet]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 7 Jan 2018\nSource: Times LIVE [edited]\nhttps://www.timeslive.co.za/news/2018-01-07-listeriosis-flare-up-now-seen-as-worst-documented-outbreak-in-global-history/\n\n\nIn the past month\u201a another 167 people have contracted deadly listeriosis\u201a bringing the total number of confirmed cases in South Africa to 717.\n\nFood scientists are now calling it the worst documented listeriosis outbreak in global history.

Less than 1% of people who get _Salmonella_ or _E. coli_ O157 die as a result. Neonates -- babies less than 28 days old -- remain the most affected by listeriosis.\n\nA prohibition notice has been issued to an abattoir in the Tshwane area halting it from distributing meat after samples taken from it tested positive. The outbreak is across all 9 provinces, and clinical tests have revealed that the _Listeria_ originates from a single source, 'most likely a food product on the market or a series of food products produced in the same manufacturing environment\u201a' says Dr Lucia Anelich\u201a a prominent South African food microbiologist and food safety expert.\n\nThe City of Tshwane's environmental health practitioners recently traced the source of a hospitalised Tshwane man's listeriosis to chicken supplied to a store by a certain abattoir. Samples they took from the abattoir tested positive for _Listeria monocytogenes_, and the abattoir was closed pending further investigations.\n\n'Although _Listeria monocytogenes_ has been found in a specific abattoir\u201a precise confirmation of the strain is still required\u201a' Anelich says. 'Much work needs to be done to match the outbreak strain with food products originating from the same manufacturing environment\u201a including clear evidence that the apparently contaminated food was ingested by the majority of people across 9 provinces. As things stand\u201a the source of this outbreak is still not known.' The significance of isolating _L. monocytogenes_ from raw poultry\u201a which is cooked before consumption\u201a thus killing the bacterium\u201a is questionable\u201a Anelich says.\n\n[Byline: Wendy Knowler]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 3 Jan 2018\nSource: Centre for Enteric Diseases (CED) and Division of Public Health Surveillance and Response, Outbreak Response Unit (ORU), National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD)/ National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) [edited]\nhttp://www.nicd.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/NICD-Situation-report-on-listeriosis-outbreak-South-Africa_03-January-2018.pdf\n\n\nSituation Report on Listeriosis Outbreak South Africa, 2017-2018\n-----------------------\nCase data and outbreak response activity summary is the best available at time of publication and are updated on an ongoing basis.\n\nDue to recent challenges with NHLS laboratory information system data (since epidemiological week 47) and a possible lag in reporting as a result of the public holidays, case numbers for weeks 47-52 of 2017 are likely to change on a daily basis, and trends must be interpreted with caution until it has been confirmed that all cases have been captured.\n\nDescriptive epidemiology\n----------------\nAs of 3 Jan 2018, a total of 717 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases have been reported to NICD since 1 Jan 2017 (Figure 1). Most cases have been reported from Gauteng Province (61%, 436/717) followed by Western Cape (13%, 92/717) and KwaZulu-Natal (7%, 50/717) provinces. Cases have been diagnosed in both public (66%, 470/717) and private (34%, 247/717) healthcare sectors. Diagnosis was based most commonly on the isolation of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in blood culture (70%, 502/717), followed by CSF (24%, 175/717). Where age was reported (n=683), ages range from birth to 93 years (median 26 years) and 39% (268/683) are neonates aged 28 days and under (Figure 2). Of neonatal cases, 96% (258/268) had early-onset disease (birth to 6 days and under). Females account for 55% (382/692) of cases where gender is reported.\n\nAs of 2 Jan 2018, case investigation forms (CIFs) of variable completeness have been received for 264/712 (37%) cases. Apart from neonates (28 days and under) and the elderly (over 65 years), additional risk factors for listeriosis reported include pregnancy (15/61 females aged 15-49 years where pregnancy status known) and HIV infection status (44/120 cases with known HIV infection status are HIV-positive). Final outcome data is available for only 19% (134/712) of cases, of which 45% (61/134) died.\n\nRecent developments\n--------------------\nEnvironmental Health Practitioners from the City of Tshwane recently investigated a Tshwane patient hospitalised with listeriosis. A chicken sample collected from the fridge at the patient's home tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_. This chicken was traced back to the store, and from there traced back to the abattoir it was sourced from. The Environmental Health Practitioners visited the abattoir and collected food and environmental samples, several of which tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_. As a precaution, the abattoir was closed pending further investigations. The abattoir-related _L. monocytogenes_ are undergoing WGS to assess whether they are related to the ST6 outbreak strain or not; these results will be available during the week.\n\nAt present, the source of the outbreak is not known, so it is uncertain which food/s may be implicated. Cases of listeriosis will continue to be investigated, with trace back and further investigation of any positive food/environmental samples.\n\nUpdate on whole genome sequencing analysis\n---------------------------------------\nWhole genome sequencing of currently available clinical and food-related (food and food production facility environmental sample) isolates received since 1 Jan 2017 is ongoing. As of 3 Jan 2018, of the 337 isolates sequenced to date, 73% (247/337) are clinical isolates, 22% (74/337) are food isolates, and 5% (16/337) are food production environment isolates.\n\nThe clinical isolates are represented by 9 sequence types (ST1, ST101, ST2, ST219, ST5, ST54, ST6, ST8 and ST876); however, 91% (225/247) are sequence type 6 (ST6) and are very closely related, representing a single strain of _L. monocytogenes_ - i.e. the outbreak strain. This ST6 strain has been identified in isolates from all 9 provinces, and this finding supports the current working hypothesis of a single source of food contamination causing the outbreak, i.e. a single widely consumed food product, or multiple food products produced at a single facility.\n\nThe food and environmental samples are represented by 18 sequence types, 4 of which (ST1, ST101, ST2 and ST5) are STs also represented in the clinical isolates. However, no ST6 food/environmental isolates have been identified to date.\n\n[The figure and 'Narrative summary of actions to date' are available at the source URL. - Mod.ML]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When last reported by ProMED-mail (Listeriosis - South Africa (04): fatal, increasing incidence 20171217.5508986), there were a total of 602 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases, including 40 deaths.

At a media briefing in Pretoria today [Tue 5 Dec 2017], Motsoaledi announced that there is an outbreak of listeriosis - a disease caused by a bacterium found in soil, water and vegetation, which contaminates food sources such as animal products and fresh produce.\n\nThe minister said those who contract the disease will have flu-like symptoms including diarrhoea, fever, general body pains and weakness. He said the disease can cause meningitis, which is an infection of the brain and septicemia which is an infection of the blood stream, both can be fatal. However, Motsoaledi stressed that while the disease is serious and dangerous, it is treatable with antibiotics and urged that anyone who is showing symptoms should get medical help immediately. 'If you encounter the symptoms I've mentioned please rush to look for medical help, in other words don't just assume and sit at home especially if you get flu like symptoms now in summer.'\n\nMotsoaledi said that tracing as far back as [1 Jan 2017] up until [29 Nov 2017], 557 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported. Of the 557 cases, the department of health has found the final outcome of 70 confirmed cases of listeriosis. 'Of these 70 cases, 36 persons have perished,' said Motsoaledi.\n\nThe Head of the Centre for Enteric Diseases at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), Dr Juno Thomas, said the number of deaths will increase as they receive final outcome data on the reported cases.\n\nMotsoaledi added that whilst anyone can get the diseases, which has a mortality rate of between 20 and 30 percent, those at a high risk of developing the disease are newborns, the elderly, pregnant women and people with weak immunity systems such as HIV or cancer sufferers.\n\nThe World Health Organisation has advised on food safety measures which includes; that people should keep clean especially when handling food, food should be cooked thoroughly; raw food should not be eaten; use safe water, keep food at safe temperatures and use pasteurized milk products.\n\nThe source of the outbreak is currently being investigated, but Motsoaledi said it's believed that this particular outbreak is from a food source that is being consumed by both the rich and the poor, and the contamination points may well be farms and food processing plants. 'All the stakeholders are cooperating with the investigation led by the NICD. Environmental health officers are following up diagnosed cases and are visiting their homes to sample food where available,' said Motsoaledi.\n\n_Listeria_ typically occurs every year, with between 60 - 80 cases detected and treated annually, however, in July this year [2017], the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg and Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria alerted the NICD to unusually high numbers of babies with listeriosis.\n\nOut of the 557 cases reported, 345 cases were reported in Gauteng, followed by the Western Cape which reported 71 cases, and 37 cases of listeriosis reported in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nMembers of the public can contact the NICD emergency operations centre during working hours (011 386 2000) or the NICD hotline for clinical emergencies after hours (082 883 9920).\n\n[Byline: Alex Mitchley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When ProMED-mail last posted on this outbreak, there were 122 cases of listeriosis in the province of Gauteng (mostly in the city of Johannesburg), over 60 percent of which are newborn babies, with 190 cases in South Africa as a whole (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - South Africa: increasing incidence 20171025.5402225).

The tragedy is 1 of 7 cases of listeriosis reported in the last 3 weeks. Victoria typically only deals with a single case of listeria every 2 to 3 weeks. All of the other patients have either already left hospital or their conditions are regarded as improving.\n\nA Health Department investigation found no links between any of the 7 cases and a different strain of the listeriosis bacteria was responsible for each, raising concerns of wider problems over the coming weeks.\n\n'Although it's hard to piece together exactly the pattern over summer for listeriosis, all the kind of things that create risk are present -- higher temperatures, food is left out longer, soft foods, rich foods, foods left where it's not safe -- so it seems like this is a time to be mindful of the food safety messages,' Victoria's acting Chief Health Officer Dr Finn Romanes said.\n\n'Pregnant women and their foetuses, newborn babies, the elderly and those who are immune compromised ... those groups are particularly at risk, they have a 30 percent fatality rate and these bacteria can end up in their blood, in joints and in meningitis and a serious brain infection.'\n\nHealth Minister Jill Hennessy reiterated the warning for all Victorians follow simple safety measures. 'Preventing food poisoning can be as simple as washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water and making sure food is prepared and stored safely -- if you're sick, avoid parties and preparing food for at least 24 hours afterwards,' she said.\n\nThose in high-risk groups are warned to avoid soft cheeses, ready-to-eat seafood such as cooked chilled prawns, smoked fish, oysters or raw seafood, pre-prepared salads and sandwiches, drinks made from fresh fruit and vegetables and unpasteurised dairy products or soft-serve ice cream.\n\nA Chief Health Officer Advisory sent to doctors today called for all health professionals to take extra precautions when dealing with pregnant women presenting with fever, fatigue and muscle aches, and consider the possibility of [listeriosis] being the cause.\n\nDoctors have been requested to take a clinical sample [blood sample for culture?] of patients fitting the profile to test for listeriosis.\n\nDepartment of Health's top 10 food safety tips\n----------------------------------------------\n1. Wash your hands with soap and water before handling food\n2. Keep your utensils, cutting boards, dishes and containers clean and dry\n3. Store food at the correct temperatures.

The investigation by the DDPP Loire (Department for Protection of Populations) revealed that the infection had come from cheese consumed during the meal. The 2 seniors are on antibiotic treatment and were supported by the ARS (Regional Health Agency).\n\nCheese had been made from raw cow's milk and mixed cow and goat milk under the name of 'Camembel' from the cheese maker Puillet. The cheese has been recalled and production had been stopped. Cleaning and disinfection of the entire manufacturing process is underway. Different surface sampling and monitoring products have yet to be analyzed. The establishment will resume production when the safety will be assured and validated by the DDPP. 'The controls are very strict, since consumer safety is at stake,' said Patrick Rubi, deputy director of the DDPP.\n\nThe manager of the dairy remains dubious: 'We do not know where it comes from or how it could be contaminated. It's been over 20 years since we started (the business) and it never happened before. It is really hurting our business.'\n\nPatrick Rubi says that the management of the cheese business is fully cooperating: 'The management has implemented all necessary measures to find the best possible level of hygiene. He has been very cooperative. This causes big problems for him and it's quite sad. But it was an industrial accident that may happen.' The village mayor, Jean-Luc Matray, himself a farmer, said he was 'reassured that there was no epidemic.'\n\nNote: The last case of listeriosis was detected in a dairy in Sainte-Agathe-la-Bouteresse, in July 2015, almost a year to the day.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Roanne, on the Loire River with a population of 45 105 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanne), and Belmont-de-la-Loire, with a population of about 1500 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont-de-la-Loire), are towns in the Loire Department in central France.

The cheese is distributed nationally and it's all being recalled.\n\n'As many as 6 people infected with the outbreak strain of listeria have been reported from 4 states since [1 Sep 2016],' the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement. 'All 6 people were hospitalized and 2 people from Connecticut and Vermont died. One illness was reported in a newborn. Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery of Walton, New York, is the likely source of this outbreak.' Raw milk that has not been pasteurized can carry bacteria such as listeria.\n\n'CDC recommends that consumers do not eat, restaurants do not serve, and retailers do not sell recalled soft raw milk cheeses made by Vulto Creamery,' the agency said. Vulto Creamery has recalled all lots of Ouleout, Miranda, Heinennellie, and Willowemoc soft wash-rind raw milk cheeses.\n\n'_Listeria monocytogenes_ is a bacterium which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, pregnant women and others with weakened immune systems,' the Food and Drug Administration said. 'Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths and fetal infection among pregnant women.'\n\n[Listeriosis] outbreaks are common. CDC estimates that [listeriosis] puts 1600 people into the hospital each year and kills 260 of them.\n\nThere's a 2nd big recall of cheese going on over listeria fears. This one involves cheese distributed by Deutsch Kase Haus of Middlebury, Indiana and it includes products sold under various brand names, including Sargento, Biery Cheese, Yoke's Fresh Market, Amish Classics, Gussisberg Cheese and others.

Listeria can cause a serious, life-threatening illness. Six people infected with the outbreak strain of listeria have been reported from 4 states since 1 Sep 2016. All 6 people were hospitalized, and 2 people from Connecticut and Vermont died. One illness was reported in a newborn.\n\nEpidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery of Walton, New York is the likely source of this outbreak. Six of 6 people interviewed reported eating various types of soft cheeses in the month before their illness started.\n\nThe outbreak strain of listeria was identified in samples taken from 3 intact wheels of Ouleout cheese collected from Vulto Creamery. On 7 Mar 2017, Vulto Creamery recalled all lots of Ouleout, Miranda, Heinennellie, and Willowemoc soft wash-rind raw milk cheeses. The soft raw milk cheeses were distributed nationwide, with most being sold at retail locations in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, California, Chicago, Portland, Oregon, and Washington DC.\n\nCDC recommends that consumers do not eat, restaurants do not serve, and retailers do not sell recalled soft raw milk cheeses made by Vulto Creamery. This investigation is ongoing. Updates will be provided when more information is available.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 10 Mar 2017\nSource: New York Times [edited]\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/nyregion/two-people-die-after-eating-raw-milk-cheese-made-in-new-york.html?_r=0\n\n\nTwo people have died following an outbreak of listeriosis linked to a popular artisanal raw milk cheese made in upstate New York the authorities said this week.\n\nThe deaths occurred in Vermont and Connecticut, local officials said. Four other people in New York and Florida reported feeling sick after eating Ouleout, the artisanal cheese, which is produced by Vulto Creamery in Walton, NY. Illnesses started on dates between 1 Sep of last year [2016] to 22 Jan 2017, the FDA said. All 6 people were hospitalized, and 2 people died.\n\nVulto Creamery, which produces Ouleout, said it was recalling the product, and, as a precautionary measure, 3 other soft wash-rind raw milk cheeses: Miranda, Heinennellie, and Willowemoc. 'We are very busy working on this recall with FDA and our customers,' the creamery said in an email, without offering details on the cause of the outbreak.\n\nVulto Creamery began contacting clients on 3 Mar [2017], asking them to return purchases of Ouleout after being informed of a listeria strain in a sample, the health department said. It issued a recall on 7 Mar 2017 and extended it to the 3 other brands.\n\nThe deaths highlighted concerns over safety regulations around artisanal cheese production in the United States, particularly around the raw milk cheese segment, which emerged only about a decade ago, experts say. The outbreak has also revived a continuing debate between the virtues of raw milk cheese, which aficionados say tastes better, and safety. Some customers swear only by pasteurized-milk cheese.\n\nEuropeans have eaten raw milk cheese for hundreds of years. In France, for example, 15 per cent of its cheese is made of unpasteurized milk, according to French agricultural statistics. The thinking is that when milk is cooked, or pasteurized, many of the flavor-rich enzymes are destroyed.\n\nOuleout, a soft washed-rind cheese that is aged for 60 days, 'requires real craftsmanship' because it needs to retain a good amount of moisture even as it matures, said Carlos Yescas, program director at Oldways Cheese Coalition, a nonprofit organization that promotes artisanal cheese making. 'Otherwise, the cheese will dry out really quickly.' Washed-rind cheese is made by washing and curing the cheese in beer and other solutions, helping create its pungent flavor.\n\nMore than half of artisanal cheese produced in the US is made of unpasteurized milk, Mr Yescas said, adding that there are a number of ways in which the cheese could be contaminated. Listeria, he said, could originate from the wood boards used to age the cheese, the water supply or improper sanitation, like walking in dirty boots. 'It's hard to pinpoint,' Mr Yescas said.\n\nIn the US, regulations on raw milk cheese are less stringent than in Europe, where more steps are required to ensure that there is no contamination, he said. Here, there is only a single national standard for raw milk cheese production, Mr Yescas said, which requires that the cheese be aged for at least 60 days to block _Escherichia coli_ from developing. 'We need to take a look again at the 60-day rule and have a consensus with the scientific community, regulators and cheese producers,' Mr Yescas said.\n\n[byline: Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Sun 12 Mar 2017\nFrom: Christopher Henry <chrishen@umich.edu> [edited]\n\n\nFDA regulations prohibit the sale across state lines of raw milk itself or of cheeses made from raw milk that have been aged for less than 60 days.

Foods cooked in the microwave may have cold spots where the bacteria could survive. Throw the packages away in a sealed container, or return them to the place of purchase for a refund. Wash your hands well after handling these products.\n\nThen you should clean your refrigerator or freezer with a mild bleach solution of one tablespoon liquid chlorine bleach to one gallon of warm water to kill any bacteria. Rinse any closed and unopened packages of food with this solution as well, then rinse in clear water. _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteria can grow at refrigerator temperatures, and freezing does not kill it.\n\nIf you ate any of these recalled products, watch yourself for the symptoms of _Listeria monocytogenes_ food poisoning for the next 70 days. That is how long it can take for the symptoms to appear, although symptoms usually appear within 3 weeks.\n\nSymptoms of listeriosis include flu-like fever and muscle aches, upset stomach or diarrhea, stiff neck, headache, and loss of balance.

The illnesses happened in 2014, but it took investigators until now to determine the cause. Two patients got sick from the bacteria, one in California and one in Florida, and the patient in Florida died.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday [18 Mar 2016] that the outbreak had been traced to unpasteurized raw milk produced by Miller's Organic Farm in Bird-In-Hand, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn January [2016], the FDA found _Listeria_ in samples of raw chocolate milk produced by the same company and said genetic testing confirmed it was closely related to the strain that sent the 2 patients to the hospital in 2014.\n\nAmos Miller, the owner of Miller's Organic Farm, said the company operates as a private membership club and only supplies milk and other farm-grown products to members. It does not distribute to retail stores or other outlets. Miller told CBS News the company is still selling raw milk and is not aware of any health problems. 'I don't know that it was proved it's on the farm here,' he said. 'We hope and pray for the best.'\n\nPublic health officials have long advised people not to drink raw milk or consume other unpasteurized dairy products because of the risk that it may contain dangerous pathogens like _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, _Escherichia coli_ and _Campylobacter_ bacteria. Pasteurized milk has been heated to high enough temperatures to kill the bacteria.\n\nThere have been a number of other widely publicized listeriosis outbreaks in recent years, including one last year traced to Blue Bell Creameries ice cream which killed 3 people and sickened 10. In 2014, 7 people died from listeriosis in caramel apples.\n\nYoung children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are at highest risk of severe illness from listeriosis. It's also a serious concern for pregnant women as the bacteria can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or life-threatening infections in newborns.\n\nThe CDC says symptoms of listeriosis usually develop within a few days of eating contaminated food and may include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions.

At least 18 people in 9 states have been infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria_. Whole genome sequencing has been performed on samples from all of these people and the bacteria that sickened them are 'highly related' genetically.\n\nAll 18 people sickened in this particular outbreak have been hospitalized. One person has died 'as a result of listeriosis.' according to the CDC. That person lived in Michigan. The most recent illness was diagnosed on [31 Jan 2016], so the outbreak numbers may grow.\n\nThe brand names of the salad mixes include Dole, Fresh Selections, Simple Truth, Marketside, The Little Salad Bar, and President's Choice Organics. The types of salad mixes recalled include American salads, arugula salads, Bacon and bleu cheese salads, BBQ Ranch salad, Caesar salads, Chipotle, and cheddar salads, Coleslaw mix, Field green salads, Garden salads, Iceberg salads, Italian blend salads, Kale salads, Lettuce salads, Mediterranean salads, Romaine salads, Sesame ginger salads, Southwest salads, Spinach Salads, Spring Mix salads, Sunflower salads, and Vegetable blend salads.\n\nWe would list the states where the recalled salads were sold, but we have received reports about them being sold in states not listed on the CDC website, so just look for the letter 'A' at the beginning of the code near the 'Enjoy By' date.\n\nIf you have one of these salads in your fridge, throw it away, wash your hands, then clean out your fridge with a mild bleach solution. The recalled salads should all have expired by now, so they should no longer be in consumers' homes. And Dole halted production at their Springfield, Ohio plant that is the center of this outbreak investigation in mid January. The recalled salad mixes all have number codes that start with the letter 'A'. If you have eaten one of the recalled salads and have experienced the symptoms of listeriosis, the illness caused by this bacteria, see your doctor.\n\nIt's worth noting that while most people get sick within a few weeks of exposure to the pathogenic bacteria, sometimes the illness can be delayed up to 70 days. If you ate one of these salads in January [2016], for instance, be aware of any illness development until late March [2016]. This outbreak actually began back in July 2015, but was not discovered until January 2016.\n\nPeople who are at higher risk for listeriosis include older adults, children, people with weakened immune systems, those with chronic illnesses, and pregnant women, although even healthy people can become sick. The symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, and loss of balance. Pregnant women usually only experience fever or non-specific symptoms such as headache and chills, but listeriosis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature labor, and a serious infection in the newborn.\n\n[Byline: Linda Larsen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above increases the number of US cases in the Dole salad mix listeriosis outbreak from 15 to 18 and the number of states involved from 8 to 9 since the last ProMED-mail post (Listeriosis - USA, Canada (02): fatal, recall, pre-packed salads, same genotype 20160131.3980669).

Blue Bell Creameries has not responded to CNN's request for comment.\n\nAfter weeks of gradual recalls, Blue Bell recalled all its ice cream, frozen yogurt, sherbet and other frozen treats sold in 23 states on 20 Apr 2015, after it said _Listeria_ was found on the lid of a food service cup the month before. However, an investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed the [listeriosis] outbreak dated back to 2010. The agency connected patients from 2010-2015 to the current outbreak through comparisons to a database of bacteria DNA.\n\nThe origin of the strain was then unknown, but 'the fact that it was the same strain over the last 5 years suggests it could have lurked somewhere in the factory the whole time,' Dr. Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the CDC Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases, told CNN last April.\n\nListeriosis is a potentially fatal infection caused by the germ _Listeria_, which is found in soil, water and some animals such as poultry and cattle, including raw milk. It's especially dangerous because, unlike many other germs, it can grow in the cold temperature of a refrigerator or a food processing plant.\n\nThe CDC says older adults, pregnant women, newborns and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk. Pregnant women present with fever, fatigue and body aches, but infection can lead to miscarriage and premature delivery, as well as life-threatening problems in the newborn, including stillbirth. In milder cases, symptoms can range from stiff neck and weakness to fever, vomiting and diarrhea. In older adults and those with compromised immune systems, those symptoms can develop into meningitis or a serious infection of the blood called septicemia.\n\nBlue Bell recently announced plans to continue its market reentry by filling stores with Blue Bell ice cream products in Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, among others, beginning 18 Jan 2016. The company has been reintroducing products since August 2015 in Oklahoma and Texas.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration estimates that every year, 48 million people -- 1 out of 6 Americans -- suffer from food-borne illnesses. More than 128 000 people are hospitalized and about 3000 die from infections the federal government says are largely preventable.\n\nIn September 2015, the CEO of the now-defunct Peanut Corporation of America, Stewart Parnell, was sentenced to 28 years for his role in covering up a 2008 salmonella outbreak that killed 9 and infected another 714 people across 46 states.

Almost all isolates (_Listeria monocytogenes_ serotype 1/2a) belonged to cases living in southern Germany, indicating an outbreak with a so far unknown source. Case numbers in 2015 are high (n\u202f=\u202f28). No outbreak cases outside Germany have been reported. Next generation sequencing revealed the unique cluster type CT1248 and confirmed the outbreak. Investigations into the source are ongoing.\n\nSince November 2012, a previously not observed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern in human isolates of invasive _L. monocytogenes_ serotype 1/2a has been detected in Germany with increasing frequency. Altogether 66 outbreak cases have been recorded, with 28 cases in 2015. 4 cases were pregnancy-associated and 6 cases died in the course of the disease. Here we provide details of the ongoing outbreak.\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\nSince 2009, all German _Listeria_ isolates submitted to the National Reference Centre (NRC) for _Salmonella_ and other bacterial enterics at the Robert-Koch Institute (RKI) or to the Austrian-German binational reference laboratory (KL) for _Listeria_ at the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES), have been tested with PFGE for clonal relationship. Submission of isolates is encouraged by public health authorities but is voluntary without legal obligation. Between November 2012 and November 2015, altogether 793 isolates from notified listeriosis cases were typed, which accounted for 45 percent of all cases in that period (n\u2009=\u20091765). In southern Germany, this proportion was higher (ca 60 percent) and since 2012, human isolates of _L. monocytogenes_ serotype 1/2a with the NRC internal nomenclature of the AscI/ApaI pattern 13a/54 have been observed.\n\nBy 30 Nov 2015, the typing centres had received a total of 69 isolates with the 13a/54 PFGE pattern. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed sequence type 8 (http://www.pasteur.fr/mlst). After exclusion of 3 isolates (see below), next generation sequencing (NGS) was applied to 38 of 66 isolates using a published core genome MLST (cgMLST) [1]. All 38 patient isolates could be allocated to one cluster type (CT1248) (Figure 1).\n\nWe used the following case definition in our investigation: possible outbreak cases were patients with the clinical picture of acute invasive listeriosis with onset since November 2012 with isolation of _Listeria_ from normally sterile body fluids and detection of the characteristic PFGE pattern 13a/54. Confirmed cases were patients meeting the above criteria with isolates assigned to cluster CT1248 in NGS.\n\nAccording to the Protection Against Infection Act of 2001, laboratory confirmation of _Listeria_ from a normally sterile site is notifiable to local health departments which transmit information to RKI. Of the 69 isolates with the 13a/54 PFGE pattern, 66 could be assigned to surveillance cases reported in the mandatory notification system; of those, 38 were confirmed by NGS. Figure 2 illustrates the outbreak cases by month. There was a 1st peak in the 2nd half of 2013, but most cases have occurred since June 2014 (compared with a total of 609 invasive listeriosis cases in Germany in 2014). In 2015, this has so far been the most frequently occurring PFGE pattern among all _Listeria_ isolates in molecular surveillance.\n\nThe geographical distribution was largely confined to the states of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, and Hesse, although PFGE typing is also frequently applied for isolates from the north of Germany (Figure 3). Only one case each was reported from Rhineland-Palatinate and Lower Saxony.\n\nOf the 66 cases, 4 were pregnancy-associated. Among 62 not pregnancy-associated outbreak patients, 32 were men. The outbreak affected 38 senior citizens [aged\u202f70 years or older], 23 younger adults (18-69 years), and one 2-year-old child. They did not differ from other listeriosis surveillance cases not related to the outbreak (n\u2009=\u20091699) with respect to age (p\u2009=\u20090.628) and sex (p\u2009=\u20090.433). Of the 62 cases, 44 suffered from fever 38.5 deg C [101.3 deg F] or higher, 16 had meningitis, 16 had septicaemia, and for 15, other listeriosis-related symptoms were reported. 6 (not pregnancy-associated) cases died; 3 of the deaths were confirmed to be due to listeriosis as the major cause.\n\nThis outbreak was communicated via the European Epidemic Intelligence Information System (EPIS) platform on 17 Jul 2015 and updated on 5 Nov 2015. None of the other participating countries reported cases with the outbreak PFGE pattern or NGS cluster types.\n\nInvestigation into the source of infection\n------------------------------------------\nInitial screening of food-related _Listeria_ isolates in the strain collection of RKI and AGES found a total of 6 isolates (5 from Austria and one from Germany) which had indistinguishable PFGE patterns but belonged to different NGS cluster types (Figure 1). Food consumption histories have been collected from a subset of cases via exploratory interviews by the health authorities since 2013. Furthermore, information on food consumption habits are recorded via collection of patients' grocery receipts [2]. Many patients can have difficulties recalling food consumption because of their age and their disease. Photo documentation of food items regularly purchased by some patients is used for visual support during interviews with other patients. Epidemiological studies were conducted in cooperation with regional and local health departments, considering incubation periods published by Goulet et al. [3].\n\nRegarding the source of the causative food vehicle, the results showed a heterogeneous picture. Until now, we have not observed cases with an epidemiological link to an institution (such as hospital infection). Preliminary results largely exclude fish and cheese products as a possible source but this has to be complemented by systematic screening of _Listeria_ isolates collected from food. Based on sequencing results, a PCR protocol aiming to detect CT1248 was developed for screening of isolates and published on the KL website [4].\n\nBackground\n----------\n_L. monocytogenes_, the causative agent of listeriosis is mostly caused by the consumption of contaminated food. The majority of infections are mild if they occur in younger, immunocompetent individuals except pregnant women. Infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth and serious health problems for the newborn. Invasive listeriosis can cause severe septicaemia, meningoencephalitis and a wide variety of focal infections. It is usually limited to the elderly and those with compromised immune systems or severe underlying medical conditions. Because of the severity of certain clinical manifestations (infections of the central nervous system, septicaemia, and abortion), the high case-fatality rate of up to 30 percent and the long incubation time, human listeriosis is of major public health concern. A recent nationwide case-control study in Germany among sporadic disease cases detected cold cooked sausages, packaged cheese and pre-sliced cheese as risk foods [5]. Medical conditions associated with listeriosis are immunosuppressive therapy, immunocompromising disease, and gastric acid suppression [5].\n\nPublic health assessment\n------------------------\nWhen considering confirmed as well as possible cases, this is the largest outbreak of listeriosis described in Germany to date [6]. Considering under-ascertainment, under-reporting, and the considerable proportion of isolates that are not typed, the size of the visible outbreak of invasive listeriosis is certainly underestimated. Furthermore, mild and non-invasive gastrointestinal cases, which can make up a significant proportion of disease cases, are not under surveillance in Germany. Until now, the cluster type CT1248 is confined to this outbreak and investigation via EPIS did not generate feedback on isolates with a related sequence in participating countries. Listeriosis cases have become more frequent over the past years in Germany [7] and elsewhere in Europe [8]. Investigations of listeriosis outbreaks are difficult due to the multitude of possible food vehicles including a broad range of ready-to-eat foods.\n\nPFGE is suitable for screening but cannot confirm outbreak isolates, whereas NGS appears highly discriminatory and superior for the allocation of cases to the outbreak. The geographical limitation to southern Germany and the size of the outbreak area with a population of 27 million inhabitants suggest _Listeria_-contaminated food in a supra-regional supermarket grocery chain as the vehicle of infection. Although the number of new cases has decreased since August 2015, new outbreak cases are still being reported. We must therefore assume that the source of infection is still active and further cases are possible. Further epidemiological studies, laboratory investigations and trace-back of food items are needed and ongoing to narrow down the source of infection.\n\nDiagnostic laboratories are requested to send any _Listeria_ isolates to one of the typing centres. The use of NGS is desirable as routine for all _Listeria_ isolates collected for typing.\n\n[Figures and references can be found at the source URL above.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of German states can be found at http://www.worldatlasbook.com/germany/maps/germany-regions-map-printable.jpg.\n\nFor discussions of listeriosis, please see my comments in prior ProMED-mail posts listed below. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/101.]", "summary": "Between November 2012 and November 2015, altogether 793 isolates from notified listeriosis cases were typed, which accounted for 45 percent of all cases in that period (n\u2009=\u20091765). \n\nWe used the following case definition in our investigation: possible outbreak cases were patients with the clinical picture of acute invasive listeriosis with onset since November 2012 with isolation of _Listeria_ from normally sterile body fluids and detection of the characteristic PFGE pattern 13a/54.

Listeria can cause a serious, life-threatening illness.\n\nPublic health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA 'fingerprinting' is performed on listeria bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE.\n\n12 people infected with the outbreak strain of listeria have been reported from 6 states since 5 Jul 2015. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: Indiana (1), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (4), New Jersey (1), New York (4), and Pennsylvania (1). WGS has been performed on clinical isolates from all 12 ill people and has shown that the isolates are highly related genetically.\n\nListeria specimens were collected from 5 Jul 2015 to 23 Dec 2015. Ill people range in age from 3 years to 83, and the median age is 66. 6Sixty-nine per cent of ill people are female. All 12 ill people reported being hospitalized, and 1 person from Michigan died as a result of listeriosis. 1 of the illnesses reported was in a pregnant woman.\n\nEpidemiologic and laboratory evidence available at this time indicates that packaged salads produced at the Dole processing facility in Springfield, Ohio and sold under various brand names are the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nState and local health departments are interviewing ill people about the foods they may have eaten or other exposures in the month before their illness began. All 5 ill people who were asked about packaged salad reported eating a packaged salad. Two ill people specified the brand of packaged salad eaten: both reported various varieties of Dole brand packaged salad.\n\nAs part of a routine product sampling program, the Ohio Department of Agriculture collected a Dole brand Field Greens packaged salad from a retail location and isolated listeria. This packaged salad was produced at the Springfield, Ohio Dole processing facility. In January 2016, WGS showed that the listeria isolate from the packaged salad was highly related genetically to isolates from ill people. This information linked the illnesses to Dole brand packaged salads produced at the Dole processing facility in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nOn 21 Jan 2016, Dole reported to CDC that it had stopped production at the processing facility in Springfield, Ohio. The company also reported that it is withdrawing packaged salads currently on the market that were produced at this facility. The withdrawal does not affect other Dole products.\n\nCDC recommends that consumers do not eat, restaurants do not serve, and retailers do not sell packaged salads produced at the Dole processing facility in Springfield, Ohio. These packaged salads were sold under various brand names, including Dole, Fresh Selections, Simple Truth, Marketside, The Little Salad Bar, and President's Choice. The packaged salads can be identified by the letter 'A' at the beginning of the manufacturing code found on the package. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that packaged salads produced at other Dole processing facilities in the United States are linked to illness.\n\nCDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview them. Updates will be provided when more information is available.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 22 Jan 2016\nSource: CTV News, Associated Press report [edited]\nhttp://www.ctvnews.ca/health/1-dead-in-listeria-outbreak-linked-to-dole-lettuce-recall-affects-canada-1.2748461\n\n\nDole is withdrawing packaged salads from Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada and more than 20 US states due to a listeria outbreak. CDC reported on Friday [22 Jan 2016] that packaged salads produced at a Dole facility in Ohio are linked to one death in Michigan and the hospitalizations of 12 people in 6 states.\n\nThe outbreak, which dates back to July [2015], is linked to salads sold under the brand names Dole, Fresh Selections, Simple Truth, Marketside, The Little Salad Bar and PC Organics.\n\nA 'small number' of PC Organics products packaged by Dole and sold in plastic tubs appear to be affected and include spinach and arugula, said Kevin Groh, vice-president of corporate affairs and communication for Loblaw Companies Limited. Supermarkets were awaiting official notification late on Friday [22 Jan 2016] from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency on removing any affected products from stores, said Dave Wilkes, senior vice-president of the Retail Council of Canada. 'As soon as supermarkets are aware of the products that are affected they'll take those products off the shelves,' he said. 'They won't wait. Food safety is the No. 1 priority. It is a non-negotiable part of the business so as soon as they're aware of the products that have been identified they will come off the shelf immediately.'\n\nCDC said it connected the outbreak to the Dole salads this month after Ohio agriculture officials found listeria in a bag bought at a retail location. The strain of listeria was 'highly related genetically' to the listeria that had made people sick. CDC said Dole had stopped all production at its Springfield, Ohio, plant and is withdrawing packaged salads on the market that were produced there. Consumers can identify the salads by the letter 'A' at the beginning of the manufacturing code on the packages.\n\nOn Wednesday [20 Jan 2016], the Public Health Agency of Canada reported that 7 people had been hospitalized in a listeria outbreak affecting 5 provinces. A spokeswoman said in an email late on Friday [22 Jan 2016] that the agency believes there is a link with the US outbreak, but is awaiting final lab results.\n\nThe agency said there were 3 cases in Ontario and 1 each in Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Most of them were women with an average age of 81. They became sick between September 2015 and early January [2016] and 1 of them died. It has not been determined if listeria contributed to the death.

Blue Bell released a statement Tuesday announcing Bass has become a partner.\n\nRoughly 1/4 of Texas cases [of listeriosis] involving _Listeria_, which contaminated Blue Bell ice cream and forced a crippling national recall in April [2015], are not submitted to public health officials as required by law and go untracked, a newspaper reported [Sun 19 Jul 2015]. Texas is not alone: Many state health departments in the USA don't receive samples in 10 to 40 percent of confirmed [listeriosis] cases to enter into databases, which can leave regulators unable to trace an outbreak, leave deadly food on the market and help companies avoid responsibility, the Houston Chronicle reported (http://bit.ly/1RH7ipI [see below]).\n\nThe Blue Bell outbreak could have been identified sooner had [listeriosis] reporting been better around the country, said Richard Danila, assistant state epidemiologist for the Minnesota State Health Department. Blue Bell ice cream was linked to 10 [listeriosis] illnesses in 4 states, including 3 deaths in Kansas.\n\nSubmitting bacterial cultures can be an afterthought to doctors focused on saving patients, and shipping pathogens comes with expensive and complex requirements.\n'The clinical laboratory is there for the diagnosis and treatment of the patient,' said Shari Shea, director of food safety for the Association of Public Health Laboratories. 'There's not always appreciation for the way it fits into the public health system.' At least 19 states don't have laws requiring laboratories to submit confirmed _Listeria_ samples, or 'isolates,' to state health officials. Of those that do, Texas hovers around the middle of the pack in states missing samples in confirmed cases, according to the Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response.\n\nBut despite Texas requiring laboratories to submit samples, the state has never enforced the mandate. Texas Department of State Health Services spokeswoman Carrie Williams said the agency instead prefers to work with labs and health providers to educate them and bring them into compliance. Penalties are almost never enforced in any state, said Craig Hedberg, epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. He said part of the reason is that public health departments depend on relationships with laboratories.\n\nNo date has been given for when Blue Bell products could be back in stores.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 18 Jul 2015\nSource: Houston Chronicle [edited]\nhttp://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/health/article/Man-s-fight-with-Blue-Bell-exposes-food-health-6393048.php?t=450372a1c7438d9cbb&cmpid=twitter-premium\n\n\nIn October 2013, [the patient] missed work and didn't answer calls and texts. His friends found him at home -- pale, unconscious, and barely breathing. His temperature was as high as 107 deg F [41.7 deg C] before he was admitted to an intensive care unit. He woke up after 6 days on a respirator to find his nervous system ravaged. He couldn't walk, talk, or swallow. His listeriosis, confirmed by doctors at a Houston hospital, has not been definitively linked to Blue Bell Creameries, and the company denies a connection. But [the patient] is one of thousands of Americans whose severe foodborne illnesses have never been properly counted or studied -- and not because the technology doesn't exist. [The patient], 32, contends he also is a victim of the Blue Bell outbreak and has filed suit. He has had to put his career on hold, move back home to Maryland to live with his parents and is relearning how to walk and talk. His brain damage is permanent.\n\n20 years ago, finding the source of a food poisoning outbreak was like playing a twisted lottery. If you got really sick, you might go to the doctor and find out it was _Salmonella_. But there was no way of knowing where the bacteria came from or if someone 10 states over had drawn the same bad luck. Everything changed in 1996, the year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] launched PulseNet. Now the same technology linking a prison inmate to a stray hair from a murder committed 25 years ago can be used to connect illnesses to food. In PulseNet, the CDC keeps a database of bacterial DNA from public health laboratories that extract it from people who got sick. It has more than half a million isolates. Now health officials know if people in San Francisco and New York ate the same tainted corned beef, and whether tests from that beef processing plant show organisms with the same DNA pattern. With PulseNet, they can pull bad food off the market in a relative heartbeat. With PulseNet, they can find the dirty factory.\n\nStill, it's an intricate web of data, of DNA bar codes, of petri dishes and test tubes and USD 100 000 machines, of laboratories that reek of rotting meat where biologists in white coats render food into a vomit-like slime, then extract the pathogens; of doctors and nurses and forms and long questionnaires about what people ate and when. In the center of the web is the CDC. Then there is a ring of state and local public health laboratories, then a ring of commercial testing laboratories -- like Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp -- then rings of hospitals and doctors' offices.\n\nEach thread in the web is a flow of information. If one of them fails, the web comes down: Health regulators can't trace the outbreak. Deadly food stays on the market. The sick and injured, and families of the dead, can't get answers. Companies can avoid responsibility. When [the 32-year-old patient]'s world shattered in Houston, the web there to help him fell apart.\n\nIn January [2015], South Carolina health officials were randomly testing frozen desserts when they found _Listeria_ in an ice cream cookie sandwich and ice cream-on-a-stick made by Blue Bell. Texas health officials then tested samples from the Brenham [Texas] plant in February [2015] and found _Listeria_ in a 3rd product, individually wrapped scoops of vanilla. The company quietly withdrew them from the market but did not issue a public recall until March [2015]. By April [2015], what Blue Bell had initially cast as a problem isolated to a single machine was clearly a systemic sanitation failure affecting multiple plants and dating at least to 2009.\n\nThe cracking reputation of a Texas icon [Blue Bell] attracted widespread coverage. And then it dawned on [the 32-year-old Houston patient]. Could the treats that allayed his sweet tooth in Texas be responsible for ravaging his brain? He had moved to Houston after college in Maryland and starting his career in Massachusetts to become an administrator at Eagle's Trace, an assisted living facility with 462 apartments. One of Blue Bell's many institutional accounts, it's just 75 miles [121 km] from the biggest little creamery in Texas. [The patient] had discovered the hallowed Texas brand and eaten it often -- many sizes, many flavors. He connected with Pritzker Olsen, a national food poisoning law firm based in Minnesota. After investigating for about 2 months, the firm filed the 1st [listeriosis] lawsuit against Blue Bell on [15 May 2015]. [The patient] and his attorneys don't know what happened to his isolate.\n\nIn a typical scenario, a doctor would order a spinal tap on a bacterial meningitis patient to extract fluid containing the bacteria. It would be sent to a commercial laboratory. There, microbiologists would use a sterile cotton swab to drag a broth containing the bacteria across a plate embedded with a growth medium, usually made of sheep's blood. Within a day or two, they would see colonies of _Listeria_ blossom like snowflakes against the blood-red plate. The hospital would get the result, and the isolate broth would go to the Houston Department of Health and Human Services laboratory.\n\nThere, microbiologists would break the bacteria cells open, extract sections of DNA and place them in an electric field, causing them to separate, by weight, into a series of lines like a bar code -- the DNA fingerprint. An image of the bar code would be uploaded to PulseNet, the CDC database. If it matched the bar code of _Listeria_ isolated from Blue Bell ice cream, [the patient] would officially become part of the outbreak. If not, it would remain in the national database and could be compared with DNA from future illnesses and contaminated food. Either way, the broth would go into a freezer for indefinite storage at [-112 deg F / -80 deg C], readily available for health authorities, or lawyers.\n\nOne of [the Houston patient]'s attorneys, has said they know he tested positive for _Listeria_ through medical records, but know nothing else about his isolate -- it appears neither Houston, Texas, nor federal health authorities have records for [this patient], based on requests made by the law firm. Privacy laws prevent the agencies from discussing individual cases with others.\n\n[The patient]'s attorneys are not speaking at length about his case, and they advised him not to speak, either. It doesn't help them to broadcast that there is no smoking gun. They remain confident, however, that his food history, which includes records derived from a grocery card, and expert epidemiologists' testimony will be enough to show it is more likely than not -- the standard in a civil trial -- that tainted Blue Bell [ice cream] made him sick. Blue Bell is not commenting on the lawsuit but has issued a categorical denial in its initial answer in court.\n\nThe case is far from a slam dunk for [the patient]. _Listeria_ may incubate for 70 days in the body. [meaning the incubation period for listeriosis, that is, the time it takes for symptoms to develop after exposure, is up to 70 days.] It has been found on meats, cheeses, fruits, and can live in almost any ready-to-eat food. Blue Bell's lawyers will likely press him to recall everything he ate for weeks in 2013.\n\nMost state health departments are missing isolates in 10 percent to 40 percent of confirmed cases of _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, and _E. coli_ infection, according to research by the Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response. Some are much better, some far worse. Texas hovers around the middle of the pack, missing about 25 percent for [listeriosis] cases in the last 5 years.\n\nOverwhelmed doctors' offices may not have time for the paperwork. Clinical labs need someone specially certified in shipping pathogens. Private courier services have complex, expensive requirements for shipping and handling, and can refuse packages for any reason. And when saving the patient is the 1st priority, bacterial cultures can be an afterthought. 'The clinical laboratory is there for the diagnosis and treatment of the patient,' said Shari Shea, director of food safety for the Association of Public Health Laboratories. 'There's not always appreciation for the way it fits into the public health system.'\n\nMore trouble looms. Increasingly, clinical and commercial laboratories are turning to new tests that identify the pathogen without the need to grow the bacteria in a culture. They give doctors a diagnosis quickly without an isolate. Health officials around the country are scrambling to figure out how to continue to obtain cultures for outbreak surveillance, and who will pay for it.\n\nBut epidemiologists generally agree that for every laboratory-confirmed listeriosis case, another one goes undetected.\n\n[Byline: Mark Collette]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail previously reported this multistate outbreak of listeriosis traced to eating _Listeria_-contaminated ice cream manufactured by Blue Bell Creameries ('See Also's' below).

PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA 'fingerprinting' is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. This additional detail was important because 5 rare PFGE fingerprints of _Listeria_ were included in this investigation. The sequencing showed that the _Listeria_ strains with the 5 rare PFGE fingerprints were closely related genetically.\n\n30 people infected with one of the closely related _Listeria_ strains were reported from 10 states since 16 Jun 2010. The number of ill people reported from each state was as follows: California (18), Colorado (1), Illinois (2), Massachusetts (2), Michigan (1), New York (2), Ohio (1), Tennessee (1), Virginia (1), and Washington (1).\n\nDates of _Listeria_ specimen collection ranged from 16 Jun 2010 to 24 Aug 2015. The cluster was 1st identified in August 2015 after investigators saw an increase in one of the 5 rare PFGE fingerprints reported to PulseNet. WGS found that the 4 other PFGE fingerprints were closely related genetically to the 1st PFGE fingerprint. Illnesses associated with those PFGE fingerprints were added to the investigation, including illnesses that occurred over 5 years ago.\n\nIll people ranged in age from less than one year to 92, and the median age was 73. 70 percent of ill people were female. 28 (93 percent) of 30 ill people for whom information was available reported being hospitalized. Six of the illnesses were pregnancy-related, and one illness resulted in a fetal loss. Three deaths were reported from California (2) and Ohio (1).\n\nEpidemiologic and laboratory information indicated that soft cheeses distributed by Karoun Dairies were the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nState and local health departments interviewed ill people about the foods they may have eaten or other exposures in the month before their illness began. 20 (67 percent) of 30 people with available information were of Middle Eastern or Eastern European descent or shopped at Middle Eastern or Eastern European-style markets. Of 28 ill people for whom information was available, 21 (75 percent) consumed soft cheese, and all of those 21 (100 percent) reported eating Middle Eastern, Eastern European, Mediterranean, or Mexican-style cheeses, including ani, feta (e.g., Bulgarian feta), Middle Eastern-style string cheese, nabulsi, and village cheese. Three of 7 ill people who specified the brand of cheese eaten reported brands distributed by Karoun Dairies. An additional ill person was unable to name the brand of cheese eaten but described the packaging and label of a Karoun product. No other brand of soft cheese was reported more than once. One other ill person reported eating Karoun brand kefir cheese. This person was previously included in the number of people reporting a Karoun brand soft cheese, but has now been excluded, since kefir is typically classified as a yogurt product rather than a cheese.\n\nFDA isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ from 2 environmental samples collected in September 2015 from the Central Valley Cheese, Inc. manufacturing facility in Turlock, California. Central Valley Cheese, Inc. manufactures cheese for Karoun Dairies. Whole genome sequencing showed that these isolates were closely related genetically to isolates from ill people. In addition, whole genome sequencing showed that 5 _Listeria_ isolates collected in 2010 from the same facility were also closely related genetically to isolates from ill people.\n\nOn 16 Sep 2015, Karoun Dairies, Inc. voluntarily recalled certain cheeses that the company distributes due to possible contamination with _Listeria_. The recall includes several brands and types of cheeses that were distributed to retail outlets in the United States. Products were sold under the following brands: Karoun, Arz, Gopi, Queso Del Valle, Central Valley Creamery, and Yanni. Products were vacuum packed in jars or in pails.

Information gathered as part of the investigation indicated that various Blue Bell brand products were the source of this outbreak of listeriosis.\n\n- Listeriosis is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium (germ) _Listeria monocytogenes_ (_Listeria_). People at high risk for listeriosis include pregnant women and their newborns, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems.\n\n- A total of 10 people with listeriosis related to this outbreak were reported from 4 states: Arizona (1), Kansas (5), Oklahoma (1), and Texas (3). All ill people were hospitalized; 3 deaths were reported from Kansas (3).\n\n- On [20 Apr 2015], Blue Bell Creameries voluntarily recalled all of its products currently on the market made at all of its facilities, including ice cream, frozen yogurt, sherbet, and frozen snacks.\n\n- Consumers should not eat any recalled Blue Bell brand products, and institutions and retailers should not serve or sell them. This is especially important for people at higher risk for listeriosis. These products are frozen, so consumers, institutions, and retailers should check their freezers.\n\n- On [7 May 2015], the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released the findings from recent inspections at the Blue Bell production facilities in Brenham, Texas [see source document]; Broken Arrow, Oklahoma [see source document]; and Sylacauga, Alabama [see source document].\n\nOutbreak Summary\nIntroduction\n------------\nThis was a complex multistate outbreak investigation of listeriosis cases occurring over several years. Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA 'fingerprinting' is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks of enteric illness. Several PFGE patterns (strains) of _Listeria_ were involved in this outbreak.\n\nA total of 10 people infected with several strains of _Listeria_ were reported from 4 states: Arizona (1), Kansas (5), Oklahoma (1), and Texas (3). Illness onset dates ranged from January 2010 through January 2015. The people with illness onsets during 2010-2014 were identified through a retrospective review of the PulseNet database for DNA fingerprints matching isolates collected from Blue Bell ice cream samples. All 10 (100 percent) people were hospitalized; 3 deaths were reported from Kansas.\n\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\n-----------------------------\nFebruary 2015\nIn February 2015, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control isolated _Listeria_ as part of routine sampling from Blue Bell brand single-serving ice cream products collected from a distribution center: Chocolate Chip Country Cookie Sandwiches and Great Divide Bars. In response to the findings in South Carolina, the Texas Department of State Health Services collected product samples from the Blue Bell Creameries production facility in Brenham, Texas, that made these products. Testing by Texas health officials yielded _Listeria_ isolates from some samples of the same 2 products tested by South Carolina and from another Blue Bell ice cream product called 'Scoops.' This product was made on the same production line as the Chocolate Chip Country Cookie Sandwiches and Great Divide Bars. PFGE was performed on the _Listeria_ isolated from the ice cream samples; 7 different PFGE patterns were identified and uploaded to PulseNet.\n\nMarch 2015\nIn March 2015, Kansas health officials identified 2 people from the same hospital who were infected with _Listeria_ bacteria that had the same PFGE pattern; 3 additional listeriosis cases with 3 other PFGE patterns had previously been identified from the same hospital. All 5 people were hospitalized for unrelated problems before developing invasive listeriosis -- a finding that strongly suggested their infections were acquired in the hospital. _Listeria_ isolates from 4 of the 5 people had PFGE patterns that were also identified in ice cream tested by South Carolina and Texas. Although some of the illnesses occurred more than a year before this investigation began, all 4 people with available information consumed milkshakes made with the 'Scoops' Blue Bell ice cream product while they were in the hospital. Isolates from 4 of these people were highly related to each other by whole genome sequencing. _Listeria_ isolated from the 5th person was not related to isolates from the other 4 ill people. In addition, the PFGE pattern was not identified in any ice cream samples. However, this person was part of a recognized illness cluster at the hospital and consumed milkshakes made with 'Scoops' while hospitalized. As a result, this person was included as a case in the outbreak. Illness onset dates for the 5 people ranged from January 2014 through January 2015. Three of these people died as a result of their _Listeria_ infection.\n\nOn [13 Mar 2015], Blue Bell Creameries reported removing the 'Scoops' ice cream product and other products made on the same production line from the market. The company also reported that it had shut down that production line at its Brenham, Texas, facility.\n\nOn [22 Mar 2015], the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) reported that _Listeria_ was isolated from a previously unopened, single-serving Blue Bell brand 3 oz. institutional/food service chocolate ice cream cup collected from the Kansas hospital involved in the outbreak. Samples of Blue Bell brand 3 oz. institutional/food service chocolate ice cream cups collected from the company's Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, facility also yielded _Listeria_. _Listeria_ isolated from ice cream cup samples were indistinguishable from each other by PFGE, but were different from those isolated from people in Kansas and from other Blue Bell brand ice cream products previously sampled in Texas and South Carolina. On [23 Mar 2015], Blue Bell announced a recall of 3 oz. institutional/food service ice cream cups (with tab lids) of several flavors produced at the company's Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, facility.\n\nApril 2015\nOn [3 Apr 2015], CDC reported that illnesses might be linked to ice cream made in Blue Bell Creameries' Oklahoma facility, but lacked sufficient information to include them as cases in the outbreak at the time. These illnesses were identified when investigators searched the PulseNet database and identified 6 people from Arizona (1), Oklahoma (1), and Texas (4) with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 who had _Listeria_ isolates with PFGE patterns indistinguishable from isolates from the chocolate ice cream cups made in the Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, facility. The 4 people reported from Texas were hospitalized for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis. Information available for one person indicated that they consumed ice cream in a Texas hospital before developing listeriosis; the Texas Department of State Health Services reported that the hospital had received Blue Bell brand ice cream cups. None of the 4 people in Texas died from _Listeria_ infection. At this point in the investigation, CDC recommended that consumers not eat and institutions and retailers not serve any products made at the company's Oklahoma facility, in addition to any previously recalled or withdrawn products. That day, Blue Bell Creameries reported that they had voluntarily suspended operations at their facility in Oklahoma.\n\nOn [8 Apr 2015], CDC reported that whole genome sequencing confirmed that 3 of the 4 isolates from people in Texas were nearly identical to _Listeria_ strains isolated from ice cream produced at Blue Bell Creameries' Oklahoma facility. These 3 people were added to the case count for the outbreak, bringing the total to 8. The 4th isolate was later determined not to be part of the outbreak by whole genome sequencing and this illness was not added to the case count.\n\nOn [20 Apr 2015], Blue Bell Creameries voluntarily recalled all products currently on the market made at all of its facilities, including ice cream, frozen yogurt, sherbet, and frozen snacks. Blue Bell announced this recall after sampling by the company revealed that Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream half gallons produced on [17 Mar 2015] and [27 Mar 2015] contained _Listeria_.\n\nOn [21 Apr 2015], CDC reported that whole genome sequencing confirmed that the people from Arizona (1) and Oklahoma (1) were part of the outbreak, bringing the total case count to 10.\n\nMay 2015\nOn [7 May 2015], FDA released the findings from recent inspections at the Blue Bell production facilities in Brenham, Texas [see source document]; Broken Arrow, Oklahoma [see source document]; and Sylacauga, Alabama [see source document].\n\nThis outbreak investigation is over. However, people could continue to get sick because recalled products may still be in people's freezers and consumers unaware of the recalls could eat them. Institutions should not serve and retailers should not sell recalled products. These products are frozen, so consumers, institutions, and retailers should check their freezers.

Two of them died within 30 days of the bacterium's discovery.\n\nThe institute said that 2 of the new cases resemble the same type that was present in batches of the popular deli meat rullepolse produced by the company Jorn A. Rullepolser in 2014. That outbreak began in August 2014 and infected a total of 41 individuals, 17 of whom died. Two of the other new cases resemble previous minor outbreaks, while the 5th is infected with a type of _Listeria_ that has not yet been seen.\n\n'It's unusual to have 5 cases in one week. Normally we see one case of listeriosis per week. But it is also unusual that we were able to so quickly determine the type of _Listeria_. That is a sign that our monitoring for the organism has gotten better,' SSI spokesman Kare Molbak said.\n\nThe Jorn A. Rullepolser listeriosis outbreak led to a total of 30 products -- including variations of rullepolse, salami and hot dogs -- being recalled from stores nationwide. The company was shut down as a result.\n\nThe source of the new cases was not immediately known, Molbak said. 'It's the same bacteria as in the rullepolse outbreak. So it's possible that the old outbreak has been rekindled,' he told public broadcaster DR.\n\nSSI said that the majority of those who have been infected with _Listeria_ had weakened immune systems. Fatality rates among infected individuals is 25 percent, the institute said.\n\nDenmark normally sees around 50 listeriosis cases per year, but in the years 2009-2014, that number was closer to 100.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The locations of the 5 cases in Denmark are not stated in the posting, but it seems to be the case that the strains are not all genotypically related.\n\nThe following is part of a moderation written by my colleague ML regarding listeriosis:\n'Listeriosis is an illness caused by eating foods contaminated by the bacterium, _Listeria monocytogenes_, a gram-positive bacillus. _Listeria_ can be in a variety of raw foods as well as in processed foods and foods made from unpasteurized milk. The process of making asparagus soup, if cooked at temperatures higher than 150 F (65 C), should have killed _Listeria monocytogenes_, the gram-positive bacillus that is the cause of listeriosis, in any of the soup's ingredients. However, _Listeria_ can contaminate foods after the food is cooked, and unlike many other foodborne bacteria, _Listeria_ multiply at refrigerator temperatures (between 35-38 F (2-3 C). If previously refrigerated soup had been reheated sufficiently before serving, _Listeria_ again should have been killed. The FDA recommends that soups, sauces, and gravy should be brought to a boil when reheating, and leftovers should be reheated to 165 F (74 C) (http://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm079667.htm).

The process of making asparagus soup, if cooked at temperatures higher than 150 F (65 C), should have killed _Listeria monocytogenes_, the gram-positive bacillus that is the cause of listeriosis, in any of the soup's ingredients. \n\nDenmark normally sees around 50 listeriosis cases per year, but in the years 2009-2014, that number was closer to 100. \n\n\nFive people were infected with listeriosis within a one-week span earlier in April 2015, the Danish State Serum Institute (SSI) said on Tue 28 Apr 2015.

'We're also finding smaller outbreaks that we weren't able to find before.' They're also finding them originating in previously unsuspected foods, from caramel apples to ice cream.\n\nThe new detection method can identify gaps in the food safety system, especially when used alongside similar efforts by the FDA to sequence samples from food and from the places where food is prepared, from factories to distribution centers, Jackson says.\n\nIn the Blue Bell case, a quick-thinking nurse was the first to link 5 cases in Kansas with the tainted ice cream. For more than a year, Infection Prevention and Control Coordinator Karen Bally at Via Christi Health in Wichita and the rest of the team had been searching for anything to tie together the infections, which started with a single illness in January 2014. Traditional epidemiological tools showed nothing. Diet records were inconclusive, and samples from the 1st 4 patients seemed unrelated using the standard technique for DNA analysis.\n\nWhen the 5th patient fell ill in early 2015, standard DNA analysis finally showed a link to a previous case -- patient number 3. The state of Kansas sent a sample to CDC for confirmation. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the 2 samples of _Listeria_ were a near-perfect match. 'That was like the 'aha' moment,' Bally says.\n\nBut they still didn't have a source. Bally and her team scoured FDA recalls and public health listservs for reports of tainted foods. Nothing. Then, she heard about a quality problem with one of their vendors --Blue Bell ice cream. Unknown to Bally, FDA sampling had turned up listeria in a Blue Bell distribution center in South Carolina, and inspectors had traced it to a production facility in Texas. Without explanation, Blue Bell stopped delivering its most popular products to Bally's hospital.\n\nBally called the state health department. They contacted FDA, which had just sequenced the tainted ice cream samples. When they compared those results to the CDC samples, they found another match. CDC then looked into other unsolved listeria cases. By sequencing samples still in storage, they confirmed 5 additional cases, dating back to 2010.\n\n'It's not something that we've seen before -- being able to look at cases so far back,' Jackson says. And although it took many tools to track the current outbreak, whole-genome sequencing 'made all the difference,' he says.\n\nBefore now, investigators had 2 main tools for tracking cases: diet interviews and DNA analysis known as genetic fingerprinting. Fingerprinting shows the degree to which two different samples of DNA are related. But it isn't 100 percent accurate -- in some cases, different bacterial strains can appear related and similar strains can appear to be unrelated.\n\nWhole-genome sequencing, in contrast, allows scientists to accurately compare every single DNA base pair in samples, giving them 'a much sharper look at the differences and similarities in the strains,' Jackson says. The process takes longer -- 72 hours for testing compared with 48 hours -- and it costs more. CDC's goal is to create a national DNA database for foodborne pathogens from clinical samples that could be integrated with an already-existing FDA database of foodborne pathogens from food and environmental samples. The agency plans to add other foodborne illnesses, including salmonellosis and the most common disease-causing strain of _Escherichia coli_, to the project within 3 years.\n\nBut progress toward setting up a comprehensive national network has been incremental, because only 2 states can currently perform their own sequencing. The rest must send their samples to central CDC laboratories. And because the onus is on the state to send in samples, some go unsequenced. But the technology can do more than simply identify outbreaks, according to Robert Tauxe, deputy director of CDC's Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases.\n\n'Whole-genome sequencing shines a new light in this area that helps us find unsuspected gaps in the food safety system,' he says. Ice cream, for example, was rarely tested for _Listeria_ prior to the Blue Bell outbreak. But in the weeks since, several states have said that _Listeria_ testing in ice cream will now be part of their regimen. 'Finding these outbreaks related to foods we never suspected before is a very surprising thing,' Tauxe says. 'This is a wake-up call to the ice cream industry in general and to the regulators.'\n\n[Byline: Catherine Matacic]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This technology appears to be more useful in linking isolates of potential foodborne outbreaks, such as listeriosis, and is to be expanded in the future to other infections such as salmonellosis and enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]", "summary": "\n\nThe new detection method can identify gaps in the food safety system, especially when used alongside similar efforts by the FDA to sequence samples from food and from the places where food is prepared, from factories to distribution centers, Jackson says.

'Voluntary recall is a specific term used by the Food and Drug Administration. While our actions under a voluntary recall as compared to the previously reported voluntary withdrawal remain the same, we have updated our communication terminology to reference a 'recall,' ' according to the Dole company statement. 'We have done this with the aim of using terminology that may be more familiar to consumers.'\n\nThe federal definition of 'recall' indicates a company knows consuming a product could cause 'serious adverse health consequences or death.' The term 'withdrawal' indicates 'a minor violation that would not be subject to legal action by the FDA or which involves no violation.'\n\nDole reports all retailers across 23 states and 3 Canadian provinces that received products from the Springfield, Ohio, facility had been contacted as of [27 Jan 2016].\n\nHealth officials did not link the Springfield facility to the outbreak -- which dates back to at least July 2015 and is ongoing -- until earlier this month [January 2016], when a lab test of a packaged salad collected in Ohio returned a positive test result for _Listeria monocytogenes_.

'With an organism like _Listeria_, you cannot do a visual inspection,' Stromberg said on Thursday [9 Apr 2015].\n\nTainted Blue Bell ice cream products have sickened 8 people -- 5 in Kansas and 3 in Texas. 3 of the 5 in Kansas have died and health officials there say listeriosis [the illness caused by _Listeria_] might have been a contributing factor in the deaths.\n\nBlue Bell has temporarily closed its facility in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and shut down a production line at its facility in Brenham, Texas, where the company is headquartered. Blue Bell has also recalled more than 25 of its products since last month [March 2015].\n\nIn the one-page report about the Oklahoma plant, provided to The Associated Press in response to an open records request, an inspector wrote 'No Violations Observed!' and 'Keep it up!' At the time of the inspection, _Listeria_ had only been traced to Blue Bell's Brenham facility. Blue Bell issued its 1st recall on 13 Mar [2015]. Stromberg said Oklahoma officials didn't learn until 22 Mar [2015] that _Listeria_ was connected to a product produced by the Oklahoma plant.\n\nStromberg said his agency has been at the plant ever since, working with the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies to determine a cause of the _Listeria_. 'Once you identify where it is, _Listeria_ is relatively easy to control. But it's going to be like looking for a needle in a haystack,' he said.\n\nOfficials in Washington [State] can attest to the difficulty of tracking down _Listeria_ at a plant. At least 2 people became ill after the _Listeria_ was detected in products manufactured by Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream. The company responded by issuing a recall in December [2014]. It addressed health safety concerns and was given approval to resume operations a month later.\n\n'You may just be working to keep your plant really, really clean, but you also need to work to keep it in good repair because that organism can slide into a crack on the door, or get into the crack where the wall and floor meet,' said Lucy Severs, food safety manager for the Department of Agriculture in Washington.\n\nStromberg said he didn't believe there was any sort of breakdown in the inspection process in Oklahoma, as officials don't normally submit samples for laboratory testing as a part of routine reviews, unless there were problems such as with cleanliness. No such problems were detected in the 18 Mar [2015] inspection, which is one of 8 to 10 done each year at the plant.\n\nBefore the recall, the facility in Brenham had last been fully inspected in February [2015] and the Texas Department of State Health Services had found a couple of minor issues. The Brenham facility is inspected monthly.\n\n'Over the years, Blue Bell has had a good inspection record and very few issues, none leading to any enforcement issue (i.e. penalty),' agency spokeswoman Carrie Williams wrote in an email.\n\nIn a statement Thursday [9 Apr 2015], Blue Bell said, 'the fact that our products may be linked to these events is very distressing to us. We are sorry for this news and we are doing everything possible to determine the cause of the outbreak.'\n\nListeriosis is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called _Listeria monocytogenes_, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. The disease primarily affects pregnant women and their newborns, older adults, and people with immune systems weakened by cancer, cancer treatments, or other serious conditions.\n\nThe CDC said Thursday preliminary tests indicate another 3 people hospitalized at some point from 2010 to 2012 appear to have a similar strain of _Listeria_ as the others, but further testing is necessary before confirming a connection.\n\n[Byline: David Warren, Juan A.

Of the 4 ill people for whom information is available on the foods eaten in the month before _Listeria_ infection, all consumed milkshakes made at the hospital with a Blue Bell brand ice cream product called 'Scoops.'\n\nWhole genome sequences of _Listeria monocytogenes_ strains isolated from 4 of the patients were found to be highly related to sequences of _Listeria_ strains isolated from 'Scoops' and 2 other products made on the same line at the company's Texas facility. These products were recalled by Blue Bell Creameries on 13 Mar 2015.\n\nCluster 2 consists of 3 patients reported from Texas between 2011 and 2014 who were all hospitalized for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis. Whole genome sequences of their _Listeria monocytogenes_ strains were highly related to sequences of _Listeria_ strains isolated from another Blue Bell ice cream product -- 3-oz. institutional/food service chocolate ice cream cups made at the company's Oklahoma production facility. The cup products were recalled by Blue Bell Creameries on 23 Mar 2015.\n\n3 additional patients with listeriosis during 2010 through 2012 whose isolates have PFGE patterns similar to those of others in the cluster have been identified in the PulseNet database. Further testing is underway to determine whether these illnesses may be related to this outbreak. Results of this testing will be reported once they are available.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ strains from a 1-pint container of Blue Bell brand banana pudding ice cream collected from the company's Oklahoma production facility. This contaminated product was produced in the same facility but on a different line from the 3-oz. institutional/food service ice cream cups previously recalled.\n\nOn 3 Apr 2015, Blue Bell Creameries reported that they had voluntarily suspended operations at their Oklahoma production facility.\n\nOn 7 Apr 2015, Blue Bell Creameries announced a 3rd product recall that included banana pudding ice cream pints and other products made on the same line that were produced between 12 Feb 2015, and 27 Mar 2015, at their Oklahoma facility.\n\nFurther testing of environmental and product samples from Blue Bell Creamery facilities is ongoing.\n\nCDC recommends that consumers do not eat any recalled products or Blue Bell brand products made at the Oklahoma production facility and that retailers and institutions not sell or serve them. This advice is particularly important for consumers at higher risk for listeriosis, including pregnant women, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems.\n\nState and local health officials, CDC and FDA continue to work closely on the investigation.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail previously reported that listeriosis in 5 Kansans (3 of whom died), who had developed this infection while hospitalized, was traced to eating _Listeria_-contaminated ice cream manufactured by a Blue Bell Creameries facility in Brentham, Texas (Listeriosis - USA (04): (KS) fatal, nosocomial, ice cream 20150315.3231917).

On 31 Jul 2014, the recall was expanded to cover all fruit packed at their facility during 1 Jun 2014-17 Jul 2014 (2). After the initial recall, clinicians, state and local health departments, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received many inquiries about listeriosis from concerned consumers, many of whom had received automated telephone calls informing them that they had purchased recalled fruit. During 19-31 Jul 2014, the CDC _Listeria_ website received more than 500 000 page views, more than 7 times the views received during the previous 52 weeks. However, no molecular information from _L. monocytogenes_ isolates was available to assess whether human illnesses might be linked to these products.\n\nIn early August 2014, a 2-enzyme pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern shared by 3 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates from stone fruit associated with the recall was uploaded to PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance. 4 human isolates with isolation dates during the period 8 May 2014-8 Jul 2014 (Illinois, Massachusetts, and South Carolina) and 28 Aug 2014 (Minnesota) were identified that had PFGE patterns indistinguishable from isolates from company A stone fruit. Samples of stone fruits from company A collected after the recall yielded an additional 31 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, 22 of which were indistinguishable from the initial isolates by PFGE; 3 other PFGE patterns were identified that did not match any isolates from clinical specimens collected during 1 May-31 Aug 2014. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis by whole-genome multilocus sequence typing showed that isolates from the Massachusetts and Minnesota patients were highly related (less than 10 allele differences and less than 10 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism differences) to the isolates from recalled stone fruits, whereas the Illinois and South Carolina isolates were not.\n\nA review of the standardized _Listeria_ Initiative exposure questionnaire (3) for the Massachusetts patient showed that organic nectarine consumption was recorded, although the form does not specifically ask about stone fruit consumption. A subsequent interview using a questionnaire with questions about stone fruits indicated that the patient consumed nectarines and peaches purchased from stores that sold company A stone fruit. Traceback using receipts and shopper card data indicated the patient's family purchased recalled fruit. An interview with a family member of the Minnesota patient revealed that the patient consumed peaches from a store that received company A stone fruit; however, dates from receipts indicated that the peaches were purchased after the recalled fruit was reported to have been removed from the shelves. After removal of recalled fruit, the store received company A peaches that were not part of the recall as well as peaches from another California supplier. The South Carolina patient reportedly did not eat stone fruit before becoming ill. Family of the Illinois patient could not be reached for interview.\n\nStrong evidence linked the Massachusetts case to recalled stone fruit, including food exposure interviews, receipt and shopper card data, and WGS results showing very high genetic relatedness between the patient's isolate and isolates from nectarines. Consumption data and WGS results suggest that stone fruit was also the likely source of _L. monocytogenes_ infection in the Minnesota case; however, the later dates of illness onset and fruit purchase suggest that the patient consumed stone fruit that was not included in the recall.\n\nThis is the 1st reported link between human listeriosis and stone fruit. WGS results provided a basis for focusing resources for extended case interviews and follow-up. Specifically, among cases that matched the recalled stone fruit by PFGE, WGS allowed differentiation between sporadic cases and cases associated with stone fruit consumption.\n\nReported listeriosis is much more common in pregnant women than in the general population and can cause major fetal and perinatal complications. Because of this higher risk, and partially in response to public concern stemming from these recalls, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued guidelines for management of pregnant women with possible _L. monocytogenes_ exposure (4). Although exposure to this recalled product was likely widespread, disease was very rare. Therefore, this recall and associated illness does not provide sufficient evidence to recommend that persons at higher risk for listeriosis (such as, pregnant women, persons aged 65 years or older, and immunocompromised persons) avoid fresh stone fruits. However, it does support the need to understand risks associated with contaminated, ready-to-eat fresh fruit so that prevention strategies can be strengthened.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. FDA.

Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_.\n\nIn this outbreak 5 people in Kansas have become ill and 3 deaths have been reported. Patients became ill with listeriosis after hospitalizations for unrelated causes at the same hospital. They became ill between January 2014 and January 2015 after a majority were known to have consumed Blue Bell Creameries ice cream at the hospital. The hospital was not aware of the listeriosis contamination. The outbreak was recently discovered after 2 patients were identified with the same strain of listeriosis. Further investigation identified 3 other patients with listeriosis who had been hospitalized for unrelated causes before the onset of listeriosis.\n\nToday, the FDA warned consumers about the potential contamination in Blue Bell Creameries' products. Kansas health officials are warning consumers who have purchased the following Blue Bell Creameries novelty items and have not consumed the items to discard them: Chocolate Chip Country Cookie; Great Divide Bar; Sour Pop Green Apple Bar; Cotton Candy Bar; Scoops; Vanilla Stick Slices; Almond Bar; and No Sugar Added Mooo Bar (regular Mooo Bars are not included).\n\nPotentially contaminated items have been pulled from retail locations by Blue Bell Creameries and are no longer available for purchase. At this time, no other products from Blue Bell Creameries have been linked to this outbreak. The FDA issued a consumer advisory about certain Blue Bell ice cream products made in Texas. The March 13 [2015] notice was issued after several confirmed cases of listeriosis in Kansas were linked to products made on a single production line at the Blue Bell Creameries plant in Brenham [Brenham is a city in east-central Texas; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenham,_Texas].\n\nThe disease primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and adults with weakened immune systems. Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms begin from 3 to 70 days after consuming the bacteria. In 2014, 5 cases of listeriosis were reported in Kansas.\n\nAnyone who believes they may have become ill with listeriosis should contact their health care provider.\n\n[Byline: Bruce Clark]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDr Tony Ellam\nConsultant in Communicable Disease Control (ret)\n<tonypj@meadlane.freeserve.co.uk>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 14 Mar 2015\nSource: Time [edited]\nhttp://time.com/3744962/ice-cream-contaminated-kansas-blue-bell-creameries/\n\n\nIn Kansas 3 people have died after eating contaminated Blue Bell Creameries brand ice cream products. A total of 5 people were infected, and the ice cream has been recalled. But how does ice cream get tainted in the first place?\n\nThe bacteria that contaminated the ice cream is called _Listeria monocytogenes_, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1600 Americans get sick from listeriosis every year. It's the 3rd leading cause of death from food poisoning. It's the same bacteria that contaminated caramel apples from California in January 2015, causing 35 people in 12 states to get sick, and killing 7.\n\nThe bacterium grows very well at refrigerator temperatures, even as low as 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that the longer ready-to-eat refrigerated foods are stored in the fridge, the more opportunity the bacterium has to grow.\n\n'It's why it's a problem for cooler foods like ice cream and cheese,' says Bill Marler, a food safety lawyer in Washington state.\n\nThe FDA was able to confirm that 3 strains of the bacteria came from a single Blue Bell production line at 1 facility in Brenham, Texas, though the agency has not disclosed a precise point of contact. Blue Bell says one of its machines produced the problem.\n\n'Likely what happened is the piece of machinery was contaminated. The liquid form of the ice cream goes through the machine when it's not yet frozen, but around 40 degrees, and it's a great place for [_Listeria_] to grow,' says Marler.\n\nIt's not the 1st time contaminated ice cream has sickened Americans. In December 2014, Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream, Inc. issued a voluntary recall of several of its ice cream, gelato, custard and sorbet products when they tested positive for _Listeria_ and sickened 2 people. In 1994, 200 000 people became ill from eating Schwan's ice cream that had been transported by a distribution truck that had previously transported non-pasteurized liquid eggs contaminated with _Salmonella_.\n\nOther recent dairy outbreaks include a 2014 outbreak of listeriosis in cheese and dairy products produced by Oasis Brands, Inc., when 5 people became ill and 1 died. A year earlier, 6 people were infected with _Listeria_ in Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Company cheese products -- one person died.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Listeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by the bacterium, _Listeria monocytogenes_, a gram-positive bacillus that is transmitted to humans, other than newborn infants, by ingestion of contaminated food. (Neonatal listeriosis is acquired transplacentally or during or after delivery.) _Listeria_ can be found in a variety of raw foods as well as in processed foods and foods made from unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization or cooking at temperatures higher than 150 F (65 C) should kill _L. monocytogenes_. However, contamination can occur after pasteurization or cooking, and unlike many other foodborne bacteria, _Listeria_ multiply at refrigerator temperatures (between 35-38 F (2-3 C) and is reported to survive freezer temperatures (http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11102004-072203/unrestricted/Beverly_dis.pdf).\n\nInfection with this organism results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.\n\nListeriosis was added to the list of nationally notifiable diseases in 2001. Almost all reported cases of listeriosis have invasive infection in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (e.g., amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to those from patients outside the cluster (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance.html). - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/219.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\n Communicated by:\nDr Tony Ellam\nConsultant in Communicable Disease Control (ret)\n<tonypj@meadlane.freeserve.co.uk>\n\n******\n \n\nOther recent dairy outbreaks include a 2014 outbreak of listeriosis in cheese and dairy products produced by Oasis Brands, Inc., when 5 people became ill and 1 died.

The bacterium was detected in tissues of the dead animals and in feed samples. This confirms the initial suspicions by the competent veterinary association of Kumanovo and representatives from the Food and Veterinary Agency.\n\nThe infection was caused by contaminated silage, a common source of infection for such cases in winter and early spring. The incubation period for the disease is 2-3 weeks; unfortunately, the breeder, without being aware of the problem, continued to feed the animals with the contaminated silage up to the appearance of the clinical signs.\n\nRepresentatives of the Food and Veterinary Agency visited the farm on 15 Jan 2015, and noted the disease subsiding and no new cases appearing. Restrictions on the movements of the animals and disinfection requirements have been imposed on the affected farm. Guidelines to protect humans from infection have been issued. The measures will remain in force until expiration of the incubation period of the disease following detection of the last case.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nElena Arsevska\n<elena.arsevska@cirad.fr>\n\n[A wide variety of animal species can be infected with _Listeria monocytogenes_, but clinical listeriosis is mainly a ruminant disease, with occasional sporadic cases in other species. Outbreaks in ruminants are most prevalent during spring and winter seasons. Soil contamination and ingestion of contaminated silage are the primary modes of transmission. Poor quality silage, a pH greater than 5.5 is commonly implicated, and accounts for listeriosis often being referred to as 'silage disease'. Both host management and the pathogen itself make different contributions to the occurrence of the disease.\n\nThe clinical manifestations of listeriosis in animals include rhombencephalitis (affecting the brainstem and cerebellum; or in some cases more disseminated encephalitic changes), septicaemia, and abortion, especially in sheep, goats, and cattle. During an outbreak within a flock or herd, usually only one clinical form of listeriosis is encountered. The rhombencephalitic form is referred to as 'circling disease' because of a tendency of the animal to circle in one direction, and it is the most common manifestation of the disease in ruminants. Also, it is amongst the most common causes of neurological disease in ruminants. The clinical signs include depression, anorexia, head pressing or turning of the head to one side, and unilateral cranial nerve paralysis. The latter is due to involvement of cranial nerves and their nuclei within the brainstem. Abortion is usually late term (after 7 months in cattle and 12 weeks in sheep). The septicaemic form is relatively uncommon and generally, but not invariably, occurs in the neonate. It is marked by depression, inappetence, fever, and death. In sheep, endophthalmitis (inflammation of the ocular cavities and their adjacent structures) is a typical disease sign, and may be unilateral. Rarely, mastitis (inflammation of breast tissue) of ruminants has been associated with _L. monocytogenes_ infection. Gastrointestinal infections can occasionally occur in sheep.\n\nThe post-mortem findings and histopathology in animal listeriosis depend on the clinical presentation. In the encephalitic form, the cerebrospinal fluid may be cloudy and the meningeal vessels congested. Gross lesions are generally subtle and characterised by vascular congestion and mild tan discoloration of the brainstem. On occasion, the medulla shows areas of softening (malacia) and abscessation. Characteristic histopathological changes consist of foci of intraparenchymal neutrophils and macrophages (microabscesses) in the brainstem with adjacent perivascular mononuclear cuffing. The microabscesses often affect one side more severely. More extensive malacic pathology may occur. The medulla and pons are most severely involved. In the septicaemic form, multiple foci of necrosis in the liver and, less frequently the spleen, may be noted. Aborted fetuses of ruminants show very few gross lesions, but autolysis may be present if the fetus was retained before being expelled.\n\nThose diseases affecting the nervous system such as rabies, gid (coenurosis or sturdy; invasion of the brain and spinal cord by the intermediate stage of _Taenia multiceps_), scrapie, pregnancy toxemia, and deficiency diseases in lambs such as enzootic ataxia (swayback) and polioencephalomalacia (PEM, or cerebrocortical necrosis, CCN) should be differentiated from listeriosis. Silage feeding should be discontinued if an outbreak of listeriosis is confirmed. In the case of abortion, isolation of aborting ewes and does from their offspring reduces further infection of the dam. The recommended drugs used for treatment of listeriosis include oxytetracycline, penicillin-G, and dexamethasone.\n\nListeriosis is zoonotic; affected animals may not be slaughtered for meat. They must be either treated immediately or euthanized.\n\nThe food industry and public health agencies play a pivotal role in the prevention of foodborne listeriosis by developing and implementing effective HACCP (hazard analysis and critical control points) programmes to reduce the presence of _L. monocytogenes_ at all critical points in the food production and distribution chain (from the farm to the market). Likewise, the lack of well designed and tested vaccines for animal use, means that control of listeriosis in animals is most feasible by preventing the environmental conditions that favour its presentation. There is a well established link between silage feeding and listeriosis and, as _L. monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in nature, with animals and birds acting as carriers, contamination of silage is not uncommon. Emphasis should therefore be placed on reducing the likelihood of the multiplication of the organism, which occurs more frequently at pH values greater than 5, particularly where ineffective fermentation has occurred and where there is concomitant growth of moulds. Every effort should be made to produce silage of good quality, with early cutting of grass, minimal contamination with soil or faeces, and ensuring optimal anaerobic fermentation, which will insure that the pH falls below 5.0; at that level, growth of _Listeria_ spp is inhibited. The best silage for feeding should be selected, especially in the case of sheep, discarding material that has obvious signs of contamination with mould. Material a few centimetres from the top, front and sides of an opened bale or bag, should also be discarded. Leftover silage should be removed.\n\nFurther reading:\n1.

Consumers are urged to ask retailers if the apples were supplied by Bidart Bros. Friday [9 Jan 2015], the company confirmed they are closed for the season, but noted the last shipment of apples this past year was sent out on [2 Dec 2014].\n\nThe fruit has been linked to a _Listeria_ infection found in prepackaged caramel apples.

'_Listeria_ is a colder-loving bacteria, so it tends to be on things that you wouldn't suspect, like apples or caramel apples.'\n\nThe disease can contaminate other food in your refrigerator, so consumers who may have purchased the fruit are urged to sanitize the walls and shelves of their refrigerators, cutting boards and counter tops.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is still gathering the list of the specific store locations the apples might have been shipped to, but Fenton confirmed the fruit was sold at various Albertsons, Stater Bros. and Sprouts grocery stores across the nation.\n\n[Byline: Kyndell Nunley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The outbreak caused by 2 genotypically distinct strains of _Listeria_ linked to eating caramel apples has now involved 37 cases, including 6 deaths, in 11 US states.

Based on this finding, FDA conducted an inspection of the facility from 12 Aug 2014, through 3 Sep 2014, and isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ from 25 environmental swabs obtained during the inspection. FDA also issued a report with 12 inspectional observations, citing the firm for numerous unsanitary conditions and poor equipment maintenance.\n\nOn 28 Aug 2014, Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. agreed to conduct a voluntary recall of mung bean sprouts and notified customers by telephone. Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. ceased production of sprouts on 28 Aug 2014, and resumed production on 15 Sep 2014 after _Listeria monocytogenes_ was not identified in finished product. From 7-31 Oct 2014, FDA re-inspected the facility and identified _Listeria monocytogenes_ in 9 environmental swabs. FDA investigators issued another report to the firm, noting 12 inspectional observations involving unsanitary conditions and poor equipment maintenance. Nine of these observations had persisted from the previous inspection.\n\nOn 14 Oct 2014, Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. ceased production of all products except mung bean and soy bean sprouts. FDA is working with the company to ensure that they do not produce sprouts until FDA has adequate assurances that this persistent and dangerous strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ is sufficiently controlled. Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) is working to embargo all product[s] at Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. and the other wholesalers that presently have product. In addition, IDPH has asked local health departments to contact facilities in their jurisdictions that have received the product to have the facilities either hold the product or destroy per the CDC recommendations.\n\nFDA performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on the isolates from mung bean sprouts and environmental samples from Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. to further characterize the _Listeria_ isolates. Compared with PFGE, WGS provides a clearer distinction of genetic differences among _Listeria_ isolates (strains that are highly related by WGS are more likely to have a common source).\n\nPublic health investigators used PFGE and WGS to identify cases of illness that were caused by highly related strains and therefore possibly related to products made at Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. This included data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network of state and local public health laboratories, CDC, and federal food regulatory laboratories that perform molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.\n\nWhole-genome sequences of _Listeria_ strains isolated from 5 ill people were found to be highly related to sequences of the _Listeria_ strain isolated from mung bean sprouts produced by Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. These ill people have been reported from 2 states: Illinois (4) and Michigan (1). They became ill from June through August 2014. All 5 people were hospitalized, and 2 deaths were reported. Two of the 5 people were interviewed, and both reported consuming bean sprouts in the month before becoming ill.\n\nThe high degree of genetic similarity between isolates from ill people and from mung bean sprouts and environmental samples collected at Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. shows that the food was contaminated with a strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ that can cause serious illness. Although limited information is available about the specific sprout products that the ill people consumed, the whole genome sequencing findings, together with the sprout consumption history of 2 patients and inspection findings at the firm, suggest that these illnesses could be related to products from Wholesome Soy Products, Inc.\n\nCDC, the states involved, and FDA continue to work closely on this ongoing investigation, and new information will be provided when available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above says that _Listeria monocytogenes_ was isolated from mung bean sprouts and sprout irrigation water on 13 Aug 2014 at Wholesome Soy Products; and the company ceased production and recalled mung bean sprouts on 28 Aug 2014. The company resumed production on 15 Sep 2014 after _L. monocytogenes_ was not identified in finished product. However, from 7-31 Oct 2014, on re-inspection of the facility by the FDA, _L. monocytogenes_ was again identified in 9 environmental swabs, but the news report above then says, 'On 14 Oct 2014, Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. ceased production of all products except mung bean and soy bean sprouts.' So, potentially contaminated sprouts may again be available in stores. Clarification on this matter would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.\n\nListeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by _L. monocytogenes_ transmitted to humans who are not newborn infants by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.\n\nListeriosis was added to the list of nationally notifiable diseases in 2001. Almost all reported cases of listeriosis have invasive infection in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (e.g., amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to those from patients outside the cluster (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance.html).\n\nThe average annual incidence of invasive listeriosis in the United States was 0.29 cases per 100 000 population for 2009-2011, with a case-fatality rate (CFR) (deaths and fetal losses) of 21 percent (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6222a4.htm?s_cid=mm6222a4_w).\n\nFor a further discussion of listeriosis, please see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail posts Listeriosis, fatal - USA: (CO) 20110605.1719. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]", "summary": "promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above says that _Listeria monocytogenes_ was isolated from mung bean sprouts and sprout irrigation water on 13 Aug 2014 at Wholesome Soy Products; and the company ceased production and recalled mung bean sprouts on 28 Aug 2014. \n\nWhole genome sequences of the _Listeria_ strains isolated from mung bean sprouts produced by Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. and environmental isolates collected at the production facility were found to be highly related to sequences of _Listeria_ strains isolated from 5 people who became ill from June through August 2014.

If previously refrigerated soup had been reheated sufficiently before serving, _Listeria_ again should have been killed. The FDA recommends that soups, sauces, and gravy should be brought to a boil when reheating, and leftovers should be reheated to 165 F (74 C) (http://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm079667.htm).

The disease affects primarily older adults, pregnant women, newborns, and persons with weakened immune systems. On average, 7 cases of listeriosis are reported in Minnesota each year. Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. Infected pregnant women may experience only a mild, flu-like illness; however, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, premature delivery, or infection of the newborn. Symptoms begin from 3 to 70 days after consuming the bacteria.\n\nAnyone who believes they may have become ill with listeriosis should contact their health care provider.\n\n[Byline: Bruce Clark]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n& Dr Tony Ellam\nRetired Consultant in Communicable Disease Control\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 19 Dec 2014\nSource: Chicago Tribune [edited]\nhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/chi-listeria-caramel-apples-20141219-story.html\n\n\nFive people have died and 21 others have been hospitalized in a [listeriosis] outbreak linked to caramel apples, federal health officials said today [19 Dec 2014].\n\nA total of 28 people infected with _Listeria_ have been reported from 10 states, according to a statement from the US Centers for Disease Control. 11 of the cases are in the Midwest: 5 in Missouri, 4 in Minnesota and 2 in Wisconsin.\n\n[A map of the USA showing states with cases of listeriosis linked to caramel apples is available at the source URL.]\n\nThe CDC warned consumers not to eat any pre-packaged, commercially-produced caramel apples, including those with other toppings such as nuts, chocolate or sprinkles, until more information is available.

In addition, 2 cases related to the outbreak have been reported by the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n\nOf the 6 deaths tied to the outbreak, all of the victims were confirmed to be infected with the outbreak strain of bacteria, but [listeriosis] contributed directly to only 3 of the deaths. It's unclear whether [listeriosis] contributed to 2 others, and 1 death wasn't related to the infection, health officials said.\n\nThe CDC continues to warn consumers not to eat any prepackaged caramel apples while the investigation into the [listeriosis] outbreak continues. That includes plain caramel apples and those decorated with nuts, sprinkles or chocolate.\n\n3 firms have issued voluntary recalls for commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples in connection with the outbreak that led to illnesses reported from [17 Oct to 11 Dec 2014]. Happy Apples of Washington, Missouri, issued a recall on [24 Dec 2014] for packaged apples sold at grocery stores, discount stores and club stores in more than 30 states. California Snack Foods of South El Monte, California, issued a recall [27 Dec 2014], for all styles of its Karm'l Dapples products sold in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas and Utah. And Merb's Candies of St. Louis, Missouri, issued a recall of its Bionic Apples and Double Dipped Apples sold in St. Louis stores and by mail order nationwide.\n\nAll of the retailers said they were issuing recalls after learning that Bidart Bros., a Bakersfield, California, apple producer, had voluntarily recalled fresh apples because they may be contaminated with _Listeria_.

[Listeriosis is caused by the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_.]\n\nAccording to the CDC, as of [30 Dec 2014], 32 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 11 states. The CDC reports that 31 ill people have been hospitalized. 6 deaths have been reported. Listeriosis contributed to 3 of these deaths and it is unclear whether it contributed to 2 others. The 6th death was unrelated to listeriosis. 10 illnesses were pregnancy-related, with 1 illness resulting in a fetal loss.\n\nThe CDC reports that 23 of the 26 ill people interviewed reported eating commercially-produced, prepackaged whole caramel apples. To date, caramel apple brands named in interviews include Happy Apple, Carnival and Merb's Candies. However, the investigation is ongoing and other brands may be identified. No illnesses related to this outbreak have been linked to apples that are not caramel-coated and are not prepackaged, and no illnesses have been linked to caramel candy.\n\nOn [18 Dec 2014], the Minnesota Department of Health reported 4 illnesses. The Minnesota cases purchased caramel apples from Cub Foods, Kwik Trip, and Mike's Discount Foods, which carried Carnival brand and Kitchen Cravings brand caramel apples. These 2 brands are no longer available for purchase at retail locations.\n\n3 companies have issued voluntary recalls of caramel apples because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_. These companies are: Happy Apple Company of Washington, Missouri; California Snack Foods, of El Monte, California; [and] Merb's Candies of St. Louis, Missouri. Each company reported receiving notice from Bidart Bros., an apple supplier headquartered in Bakersfield, California, that there may be a connection between the listeriosis outbreak and the apples supplied to them by Bidart Bros.\n\nThe FDA has traced the distribution of the caramel apples eaten by 8 ill people involved in the outbreak. Although the Happy Apple Company and Merb's Candies receive apples from other growers, the FDA's ongoing traceback investigation has confirmed that Bidart Bros. is the only apple grower that supplied apples to both companies.\n\nOn [22 Dec 2014], the FDA briefed Bidart Bros. on the status of the investigation. On [22 Dec 2014], Bidart Bros. issued a recall of Granny Smith apples it sold in 2014 to those customers known to produce caramel apples. Then, on [24 Dec 2014], Bidart Bros. notified all customers receiving Granny Smith apples in 2014 to recall those apples if they had been used to make caramel apples.\n\nThe FDA is continuing its investigation into whether there are common sources of caramel, caramel ingredients, sticks, or packaging to these caramel apple makers. Additionally, FDA and state investigators are working to identify the source of the contamination and determine what products may be contaminated. New information will be provided as it becomes available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The outbreak caused by 2 genotypically distinct strains of _Listeria_ linked to eating caramel apples has now involved 32 cases, including 6 deaths, in 11 US states. In addition, 2 Canadians have also developed listeriosis caused by _Listeria_ with the same genotype as one of the US outbreak strains.

The warning follows 20 people in Denmark falling ill from contaminated food and 12 of those victims dying.\n\nTurid Berglund, senior advisor for the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, said: 'We ask everyone who shopped for food in Denmark recently to listen out for any information from the Danish authorities. Please take a look in your fridge to see if you have any meat products bought from Denmark.\n\nThe source of contamination is thought to be a type of cold cut meat. The Danish authorities have so far not confirmed which product it is, but suspicion is directed towards head cheese or rolled sausage ('Rullepoelse'), from the company 'Joern A Rullepoelser A/S' in Hedehusene, Denmark.\n\nThe products are sold in the supermarket chains 'SuperBest', 'Eurospar', and select 'Spar' stores. Berglund said: 'If you have such a package, then we ask you to throw it in the bin. We have no reason to suspect other Danish food groceries sold in Norway.'\n\nBerglund advised it is usually people already unwell -- high-risk groups -- who are most exposed to becoming ill from _Listeria_. She still encouraged Norwegians having had their vacation in Denmark, and bought Danish meat products there, to check who produced it. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority now awaits confirmation from Denmark on where the possibly contaminated products are sold and if they could have been distributed to Norway.

The cases in Sweden are said to have been linked to consumption of contaminated cold cuts, but we are not told about patient characteristics.\n\n_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in nature and is transmitted to humans who are not newborn infants by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection may result in diarrhea, but almost all reported cases of listeriosis have invasive infection in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. People at risk of developing invasive listeriosis are newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses.\n\nContamination of food can occur in nature; e.g., raw vegetables contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk from infected cows, or contamination may occur following subsequent cooking or other processing.

Almost all listeriosis occurs in persons in higher-risk groups (the elderly, pregnant women, newborns, and immunocompromised persons) and in the USA most cases of listeriosis occur in the age group over 65 years (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6222a4.htm?s_cid=mm6222a4_w).\n\nA possible reason for the higher and increasing incidence of listeriosis in Scandinavian countries includes increasingly more people at risk of invasive listeriosis in these countries, for example, an increasingly aged population. However, in Denmark at least, the incidence of listeriosis has risen substantially within the age group of over 70-year-olds, so demographic changes alone do not explain the increase (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19522).\n\nAnother possible explanation is increasing exposure to _Listeria monocytogenes_ because of increasing levels of food contamination or increased consumption of contaminated food. _L. monocytogenes_ is frequently present in raw foods of both plant and animal origin and may be also present in cooked foods if contaminated after cooking. Even if _L. monocytogenes_ is initially present at a low level in a contaminated food, because of its ability to grow during refrigerated storage, levels of contamination are likely to increase during refrigerated storage of those foods that can support the growth of the microorganism.\n\nListeriosis outbreaks have been frequently attributed to refrigerated ready-to-eat food (RTE) (such as, such as pate, cold cut meats, and fish) that is eaten without further cooking. In fact, consumer surveys from Statistics Denmark, comparing the period from 2005 to 2007 with the period from 2003 to 2005, indicate that expenditures for RTE products have increased by 87 percent for RTE meat products and by 34 percent for RTE fish products among individuals older than 60 years and living alone (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19522). - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/20NO.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Tel Aviv Medical Center\nIsrael\n<mberger@post.tau.ac.il>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Berger for his continuing contributions. ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRates of listeriosis have been increasing in Scandinavia for over 20 years, and are currently 2- to 5-fold higher than those reported in the United States -- see graph (black arrow = USA) (1-3), http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/ListeriaSweden.png). \n\nA possible reason for the higher and increasing incidence of listeriosis in Scandinavian countries includes increasingly more people at risk of invasive listeriosis in these countries, for example, an increasingly aged population.

Listeria can cause a serious, life-threatening illness.\n\nThere are currently 2 cases of listeriosis in Canada with the same genetic fingerprint as seen in the US investigation (one case in Ontario, one case in Manitoba). The investigation continues to determine if these individuals consumed prepackaged caramel apples imported from the US.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada and its federal partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada are investigating whether the products potentially linked to illnesses in the US may have been imported into Canada. As a precaution, the Public Health Agency of Canada is advising that Canadians do not eat commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples imported from the US until further notice. This includes plain caramel apples as well as those containing nuts, sprinkles, chocolate, or other toppings. These products could have a shelf life of one month.\n\nBased on current information related to this investigation, the risk to Canadians is low. The Public Health Agency of Canada and its partners will notify Canadians of any increased risk to public health as new information becomes available.\n\nThe status of these [2 Canadian] individuals is not known at this time.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada is working with its provincial and territorial partners to determine the source of these illnesses. At this time, it is not known whether these illnesses are linked to commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples imported from the US. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is working closely with US officials to determine if any potentially affected product may have been distributed in Canada. If products are identified, the Agency will inform the public and ensure that they are promptly removed from the marketplace.\n\nIf you have any commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples imported from the US in your home, do not eat them. If you have a candy apple product and are unsure if it would qualify as a caramel apple, do not consume it. Secure the caramel apple in a plastic bag and throw it out. Then wash your hands thoroughly in warm soapy water. Securing it in a plastic bag will ensure that no animals consume the product from your garbage. Food contaminated with listeria may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. If you suspect you have been ill from eating a commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apple, talk to your healthcare provider.\n\nIn the milder form of the disease [listeriosis], symptoms can start the following day after consuming a product with listeria. For the more serious form of the disease, the incubation period is generally much longer; on average about 21 days, but can be up to 70 days after exposure. Listeriosis can be treated with antibiotics, but early diagnosis is key, especially for people at high risk, such as pregnant women, older adults and people with weakened immune systems.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada, in collaboration with federal, provincial and territorial partners, will continue to monitor for and investigate any new cases of [listeriosis] that may be related to this outbreak as part of its routine surveillance activities.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 25 Dec 2014\nSource: The Washington Post [edited]\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/12/25/missouri-company-recalls-caramel-apples-that-may-be-linked-to-listeria-outbreak/\n\n\nA Missouri company is recalling packaged caramel apples that may be linked to a [listeriosis] outbreak that has hospitalized 29 people and killed at least 3 in 10 states. Happy Apples of Washington, Missouri, recalled caramel apples carrying a best-use date between [25 Aug 2014] and [23 Nov 2014] that were sold in grocery, discount, and club stores in packs of one, 3, 4, and 8. In a statement issued on Wednesday [24 Dec 1024], the company said an apple supplier, Bidart Brothers, had notified it that 'there may be a connection between this outbreak and the apples that they supplied' to a Happy Apples facility in California.\n\nOn Friday [19 Dec 2014], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned consumers to stop eating prepackaged caramel apples while it investigated the outbreak [due to] _Listeria monocytogenes_, a bacterium that causes the rare but sometimes fatal infection [listeriosis]. Older people, pregnant women, newborns, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to the pathogen. CDC said 9 of the illnesses occurred in pregnant women or newborns. 3 people have come down with meningitis.\n\nIn 2011, listeria in cantaloupes killed 33 people and sickened 147 in 28 states, according to CDC. In the current outbreak, no illnesses have been associated with uncoated apples or caramel candy, or with caramel apples that are not prepackaged, the agency said.\n\nCDC originally linked the bacteria to 5 deaths, but the Food and Drug Administration, in an update posted on Thursday [25 Dec 2014], said only 3 deaths can be attributed to listeria. It is unclear whether a 4th death is connected to listeria, the FDA said, and the 5th was not caused by the organism.\n\nOn Monday [22 Dec 2014], Seattle food safety attorney Bill Marler filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Safeway grocery store chain over the death of 81 year old, who, Marler stated, bought a caramel apple shortly before Halloween and died [2 Dec 2014]. Listeriosis was the cause of death, according to the statement, which cited [the patient's] family. Safeway later pulled the caramel apples from its shelves.\n\nHealth officials still have not determined the location of the listeria contamination.\n\nHappy Apples said the caramel apples were available in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin. The company ceased production of them at the end of October [2014]. They are no longer available in stores.\n\n[byline: Lenny Bernstein]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A listeriosis outbreak has involved so far at least 3 deaths and 29 illnesses in 10 US states and has now been linked to eating Happy Valley Brand Caramel Apples made by the Happy Apple Company, which has manufacturing facilities are located in Orosi, California and Union, Missouri.

The death was in Minnesota, while illnesses from _Listeria monocytogenes_ were reported in Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\n3 Crave Brothers pasteurized soft cheeses were the subject of a nationwide recall as a result of the outbreak: Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with truffles. All 3 had previously captured national and international awards for Crave, one of Wisconsin's most well-known cheesemakers.\n\n'Inspection of the cheesemaking facility revealed that substantial sanitation deficiencies during the cheesemaking process itself, after the milk was pasteurized, likely led to contamination,' CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report noted.\n\nPasteurization, a process in which milk is heated to a high temperature to destroy pathogens, eliminates listeria in milk. But contamination can occur after pasteurization, according to government regulators. 'Cheese-making facilities should use strict sanitation and microbiologic monitoring, regardless of whether they use pasteurized milk,' the CDC report said. Details of the contamination were not in the report, and Crave Brothers declined to comment.\n\nThe 5 people sickened told health department officials they had definitely or probably eaten 1 of 3 varieties of Crave soft-ripened cheese. 3 of the people had purchased the cheese at 3 different restaurants, and 2 had purchased it at 2 different grocery stores. The cheeses were shipped as intact wheels to the restaurants and stores, where they had been cut and served or cut and repackaged and sold to customers, according to the CDC report.\n\nLaboratory tests conducted by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture on samples of the cheeses from 2 retail stores indicated the presence of the outbreak strain [of] _Listeria monocytogenes_.\n\nListeria infections are among the 3 most deadly foodborne bacteria after toxoplasmosis and salmonellosis.\n\nCrave Brothers issued voluntary product recalls 2 days after it halted production of the 3 cheeses. On [11 Jul 2013], the company voluntarily halted production of all cheese products made in the plant, the report noted.\n\nAll 5 people sickened in the outbreak were hospitalized, including the pregnant woman who suffered a miscarriage. They ranged in age from 31 to 67 years old, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe company has not been fined, and checks of court records haven't revealed lawsuits. Cheesemakers could face criminal charges for shipping contaminated cheese into the marketplace, according to Bill Marler, a Seattle attorney who specializes in food safety cases.

A query of PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, identified clinical and environmental isolates from other states. On [28 Jun 2013], CDC learned from the Food and Drug Administration's Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation Network that environmental isolates indistinguishable from those of the 2 patients had been collected from Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese during 2010-2011.\n\nAs of [28 Jun 2014], 5 cases [who had isolation of _L. monocytogenes_ with the outbreak PFGE pattern from an anatomic site that is normally sterile (such as, blood or cerebrospinal fluid), or from a product of conception] were identified in 4 states (Minnesota, 2 cases; Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, one case each). Median age of the 5 patients was 58 years (range: 31-67 years). 4 patients were female, including one who was pregnant at the time of infection. All 5 were hospitalized. 1 death and 1 miscarriage were reported.\n\nAll 5 patients had definitely or probably eaten one of 3 varieties of Crave Brothers soft-ripened cheese (Les Freres, Petit Frere, or Petit Frere with truffles). 3 patients had purchased the cheese at 3 different restaurants, and 2 had purchased the cheese at 2 different grocery stores. The cheeses were shipped as intact wheels to the 3 restaurants and 2 grocery stores, where they had been cut and served or repackaged and sold to customers.\n\nTesting at the Minnesota Department of Agriculture identified the outbreak pattern of _L. monocytogenes_ in 2 cheese wedges (Les Freres and Petit Frere with truffles) collected from 2 different grocery stores in Minnesota. Inspection of the cheese-making facility revealed that substantial sanitation deficiencies during the cheese-making process itself, after the milk was pasteurized, likely led to contamination. On [1 Jul 2013], Crave Brothers halted production of Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with truffles. On [3 Jul 2013], Crave Brothers issued a voluntary recall of these products with a production date of [1 Jul 2013], or earlier. On [11 Jul 2013], the company voluntarily halted production of all cheese products manufactured at the facility. After product recall, one additional case was identified in Texas through whole genome sequencing, bringing the total case count for the outbreak to 6.\n\nThis outbreak was linked to soft cheeses that were likely contaminated during the cheese-making process (2,3). Pasteurization eliminates _Listeria_ in milk. However, contamination can occur after pasteurization.

The number of ill persons identified includes 2 from Minnesota, and one each from Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and now one from Texas. One of the 2 Minnesota victims died, and another person sickened was a pregnant woman, whose illness resulted in a miscarriage. All 6 ill persons were hospitalized.\n\nOn 3 Jul 2013, the Waterloo-based company recalled 3 varieties of soft cheese, including its Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with Truffles, made on 1 Jul 2013 or earlier due to possible _L. monocytogenes_ contamination. The products were distributed nationwide.\n\nAccording to the CDC, a collaborative investigation is being conducted by local and state public health and regulatory agencies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration indicates that Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with Truffles cheeses are the likely source of the outbreak.\n\nInformation about specific cheeses consumed is available for 5 of the 6 ill persons. Of those, all 5 either definitely or probably ate Les Freres cheese made by Crave Brothers before getting sick, according to the CDC.\n\nAmong persons for whom information is available, dates that illnesses were diagnosed range from 20 May to 7 Jul 2013. Ill persons range in age from 30 to 67 years, with a median age of 55 years, and 83 percent are female, according to the CDC. Clinical specimens that were collected after 10 Aug 2013 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. It takes an average of 2-3 weeks.\n\nPublic health investigators used DNA 'fingerprints' of _Listeria_ bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulse-field gel electrophoresis to identify cases of illness that may be part of the outbreak. The DNA fingerprint of the outbreak strain is typically associated with about 14 cases per year, even in the absence of a recognized outbreak, according to the CDC website.\n\nBetween 2-10 Jul 2013, the FDA conducted an inspection at the firm's processing facility in cooperation with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture. During that inspection, the FDA collected a sample of Petit Frere with Truffles that was found to contain _Listeria monocytogenes_ with the same DNA fingerprint as the outbreak strain, the CDC reported.\n\nCrave Brothers cheese stopped production, and the FDA and the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture are monitoring corrective action being made by the firm.\n\nAbout 800 laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis are reported each year in the United States, and typically 3 or 4 outbreaks are identified and reported to the CDC annually. The organism can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.\n\nCrave Brothers Farmstead Cheese did not provide a comment on the one new outbreak.\n\n[Byline: Diane Graff]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The report above adds one more case to the 5 cases of listeriosis previously posted (Listeriosis - USA: fatal, cheese, recall 20130710.1816187) in now 5 states with still one death (in Minnesota) and one miscarriage. The prior post indicated that the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ was identified on the basis of genotyping in cheeses made by Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Company of Waterloo, Wisconsin. Les Frere and the smaller version Petit Frere sold in wooden boxes are washed rind, semi-soft, soft ripened cheeses; for a picture of them, see http://www.cravecheese.com/cheese-detail.php?Petit-Fr-re-5.\n\nThe cheeses are described as being 'hand-ladeled' [sic, probably ladled by hand], washed regularly with brine, and matured for a minimum of 3 weeks on site,' (http://culturecheesemag.com/node/1227).\n\nOn 3 Jul 2013, Crave Brothers recalled the 3 implicated cheeses with make dates of 1 Jul 2013 or earlier. The recalled cheeses were distributed nationwide through retail and foodservice outlets and mail order. More cases can be anticipated because of the long incubation period for listeriosis, with symptoms sometimes not showing up until 2 months after people have consumed the tainted food, and delays in reporting.\n\nListeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by _L. monocytogenes_ transmitted to humans who are not newborn infants by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.\n\nListeriosis was added to the list of nationally notifiable diseases in 2001. Almost all reported cases of listeriosis have invasive infection in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (e.g., amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to those from patients outside the cluster (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance.html).\n\nThe average annual incidence of invasive listeriosis in the United States was 0.29 cases per 100 000 population for 2009-2011, with a case-fatality rate (CFR) (deaths and fetal losses) of 21 percent (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6222a4.htm?s_cid=mm6222a4_w).\n\nFor a further discussion of listeriosis, please see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail posts Listeriosis, fatal - USA: (CO) 20110605.1719 and Listeriosis - UK (02): (N.

Through these tests, the contaminated food was detected.\n\nOyarce clarified that only 'certain items (those with the bacteria) and not the whole production (of cheese) were affected. A single batch was contaminated.' The products are already being recalled to prevent further infections.\n\nJorge Diaz, assistant health secretary, reported that until last week [week of 22 Apr 2013], 34 cases had been registered in the country including 5 deaths. Santiago is the most affected, with 18 cases and 4 deaths.\n\nThe SEREMI reiterated the call for people to pay attention to hygiene measures when handling food, especially vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women and the elderly and chronically ill, who are more susceptible to [infection] with the bacteria.\n\n'People who are not at risk will most likely not have many problems apart from general malaise, but for people at higher risk, we maintain the preventive message to avoid eating raw foods or foods such as these (soft cheeses), because the risk is higher for them,' she said.\n\nAmong the products that as a general rule could be contaminated are unpasteurized milk and its byproducts, raw meat, fish, and seafood, as well as cold cuts and sausages, and fruit and vegetables that have contacted the soil, as the bacterium is typically found in soil and water.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Santiago Metropolitan Region: turkey ham\nDate: Tue 30 Apr 2013\nSource: Cooperativa.cl [in Spanish, trans.

Samples taken from this store tested positive in our environmental health laboratory,' said Oyarce. From the 14 shops that were investigated in the commune as a result of the infection of one person, only the store in question gave a positive result, but Oyarce said they would to continue to investigate to find other possible sources of contamination.\n\nThe health authority also confirmed that of the 45 samples of different foods from different brands tested during the past week, the Santa Rosa cheeses are the only ones contaminated with listeria.\n\nThe authority outlined the following measures to prevent infection with the disease:\n- wash hands before and after handling food;\n- wash vegetables and fruits;\n- wash surfaces and utensils that have been in contact with foods at risk;\n- separate raw from cooked foods to avoid cross contamination;\n- consume only pasteurized dairy products (milk, fresh cheese, cottage cheese, buttery cheese, chanco cheese, gouda, etc.);\n- reheat food at high temperature, to ensure removal of any contamination. Reheating in microwave ovens may be inadequate.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in nature. The organism can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw and pasteurized milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and in crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects.\n\nMost human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.\n\nRaw milk, soft cheeses such as Latin-American cheeses, feta, brie and camembert, ice cream, raw vegetables and fruit, delicatessen salads such as coleslaw, cold cuts, turkey franks and other hot dogs, pate, deli meats, raw and smoked fish, shellfish such as shrimp, and undercooked chicken have been sources of human listeriosis. Listeria can also survive in frozen food. Even minimal contamination of refrigerated, packaged ready-to-eat products is a problem, since _L. monocytogenes_ grows at refrigerator temperatures, and its presence in food does not alter the taste or smell of the food.\n\nThe sources of human infection can be pinpointed by DNA identification techniques that match _Listeria_ spp isolated from a possible source with the strains recovered from patients.\n\nThere seems to be 2 concurrent listeriosis outbreaks in Chile at the present time: One involves as of the week of 22 Apr 2013, 34 cases, including 5 deaths nationwide. Santiago Metropolitan Region is the most affected, with 18 cases and 4 deaths. This outbreak apparently has been attributed to a batch (#073 210, with an expiration date of 23 May 2013) of Camembert soft cheese of the Santa Rosa brand, which is already being recalled nationwide. This batch was distributed mostly in Santiago and in the Bio Bio Region. The 2nd outbreak involves at least one of the 18 Santiago cases that has been attributed to turkey ham, which is thought to have been contaminated by the cutting machine at a neighborhood store. The linkages of cases to possible sources are not stated. However, DNA fingerprinting of isolates from the suspected source and from patients could confirm a linkage.

According to the SEREMI, once the alert was raised due to the increased number of cases, [health authorities] began an investigation of the products that might be contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_, including raw food and unpasteurized milk, as well as dairy products such as soft cheeses. The organism can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw and pasteurized milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and in crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. \n\nThere seems to be 2 concurrent listeriosis outbreaks in Chile at the present time: One involves as of the week of 22 Apr 2013, 34 cases, including 5 deaths nationwide. \n\nJorge Diaz, assistant health secretary, reported that until last week [week of 22 Apr 2013], 34 cases had been registered in the country including 5 deaths. \n\nThe health authority also confirmed that of the 45 samples of different foods from different brands tested during the past week, the Santa Rosa cheeses are the only ones contaminated with listeria.

The joint investigation indicates that Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with Truffles cheeses made by Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Company of Waterloo, Wisconsin are the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nPublic health investigators are using DNA 'fingerprints' of _Listeria_ obtained through testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.\n\nA total of 5 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_ have been reported from 4 states. The number of ill people identified in each state is as follows: Illinois (1), Indiana (1), Minnesota (2), and Ohio (1).\n\nAmong persons for whom information is available, dates that illness was diagnosed range from 20 May 2013 to 17 Jun 2013. All 5 ill persons were hospitalized. Ill persons range in age from 31 years to 67 years, with a median age of 58 years, and 80 percent are female. One illness in a pregnant woman resulted in a miscarriage. One death was reported in Minnesota.\n\nThe outbreak can be visually described with a chart showing the number of persons who were diagnosed each day [http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/cheese-07-13/epi.html]. This chart is called an epidemic curve or epi curve. Clinical specimens that were collected after 22 Jun 2013 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks.\n\nAbout 800 laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis are reported each year in the United States, and typically 3 or 4 outbreaks are identified and reported to CDC annually. Some foods that have been linked to outbreaks in recent years are Mexican-style soft cheeses, imported ricotta salata cheese, whole cantaloupe, raw sprouts, and pre-cut celery.\n\nInvestigation of the outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and trace-back investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with Truffles cheeses manufactured by Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Company are the likely source of this outbreak of listeriosis.\n\nIn interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods consumed and other exposures in the month before becoming ill. All 5 ill persons reported consuming a soft cheese. Information about specific cheeses consumed is available for 4 of the ill persons. Of those, 3 either definitely or probably ate Les Freres cheese made by Crave Brothers before getting sick. Investigation of specific types of cheeses consumed by other ill persons is ongoing.\n\nLaboratory tests conducted by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture on samples of Les Freres and Petit Frere with Truffles cheeses made by Crave Brothers from 2 retail stores indicate the presence of the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_. Further testing and confirmation of the results are pending.\n\nOn 3 Jul 2013, Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Company of Waterloo, Wisconsin voluntarily recalled its Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with Truffles cheeses with make dates of 1 Jul 2013 or earlier due to possible _L. monocytogenes_ contamination. The recalled cheeses were distributed nationwide through retail and foodservice outlets as well as by mail orders.\n\nThe FDA is conducting an inspection at Crave Brothers' processing facility in coordination with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture. FDA is working closely with CDC, Crave Brothers, and public health authorities in states where illnesses occurred to determine the exact cause of contamination.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The CDC report above concerns 5 cases of listeriosis in 4 states, with 1 death (in Minnesota) and 1 miscarriage.

More cases can be anticipated because of the long incubation period for listeriosis, with symptoms sometimes not showing up until 2 months after people have consumed the tainted food.\n\nListeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis, caused by _Listeria monocytogenes_, transmitted to humans by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare (about 2500 cases occur annually in the USA), but [that type of] the disease has an overall mortality rate of 20 to 30 percent.

Public health investigators are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network of state and local public health laboratories, CDC, and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. The PulseNet data consists of DNA 'fingerprints' of _Listeria_ obtained through testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE. We are supplementing PFGE data with whole-genome sequencing.

The 3 other illnesses occurred among adults. One death was reported in California. All ill persons were reported to be of Hispanic ethnicity.\n\nThe outbreak can be visually described with a chart showing the number of persons who were diagnosed each day. This chart is called an epidemic curve or epi curve. Clinical specimens that were collected after [1 Feb 2014] might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks.\n\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\n-----------------------------\nIn interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods consumed and other exposures in the month before becoming ill. All patients in Maryland reported consuming soft or semi-soft Hispanic-style cheese and all shopped at different locations of same food store chain (Chain A). Testing of cheese products collected from Chain A stores was performed in Maryland and Virginia.\n\nVirginia's Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services (DCLS) identified the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_ in a sample of Cuajada en Terron (fresh cheese curd) collected by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) from a Chain A store. This cheese was likely produced by Roos Foods of Kenton, Delaware, and was later repackaged in the Chain A store. VDACS issued a press release on [15 Feb 2014] instructing persons who purchased this product not to consume the cheese and to discard any remaining product.\n\nVDACS subsequently collected pre-packaged Cuajada en Terron produced by Roos Foods from Chain A that was not repackaged in the store. The Virginia DCLS identified _L. monocytogenes_ from these samples; a consumer advisory was issued on [21 Feb 2014]. DNA fingerprinting and whole-genome sequencing will be performed on these isolates. In addition, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has tested samples of pre-packaged cheese products purchased at Chain A stores; those products produced by Roos Foods are preliminarily positive for _L. monocytogenes_. On [19 Feb 2014], the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a warning to consumers to not eat any cheese products made by Roos Foods. Their warning stated that Roos Foods cheese products are sold under brand names Santa Rosa de Lima, Amigo, Mexicana, Suyapa, La Chapina, and La Purisima Crema Nica.\n\n[The epidemic curve and consumer advisories are available at the source URL.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The reports above say that an outbreak in the US of listeriosis linked to semi-soft, Latino-style cheese called Cuajada en Terron has involved 8 people so far including 5 (2 mother-newborn pairs and a newborn) that were related to pregnancy. There has been one fatality. The 5 isolates are closely related on DNA typing. There may be additional cases because of the long incubation period for listeriosis of up to 60 days.\n\nListeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by _L. monocytogenes_ transmitted to humans who are not newborn infants by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection.\n\nListeriosis was added to the list of nationally notifiable diseases in the US in 2001. Almost all reported cases of listeriosis have invasive infection in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (e.g., amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to those from patients outside the cluster (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance.html).\n\nIn the US, the CDC reported 1651 people were sickened by listeriosis during 2009-2011; the average annual incidence was 0.29 cases per 100 000 population, with a case-fatality rate (CFR) (deaths and fetal losses) of 21 percent (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6222a4.htm?s_cid=mm6222a4_w). At least 90 percent of people who get listeriosis are in a high risk group; pregnant women, the fetus and newborns, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease. Infection during pregnancy can cause fetal loss (miscarriage or stillbirth), preterm delivery, and illness or death in newborn infants. Pregnant women are about 10 times more likely than the general population to get listeriosis and pregnant Hispanic women are about 24 times more likely than the general population to get listeriosis (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/risk.html). Although the news report tells us newborns were infected in 3 of 5 pregnancy-related illnesses, we are not told the outcome of the pregnancies in the 2 other mothers.\n\nMany outbreaks have been linked to soft cheese made with unpasteurized milk. However, in the period 2009-2011, 5 outbreak investigations by the CDC implicated soft cheeses made from pasteurized milk that the CDC says were likely contaminated during cheese-making (4 implicated Mexican-style cheese, and 1 implicated 2 other types of cheese); 2 outbreaks were linked to raw produce (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6222a4.htm?s_cid=mm6222a4_w). _Listeria_ grows at refrigeration temperatures, so it can thrive when soft cheeses that support its growth have been contaminated.\n\nCuajada, which means 'curdled' in Spanish, is a cheese that is popular in Latin America, especially in El Salvador and Nicaragua. The following is extracted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuajada and http://www.nicaliving.com/node/1092: Raw milk that is warmed or heated to about 80 degrees C is mixed with rennet, vinegar, or citrus juice and left to curdle. The precipitate is placed in cheesecloth to drain. Cuajada is usually served as dessert with honey and walnuts or sometimes sugar, and, less often, for breakfast with fruit or honey. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/3DHP.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\n promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The reports above say that an outbreak in the US of listeriosis linked to semi-soft, Latino-style cheese called Cuajada en Terron has involved 8 people so far including 5 (2 mother-newborn pairs and a newborn) that were related to pregnancy.

In addition, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has tested samples of pre-packaged cheese products purchased at Chain A stores; those products produced by Roos Foods are preliminarily positive for _L. monocytogenes_. At least 90 percent of people who get listeriosis are in a high risk group; pregnant women, the fetus and newborns, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease. Clinical specimens that were collected after [1 Feb 2014] might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. \n\nMany outbreaks have been linked to soft cheese made with unpasteurized milk.

The 2 other patients, one from Concord hospital and another from the Royal Prince Alfred are responding well to treatment.\n\nThe profiteroles, which were made by Rich Products Australia, have since been withdrawn from all patient meals.\n\nAn investigation into the outbreak, which is believed to have occurred between mid-March and 16 Apr 2013, is ongoing.\n\nNSW Director of Health Protection Jeremy McAnulty says the risk of further cases is low but if people are concerned they should seek medical advice.\n\n'If people did eat profiteroles in one of the hospitals in central or southwest Sydney and they get the symptoms of listeriosis then they should see their doctor,' he said. 'We've withdrawn them from serving to patients.'\n\n[Symptoms] include fever, muscle aches, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhoea.

Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare (about 2500 cases occur annually in the USA), but the disease has an overall mortality rate of 20 to 30 percent. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.\n\nFood implicated in outbreaks has included raw milk, soft cheeses such as Latin-American cheeses, feta, brie, and Camembert, ice cream, raw vegetables and fruit, or consumption of ready-to-eat food that has been contaminated during processing of food, such as deli meat and delicatessen salads such as coleslaw, raw and smoked fish, shellfish such as shrimp, and undercooked chicken.\n\nWhen _L. monocytogenes_ get into a food-processing facility (such as, factories processing smoked fish, poultry, meat, and dairy products), they persist there for years and can contaminate food after factory cooking, but before packaging. Particularly problematic is the fact that _L. monocytogenes_ can grow in refrigeration temperatures during storage, which is why even minimal contamination with this bacterium during the processing of subsequently refrigerated ready-to-eat food can cause severe foodborne infections.\n\nNosocomial listeriosis has been described previously related to food service in healthcare facilities. Since listeriosis is more severe in newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses, food such as refrigerated, packaged ready-to-eat products, such as, cold cut meats, should not be part of a menu in health care settings.\n\nA profiterole or cream puff is a hollow pastry ball filled with whipped cream, pastry cream, or ice cream and the puff garnished with chocolate sauce, caramel, or a dusting of powdered sugar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiterole).\n\nComparison of the molecular characteristics, such as PFGE, of _L. monocytogenes_ strains isolated from the cases with each other and with that of strains isolated from suspected foods help to confirm a common source for an outbreak.\n\nThe incubation period for listeriosis ranges from 3 to 70 days, with the median incubation period being 3 weeks.

All of the hospital's supplied ready-to-eat meat has since been quarantined, and the results are now part of an investigation into the source of the outbreak, he said.\n\nDirector of Public Health Caroline McElnay said listeriosis has a long incubation period of up to several weeks. Dr McElnay said listeriosis is very rare, and there are only about 25 cases a year in New Zealand. The disease is only dangerous to pregnant women, their babies, the elderly, and people with a lowered immune system. Almost all other people are not harmed by it.\n\nThe outbreak served as a warning for anyone who was immuno-compromised, elderly, or pregnant to be very aware of food safety. People at high risk should not eat ready-to-eat foods like soft cheeses made with pasteurised and unpasteurised milk, processed meat and poultry [The relatively high moisture content of soft cheeses favors proliferation of _Listeria_ even at refrigeration temperatures. The ubiquitous nature of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in the environment means that contamination of soft cheeses may occur at any point post-pasteurization.]. If high-risk people develop flu like symptoms such as a mild fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, aches and pains, or a mild cough or cold, they should seek medical advice.\n\nHow did _Listeria_ get into food at the hospital? The food samples were all pre-packaged ready-to-eat meat, which is supplied to the hospital by an external provider. The Ministry for Primary Industries is making further enquiries.\n\nHow does HBDHB ensure food is safe? As part of the hospital's food safety programme, Nutrition and Food Services only purchases from approved suppliers. For a medium to high-risk product like cooked meat, this means that suppliers must have an NZ Food Safety Authority approved food safety or risk management programme in place. HBDHB's kitchen has a Certificate of Registration from Hastings District Council, which was achieved with 'excellence' from 31 Mar 2012 until 31 Mar 2013. High-risk foods are restricted to [sic] certain at risk groups, e.g. ante-natal patients.\n\nDid listeriosis cause the deaths of these 2 people? It appears that listeriosis was the cause of death in at least one of these patients, and in the other patient, it probably was a contributing factor. Both patients were immuno-compromised.\n\nWhat action has HBDHB taken? 'As part of our investigation, the hospital kitchens were inspected and food samples taken. We withdrew all pre-packaged ready-to-eat meats from the kitchen on Tue 10 Jul 2012 and reviewed our internal processes. These samples of ready-to-eat meats from the kitchen have now tested positive to _Listeria_. The Ministry for Primary Industries is making further inquiries regarding the source of _Listeria_ infection. We are informing the public now in order to raise awareness about the ever-present risk of listeriosis to vulnerable patients.'\n\nHas anyone else gotten sick from listeriosis and been hospitalised? There have been no other hospitalised cases or further notifications in Hawke's Bay.\n\nWhat has happened to the food that has tested positive? 'We have withdrawn it.'\n\nIn New Zealand, around 25 cases occur annually. Of those, about 20 percent are associated with pregnancy or newborn babies.\n\nThere is more information available from\nhttp://www.surv.esr.cri.nz/PDF_surveillance/AnnualRpt/AnnualSurv/2011/2011AnnualSurvRpt.pdf.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of listeriosis, please see moderator ML's comments in the 4 prior ProMED-mail posts this year (2012) on a nosocomial outbreak in Northern Ireland: Listeriosis - UK (04): (N.

PHA is also working with all Trusts to ensure that robust arrangements for food safety are maintained in the hospital setting.\n\nListeriosis is an uncommon infection in the hospital setting. It is usually food-borne, most often found in ready-to-eat refrigerated and processed foods such as chilled meats, soft cheeses, cold cuts of meat, pates and smoked fish. It may also be found in food items containing one or more of these products, e.g., sandwiches.\n\nThere would normally be between 3 to 5 cases of listeriosis each year in Northern Ireland. Listeriosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease. Most adults experience only mild infections of the eye and skin or gastroenteritis. It can, however, lead to severe illness including blood poisoning or meningitis.\n\nOlder people and individuals with weakened immune systems, including those who have cancer, AIDS or issues with alcohol misuse, are all susceptible. Listeriosis may be particularly dangerous in pregnancy as it can present as a mild and 'flu-like' illness that is not serious to the mother but can cause miscarriage, premature delivery, stillbirth or severe illness in a newborn child.\n\nThe PHA is reminding patients in hospitals and those attending hospital day services that they should only eat foods provided on the wards by hospital staff and not eat foods from other sources such as hospital canteens, shops or restaurants. Visitors are urged not to bring food into hospitals for patients unless this has been discussed and agreed with ward managers. Patients should wash their hands before and after eating, eat food as soon as it is served, dispose of any leftovers immediately and not hold over food for later consumption.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alert\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In an April 2012 ProMED-mail post (Listeriosis - UK: (Northern Ireland) nosocomial, fatal 20120415.1101822), a news report indicated that there were 3 cases of nosocomial listeriosis, one of which was fatal, at 2 hospitals in Northern Ireland (Antrim Area Hospital in Antrim and Causeway Hospital in Coleraine), possibly due to contaminated food prepared outside the hospital.

The DHB says [the] 2 patients at Hawke's Bay Hospital [who] died after getting listeriosis were both older women who had compromised immune systems. Two others, also older people with compromised immune systems, who had used hospital services also got listeriosis but have since recovered.\n\nThe cases were confirmed in May and June 2012, but processed meat such as salami, ham and pepperoni -- which are known as sources of _Listeria_ -- were not removed from the hospital menu until 10 Jul 2012. The DHB has confirmed the meat had signs of contamination, but won't say whether it was the source of the outbreak. Director of population health, Caroline McElnay, told Checkpoint the food wasn't tested because staff did not suspect the bug was in it. Dr McElnay says in hindsight the hospital could have withdrawn the meats as a precaution after the 1st patient caught the bug. She says the hospital is considering leaving processed meat off its menu permanently.\n\nFood safety officials say they hope the outbreak is over. The DHB says the 1st of the 4 cases was notified in early May 2012 and the last on 29 Jun 2012. The Ministry of Primary Industries is seeking to identify the source and the extent of the outbreak. Its deputy director general of compliance and response, Andrew Coleman, says he hopes it won't go further than the hospital. 'At this stage, it doesn't seem that it will be much broader. There's certainly been no unfortunate deaths and illnesses through the Hawke's Bay District Health Board's hospital since the June [2012] date.' The DHB says investigations are still underway and it's too soon to say how the patients got the bacterium, but food is a likely source.\n\nPregnant women, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are warned to be careful what foods they eat. They are advised to avoid soft cheeses, processed meats and poultry. Family doctors say people who are generally well have nothing to fear from the outbreak.\n\nThe ministry says it has overseen a voluntary recall of a number of ready-to-eat meat products. At this stage, the ministry says there is only one firm involved in its inquiry into the outbreak. Bay Cuisine of Napier supplied ready-to-eat meat products to the hospital, but the ministry says it's not clear yet whether any of these products are linked to the cases. The ministry says it's talking only to Bay Cuisine, the board's sole supplier of packed meats, at this stage but may talk to other companies.\n\nBay Cuisine hasn't been available for interview, but in a statement, it says it's concerned about the outbreak and 2 deaths. It says it understands the source of the contamination is yet to be determined and it's working with authorities to find the source. It says it recalled products sold in Mad Butcher stores throughout the country and in Preston's stores in Wellington, Porirua and Palmerston North, although none has shown any evidence of contamination.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of listeriosis, please see moderator ML's comments in the 4 prior ProMED-mail posts this year on a nosocomial outbreak in Northern Ireland: Listeriosis - UK (04): (N.

[A picture of the package label for the incriminated cheese is available at http://www.foodsafetynews.com/RicottaRecallMain.jpg.]\n\nThe total number of cases by state is as follows: California (1), Colorado (1), District of Columbia (1), Maryland (3), Minnesota (1), Nebraska (1), New Jersey (1), New Mexico (1), New York (1), Ohio (1), Pennsylvania (1), Virginia (1) and Washington (1). [A map of cases by state is available at http://www.foodsafetynews.com/RicottaMap.jpg.]\n\nAll 15 victims have been hospitalized as a result of their infections, according to CDC. Three deaths have occurred, one each in Minnesota, Nebraska and New York. These deaths were reported by CDC in its initial outbreak report on 11 Sep 2012. The 1st illness connected to this outbreak began on 25 Mar 2012, and illness onsets have been recorded as recently as 26 Aug 2012.\n\nForever Cheese of Long Island City, NY, which imports the recalled cheese, has also announced that it will no longer be importing cheese made by Fattorie Chiarappa Srl, the company whose ricotta is now linked to the multistate listeriosis outbreak. 'Forever Cheese has decided to stop importing and selling all products produced by Fattorie Chiarappa Srl,' the firm said last week. Brands including Ricotta Salata Frescolina, the brand linked to this outbreak; Marte brand Roasted Ricotta and Hard Ricotta Salata will be discontinued immediately, said the company.\n\nHealth officials note that the affected cheese may also have been labeled as Ricotta Frescolina Marte Tipo Toscanella and/or Ricotta Salata Soft Lot (T9425) as it was being distributed.\n\nConsumers who may have purchased the affected cheeses should not eat them and should discard them. This warning is especially important for pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, and older adults, warns FDA, as people in these categories risk more serious infections from _Listeria monocytogenes_.\n\nSymptoms of _Listeria_ infection, or listeriosis, usually include fever, chills, severe headache, vomiting, and other influenza-type symptoms. The CDC notes that infected individuals may develop fever, muscle aches, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea.

Just because ruminants seem to be more clinically susceptible doesn't mean that they are the primary source for people. Many monogastric animals can carry _Listeria_ in their GI tracts, too... dogs, cats, rabbits, and other small mammals.\n\n--\nMarilyn M. Simunich, DVM, Dipl.

Most human _L. monocytogenes_ infections follow consumption of food contaminated with the bacterium. Many different types of food have been involved in outbreaks of listeriosis; these foods include deli meats, raw (unpasteurized) milk or milk products made from unpasteurized milk, such as soft cheeses or Mexican-style cheeses, pate or meat spreads, refrigerated smoked seafood and crustaceans, and raw fruit and vegetables.\n\nHowever, the routes of transmission of _L. monocytogenes_ for listeriosis in human and other animals are complex and not completely understood (see Sauders BD, Wiedmann M: Ecology of _Listeria_ species and _L. monocytogenes_ in the natural environment. Chapter 2. (2007) In: Listeria, Listeriosis, and Food Safety. ET Ryser, EH Marth (eds). Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY). Human infections with _L. monocytogenes_ can result from consumption of contaminated unprocessed raw food, such as uncooked meats, unpasteurized milk or milk products, fruits, and vegetables, or consumption of ready-to-eat food that has been contaminated during processing of food such as deli meat (Gravani R: _Listeria_ in food-processing facilities, p 657-709.

Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY)\n\n_L. monocytogenes_ survives extremely well in the food-processing facility environment. However, information on how these strains entered that environment is limited. They may be introduced into these facilities through a variety of routes, including raw materials, employees' shoes or clothes, and equipment. When _L. monocytogenes_ get into a food-processing factory (such as, factories processing smoked fish, poultry, meat, and dairy products), they persist there for years and can contaminate food after factory cooking, but before packaging. Particularly problematic is the fact that _L. monocytogenes_ can grow in refrigeration temperatures during storage, which is why even minimal contamination with this bacterium during the processing of subsequently refrigerated ready-to-eat food can cause severe food-borne infections.\n\nThe role of the dairy farm as a potential source for _L. monocytogenes_ has been investigated by comparison of the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) restriction enzyme digestion profiles of _L. monocytogenes_ dairy farm-associated strains (milk, environmental, and bovine) with that of human sporadic and epidemic disease strains (Borucki MK, et al: Dairy farm reservoir of _Listeria monocytogenes_ sporadic and epidemic strains.

El Ranchero del Sur agreed to a voluntary recall its products and to close its production plant while the investigation is in progress.\n\nAccording to the NJDHSS health alert, El Ranchero del Sur cheese products can be found primarily in Mexican and Latin American grocery stores, restaurants, and other Hispanic food establishments under the name brands El Ranchero, Los Corrales, and Carnes Don Beto with the plant number 34-0013669 marked on the label. All products are 14 ounces in weight except for the Queso Hebra Oaxaca String Cheese ball in 10 pound packages.\n\n_Listeria monocytogenes_ is a bacterium that is normally found in the environment and has been found in animals, birds and vegetation. It can be found in raw foods and in processed foods that get contaminated after processing. Some of the most common foods that are associated with listeriosis are raw milk, soft cheeses, vegetables, and many ready to eat meats like hot dogs, deli meats and pates. Those at greatest risk of serious listeriosis include pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, and adults with weakened immune systems.\n\nMost healthy persons show no symptoms of this disease. Initial symptoms of food-borne listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, fatigue and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Primarily in high risk groups but occasionally in healthy adults, the infection can spread to the blood and central nervous system where it can cause sepsis and meningitis.\n\nDue to a naturally depressed immune system, pregnant women are about 20 times more likely than other healthy adults to contract this disease. Though many women may only experience mild flu-like symptoms, infections during pregnancy can have devastating consequences to the fetus which include stillbirth or miscarriage, premature delivery and serious infections in the newborn.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alert\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is an excellent primer from the USA FDA that overviews the relationship of pregnancy and infection with _Listeria monocytogenes_\nhttp://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~pregnant/whillist.html:\n\n'What is _Listeria monocytogenes_?\nIt's a harmful bacterium that can be found in refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods (meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy (unpasteurized milk and milk products or foods made with unpasteurized milk)) and in soil. Animals can carry this bacterium without appearing ill, and thus, it can be found in foods made from animals. _L. monocytogenes_ is unusual because it can grow at refrigerator temperatures where most other foodborne bacteria do not. When eaten, it may cause listeriosis, an illness to which pregnant women and their unborn children are very susceptible.\n\n'How could I get listeriosis?'\nBy eating ready-to-eat meats, poultry, seafood, and dairy products that are contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_. You can also get listeriosis by eating contaminated foods processed or packaged in unsanitary conditions or by eating vegetables that are contaminated from the soil or from manure used as fertilizer.\n\n'How could listeriosis affect me?'\nThe symptoms can take a few days or even weeks to appear and may include fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea or upset stomach, headache, stiff neck, confusion, and loss of balance. In more serious cases, listeriosis could also lead to the mother's death. Most of the time, pregnant women who are infected with listeriosis don't feel sick. However, they can pass the infection to their unborn babies without even knowing it. That's why prevention of listeriosis is very important. In any case, if you experience any of the above symptoms, see your doctor or health-care provider immediately. Pregnant women are about 20 times more likely to get listeriosis than other healthy adults, and an estimated 1/3rd of all Listeria cases occur in pregnant women.\n\n'How could listeriosis affect my baby?'\nDuring the 1st trimester of pregnancy, listeriosis may cause miscarriage. As the pregnancy progresses to the 3rd trimester, the mother is more at risk. Listeriosis can also lead to premature labor, the delivery of a low-birth-weight infant, or infant death. Fetuses who suffer a late infection may develop a wide range of health problems, including mental retardation, paralysis, seizures, blindness, or impairments of the brain, heart or kidney. In newborns, _L. monocytogenes_ can cause blood infections and meningitis.\n\n'Listeriosis and Pregnant Hispanic Women'\nStudies show that pregnant Hispanic women may have a higher incidence of listeriosis than pregnant non-Hispanic women. This is most likely because they might make and eat homemade soft cheese and other traditional foods made from unpasteurized milk. 'Queso fresco' -- a traditional homemade cheese, prepared from unpasteurized milk and widely consumed by Hispanics -- has led to miscarriages, death of newborns, and premature delivery caused by _L. monocytogenes_. To prevent the risk of listeriosis, Hispanic pregnant women should not eat homemade soft cheeses and other traditional foods made from unpasteurized milk. Like all other pregnant women, they should follow the food safety precautions outlined below.\n\n'How can I prevent listeriosis?'\nThe good news is that listeriosis can be prevented! Here's how:\n- Your refrigerator should register at 40 F (4 C) or below and the freezer at 0 F (-18 C). Place a refrigerator thermometer in the refrigerator, and check the temperature periodically. During the automatic defrost cycle, the temperature may register slightly higher than 40 F. This is okay.\n- Refrigerate or freeze perishables, prepared food, and leftovers within 2 hours of eating or preparation. Follow the 2-Hour Rule: Discard food that has been left out at room temperature for longer than 2 hours. When temperatures are above 90 F (32 C), discard food after one hour.\n- Use ready-to-eat, perishable foods, such as dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and produce, as soon as possible.\n\n***Don't eat:\n- Hot dogs and luncheon meats unless they're reheated until steaming hot.\n- Soft cheeses like Feta, Brie, and Camembert, 'blue-veined cheeses,' or 'queso blanco,' 'queso fresco,' or Panela unless they're made with pasteurized milk; Make sure the label says, 'made with pasteurized milk'\n- refrigerated pates or meat spreads\n- refrigerated smoked seafood -- unless it's in a cooked dish, such as a casserole (Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod, tuna, or mackerel is most often labeled as 'nova-style,' 'lox,' 'kippered,' 'smoked,' or 'jerky.'

The pensioner was one of two patients in the Antrim Area Hospital who contracted the food-borne bacteria. Another acquired the bug in the Causeway Hospital on the region's north coast. The patient who died was already ill but listeriosis has been confirmed as a contributory cause of death.\n\nBoth hospitals are managed by the Northern Trust, which has declared an outbreak. The Trust's director of nursing Olive MacLeod said: 'The person who died was a frail, elderly patient who had other illnesses but this _Listeria_ infection did contribute to their death.'\n\nListeriosis is usually associated with refrigerated food stuffs. Chilled meats, soft cheeses, cold cuts of meat, pates and smoked fish are all potential sources. Ms MacLeod said a full investigation was under way but said the hospitals were satisfied with how cold food was managed. She said listeriosis was 'uncommon' in a hospital setting. 'Normally there would be between three to five cases of listeriosis per annum in Northern Ireland,' she added. 'Because these three cases have occurred within a short period of time, we are declaring an outbreak.'\n\nA series of measures have been introduced in response to the outbreak with visitors to the hospitals being told not to bring food in from the outside.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alert\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[Listeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis, caused by _Listeria monocytogenes_, that is transmitted from the intestinal tract of farm animals to humans by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare (about 2500 cases occur annually in the USA), but the disease has an overall mortality rate of 20 to 30 percent. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as, HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.\n\nThe organism can be killed by pasteurization, but contamination may occur after pasteurization. Although cooking can kill the organism, contaminated surfaces in food preparation areas can recontaminate previously cooked food that requires no further cooking prior to eating. The organism can then continue to grow in the refrigerated, packaged ready-to-eat product, since _L. monocytogenes_ grows at refrigerator temperatures. Its presence in food does not alter the taste or smell of the food.\n\nFood implicated in outbreaks has included raw milk and pasteurized milk, soft cheeses such as Latin-American cheeses, feta, brie, and Camembert, ice cream, raw vegetables, delicatessen salads such as coleslaw, cold cuts, turkey franks and other hot dogs, raw and smoked fish, shellfish such as shrimp, and undercooked chicken.\n\nA detailed discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail post 20071230.4186. Nosocomial listeriosis has been described before related to food service in health care facilities, but is quite uncommon.

The pathogen was found on a conveyor belt for\ncarrying cantaloupes, a melon drying area and a floor drain, among\nother places.\n\n'You're rolling around cantaloupe on uncleanable equipment and you're\ngetting it wet and you're not cooling it -- it provides the perfect\nenvironment for listeria growth and spread,' said James Gorny, a\nsenior food safety adviser at the Food and Drug Administration [FDA].\n\nThe outbreak, which began in late July 2011, is the deadliest caused\nby foodborne disease since 1985. A total of 123 people in 26 states\nhave fallen ill, including those who died, according to the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNicholas J Parolisi Jr, a lawyer for Jensen Farms, said he could not\ncomment on the FDA's accusations. The farm had passed a food safety\naudit by an outside contractor just days before the outbreak began.\nEric Jensen, a member of the family that runs the farm, said in an\nemail that the auditor had given the packing plant a score of 96\npoints out of 100. FDA officials did not criticize the auditor\ndirectly. But Michael R Taylor, deputy commissioner for foods, said\nthe agency intended to establish standards for how auditors should be\ntrained and how audits should be conducted. The food industry\nincreasingly has come to rely on what it calls 3rd-party audits of\nfarms or processing plants to ensure the safety of food. But the\nauditors are hired by the companies being inspected, and their\nprocedures are largely unregulated. In several recent food safety\nlapses, the facilities involved had passed 3rd-party audits.\n\nIt was not clear how listeria initially got into the packing shed,\nwhich officials described as an open-air structure having a concrete\nfloor, a roof, and no walls. Listeria is frequently found in soil or\nmanure, but tests of the soil on the farm did not turn up the\nbacteria. Officials said that a dump truck used to take culled melons\n[removal of any product that showed signs of physical damage, such as\nskin breaks or decay] to a cattle farm was parked near the processing\nshed and could have brought bacteria to the facility.\n\nJensen Farms, run by Mr Jensen and his brother Ryan, had recently\nacquired a set of used machinery to upgrade the way it washed and\ndried its cantaloupes. The equipment had been used to clean potatoes\nand was not intended for use with cantaloupes, officials said. They\nsaid the equipment was corroded in places and built in a way that made\nit difficult to clean and sanitize. An area used to dry the melons\nincluded a cloth cover that could easily have harbored the bacteria,\naccording to a person who discussed the operation with the Jensens.\n\nOfficials also said that the cantaloupes had not been adequately\ncooled before they were placed in refrigerated storage, which could\nhave caused condensation to form on the fruit, creating hospitable\nconditions for listeria. The bacteria grow well in wet or damp\nconditions and can also thrive in cold.\n\nDr Gorny said that some of the conditions he described, including\npools of water on the floor, had been noted during a visit in\nmid-September 2011 after the plant ceased operation and the equipment\nwas dismantled. It was not clear if investigators who had visited the\nplant while it was still in operation saw the same unsanitary\nconditions. Officials said that conditions at Jensen Farms were not\ntypical of the produce industry. 'We have no reason to believe these\nfactors are indicative of practices throughout the industry,' said\nSherri McGarry, a senior FDA adviser.\n\nThe outbreak is likely to focus new attention on the use of auditors\nin the food industry. Typically farms or processors are required by\ntheir customers, like supermarket or restaurant chains, to have an\nauditor evaluate their food safety procedures. Jensen Farms hired an\nauditor called PrimusLabs, based in California, to inspect its\nfacility. Primus gave the job to a subcontractor, Bio Food Safety,\nwhich is based in Texas. Jensen and Primus declined to provide a copy\nof the audit report.\n\nRobert Stovicek, the president of PrimusLabs, said his company had\nreviewed the audit and found no problems in how it was conducted or in\nthe auditor's conclusions. 'We thought he did a pretty good job,' Mr\nStovicek said. He said the auditor, James M DiIorio, has been doing\naudits for the company since March 2011. He said that Mr DiIorio had\nreceived 2 one-week training courses as part of his preparation and\nhad also gone on audits with other auditors. Asked how Mr DiIorio\ncould have given high marks to a facility that the FDA described as a\nbreeding ground for _Listeria_, Mr Stovicek said, 'There's lots of\nvariations as to how people interpret unsanitary conditions.' Mr\nDiIorio did not return phone calls seeking comment.\n\nTrevor V Suslow, a professor of food safety at the University of\nCalifornia, Davis, said auditors may give farmers, processors, and\nretailers a false sense of security. 'There needs to be training,\ncertification, and auditing of the auditors,' he said.\n\n[byline: William Neuman]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[An FDA draft guidance to minimize microbial hazards of melons (July\n2009) spelled out ways cantaloupes can become contaminated\n(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/GuidanceDocuments/ProduceandPlanProducts/ucm174171.htm).\nIn this document, more foodborne illness outbreaks were noted to be\nassociated with melons that have netted rinds perhaps because human\npathogens may adhere to, survive on, and be more difficult to\neliminate from netted melon rind surfaces.

Infection causes a spectrum\nof illness, ranging from febrile gastroenteritis to invasive disease,\nincluding sepsis and meningoencephalitis. Invasive listeriosis occurs\npredominantly in older adults and persons with impaired immune\nsystems. Listeriosis in pregnant women is typically a mild 'flu-like'\nillness, but can result in fetal loss, premature labor, or neonatal\ninfection. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. On 2 Sep 2011, the\nColorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) notified\nCDC of 7 cases of listeriosis reported since 28 Aug 2011. On average,\nColorado reports 2 cases of listeriosis annually in August. By 6 Sep\n2011, all 7 Colorado patients interviewed with the Listeria Initiative\nquestionnaire reported eating cantaloupe in the month before illness\nbegan, and 3 reported eating cantaloupe marketed as 'Rocky Ford.'\n\nA case was defined as illness with one of the outbreak strains\nisolated on or after 1 Aug 2011. Outbreak strains initially were\ndefined as: 1) clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ with\nspecimen collection dates in August 2011; 2) with a 2-enzyme,\npulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern combination that\noccurred in 2 or more persons; and 3) that matched any of the 2\npattern combinations found among Colorado residents in August 2011.\nAnalysis of Listeria Initiative data comparing the 1st 19\noutbreak-associated cases in 2011 with 85 cases among persons aged 65\nyears or greater with sporadic listeriosis identified during August of\nthe years 2004-2010 indicated that cantaloupe consumption was strongly\nassociated with illness caused by the outbreak strains: 19 of 19 (100\npercent) versus 54 of 85 (64 percent); (odds ratio = 14.9; 95 percent\nCI = 2.4-infinity). Initial tracebacks of cantaloupe purchased by\npatients converged on Jensen Farms in Colorado.\n\nAfter cantaloupe was implicated, PulseNet, the national molecular\nsubtyping network for foodborne bacterial disease surveillance,\ndetected a multistate cluster with a 4th PFGE pattern combination; a\nsample of cantaloupe collected from the implicated farm yielded _L.\nmonocytogenes_ with this pattern, and interviews with patients\nrevealed that most had consumed cantaloupe. Isolates with this pattern\nwere then also considered to be among the outbreak strains. By 29 Sep\n2011, 84 cases with one of the 4 outbreak PFGE pattern combinations\nhad been reported from 19 states, including 83 with information on the\ndate of illness onset. Among the patients, 88 percent were aged 60\nyears or greater (range: 35-96 years); 55 percent were female, and 2\nwere pregnant. 15 deaths were reported. 92 percent (57 of 62 with\ninformation on food consumption) reported eating cantaloupe in the\nmonth before illness began. All 4 outbreak strains of _L.\nmonocytogenes_ were isolated from whole and cut cantaloupe samples\nfrom patients' homes or from samples of Jensen Farms cantaloupe\ncollected from grocery stores and the farm. On 14 Sep 2011, the farm\nissued a voluntary recall of its cantaloupe.\n\nThis outbreak has several unusual features. First, this is the 1st\nlisteriosis outbreak associated with melon. Second, 4 widely differing\nPFGE pattern combinations and 2 serotypes (1/2a and 1/2b) have been\nassociated with the outbreak. Third, this outbreak is unusually large;\nonly 2 US listeriosis outbreaks, one associated with frankfurters (108\ncases) and one with Mexican-style cheese (142), have had more cases\n[1,2]. Additional cases likely will be reported because of the long\nincubation period (usually 1-3 weeks, range: 3-70 days) and the time\nneeded for diagnosis and confirmation. Fourth, this outbreak has the\nhighest number of deaths of any US foodborne outbreak since a\nlisteriosis outbreak in 1998 [1].\n\nCDC recommends that persons do not eat cantaloupes from Jensen Farms.\nThis recommendation is especially important for persons at greater\nrisk for listeriosis, including older adults, persons with weakened\nimmune systems, and pregnant women. Not all of the recalled\ncantaloupes are individually labeled with stickers to indicate\nproduction by Jensen Farms. Consumers should consult the retailer or\ndiscard any cantaloupe of uncertain origin.

All illnesses started on or\nafter 31 Jul 2011. The number of infected persons identified in each\nstate is as follows: Alabama (1), Arkansas (1) California (1),\nColorado (30), Idaho (1), Illinois (1), Indiana (2), Kansas (7),\nMaryland (1), Missouri (3), Montana (1), Nebraska (6), New Mexico\n(13), North Dakota (1), Oklahoma (11), Texas (14), Virginia (1), West\nVirginia (1), Wisconsin (2), and Wyoming (2).\n\n18 deaths have been reported: 5 in Colorado, 2 in Kansas, 1 in\nMaryland, 1 in Missouri, 1 in Nebraska, 5 in New Mexico, 1 in\nOklahoma, and 2 in Texas.\n\nOn 14 Sep 2011, FDA issued a press release to announce that Jensen\nFarms issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford-brand cantaloupes\nafter being linked to a multistate outbreak of listeriosis. Although\nJensen Farms issued a voluntary recall of Rocky Ford-brand cantaloupes\non 14 Sep 2011 and the recalled cantaloupe should be off store\nshelves, more ill persons may be reported because of the time lag\nbetween diagnosis and laboratory confirmation and also because up to 2\nmonths can elapse between eating contaminated food and developing\nlisteriosis. CDC recommends that consumers not eat Rocky Ford-brand\ncantaloupe from Jensen Farms. This is especially important for older\nadults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women. Even\nif some of the cantaloupe has been eaten without becoming ill, dispose\nof the rest of the cantaloupe immediately.\n\n_Listeria_ bacteria can grow in the cantaloupe at room and\nrefrigerator temperatures.\n\nCantaloupes that are known to NOT have come from Jensen Farms are safe\nto eat. If consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe\nfor purchase, they should ask the grocery store. A cantaloupe\npurchased from an unknown source should be discarded: 'when in doubt,\nthrow it out.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Mon 3 Oct 2011\nSource: Bloomberg Businessweek [edited]\nhttp://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9Q4VLJG1.htm\n\n\nAn elderly woman from East Baton Rouge Parish died over the weekend\n[1-2 Oct 2011] after being diagnosed with listeriosis, Louisiana's\nstate epidemiologist, Dr Raoult Ratard, said Monday [3 Oct 2011]. The\nwoman had eaten cantaloupe 2 or 3 weeks earlier, but her family didn't\nknow which store or state it came from, he said.\n\nInvestigators will try to learn whether the _Listeria_ is the same\nstrain found in Colorado cantaloupe recalled because of the bacterium,\nbut it will take at least a week to grow and test the bacteria and the\ntests may be inconclusive, Ratard said.\n\nCantaloupe from Jensen Farms in Colorado has been linked to 84\nillnesses and as many as 17 deaths in 19 states.\n\nState officials said Friday [30 Sep 2011] that Jensen Farms had added\nLouisiana to its recall list for cantaloupes shipped between 29 Jul\nand 10 Sep 2011.\n\nThe fatal infection is the only listeriosis case reported since July\n2011 in Louisiana, Ratard said. 'By now any (recalled) cantaloupe left\nwould be rotten. So it looks like the danger from cantaloupe is very\nlow now,' Ratard said. 'But you never know. Something else may come\nup.'\n\n_Listeria_ is common in soil and water, according to the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention. The CDC's website says it can be found\nin uncooked meats and vegetables, unpasteurized milk and cheese made\nfrom unpasteurized milk, and processed meats, smoked seafood, and soft\ncheeses that become contaminated after cooking and processing. And\nsince it can take a month or more for symptoms to show up, people who\nate contaminated cantaloupe before the recall could still get sick.\n\nSymptoms can vary widely. The CDC says older adults and people with\nimmune system disorders are most likely to develop blood poisoning and\nmeningitis, which can cause headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of\nbalance, and convulsions. Pregnant women may have a mild, flu-like\nillness followed by a miscarriage or a life-threatening illness in the\nnewborn. People whose immune systems are in good shape may not feel\nsick or might get high fever and muscle aches, with diarrhea, nausea,\nor vomiting sometimes coming first.\n\n[Byline: Janet McConnaughey]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of 3 Oct 2011, a total of 100 persons infected with any of the 4\noutbreak-associated strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been\nreported to CDC from 20 states. 18 deaths were reported from 8 states.\nListeriosis is known to be more severe in the elderly and almost 90\npercent were 60 years of age or greater in the current outbreak. 2\nwere pregnant.

Among the 27 ill persons with available\ninformation on what they ate, 26 (96 percent) reported consuming\ncantaloupes. Ill persons were interviewed about exposures during the\nmonth before they became ill; investigators compared their responses\nto persons with listeriosis reported through the CDC Listeria\nInitiative, whose illnesses were not part of this outbreak. Several\nill persons remembered the type of cantaloupe they had eaten and said\nthey were Rocky Ford cantaloupes, which are grown in the Rocky Ford\nregion of southeastern Colorado. Source tracing of the cantaloupes\nthat ill persons ate indicated that they came from Jensen Farms, of\nGranada, Colorado and were marketed as being from the Rocky Ford\nregion. These cantaloupes were harvested in August and September 2011,\nwere distributed widely in the USA, and may still be available in\ngrocery stores.\n\nLaboratory testing by the Colorado Department of Public Health and\nEnvironment identified _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteria on\ncantaloupes collected from grocery stores and from an ill person's\nhome. Product traceback information from Colorado state officials\nindicated these cantaloupes also came from Jensen Farms. FDA is\nworking closely with CDC, the firms involved, and public health\nauthorities in states where illnesses occurred to determine the exact\ncause of contamination.\n\nCDC advises persons throughout the mainland United States who are at\nhigh risk for listeriosis, including older adults, persons with\nweakened immune systems, and pregnant women, to not eat Rocky Ford\ncantaloupes from Jensen Farms. Other consumers who want to reduce\ntheir risk of Listeria infection should not eat Rocky Ford cantaloupes\nfrom Jensen Farms.\n\nRecall\n----\nOn 14 Sep 2011, FDA issued a press release to announce that Jensen\nFarms issued a voluntary recall of Rocky Ford Cantaloupes because the\ncantaloupes have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria and\nmay be linked to a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis.\n\nAdvice to consumers\n----------------\nContaminated cantaloupes may still be in grocery stores and in\nconsumers' homes.\n\nCDC recommends that persons at high risk for listeriosis, including\nolder adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant\nwomen, do not eat Rocky Ford cantaloupes from Jensen Farms. Even if\nsome of the cantaloupe has been eaten without anyone becoming ill, the\nrest of the cantaloupe should be disposed of immediately. Listeria\nbacteria can grow in the cantaloupe at room and refrigerator\ntemperatures. Other consumers who want to reduce their risk of\nListeria infection should not eat Rocky Ford cantaloupes from Jensen\nFarms.\n\nThe recalled cantaloupes may have a sticker [See:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm271882.htm. - Mod.LL]. Not all\nof the recalled cantaloupes are labeled with a sticker. Consumers\nshould consult the retailer if they have questions about the origin of\na cantaloupe.\n\nConsumers and food preparers should wash their hands before and after\nhandling any whole melon, such as cantaloupe, watermelon, or honeydew.\n\n- Wash the melons and dry them with a clean cloth or paper towel\nbefore cutting.\n- Cut melon should be promptly consumed or refrigerated at or less\nthan 40 F (32-34 F is best) for no more than 7 days.\n- Cut melons left at room temperature for more than 4 hours should be\ndiscarded.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of affected individuals has grown from 22 to 35 in the 5\ndays between CDC postings on the outbreak, and 3 more states have\nreported outbreak cases.

All of the Listeria-positive cantaloupe samples at\nthis time appear to have been grown at Jensen Farms.\n\nDr. Chris Urbina, chief medical officer and executive director of the\ndepartment, reiterated to consumers that: 'Individuals who are high\nrisk for listeriosis should not eat cantaloupe if they know it is from\nJensen Farms or if they don't know where the cantaloupe they purchased\nis from.' Urbina said high-risk individuals for listeriosis are people\naged 60 and older; those with weakened immune systems from transplants\nor certain chronic diseases, immunosuppressive therapies or\nmedications; and pregnant women. Healthy adults under age 60 rarely\ndevelop this illness.\n\nOn Wed 14 Sep 2011, Jensen Farms voluntarily recalled its cantaloupe,\nshipped between 29 Jul 2011 and 10 Sep 2011, which was distributed to\nat least 17 states with possible further distribution. An FDA news\nrelease issued Wednesday [14 Sep 2011] night said that although the\ninvestigation is ongoing, no other cantaloupe producer has been\nimplicated.\n\nAlthough these cantaloupes have been, and are being, removed from\ncommerce, additional infections likely will be reported, because it\ntakes an average of 3 weeks to become ill with listeriosis after\neating a contaminated product. Ten samples collected from cantaloupes\nidentified as being from Jensen Farms all came back positive for\n_Listeria monocytogenes_. Several samples matched the lab results of\nColorado's 12 confirmed human cases. The state health department\ncontinues to work with FDA and CDC to determine the source of the\ncantaloupe contamination.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The vehicle for _L. monocytogenes_ in this substantial outbreak is\nunusual, so ProMED awaits more information regarding the source of the\ncontamination. Since the melon grows on a vine on the ground, its rind\ncan become contaminated with pathogens by contact with contaminated\nsoil, fertilizer, or water used for irrigation or washing.\nContamination could also occur later during the process of bringing\nthe food from field to table. Cutting through the outer skin can then\ncontaminate the pulp of cantaloupe, if washing of the outside is\ninadequate. It is, therefore, important to wash the melon thoroughly\nbefore cutting into it, since bacteria can grow on the rind. However,\nbecause Listeria reproduce at refrigerator temperatures, inoculation\nof the pulp by even low numbers of the organism can result in higher\ngrade contamination of refrigerated product.

Most human\ninfections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur\nfrom mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an\ninfected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in\nveterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals. The\norganism can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat\nand poultry, raw milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the\nintestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans,\nand in crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. \n\nCDC advises persons throughout the mainland United States who are at\nhigh risk for listeriosis, including older adults, persons with\nweakened immune systems, and pregnant women, to not eat Rocky Ford\ncantaloupes from Jensen Farms. On 14 Sep 2011, FDA issued a press release to announce that Jensen\nFarms issued a voluntary recall of Rocky Ford Cantaloupes because the\ncantaloupes have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria and\nmay be linked to a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis. \n\nLaboratory testing by the Colorado Department of Public Health and\nEnvironment identified _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteria on\ncantaloupes collected from grocery stores and from an ill person's\nhome. Ill persons were interviewed about exposures during the\nmonth before they became ill; investigators compared their responses\nto persons with listeriosis reported through the CDC Listeria\nInitiative, whose illnesses were not part of this outbreak. The number of infected\npersons identified in each state is as follows: California (1),\nColorado (12), Illinois (1), Indiana (1), Montana (1), Nebraska (4),\nNew Mexico (5), Oklahoma (6), Texas (3), and West Virginia (1). Although these cantaloupes have been, and are being, removed from\ncommerce, additional infections likely will be reported, because it\ntakes an average of 3 weeks to become ill with listeriosis after\neating a contaminated product. Source tracing of the cantaloupes\nthat ill persons ate indicated that they came from Jensen Farms, of\nGranada, Colorado and were marketed as being from the Rocky Ford\nregion. Urbina said high-risk individuals for listeriosis are people\naged 60 and older; those with weakened immune systems from transplants\nor certain chronic diseases, immunosuppressive therapies or\nmedications; and pregnant women. Investigators are using data from PulseNet, the\nnational subtyping network made up of state and local public health\nlaboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs\nmolecular surveillance of foodborne infections. Cantaloupe samples from the refrigerator of a Listeria patient's home,\nas well as samples obtained from various retail outlets last week,\nhave the same DNA fingerprints as the Listeria that has infected 12\n An FDA news\nrelease issued Wednesday [14 Sep 2011] night said that although the\ninvestigation is ongoing, no other cantaloupe producer has been\nimplicated. FDA is\nworking closely with CDC, the firms involved, and public health\nauthorities in states where illnesses occurred to determine the exact\ncause of contamination. However,\nbecause Listeria reproduce at refrigerator temperatures, inoculation\nof the pulp by even low numbers of the organism can result in higher\ngrade contamination of refrigerated product. There is also increasing\ndata to suggest that some enteric pathogens (such as _E. coli_ O157:H7\nor _Salmonella enterica_ serotypes) could persist internally in the\ngrowing plant if introduced to the seed or early growing phases. \n\nCDC recommends that persons at high risk for listeriosis, including\nolder adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant\nwomen, do not eat Rocky Ford cantaloupes from Jensen Farms. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of affected individuals has grown from 22 to 35 in the 5\ndays between CDC postings on the outbreak, and 3 more states have\nreported outbreak cases. On Wed 14 Sep 2011, Jensen Farms voluntarily recalled its cantaloupe,\nshipped between 29 Jul 2011 and 10 Sep 2011, which was distributed to\nat least 17 states with possible further distribution. Ongoing collaborative investigations by local, state, and federal\npublic health and regulatory agencies indicate the source of the\noutbreak is cantaloupe.

Many of\nthe deaths involved elderly people, who are especially susceptible to\nthe aggressive pathogen.\n\nThe cantaloupes were grown by a Colorado company, Jensen Farms, which\nissued a recall earlier this month [September 2011]. The melons, a\ntype marketed as Rocky Ford cantaloupes, named after a region in\nColorado, were sold around the country.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that\nsince the outbreak began in late July [2011] at least 72 people had\nfallen ill in 18 states. The agency said that 4 people had died in New\nMexico, 2 in Colorado, 2 in Texas, and one each in Kansas, Maryland,\nMissouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The toll could grow as state health\nofficials wait for test results on other deaths suspected of being\npart of the outbreak.\n\nOfficials said that most of those who died were over age 60. At least\n2 were in their 90s. _Listeria_ is a common but dangerous bacterium\nthat can cause severe illness, especially among the elderly, the very\nyoung, and people with compromised immune systems. The pathogen can\nalso cause pregnant women to have miscarriages. Federal officials have\nso far provided no information about the number of miscarriages or\nstillbirths associated with the outbreak. Pregnant women are 20 times\nas likely as other healthy adults to come down with a severe\ninfection, according to the CDC.\n\nJohn N Sofos, a professor of food safety at Colorado State University,\nsaid that many people who were infected might have only mild symptoms,\nlike diarrhea. But in others, especially those in the most vulnerable\ncategories, the bacteria can aggressively move out of the\ngastrointestinal tract and attack muscle tissue or the spinal cord,\nleading to much more severe illnesses like meningitis. For that\nreason, the death rate in listeriosis outbreaks is often much higher\nthan with other forms of foodborne bacteria.\n\nWilliam Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of foodborne\nillness, said this outbreak might turn out to be especially deadly\nsimply because cantaloupe is a food eaten by many older people.\nSometimes in outbreaks, it's the population that's consuming the food\nthat drives the numbers, Mr Marler said. In this instance, you've got\na lot of people 60 and older who are consuming cantaloupe.\n\nThe outbreak appeared to be the 3rd worst in the United States\nattributed to any form of foodborne illness, in terms of the number of\ndeaths, since the CDC began regularly tracking such outbreaks in the\nearly 1970s. The deadliest outbreak in the United States since then\noccurred in 1985, when a wave of listeriosis, linked to Mexican-style\nfresh cheese, swept through California. A federal database says 52\ndeaths were attributed to the outbreak, but news reports at the time\nput the number as high as 84.\n\nThe 2nd deadliest outbreak was in 1998 and 1999, when there were at\nleast 14 deaths and 4 miscarriages or stillbirths in a listeriosis\noutbreak linked to hot dogs and delicatessen meats. Some sources put\nthe death toll in that outbreak as high as 21.\n\nWith the updated death toll on Tuesday [27 Sep 2011], the Rocky Ford\ncantaloupe outbreak surpassed the 2008 deaths associated with\nsalmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut butter produced by a Georgia\ncompany, the Peanut Corporation of America. That outbreak, which drew\na large amount of news coverage, killed 9 people and sickened more\nthan 700.\n\nThe huge outbreak this year [2011] in Europe of a rare form of _E.\ncoli_ bacteria attributed to fenugreek sprouts killed at least 50\npeople.\n\n_Listeria_ is a common bacterium that can be found in soil, water,\ndecaying plant matter, and manure. A strain of the organism, called\n_Listeria monocytogenes_, was first found to cause illness linked to\nfood in the early 1980s. Since then, only a handful of listeriosis\noutbreaks have been associated with fresh fruits and vegetables. The\nmajority was caused by tainted meat or dairy products.\n\nIt can take more than 2 months for a person exposed to the bacteria to\nfall ill, which means that it is often difficult to identify a food\nthat carried the pathogen. Unlike some other bacteria, _Listeria_ also\ngrows well at low temperatures, meaning it can be difficult to\neliminate from refrigerated areas used to process or store foods.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it had found the strain of the\nbacterium on melons and on equipment in the Colorado farm's\npackinghouse. It also found the bacteria on melons in a Denver-area\nstore. Investigators have not said how they believe the contamination\noccurred.\n\nThe FDA recommends that consumers rinse all raw produce, including\ncantaloupes, under running water. Firm produce, like melons, should be\nscrubbed with a produce brush. The washed produce should be dried with\na clean cloth or unused paper towel, the agency said.\n\n[Byline: William Neuman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: KKTV [edited]\nhttp://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/D70_Takes_Cantaloupe_Off_Menu_Due_To_Listeria_Scare_129834148.html\n\n\nDr Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, said Wednesday [28 Sep 2011] during a conference call with\nmedia that 2 pregnant women were among the 72 confirmed cases of\n_Listeria_ infection linked to cantaloupes grown in Colorado. He also\nconfirmed that this was the deadliest outbreak in more than a decade.\n\nBoth of the pregnant women and their fetuses are expected to be fine,\nbut 13 people have died from the infection. 3 more deaths are also\nsuspected to be connected, but are not yet confirmed by laboratory\ntests.\n\nThe CDC says _Listeria_ infection during pregnancy could lead to\npremature delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth, and other serious health\nproblems.\n\nThe CDC also said that the number of cases and deaths are likely to\nincrease, because symptoms of _Listeria_ infections can develop up to\n2 months after consumption of the contaminated food.\n\nThe _Listeria_ infections were reported in 18 states.\n\nIn this case, laboratory tests have connected the strains of\n_Listeria_ to melons of the 'Rocky Ford' variety grown by Jensen Farms\nin Holly, Colorado. That particular variety is prized for having a\nhigher sugar contact, and was developed in the Rocky Ford region of\nColorado during the late 1800's.\n\nThe state of Colorado says it has tested melon samples from the\nrefrigerator of a listeriosis patient's home, as well as samples\nobtained from various retail outlets. They were also traced to Jensen\nFarms.\n\nJensen Farms has voluntarily recalled the melons in question, which it\nsays were shipped between 29 Jul and 10 Sep 2011. They were sent to\nIllinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota,\nKansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma,\nArizona, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThey carry stickers that say either, 'Product of USA - Frontera\nProduce - Colorado Fresh - Rocky Ford' or 'Jensen Farms - Sweet Rocky\nFords.'\n\nAnyone who has, or may have had cantaloupes from Jensen Farms is\nadvised to throw them away. Do not try to clean the melons.\n\nAdditionally, the CDC warned that _Listeria_ can continue to grow --\neven inside a refrigerator. Caution is advised for everyone who may\nhave had one of the recalled melons, but specifically for people who\nare at high risk.\n\nThe FDA, also represented during Wednesday's [28 Sep 2011] conference\ncall, said this is the 1st known outbreak of listeriosis related to\ncantaloupe. The 10 cantaloupe-related outbreaks in the past decade\nwere connected to salmonella or a virus.\n\nThe worst outbreak of listeriosis on record was in 1985 and traced\nback to Mexican-style cheese.\n\nThe FDA says it has a team working with a team from Colorado to do an\nenvironmental assessment at Jensen Farm's facilities. As part of that\nwork, they're looking at potential contamination from animals, water,\nand the processing facility. So far, they've not reached any\nconclusions.\n\nA couple from Colorado Springs is suing the farm and Walmart because\nof the tainted fruit. According to the lawsuit, obtained by 11 News,\nthey are alleging that a cantaloupe distributed by Jensen Farms and\nsold at a Walmart on Razorback Road in the Springs caused [the man] to\nfall ill with listeriosis. [He] has been hospitalized since 31 Aug\n2011.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the couple claims that the cantaloupe was contaminated\nwith _Listeria_ at the time it was sold, and is directly responsible\nfor [his] illness. They say Jensen Farms and Walmart are both liable\nfor having sold 'food which was defective and not reasonably safe.'\n\nIf you have questions about listeriosis, call the Colorado Department\nof Public Health and Environment at 1-877-462-2911.\n\nAnyone with questions about the recall can contact Jensen Farms at\n1-800-267-4561 or recall@rfordcantaloupe.com.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: Los Angeles Times [edited]\nhttp://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/09/listeria-outbreak-linked-to-cantaloupes-could-worsen.html\n\n\nIf in doubt, throw it out. Unless you can be sure of the source of\nthat cantaloupe in your kitchen, it's best to toss it. That's the word\nfrom the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is\ntrying to put a lid on one of the worst listeriosis outbreaks in US\nhistory.\n\nSo far, there are 72 reported cases of listeriosis linked to tainted\ncantaloupes, and 13 deaths. State and local officials say they are\ninvestigating 3 additional deaths that may be connected and the toll\ncould rise, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe tainted melons that triggered the multi-state listeriosis outbreak\nhave been traced to Jensen Farms in Granada, Colorado.\n\n'If it's not Jensen farms, it's okay to eat,' Dr Thomas Frieden, CDC\ndirector, said in a media conference call today [28 Sep 2011]. 'But if\nyou can't confirm that it's not Jensen farms, then it's best to throw\nit out.'\n\nSome of the cantaloupes were exported out of the country, and the CDC\nhas been issuing recalls both inside and outside the US for all the\naffected melons.\n\nThis outbreak is the largest in a decade and could grow worse, said\nthe CDC's foodborne illness specialist, Dr Barbara Mahon, who also\nparticipated in the media alert.

With the updated death toll on Tuesday [27 Sep 2011], the Rocky Ford\ncantaloupe outbreak surpassed the 2008 deaths associated with\nsalmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut butter produced by a Georgia\ncompany, the Peanut Corporation of America. The cantaloupes at the center of this\noutbreak -- first flagged on 12 Sep 2011 -- are nearing the outer edge\nof their shelf life, making it less likely they will be eaten with\neach passing day. However, because the incubation period of listeriosis can be up\nto a month or more, there may be more cases, deaths, miscarriages, or\nstillbirths reported in the future due to consumption of these\n_Listeria_-contaminated melons. According to the lawsuit, obtained by 11 News,\nthey are alleging that a cantaloupe distributed by Jensen Farms and\nsold at a Walmart on Razorback Road in the Springs caused [the man] to\nfall ill with listeriosis. But in others, especially those in the most vulnerable\ncategories, the bacteria can aggressively move out of the\ngastrointestinal tract and attack muscle tissue or the spinal cord,\nleading to much more severe illnesses like meningitis. That's the word\nfrom the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is\ntrying to put a lid on one of the worst listeriosis outbreaks in US\nhistory. They were sent to\nIllinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota,\nKansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma,\nArizona, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. \n\nWilliam Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of foodborne\nillness, said this outbreak might turn out to be especially deadly\nsimply because cantaloupe is a food eaten by many older people. \n\nThis outbreak is the largest in a decade and could grow worse, said\nthe CDC's foodborne illness specialist, Dr Barbara Mahon, who also\nparticipated in the media alert. ' \n\nThe single largest listeriosis outbreak occurred in 1985, and was\ntraced to soft Mexican-style cheese manufactured by Jalisco Mexican\nProducts Inc. of Artesia. \n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it had found the strain of the\nbacterium on melons and on equipment in the Colorado farm's\npackinghouse. The 2nd deadliest outbreak was in 1998 and 1999, when there were at\nleast 14 deaths and 4 miscarriages or stillbirths in a listeriosis\noutbreak linked to hot dogs and delicatessen meats. The FDA, also represented during Wednesday's [28 Sep 2011] conference\ncall, said this is the 1st known outbreak of listeriosis related to\ncantaloupe. \n\nIt can take more than 2 months for a person exposed to the bacteria to\nfall ill, which means that it is often difficult to identify a food\nthat carried the pathogen. \n\nThe state of Colorado says it has tested melon samples from the\nrefrigerator of a listeriosis patient's home, as well as samples\nobtained from various retail outlets. \n\nSome of the cantaloupes were exported out of the country, and the CDC\nhas been issuing recalls both inside and outside the US for all the\naffected melons. The CDC also said that the number of cases and deaths are likely to\nincrease, because symptoms of _Listeria_ infections can develop up to\n2 months after consumption of the contaminated food. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that\nsince the outbreak began in late July [2011] at least 72 people had\nfallen ill in 18 states. The huge outbreak this year [2011] in Europe of a rare form of _E.\ncoli_ bacteria attributed to fenugreek sprouts killed at least 50\npeople. \n\nThe CDC says _Listeria_ infection during pregnancy could lead to\npremature delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth, and other serious health\nproblems. The deadliest outbreak in the United States since then\noccurred in 1985, when a wave of listeriosis, linked to Mexican-style\nfresh cheese, swept through California. A federal database says 52\ndeaths were attributed to the outbreak, but news reports at the time\nput the number as high as 84. The toll could grow as state health\nofficials wait for test results on other deaths suspected of being\npart of the outbreak. The agency said that 4 people had died in New\nMexico, 2 in Colorado, 2 in Texas, and one each in Kansas, Maryland,\nMissouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. John N Sofos, a professor of food safety at Colorado State University,\nsaid that many people who were infected might have only mild symptoms,\nlike diarrhea. Federal officials have\nso far provided no information about the number of miscarriages or\nstillbirths associated with the outbreak. That outbreak, which drew\na large amount of news coverage, killed 9 people and sickened more\nthan 700. Listeria_ is a common but dangerous bacterium\nthat can cause severe illness, especially among the elderly, the very\nyoung, and people with compromised immune systems. For that\nreason, the death rate in listeriosis outbreaks is often much higher\nthan with other forms of foodborne bacteria. State and local officials say they are\ninvestigating 3 additional deaths that may be connected and the toll\ncould rise, according to the Associated Press. Many of\nthe deaths involved elderly people, who are especially susceptible to\nthe aggressive pathogen. Caution is advised for everyone who may\nhave had one of the recalled melons, but specifically for people who\nare at high risk. A strain of the organism, called\n_Listeria monocytogenes_, was first found to cause illness linked to\nfood in the early 1980s.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2011-09-27 00:00:00", "2011-09-28 00:00:00", "1999-03-26 00:00:00", "2011-09-10 00:00:00", "2011-03-26 00:00:00", "2021-03-31 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-30 00:00:00", "2011-09-26 00:00:00", "1985-03-26 00:00:00", "2008-03-26 00:00:00", "1998-03-26 00:00:00", "2011-09-12 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tennessee", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado Springs", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Illinois", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Seattle", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Holly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Granada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nebraska", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Wyoming", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maryland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Oklahoma", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "North Carolina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Jersey", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Arizona", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kansas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Minnesota", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Utah", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Artesia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Denver", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Missouri", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "742987", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Listeriosis, fatal - USA: (CO)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=742987", "date": "2011-06-05 18:01:29", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS, FATAL - USA: (COLORADO)\n************************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 2 Jun 2011\nSource: 9news.com [edited]\nhttp://www.9news.com/news/article/201433/188/2-dead-in-Colorado-from-outbreak-of-Listeria\n\n\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment [CDPHE] says\n2 people have died because of an outbreak of listeriosis. The CDPHE\nsays it is working with Denver Public Health and Denver Environmental\nHealth after 3 cases of listeriosis were reported since 20 May 2011.\nAll 3 cases involved people of Hispanic or Latino heritage, according\nto the CDPHE. The 2 people who died were a man in his 30s and a woman\nin her 60s.\n\n'These cases are very concerning to us because we have seen 3 in over\na little more than a week, and usually we see only 10 cases a year. So\nthis is very concerning to us,' Alicia Cronquist, an epidemiologist,\nsaid. The CDPHE says Colorado averages 10 cases of listeriosis a year.\nThe source of the outbreak is still unknown.\n\nPeople who are at high risk for _Listeria_ infection include people\nwith weakened immune systems from transplants or certain chronic\ndiseases, immunosuppressive therapies or medications; pregnant women;\nand people age 60 and older. Healthy people rarely contract\nlisteriosis, according to the CDPHE.\n\nSymptoms can include fever and muscle aches and also can include\ndiarrhea, headache, stiff neck, confusion and convulsions. Listeriosis\nalso can cause miscarriages and stillbirths. Antibiotics can cure it\nand prevent the fetus from being infected.\n\nRecommendations for those at high risk:\n--------------------------------------\nCheeses\n-------\n- Do not eat soft cheese such as feta, queso blanco, queso fresco,\nbrie, Camembert, blue-veined, or panela (queso panela) unless it is\nlabeled as made with pasteurized milk. Make sure the label says, 'Made\nwith pasteurized milk.'\n\nMeats\n-----\n- Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats, cold cuts, other deli meats\n(e.g., bologna), or fermented or dry sausages unless they are heated\nto an internal temperature of 165 F or until steaming hot just before\nserving.\n- Avoid getting fluid from hot dog and lunchmeat packages on other\nfoods, utensils and food preparation surfaces. Wash hands after\nhandling hot dogs, luncheon meats and deli meats.\n- Do not eat refrigerated pate or meat spreads from a deli or meat\ncounter or from the refrigerated section of a store. Foods that do not\nneed refrigeration, such as canned or shelf-stable pate and meat\nspreads, are safe to eat. Refrigerate after opening.\n\nSeafood\n-------\n- Do not eat refrigerated smoked seafood unless it is contained in a\ncooked dish, such as a casserole, or unless it is a canned or\nshelf-stable product. Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon,\ntrout, whitefish, cod, tuna and mackerel is most often labeled as\n'nova-style,' 'lox,' 'kippered,' 'smoked' or 'jerky.' These fish\ntypically are found in the refrigerator section or deli counters of\ngrocery stores and delicatessens. Canned and shelf-stable tuna, salmon\nand other fish products are safe to eat.'\n\nGeneral recommendations\n-----------------------\n>From the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\n\n- Thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources, such as beef, pork or\npoultry, to a safe internal temperature. For a list of recommended\ntemperatures for meat and poultry, visit\nhttp://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/IsItDoneYet_Magnet.pdf.\n- Rinse raw vegetables thoroughly under running tap water before\neating.\n- Keep uncooked meats and poultry separate from vegetables and from\ncooked foods and ready-to-eat foods.\n- Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk, and do not eat foods that\nhave unpasteurized milk in them.\n- Wash hands, knives, countertops and cutting boards after handling\nand preparing uncooked foods.\n\nFor more information, visit the CDC website:\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/listeriosis/.\n\n[Byline: Jeffrey Wolf]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org\n\n[The following is extracted from Mod.ML's comments in a prior\nProMED-mail post Listeriosis - USA: (NC, MA), alert 20071230.4186:\n\n'_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely\ndistributed in nature.

Texas DSHS\nhad been investigating the source of 10 cases of listeriosis -- the\nillness caused by the ingestion of _Listeria [monocytogenes]_\nbacteria, 5 of which resulted in death -- for 8 months when\ninvestigators determined that the source of the outbreak was chopped\ncelery sold by Sangar Fresh Cut Produce in San Antonio. Six of the 10\ncases have been conclusively linked to consumption of the chopped\ncelery.\n\nAccording to a health department press release, all cases of\n_Listeria_ food poisoning occurred in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo\ncounties. All of the reported cases were in people with serious\nunderlying health problems.\n\nSeveral segments of the population are at increased risk for\ncontracting listeriosis. Individuals at increased risk include:\nPregnant women, who are about 20 times more likely than other healthy\nadults to get listeriosis (about 1/3rd of listeriosis cases happen\nduring pregnancy); Newborns, who, rather than the pregnant women\nthemselves, suffer the serious effects of infection in pregnancy;\nPersons with weakened immune systems, [such as] persons with cancer,\ndiabetes, kidney disease, or AIDS (who are almost 300 times more\nlikely to get listeriosis than people with normal immune systems);\nPersons who take glucocorticosteroid medications (such as cortisone);\nand the elderly.\n\nTexas DSHS ordered the celery manufacturer, Sangar Fresh Cut Produce\nin San Antonio, to stop processing food and recall all products\nshipped from the plant since January 2010 after lab testing of\nchopped celery from the plant indicated the presence of _Listeria_.\nAccording to a press release issued by Texas DSHS, conditions in the\nfood processing plant posed 'an immediate and serious threat to human\nlife or health.'\n\nSangar Fresh Cut Produce recalled products include primarily cut\nfresh produce in sealed packages, which were distributed to\nrestaurants and institutional facilities such as hospitals and\nschools. The chopped celery and other products are not believed to\nhave been sold in grocery stores.\n\nTexas DSHS inspectors reported that they found sanitation issues at\nthe plant during the _Listeria_ outbreak investigation and believe\nthe _Listeria_ bacteria found in the chopped celery may have\ncontaminated other food manufactured in the facility. The agency\nstated in a press release that a condensation leak had been found\nabove the food product area during an inspection. Inspectors also\nfound soil on a food preparation table and identified handwashing\nissues. All of these factors could have contributed to the spread of\n_Listeria_ throughout the food manufacturing plant where celery was\nchopped and packaged.\n\nTexas DSHS food safety personnel are continuing their investigation\ninto the possible points within the facility where the celery became\ncontaminated with _Listeria_ and is contacting distributors,\nrestaurants and institutions believed to have received the recalled\nproducts to ensure the celery and other products sold by Sangar Fresh\nCut Produce does not reach consumers.\n\nThe order issued by Texas DSHS prohibits the plant from reopening\nwithout DSHS approval.\n\nThe incubation period (time between ingestion and the onset of\nsymptoms) for listeriosis ranges from 3 to 70 days and averages 21\ndays.\n\nA person with listeriosis may develop fever, muscle aches, and\nsometimes, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. If\ninfection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache,\nstiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. In\nimmune-deficient individuals, _Listeria_ can invade the central\nnervous system, causing meningitis and/or encephalitis (brain\ninfection). Infected pregnant women ordinarily experience only a\nmild, flu-like illness; however, infection during pregnancy can lead\nto miscarriage, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.\n\nNewborns may present clinically with early-onset (less than 7 days)\nor late-onset forms of infection (7 or more days). Those with the\nearly-onset form are often diagnosed in the 1st 24 hours of life with\nsepsis (infection in the blood). Early-onset listeriosis is most\noften acquired from the mother through transplacental transmission.\nLate-onset neonatal listeriosis is less common than the early-onset\nform. Clinical symptoms may be subtle and include irritability, fever\nand poor feeding. The mode of acquisition of late-onset listeriosis\nis poorly understood.\n\n[Byline: Bill Marler]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSara Volk, PhD\nAssistant Professor, Dept of Biology and Kinesiology\nOur Lady of the Lake University, San Antonio, TX\n<sara.m.volk@gmail.com>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 21 Oct 2010\nSource: MySanAntonio.com [edited]\n<http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/health_official_says_celery_was_tainted_105446578.html>\n\n\nState health officials discounted claims by the president of Sangar\nProduce & Processing Co. that the company's celery -- linked to the\ndeaths of 5 people from foodborne illness -- is 'absolutely safe.'\n\n'When we test produce, we do a rapid screen initially,' said Texas\nDepartment of State Health Services spokeswoman Carrie Williams.

Between 1 Jan and 11 Mar\nthis year [2010], there have been 14 reported cases, said Dr. Arlene\nKing, Ontario's chief medical officer. 'There is a strong network of\nfederal and provincial agencies that are working diligently to\nminimize the risk of any more incidents of this food-borne illness.\nWe will keep the public informed of any new developments in our\ninvestigation,' said King.\n\nSo far, only 10 of the 14 reported cases have been investigated.\nAside from the 2 deaths, 7 people were hospitalized. At least 2 of\nthe non-fatal cases have been linked to recently recalled ham and\nsalami products from Toronto-based company Siena Foods. Both of those\npatients are from Toronto. They were both hospitalized but are now\nrecovering.\n\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] is warning consumers that\nSiena-brand Prosciutto Cotto Cooked Ham products may have been\ncontaminated with the bacteria _Listeria monocytogenes_. These\nproducts would have been sold to consumers after 11 Jan [2010] in\ndelicatessens, and grocery and specialty food stores in Ontario,\nQuebec and Alberta. King is also warning people not to consume\nSiena-brand mild Cacciatore Salami, which was recalled in December\n2009 and may be linked to the recent rash of illnesses. Siena Foods\nis voluntarily recalling the affected food while the CFIA\ninvestigates the outbreak. Siena hasn't halted all production at its\nplant. However, only products that test negative for _Listeria_ will\nbe delivered to the public.\n\nConsumers who fear they may have consumed the tainted food are urged\nto contact their local retailers. The ham would have been sold in\nlarge wholesale packages, with best before dates of 8 Mar and 22 Mar\n2010. The salami would have a best before date of 4 May 2010.\n\nFood contaminated with _Listeria_ may not appear spoiled in any way.\nSymptoms include high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and\nnausea. 'Listeriosis is, in most cases, a mild and self-limiting\ndisease,' said King. However, pregnant women, the elderly, or people\nwith weak immune systems are at a greater risk of death because the\ninfection can lead to blood poisoning or meningitis, King said.\nPregnant women who consume contaminated foods may experience\npremature delivery, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth. As well, the\ninfection can be passed along to the newborn. King went so far as to\nrecommend people in the high-risk category avoid all deli meats and\nunpasteurized dairy products -- not just those being recalled -- at\nall times. 'There is an inherent risk of bacteria in all of those\nkinds of products,' King said.\n\n22 people in Canada died of listeriosis in 2009. The 2009 outbreak\nprompted Prime Minister Stephen Harper to assign Sheila Weatherill,\nformer head of Edmonton's health system, to issue an independent\nreport about the situation and make recommendations on how to avoid\nsimilar outbreaks in the future. Robert Charlebois, executive\ndirector of food safety and consumer protection with the CIFA, was\nunable to say how many of Weatherhill's 57 recommendations have been\nimplemented. 'Certainly, we have learned from the previous\nlisteriosis cases and the recommendations.

'We are implementing as we speak.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is not stated in the news release above whether listeria was\nisolated at the processing plant or from the Siena-brand deli meats\n(ham and salami), or whether DNA fingerprinting of any strains of\nlisteria that were isolated from the patients or deli meats was done\nand whether the DNA fingerprints proved to be identical. The news\nrelease above also does not pinpoint how the contamination occurred\nduring the production process.\n\nIn 2008, ProMED reported a Canadian deli-meat associated outbreak of\nlisteriosis that involved 20 deaths (Listeriosis, fatal, meat product\n- Canada (04) 20081005.3147).

Outbreaks are\nsometimes linked to foods such as soft cheeses and deli meats\ncontaminated after processing.\n\nGenetic analysis found the identical strain of bacteria in all the\npatients, suggesting they were infected by the same food item, said\nRoger Sanchez, senior epidemiologist with the Metropolitan Health\nDistrict. But because of the small numbers and the dispersal of cases\n-- 2 of the patients lived 300 miles apart -- it might be difficult\nto pinpoint the cause, he added.\n\n'This is not a large outbreak. What made it bad is that it has\ninfected people who are fragile, elderly people,' Sanchez said.\n\nMost healthy people aren't in danger from listeriosis though they\nsometimes experience flu-like symptoms. But in the elderly, pregnant\nwomen and people whose immune systems are weakened by illness, the\nfatality rate from the infection can reach 20 percent. The Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 2500 become\nseriously ill each year with listeriosis, and 500 of them die.\n\nSanchez said the infected patients ranged from ages 66 to 93. Most\nhad serious underlying health problems, and all but one were\nhospitalized either before or during their infection. The 1st case\nwas reported in January 2010, the most recent 6 May 2010.\n\nOn Monday [10 May 2010], the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a\npublic health alert for deli meats imported from Canada and produced\nby Ontario-based Zadi Foods. The products were prosciutto sold under\nthe brands Casa Italia and Emma. A 2008 outbreak in Canada linked to\nanother deli meat producer killed 22 people out of 57 who became ill.\nA number of Texas cases in recent years have been traced to\nunpasteurized soft, white cheese from Mexico.\n\n'Deli meats are implicated a lot because the bacteria can multiply in\nrefrigerator temperatures,' unlike most other forms of bacteria, Sanchez said.\n\nSymptoms of listeriosis can include fever, muscle aches, nausea and\ndiarrhea. If the infection spreads to the nervous system, it can\ncause headaches, confusion, vertigo and convulsions.\n\nTo reduce the risk of listeriosis, people are advised to thoroughly\ncook raw meat and wash raw vegetables before eating, keep raw meats\nseparate from vegetables and other cooked or ready-to-eat foods, and\nwash hands, knives and cutting boards afterward.\n\nFor those at highest risk of serious illness, such as the elderly or\npregnant women, experts recommend avoiding hot dogs or luncheon meats\nunless reheated until steaming hot, avoiding soft cheeses unless the\nlabel states they're made from pasteurized milk, and avoiding\nrefrigerated meat spreads and cold smoked seafood unless it is an\ningredient in a cooked dish.\n\n[Byline: Don Finley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Susan Baekeland\n\n[In 2008, ProMED reported a Canadian deli-meat associated outbreak of\nlisteriosis that involved 20 deaths (Listeriosis, fatal, meat product\n- Canada (04) 20081005.3147).

Maple Leaf temporarily closed its Bartor Road plant in Toronto\nlast week [week of 18 Aug 2008] after a number of Sure Slice delicatessen\nmeats tested positive for listeria, a type of bacteria that can lead to\nfevers, severe headaches, and nausea. Listeriosis is the disease caused by\nthe bacteria.\n\nA change in practice to include fatalities where listeriosis may not have\nbeen the direct cause contributed to the sharp increase in the death toll,\nhealth officials said.\n\nMaple Leaf fell CAD 1 [USD 0.96], or 10 per cent, to CAD 8.80 [USD 8.42] at\n4:10 pm on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the biggest one-day decline since 22\nFeb 2006. The shares have dropped 18 per cent since 19 Aug 2008, the day\nbefore the Toronto-based company expanded a recall of some of its meat\nproducts.\n\nOntario officials said today [25 Aug 2008] in a statement it asked health\nauthorities to 'check their local hospitals, long term care homes, and\ndaycares to ensure than any products from the Toronto Maple Leaf plant have\nbeen removed and are not been being consumed.' Maple Leaf reiterated today\nthat the recall will cost about CAD 20 million (USD 19.1 million) and said\nits 1st priority is to restore consumers' confidence in its products. 'The\nshort-term financial impact of this action is secondary to our\nresponsibility to safeguard our consumers' health,' chief financial officer\nMichael Vels said today in a conference call. The recall involves more than\n200 meat products that were made as early as January [2008], Vels said. The\nproducts represent a 'small percentage' of the company's annual sales,\nwhich were CAD 5.21 billion [USD 4.99 million] last year [2007]. Vels\ndeclined to speculate on how the recall will affect future Maple Leaf revenue.\n\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency said today [25 Aug 2008] that\nsandwiches made by Lucerne Foods, a unit of Safeway Inc, are being recalled\nbecause some of them may contain Maple Leaf meats. The Safeway and\nTakeAwayCafe brand sandwiches were distributed in Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nMaple Leaf placed advertisements today [25 Aug 2008] in Canadian newspapers\ncommitting to put consumers' interests first.

The sandwiches, made by Kent-based Anchor Catering, had been\ndistributed across Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Essex, Middlesex, and Greater London.\nOn Mon 26 Mar 2007, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said the\nhospital patient had the same strain of listeria as the Anchor\nproducts. The HPA said the strain was uncommon and the cases were\nlikely to be linked.\n'An individual with a weakened immune system, who reported eating a\nlikely-to-be-Anchor sandwich in a hospital supplied by Anchor, has\ntested positive for the same strain of _Listeria_ as the one found at\nAnchor Catering,' an HPA statement said. The HPA has not said which\nhospital the patient was in, or released details about his/her condition.\nThe Food Standards Agency (FSA) recalled the sandwiches on 16 Mar\n2007.

The\nsandwiches, with use-by dates from 21 Feb to 14 Mar 2007 and labeled\neither Anchor or Pomegranate, had also been supplied to schools and\nbusinesses across the South East.

Williams provided no specifics except to\nsay the victim was from southern Ontario. The number of confirmed\ncases, which seem to consist primarily of nursing home residents,\ncould grow as health units across the province continue to submit\nreports on the disease, he added. 'The pattern was people in certain\nlong-term care facilities' across southern Ontario, Williams said.\n'The median age in the males is 76 and in the females is 80.'\n\nNursing homes, deli counters, and restaurants, including McDonald's\nand Mr Sub, are among the establishments where the meat products --\nwhich include turkey, ham, corned beef, and roast beef -- were\ndistributed. Maple Leaf (TSX:MFI) spokeswoman Linda Smith said the\ncompany is taking all the necessary precautions, including shutting\ndown the plant, providing additional food safety training for\nemployees, and ensuring the public is aware of the situation.\n\n'This is a company that has a culture of food safety,' Smith said.\n'We're taking appropriate, broad, comprehensive, and definitive\naction as it relates to this facility. This involves people -- we\nwant people to understand there's a recall, we want people to have\nthat information.' The recall is costing the company approximately\n[CAD] 2 million [USD 1.9 million], Smith added.\n\nWilliams said there are an additional 16 probable or suspected cases\nin the province [Ontario]. 'I strongly advise the public, especially\nthose at high risk for listeriosis ... to make sure they avoid\nconsuming these products,' he said in a statement. 'I have also asked\nall public health units to advise emergency rooms in their\njurisdictions to be on alert for cases. All suspect and confirmed\ncases of listeriosis must be reported immediately to local public\nhealth units and in turn to the ministry within one business day of\nnotification of report.'\n\nConsumption of food tainted with listeria can lead to high fever,\nsevere headache, neck stiffness, and nausea. The illness is a\nparticular danger to pregnant women and their unborn children, the\nelderly, and people with weakened immune systems, cancer, diabetes,\nkidney disease, or AIDS.\n\nSymptoms usually appear within 2 to 30 days, and up to 90 days after\nconsuming contaminated food, according to the Canadian Food\nInspection Agency. The average incubation period is about 3 weeks,\nsays the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.\n\nThe remaining 4 confirmed cases include 2 in BC [British Columbia],\none in Saskatchewan, and one in Quebec. Health inspectors in all 4\nprovinces were working with Health Canada and the Canadian Food\nInspection Agency [CFIA] to confirm the source of the outbreak.\n\nMargaret Ringland, of the Ontario Association of Non-Profit Homes and\nServices for Seniors, which represents 180 non-profit homes in the\nprovince, said she's had no reports of suspicious deaths at the\nassociation's facilities. 'They would simply not use the meat; they\nwould move into other foods, it's as simple as that,' Ringland said.\n'People aren't going to take a chance. The products they're talking\nabout aren't ones that are a heavy part of menus in most of the\nhomes. I haven't heard from anybody who has an issue over this.'\n\nCFIA spokesman Garfield Balsom said he couldn't say how long it would\ntake to establish any possible links between Maple Leaf products and\nthe bacteria. 'To predict when you're going to complete an\ninvestigation is practically impossible,' he said. 'With the tomato\nissue in the United States, it went on for 3 or 4 months.'\n\nMaple Leaf is recalling all products prepared at the plant since [2\nJun 2008] and shutting down the plant through the weekend [23-24 Aug\n2008] for a comprehensive sanitization, Smith said. Employees are\nalso to receive additional food safety training, and the 2 production\nlines in question are to be dismantled, she added. On Sunday [17 Aug\n2008], the meat packer said it had discovered listeria in Sure Slice\nroast beef and corned beef produced at the Toronto facility and\nissued a recall on those products.\n\nBrand names for some of the recalled products include Schneiders,\nSure Slice, Deli Gourmet, and Burns Bites. A complete list of\naffected products is available on both the Maple Leaf Foods website\n(<http://www.mapleleaf.com>) and that of the CFIA\n(<http://www.inspection.gc.ca>). The 23 products involved in the\nexpanded recall carry an establishment number of 97B and have\nbest-before dates ranging from [30 Sep 2008 to 1 Jan 2009].\n\nBalsom said the CFIA first became aware of possible problems when it\nwas notified of a listeriosis outbreak on [6 Aug 2008] by a\nparticular health unit; subsequent investigation led them to Maple\nLeaf's Toronto facility, he said.\n\nMcDonald's Canada said Wednesday [20 Aug 2008] it is temporarily\nremoving its turkey BLT [bacon/lettuce/tomato] sandwich from its menu\nas a 'precautionary measure' -- the only item on the restaurant\nchain's menu that is affected. 'We apologize for any inconvenience\nthis may cause, but food safety and quality at McDonald's will not be\ncompromised,' the company said in a release.

In the latest death linked to the\noutbreak of listeriosis, a BC [British Columbia] man died after\neating tainted meat he was served in hospital. The case raised the\nfrightening spectre that tainted meat may have been consumed in\nhospitals and care homes across the country.\n\nThe man, a 64-year-old Vancouver Island resident, died at Cowichan\nDistrict Hospital from the illness, which has been linked to the\nconsumption of tainted luncheon meat that was the subject of a\nnationwide recall.\n\n'We just got confirmation today [22 Aug 2008] from the Public Health\nAgency of Canada that it's the outbreak strain,' said Dr Lorna Medd,\nmedical health officer with the Vancouver Island Health Authority.\n\nThe man died on 29 Jul 2008 at the hospital in Duncan, about 60\nkilometres (37 mi) north of Victoria, but it took time to confirm the\ncause of death, the health authority said. 'This incident occurred\nprior to the Canada-wide recall of certain Maple Leaf products,' the\nBC Centre for Disease Control said in a statement late Friday [22 Aug\n2008].\n\nThe tainted meat was possibly served on Vancouver Island at Cowichan\nDistrict Hospital as well as Victoria General Hospital, Royal Jubilee\nHospital, Saanich Peninsula Hospital, Queen Alexandra Hospital,\nAberdeen, Glengarry, Mount Tolmie, the Priory, Gorge Road Hospital,\nCairnsmore Place, and Cowichan Lodge in Duncan and Tofino Hospital.\nThe product has now been removed from these sites and all other local\nhealth authority sites.\n\nTo date, 4 other deaths have been linked to listeriosis by health\nauthorities in Ontario and they are investigating whether 3 more\ndeaths were related to the disease. Dr Richard Schabas, medical\nofficer of health for Hastings and Prince Edward counties, said the\nmost recently confirmed death was an elderly man. 'We had a death\nfrom Hastings-Prince Edward counties, someone who we've now\nidentified as part of the _Listeria monocytogenes_ outbreak. The\ndeath occurred in the middle of July [2008],' Schabas said. He said\nthe number of deaths linked to listeriosis is likely to climb.\n\nEarlier Friday [22 Aug 2008], a Niagara public health official said\ntests confirmed the death of an elderly woman who lived in St\nCatharines, ON [Ontario], was related to the listeriosis outbreak.\nThe health authority in Waterloo, ON, confirmed a 2nd death, while\nthe Hamilton health authority announced the 1st related death\nThursday [21 Aug 2008].\n\nNiagara Public Health spokeswoman Carrie Beatty said a 2nd death of a\nresident from Niagara Falls, ON, was also under investigation, but\nresults are expected to be available until next week.

The warning comes\nafter 3 cases of listeriosis were identified in Moore, Durham and\nMecklenburg counties and a probable case was identified in Buncombe\nCounty.\n\nThe 3 confirmed cases all involved Latinas; 2 (Durham and Mecklenburg\ncounties) of them were pregnant women whose pregnancies resulted in\nmiscarriages as result of the infection. The 3rd case (Moore County)\ninvolved a pregnant woman as well. As a result of the disease, she\ndelivered early, but she and the baby are doing well. The probable\ncase (Buncombe County) involves another pregnant Latina who also lost\nher baby. All 4 had consumed soft cheeses from a variety of sources.\n\nListeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated\nwith the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. Listeriosis outbreaks\nhave been associated with consumption of unpasteurized (raw) milk and\ncontaminated soft cheeses, vegetables and ready-to-eat meats. The\ndisease affects primarily pregnant women, newborns, and people with\nweakened immune systems.\n\n'This is a tragedy, which could have been avoided,' said State\nEpidemiologist Dr. Jeff Engel. 'Listeriosis can be prevented by\navoiding unpasteurized milk and other potentially contaminated food,\nespecially among vulnerable people.'\n\nAlthough the cases occurred close together in time, data from\nmolecular testing conducted at the State Laboratory of Public Health\nshowed that different strains were involved, and therefore a single\nproduct does not seem to be the source of these cases, prompting\npublic health officials to issue a general listeria warning.\n\nA person with listeriosis has fever, muscle aches, and sometimes\ngastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. If infection\nspreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache, stiff neck,\nconfusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. Pregnant women\nand people with depressed immune systems are most likely to become\nseriously ill as a result of the disease.\n\n_Listeria monocytogenes_ is found in soil and water. Vegetables can\nbecome contaminated from the soil or from manure used as fertilizer.\nAnimals can carry the bacterium without appearing ill and can\ncontaminate foods of animal origin such as meats and dairy products.\nThe bacterium has been found in a variety of raw foods, such as\nuncooked meats and vegetables, as well as in processed foods that\nbecome contaminated after processing, such as soft cheeses and cold\ncuts at the deli counter. Unpasteurized (raw) milk or foods made from\nunpasteurized milk are at increased risk to contain the bacterium.\n\nGeneral recommendations to avoid listeriosis include: Avoid\nunpasteurized (raw) milk or foods made from unpasteurized milk;\nthoroughly cook raw food from animal sources; wash raw vegetables\nbefore eating; wash hands, knives, and cutting board after handling\nuncooked foods; consume perishable and ready-to-eat foods as soon as\npossible.\n\nRecommendations for people at high risk, such as pregnant women and\npersons with weakened immune systems, in addition to the\nrecommendations listed above include: Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon\nmeats, or deli meats unless they are reheated until steaming hot;\navoid getting fluid from hot dog packages on other foods, utensils,\nand food preparation surfaces, and wash hands after handling hot\ndogs, luncheon meats, and deli meats; do not eat soft cheeses such as\nfeta, brie, and camembert, blue-veined cheeses, or Mexican-style\ncheeses such as queso blanco, queso fresco, and panela, unless they\nhave labels that clearly state they are made from pasteurized milk;\ndo not eat refrigerated pates or meat spreads (canned or shelf-stable\npates and meat spreads may be eaten); do not eat refrigerated smoked\nseafood unless it is contained in a cooked dish such as a casserole.\nRefrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod,\ntuna or mackerel, is most often labeled as 'nova-style,' 'lox,'\n'kippered,' 'smoked,' or 'jerky.' The fish is found in the\nrefrigerator section or sold at deli counters of grocery stores and\ndelicatessens. Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood may be eaten.\n\nMore information about listeriosis and other communicable diseases\ncan be found on the web at\n<http://www.epi.state.nc.us/epi/gcdc.html>.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 28 Dec 2007 [edited]\nSource: Boston.com [edited]\n<http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/12/28/2_die_from_listeriosis_in_massachusetts/?rss_id=Boston.com+--+National+news>\n\n\nState health officials warned consumers not to drink milk produced by\na Massachusetts dairy, saying it was the likely source of a bacterial\nillness that killed 2 men and sickened 2 others.\n\nWhittier Farms suspended operations and distribution, said Dr. Alfred\nDeMaria, the state director of communicable disease control. Most of\nits customers live in Worcester County. The Department of Public\nHealth issued the warning Thursday [27 Dec 2007] after identifying 4\ncases of listeriosis. Two of the victims, a 78-year-old man and a\n75-year-old man, died in June and October 2007.\n\nInvestigators have not identified the exact source of the\ncontamination in the production process, DeMaria said. But milk\nsamples gathered last week at one of the dairy's 2 retail stores\ntested positive for listeria. Testing showed that the bacteria\ncausing the infections in the 4 victims likely came from the same\nsource.\n\nOfficials at Whittier Farms did not immediately return calls Thursday\n[27 Dec 2007] seeking comment. The dairy has a processing plant in\nShrewsbury and operates 2 retail stores. A message left on an\nanswering machine at the Sutton store said it was closed and that\ninformation to date was ''inconclusive.''

Four cases of listeriosis\ninfection have been identified by DPH, according to a statement\nreleased by the state department late this afternoon [27 Dec 2007].\nThe cases occurred in June, October and 2 in November 2007. The 4\ncases involved 3 elderly residents and a pregnant woman from\nWorcester county. Two of the people have died. They have not been\nidentified.\n\nDNA fingerprinting conducted by the State Laboratory Institute showed\nthat the bacteria causing these infections came from a common source.\nSamples collected showed product contamination. Listeriosis is a\nserious foodborne disease that can be life-threatening to certain\nindividuals. While most cases of listeriosis occur in adults with\nweakened immune systems, the elderly, pregnant women and newborns,\ninfections can occasionally occur in healthy individuals. 'Although\nevidence suggests that contamination is likely to be at a low level\nand the risk of infection low, even in those at high risk, it is\nrecommended that consumers do not consume these products and discard\nany of these products they have,' said DPH Director of Communicable\nDisease Control Dr. Al DeMaria.\n\nSymptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches and sometimes\ngastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. The illness may\nbe mild, and symptoms are sometimes described as flu-like.\n\nAbout 2500 cases of listeriosis occur each year in the United States.\n22 cases occurred in Massachusetts in 2006.

But those\nreviews did not look specifically for evidence of listeria [_Listeria\nmoncytogenes_], the bacterium that sickened the 3 men and one woman.\nInstead, following guidelines established by federal health\nregulators, the laboratory at the state Department of Public Health\ntested milk from Whittier Farms for its overall bacteria count,\nfinding only one sample with a marginally elevated level of germs. A\ndairy is cited only if there is a 2nd elevated test on the same\nproduct.\n\nWhittier agreed to halt production on Thursday [27 Dec 2007], and a\nspokesman for the public health agency, Tom Lyons, said last night\nthat when Whittier resumes operations, the state will test milk from\nthe mom-and-pop dairy specifically for listeria. But there are no\nimmediate plans to begin testing for the germ statewide, he said.\nMilk is sampled monthly at all dairies in the state, with more\nexacting reviews carried out 4 times a year. 'We'll certainly take a\nlook at [broader testing for listeria], but no state in the country\ndoes this type of testing,' Lyons said. 'That's because this type of\nbacteria is not usually found to occur in pasteurized milk products.'\n\nThe inspection reports, including an exhaustive quarterly review\ncompleted just 3 weeks ago, only served to deepen the mystery around\nthe dairy and the listeriosis cases, an illness heralded by flu-like\nsymptoms that can progress into life-threatening neurological\nconditions. The state's top disease tracker said he knew of only 2\nother situations in the United States in the past 2 decades when\npasteurized milk was identified as the source of a cluster of\nlisteriosis cases. 'We always ask about hot dogs and soft cheese and\ncold cuts; those are the most implicated foods,' said Dr. Alfred\nDeMaria, the state's director of communicable disease control.\n\nMilk is suspected as the cause in this case because a bottle of\nlisteria-contaminated, coffee-flavored milk was found in the\nrefrigerator of one victim, and the genetic fingerprint of that\nstrain matched the bacteria found in all 4 victims. Also, listeria\nwas found in a milk sample taken last week at one of Whittier's\nstores.\n\nFamily-owned Whittier continued to decline requests for interviews\nyesterday [28 Dec 2007], issuing a statement that it promised to\ncooperate with state investigators and adding that 'we strive to\nproduce the best product, and, therefore, we are extremely concerned\nabout the situation.' As word spread across Worcester County that\nWhittier had halted production, milk drinkers flooded a state hot\nline, corner stores discarded gallons of the drink, and delivery men\nlamented losing customers.\n\nThe state disease hot line received 50 to 100 calls from consumers\nand their physicians expressing concerns about potential exposure to\nlisteria. Patients were told to see their doctors if they were ill,\nand physicians were told to send blood samples for testing at the\nstate laboratory.\n\nAt the Bagel Time deli in Worcester, general manager Tracy Adams had\na worker begin removing Whittier Farms products from the shelves\nbefore sunrise. The shop has been a loyal customer, offering milk\nflavored with coffee, strawberry, and chocolate. Bagel Time is a\ntypical Whittier buyer: a small, neighborhood business, not a major\nchain. Shaw's Supermarkets, for instance, does not sell Whittier\nproducts, which are marketed under brand names that include Whittier,\nSchultz, Balance Rock, Spring Brook, Maple, and Model. Whittier also\nruns its own shops in West Sutton and Shrewsbury. 'It's unfortunate\nbecause their product was top quality,' Adams said. 'They more than\nlikely will not survive this, so we're at a loss.'\n\nFor Brian Gay, the news was especially devastating. Gay delivers\ndirectly to the doorsteps of hundreds of customers. His company is\ncalled Maple Farm Dairy, but his milk actually comes from Whittier\nFarms. Yesterday [28 Dec 2007], his voicemail box overflowed with\ncustomers. Some complained of headaches that they wanted to blame on\nthe milk. Others said that their child's diarrhea surely must be a\nresult of contaminated milk. So he made the necessary decision to\nbegin delivering another company's product, even as some of his\ncustomers told him they were finished with home delivery.\n\n[Byline: Stephen Smith and Megan Woolhouse]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[ _Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely\ndistributed in nature. The organism can be found in soil, water,\nsilage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw and pasteurized\nmilk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of\nmany animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and in\ncrustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. Most human\ninfections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur\nfrom mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an\ninfected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in\nveterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.\nContamination of food can occur in nature, e.g., raw vegetables\ncontaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk by infected cows, or\nfollowing subsequent cooking or other processing.\n\nBecause the organisms can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, it\nis not surprising that listeriosis is usually associated with\ningestion of contaminated milk, meat or vegetable products that have\nbeen held at refrigeration temperatures. Listeria can also survive in\nfrozen food. Consumption of raw milk, raw-milk soft cheeses (e.g.,\nbrie, camembert, and Mexican soft cheeses), coleslaw, pate, deli\nmeats, and hotdogs have been sources of human listeriosis. The\nsources of human infection can be pinpointed by DNA identification\ntechniques matching _Listeria_ spp isolated from a possible source\nwith a species recovered from a patient.\n\nThe following is from the previous ProMED-mail post 'Listeriosis,\nnosocomial - Norway: (Oslo) 20071024.3452:' Listeriosis is a\nworld-wide zoonosis caused by _Listeria moncytogenes_, which is\ntransmitted from the intestinal tract of farm animals to humans by\ningestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and in\nsome patients invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an\nevident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord,\nendocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy\ncan lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or\nstillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare (about 2500 cases occur\nannually in the US), but the disease has an overall mortality rate of\n20 to 30 percent. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or\nolder, and those with compromised immune defenses (e.g., HIV-infected\npatients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.\n\nThe organism can be killed by pasteurization, but heavy contamination\ncan reduce pasteurization's effectiveness. Although cooking can kill\nthe organism, contaminated surfaces in food preparation areas can\ncontaminate previously cooked food that requires no further cooking\nprior to eating. The organism can then continue grow in the\nrefrigerated, packaged ready-to-eat product, since _L. monocytogenes_\ngrows at refrigerator temperatures. Its presence in food does not\nalter the taste or smell of the food.\n\nImplicated food has included raw milk and pasteurized milk, soft\ncheeses such as Latin-American cheeses, feta, brie and camembert, ice\ncream, raw vegetables, delicatessen salads such as cole slaw, cold\ncuts, turkey franks and other hot dogs, raw and smoked fish,\nshellfish such as shrimp, and undercooked chicken.\n\nThe last 2 articles provide further detail of the outbreak of\nlisteriosis in Massachusetts. Article 3 documents that 3 patients\nwere elderly and one was pregnant. Newborns, pregnant women, people\n60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses\n(e.g., HIV-infected patients) are more susceptible to severe forms of\nlisteriosis. The articles also document that the linkage was found by\nDNA fingerprint between an isolate from chocolate-flavored milk found\nin the refrigerator of one of the 4 patients and the isolates from\nall 4 victims. Also, listeria was cultured from a milk sample taken\nlast week at one of Whittier's stores, but it is not stated whether\nDNA fingerprinting was done on this isolate. Whittier's raw milk\ncould be contaminated with listeria, which then survived perhaps\nfaulty pasteurization and further proliferated in milk stored in the\nrefrigerator (because this organism can multiply at refrigerator\ntemperatures), or the milk could have been contaminated after\npasteurization, e.g., in the process of adding the chocolate-flavor.\nThe article does not state whether the listeria-positive milk sample\nin one of Whittier's stores was plain or the chocolate-flavored\nvariety, or whether all the patients gave a history of drinking the\nchocolate-flavored variety - Mod.ML]", "summary": "\n\nRecommendations for people at high risk, such as pregnant women and\npersons with weakened immune systems, in addition to the\nrecommendations listed above include: Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon\nmeats, or deli meats unless they are reheated until steaming hot;\navoid getting fluid from hot dog packages on other foods, utensils,\nand food preparation surfaces, and wash hands after handling hot\ndogs, luncheon meats, and deli meats; do not eat soft cheeses such as\nfeta, brie, and camembert, blue-veined cheeses, or Mexican-style\ncheeses such as queso blanco, queso fresco, and panela, unless they\nhave labels that clearly state they are made from pasteurized milk;\ndo not eat refrigerated pates or meat spreads (canned or shelf-stable\npates and meat spreads may be eaten); do not eat refrigerated smoked\nseafood unless it is contained in a cooked dish such as a casserole. \n\nGeneral recommendations to avoid listeriosis include: Avoid\nunpasteurized (raw) milk or foods made from unpasteurized milk;\nthoroughly cook raw food from animal sources; wash raw vegetables\nbefore eating; wash hands, knives, and cutting board after handling\nuncooked foods; consume perishable and ready-to-eat foods as soon as\npossible.

For more information\nabout listeria, call (617) 983-6800 or visit\n<http://www.mass.gov/dph>.\n\n--\n [28 Dec 2007], issuing a statement that it promised to\ncooperate with state investigators and adding that 'we strive to\nproduce the best product, and, therefore, we are extremely concerned\nabout the situation.' Infection results in diarrhea and in\nsome patients invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an\nevident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord,\nendocarditis, and intrauterine infection. The\nsources of human infection can be pinpointed by DNA identification\ntechniques matching _Listeria_ spp isolated from a possible source\nwith a species recovered from a patient. Consumption of raw milk, raw-milk soft cheeses (e.g.,\nbrie, camembert, and Mexican soft cheeses), coleslaw, pate, deli\nmeats, and hotdogs have been sources of human listeriosis. Contamination of food can occur in nature, e.g., raw vegetables\ncontaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk by infected cows, or\nfollowing subsequent cooking or other processing. Listeriosis outbreaks\nhave been associated with consumption of unpasteurized (raw) milk and\ncontaminated soft cheeses, vegetables and ready-to-eat meats. \n\nWhittier Farms' milk products are sold under several brand names,\nincluding Whittier, Schultz, Balance Rock, Spring Brook, and Maple,\nstate health officials said. \n\nThe state disease hot line received 50 to 100 calls from consumers\nand their physicians expressing concerns about potential exposure to\nlisteria. Listeriosis can be prevented by\navoiding unpasteurized milk and other potentially contaminated food,\nespecially among vulnerable people.' While most cases of listeriosis occur in adults with\nweakened immune systems, the elderly, pregnant women and newborns,\ninfections can occasionally occur in healthy individuals. ' Officials with the North Carolina Division of Public Health are\ncautioning pregnant women against consumption of soft cheeses, hot\ndogs and deli-style meats and prepared salads. We always ask about hot dogs and soft cheese and\ncold cuts; those are the most implicated foods,' said Dr. Alfred\nDeMaria, the state's director of communicable disease control. But milk\nsamples gathered last week at one of the dairy's 2 retail stores\ntested positive for listeria. Testing showed that the bacteria\ncausing the infections in the 4 victims likely came from the same\nsource.\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[ _Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely\ndistributed in nature. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or\nolder, and those with compromised immune defenses (e.g., HIV-infected\npatients) are most susceptible to invasive disease. Also, listeria\nwas found in a milk sample taken last week at one of Whittier's\nstores. The 3 confirmed cases all involved Latinas; 2 (Durham and Mecklenburg\ncounties) of them were pregnant women whose pregnancies resulted in\nmiscarriages as result of the infection. \nMilk is sampled monthly at all dairies in the state, with more\nexacting reviews carried out 4 times a year. ' Also, listeria was cultured from a milk sample taken\nlast week at one of Whittier's stores, but it is not stated whether\nDNA fingerprinting was done on this isolate.

In 2006, however, the incidence of\nhuman listeriosis was about 0.7. Altogether, 75 cases of listeriosis\nwere reported to have occurred in 2006 [Figure 1. For figures, see\noriginal URL. - Mod.LL], and a few more are still under\ninvestigation. 43 cases were registered during the last quarter of\nthe year (Figure 2). For comparison, in 2005, the overall number of\ncases was 15.\nThe majority of patients with listeriosis were elderly people; 52\npercent of patients were aged 60 and above [Table. For table, see\noriginal URL. - Mod.LL]. In general, men were affected more often\nthan women (42 versus 33 cases), but in the age group 20-39 years,\nwomen (especially pregnant women, 11 cases) constituted the majority\nof patients. A diagnosis of neonatal listeriosis was made in 14\ncases. Miscarriage as a consequence of infection was reported in 2\nwomen. 12 of the 75 patients died. 10 of the deaths were in adults\nbetween 51 and 80 years of age (mean age 71) and 2 in newborn babies.\nThe breakdown of cases by age identified the 3 main population groups\nat risk: newborns, pregnant women and immunocompromised elderly people.\nGeographically, almost half of the country was affected, with 38 out\nof the 76 districts reporting human cases of listeriosis (Figure 3).\nAlthough cases occurred in both Bohemia (western region of the\ncountry) and Moravia (eastern), the latter registered higher\nincidence (0.5 per 100 000 in Bohemia versus 0.99 per 100 000 in Moravia).\nNotification of cases:\nIn the Czech Republic, listeriosis is one of the mandatory notifiable\ndiseases reported within the EPIDAT system. The standard\ndemographical, clinical, laboratory and epidemiological data\ncollected do not include detailed clinical information. All reported\nlisteriosis cases are always laboratory confirmed.\nThe patients affected in the 2006 outbreak (all who recovered) were\ninterviewed by qualified senior epidemiologists to establish what\nfood they had consumed and what their dietary habits were, however,\nno standard questionnaire was used. Most patients reported having\neaten mature cheeses and mixed salads.\nLaboratory findings:\nStrains of _Listeria monocytogenes_ isolated both from patients and\nfood samples (altogether 36 isolates) were forwarded to the Czech\nnational reference laboratory for listeria for detailed serotyping,\npulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and antibiotic susceptibility testing.\nFood consumed by the patients was not available for laboratory\nanalysis. However, food samples collected during inspections of food\nproduction sites and sale outlets were analyzed for listeria.\nLaboratory analysis showed that all strains detected belonged to\nserotype 1/2b and none was found to be resistant against ampicillin,\npenicillin, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole. 30 human isolates were\nanalyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; 26 belonged to the same\npulse type (type A), and only 4 were types B, C, E1 and X. The pulse\ntype A was also confirmed in 2 isolates gained from a sample of\nmature cheese collected in different food store chains. Several\npatients confirmed consumption of this particular cheese. Another\npulse type was detected in a different sort of mature cheese produced\nby another manufacturer. Furthermore, the pulse type of an isolate of\none patient corresponded with the type found in a mixed salad\ncontaining salami, cheese, vegetable and dressing. The analysis of\nisolated strains identified in food samples continues; so far only 2\nstrains have been analyzed.\nControl measures:\nAs part of the control measures undertaken by the Czech authorities\nin response to the outbreak, 404 inspections were carried out by\npublic health authorities, and _L. monocytogenes_ was detected in 11\nsamples.

Animals can carry this bacterium without appearing ill, and\nthus, it can be found in foods made from animals. _L. monocytogenes_\nis unusual because it can grow at refrigerator temperatures where\nmost other foodborne bacteria do not. When eaten, it may cause\nlisteriosis, an illness to which pregnant women and their unborn\nchildren are very susceptible.\n'How could I get listeriosis?'\nBy eating ready-to-eat meats, poultry, seafood, and dairy products\nthat are contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_. You can also get\nlisteriosis by eating contaminated foods processed or packaged in\nunsanitary conditions or by eating vegetables that are contaminated\nfrom the soil or from manure used as fertilizer.\n'How could listeriosis affect me?'\nThe symptoms can take a few days or even weeks to appear and may\ninclude fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea or upset stomach,\nheadache, stiff neck, confusion, and loss of balance. In more serious\ncases, listeriosis could also lead to the mother's death.\nMost of the time, pregnant women who are infected with listeriosis\ndon't feel sick. However, they can pass the infection to their unborn\nbabies without even knowing it. That's why prevention of listeriosis\nis very important. In any case, if you experience any of the above\nsymptoms, see your doctor or health-care provider immediately.\nPregnant women are about 20 times more likely to get listeriosis than\nother healthy adults, and an estimated 1/3rd of all listeria cases\noccur in pregnant women.\n'How could listeriosis affect my baby?'\nDuring the 1st trimester of pregnancy, listeriosis may cause\nmiscarriage. As the pregnancy progresses to the 3rd trimester, the\nmother is more at risk. Listeriosis can also lead to premature labor,\nthe delivery of a low-birth-weight infant, or infant death. Fetuses\nwho suffer a late infection may develop a wide range of health\nproblems, including mental retardation, paralysis, seizures,\nblindness, or impairments of the brain, heart, or kidney. In\nnewborns, _L. monocytogenes_ can cause blood infections and meningitis.\n'Listeriosis and Pregnant Hispanic Women'\nStudies show that pregnant Hispanic women may have a higher incidence\nof listeriosis than pregnant non-Hispanic women. This is most likely\nbecause they might make and eat homemade soft cheese and other\ntraditional foods made from unpasteurized milk. 'Queso fresco'-- a\ntraditional homemade cheese, prepared from unpasteurized milk and\nwidely consumed by Hispanics -- has led to miscarriages, death of\nnewborns, and premature delivery caused by _L. monocytogenes_.\nTo prevent the risk of listeriosis, Hispanic pregnant women should\nnot eat homemade soft cheeses and other traditional foods made from\nunpasteurized milk. Like all other pregnant women, they should follow\nthe food safety precautions outlined below.\n'How can I prevent listeriosis?'\nThe good news is that listeriosis can be prevented! Here's how:\n- Your refrigerator should register at 40 F (4 C) or below and the\nfreezer at 0 F (-18 C). Place a refrigerator thermometer in the\nrefrigerator, and check the temperature periodically.

This is okay.\n- Refrigerate or freeze perishables, prepared food, and leftovers\nwithin 2 hours of eating or preparation. Follow the 2-Hour Rule:\nDiscard food that has been left out at room temperature for longer\nthan 2 hours. When temperatures are above 90 F (32 C), discard food\nafter one hour.\n- Use ready-to-eat, perishable foods, such as dairy, meat, poultry,\nseafood, and produce, as soon as possible.\nDon't eat:\n- Hot dogs and luncheon meats unless they're reheated until steaming hot.\n- Soft cheeses like Feta, Brie, and Camembert, 'blue-veined cheeses,'\nor 'queso blanco,' 'queso fresco,' or Panela unless they're made with\npasteurized milk; Make sure the label says, 'made with pasteurized milk'\n- refrigerated pates or meat spreads\n- refrigerated smoked seafood - unless it's in a cooked dish, such as\na casserole (Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout,\nwhitefish, cod, tuna, or mackerel is most often labeled as\n'nova-style,' 'lox,' 'kippered,' 'smoked,' or 'jerky.'

The\nproducts were regularly supplied to the Royal Adelaide Hospital, where one\nof the victims died, and were available from retail outlets and\nwholesalers.

The\nincreased reports on _Listeria_ isolates in Neuenberg were brought to the\nattention of the BAG on 25 May 2005 by the National Reference Center for\nListeria (CNRL, Lausanne).

All 10 of the CNRL investigated isolates had identical 1/2a\nserotypes.\nPatient questioning implicated a local soft cheese product made of\npasteurized milk. Through the advice of the canton chemist, the production\nof this cheese was stopped and distributed product was recovered and\ndestroyed. On 8 Jun 2005, several of the cheese samples tested positive for\n_L. monocytogenes_. CNRL also verified serotype 1/2a in these samples. In\nthe meantime, other listeria-contaminated milk products by the same\nmanufacturer were identified. The manufacturer may resume production when\nthe breaches in the production line are identified and rectified, so the\ncheese can be safely brought to market.\nTo more clearly identify the source of contamination, a molecular\nbiological analysis is currently under way on the clinical and cheese\nsamples.

All had eaten Tomme cheese (a raw milk white cheese) produced in\nthe canton.\nThe Neuenburg canton physician Daphne Berner confirmed the deaths through a\nreport on the local RTN radio. Both elderly people had died during the past 2\nweeks. The bacterial infection contributed to their deaths.\nBeforehand the public health officials reported on a cluster of _Listeria_\ncases occurring in May 2005, but without any mention of deaths. At present,\n10 patients have entered hospitals with listeriosis. Within the past week, 5\ncases have become known.\nCanton Neuenburg's Tomme soft cheese has been implicated as the cause. The\ninvestigators state in their report that those affected had eaten cheese of\nthis type produced by the firm. The canton chemist is conducting further\ninvestigations to identify the origin of the disease-causing bacteria.\n***Because of the severity of the incident, the Health Department declared\nthat the public should not consume Neuenberg Tomme cheese already purchased\nfrom the stores within the canton or at marketplaces. Suspect cheese should\nbe destroyed. At the same time the officials called on pregnant women to\nconsult their doctor should they have consumed Neuenburg Tomme over the past 3\nweeks and have a fever. Listeriosis can also be dangerous to those with a\nweakened immune system. The illness manifests itself with flu-like symptoms\nand can lead to an infection and even to meningitis.***\nThis occurrence harks back to the unpleasant memories of the _Listeria_\nepidemic in 1987 that occurred in French-speaking Switzerland. At that time\n31 people in Switzerland died after consuming contaminated Vacherin Mont d'Or\ncheese. At least half of the deaths were fetuses and newborns. As a\nconsequence, officials [banned] a dozen different cheese types, and a ton of\ncheese had to be destroyed.

Plants that don't comply could be shut down by\ninspectors, Murano said.\nUnder the regulations, companies will have flexibility in their\nprevention efforts. They are allowed to add germ-killing ingredients\nsuch as sodium lactate to the meat or to use a hot wash. Those that\ndo both can tout it on their product label. Those that do only one\nprocedure will face greater testing by government officials. Federal\ninspectors will continue to randomly test plants for _L.\nmonocytogenes_.\nThe bacterium is difficult to control because it may persist in\nready-to-eat meats after they are precooked at the plant. Consumers\ncan prevent sickness by cooking the meat.\nCompanies aren't allowed to use irradiation to kill germs on such\nmeats because the Food and Drug Administration has not approved it\nfor those products. The technology, which involves using gamma rays\nor electricity to sanitize meat, is allowed on ground beef.\nThe Agriculture Department has been working on the listeria rule\nsince 2001, when it first was proposed by the Clinton administration.\nConsumer groups have criticized the department for taking so long to\ncome up with the regulation, arguing that it could have sped up\nrecalls of products linked to a listeriosis outbreak last fall. The\noutbreak sickened 53 people, killed 8, and caused 3 miscarriages.\n[Deaths generally occur in immunocompromised hosts and fetuses. -\nMod.LL]\nMurano said it took months to finish the rule because the agency was\ncompleting studies that would determine the best way to prevent\nlisteria. Advocates complained that the new regulations don't\nspecify how often companies should test surfaces and products. They\nalso said the rule should require companies to warn pregnant women\nand people with weak immune systems to reheat products before eating\nthem.\n'We hope that this regulatory approach, coupled with the scientific\nstrategies employed by meat and poultry companies, will help us\nachieve our mutual goal: producing ready-to-eat meat and poultry\nproducts that consumers can enjoy with confidence,' said J. Patrick\nBoyle, president of the American Meat Institute.\nBecause it's an interim rule, the industry and public can comment on\nthe rule and the government can make changes over the next 18 months.\nHowever, it is slated to go into effect in September 2003.\n[Byline: Emily Gersema, Associated Press]\n---\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[As reflected by a number of significant outbreaks of _L.\nmonocytogenes_ in recent years and posted on ProMED-mail, listeriosis\nis clearly a major food-borne problem. The infection is most\nsignificant among pregnant women; miscarriages often occur due to\ninfection of the placenta and fetus. In the immune-deficient host,\nmeningitis and bacteremia occur.\nTreatment of precooked meats can diminish the risk of the\ntransmission of this Gram-positive bacillus. A variety of organic\nacids can be used as additives to inhibit the bacterium, as\ndemonstrated by the following 2 abstracts:\nMbandi E, Shelef LA: Enhanced antimicrobial effects of combination of\nlactate and diacetate on _Listeria monocytogenes_ and _Salmonella\nspp._ in beef bologna. Int J Food Microbiol 2002;76:191-8.\n'The antimicrobial activities of salts of organic acids such as\nlactate and acetate are well documented, but there is limited\ninformation on their effect when used in combination. We previously\nreported enhanced inhibition of _Listeria monocytogenes_ and\n_Salmonella enterica_ serovar Enteritidis in sterile comminuted beef\nat 5 and 10 degrees C by combinations of sodium lactate (SL) (2.5\npercent) and sodium diacetate (SDA) (0.2 percent). The present study\nwas undertaken to evaluate the inhibitory effect of these salts,\nalone and in combination, in ready-to-eat (RTE) meat. Single strains\nand 6-strain mixtures of each of the pathogens ( approximately 3 log\nCFU/g) were tested in beef bologna during aerobic storage at 5 and 10\ndegrees C for up to 60 days. The growth rate of the 6-strain mixture\nof _Listeria_ was faster than that of the single strain (Scott A) in\nthe lactate/diacetate-free product.\nWhile each of the salts delayed growth of the listeriae at 5 degrees\nC, the effect of their combination was listericidal for the single\nstrain and listeriostatic for the 6-strain mixture. Enhanced\ninhibition by the salt combination was also observed at 10 degrees C.\n_Salmonella_ numbers declined to undetectable levels in the untreated\nmeat product and in each of the treatments after 20-30 days. However,\nthe decline was more rapid in meat with the combination of the salts\nduring storage at both 5 and 10 degrees C.

But the\ninspector, Vincent Erthal, said inspection officials had failed to\ncrack down on some of the problems in part because of what he and\nother critics see as confusion and indecision in a new federal system\nfor regulating the nation's food companies.\nMr. Erthal said in interviews that the chief government inspector at\nthe Wampler Foods plant in Franconia, PA, USA, disagreed about the\nextent of the dangers and opposed his efforts to force a cleanup in\nthe fall of 2001, about 8 months before the outbreak, which also\nsickened 54 people in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,\nPennsylvania, and 5 other states. Mr. Erthal also said that as health\nauthorities issued the first alerts about the outbreak in late August\n2002, he and a supervisor recommended that top regional inspection\nofficials consider forcing the Wampler plant to close for repairs.\nBut, he said, little was done until 6 weeks later.\nSeveral Agriculture Department officials said sanitation problems,\nincluding mold and algae on the walls and condensation dripping from\nductwork over the processing tables, were chronic enough to justify\nclosing the plant. The department ordered the plant closed\ntemporarily on 13 Oct 2002 after the strain of _Listeria\nmonocytogenes_ that caused the deaths was found in the plant's\ndrains. Wampler, a part of Pilgrim's Pride, the nation's\nsecond-largest poultry company, also recalled 27 million pounds of\nmeat, one of the largest amounts in American history, and later\nreopened on 13 Nov 2002.\nThe Agriculture Department's Inspector General and Democrats in\nCongress are investigating why nothing more was done before listeria\nwas found in the drains. Both the government and Wampler officials\nsaid none of the meat returned under the recall had tested positive\nfor the same rare strain of _L. monocytogenes_ that caused the\noutbreak. They also said there was no proof that anyone had been\nsickened by Wampler's turkey deli meats and other ready-to-eat\nproducts.\nIdentical bacteria have been found in turkey processed by an\nunrelated company, J. L. Foods Co. Inc., in Camden, NJ, and health\nofficials say it remains unclear how most of the victims became ill.\nStill, food-safety experts say Mr. Erthal's complaints raise new\nquestions about the Agriculture Department's inspection and\nbacteria-testing program, which has come under scrutiny as a result\nof huge recalls of contaminated beef and poultry at some of the\nnation's largest processing companies since mid-July 2002. To safety\nadvocates, government auditors and some meat inspectors, the biggest\nfailures have come in how the department's Food Safety and Inspection\nService has implemented changes that grew out of a 1993 outbreak of\n_E. coli_ O157:H7 at the Jack-in-the-Box hamburger chain.\nBilled as revolutionary, the new approach was meant to be more\nscientific than the 'poke and sniff' methods that inspectors had used\nsince the turn-of-the-century days of Upton Sinclair's 'The Jungle.'\nBecause the worst hazards come from microscopic toxins, the idea was\nto place more responsibility on the companies for proper\nrefrigeration and handling and to require them to create plans to\nkill any germs. The program was phased in over several years, and\nsupporters credit it with helping to reduce the frequency of serious\nfood-borne illnesses from _E. coli_, _Salmonella_ and _L.\nmonocytogenes_, which caused the recent outbreak.\nBut surveys by the Agriculture Department's Inspector General and the\nGeneral Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, show\nthat many plants have been allowed to get by with inadequate safety\nplans.\nMr. Erthal, 40, who has been a meat inspector for 18 years, said the\nnew rules have 'a lot of gray areas.' He said inspectors were still\ntaught to step in quickly at any sign of direct contamination. But\nwhen it comes to broader sanitation problems, he and others said,\nmany inspectors are waiting longer to intervene out of a sense that\nit is now the company's role to deal with those issues unless there\nare repeated failures. Rodney Leonard, a former administrator of the\ninspection service, said the result is 'a clear `don't ask, don't\ntell' mandate' that is causing inspectors to miss 'red flags all over\nthe place.'\nRepresentative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and the\nranking minority member on the House Committee on Government Reform,\nsaid, 'I think what we're seeing is a picture of a department that\nhas abdicated its responsibility to protect the public in the area of\nfood safety.' Dr. Elsa Murano, the Agriculture Department's under\nsecretary for food safety, disputed the criticism, saying she\nexpected her inspectors to be as aggressive as ever.\nDepartment officials -- and Wampler executives -- said that if Mr.\nErthal, who was the night-shift inspector at Wampler from May 2000\nuntil last September 2002, when he received a requested transfer to a\ndaytime assignment at another plant, was so worried about the\nconditions, he should have taken harsher actions against the plant\nhimself or pushed harder to blow the whistle before the outbreak\noccurred.\nDr. Murano said the recall at Wampler was a prime motivation for a\nnew listeria testing directive that went into effect on Mon, 9 Dec\n2002. Under the plan, if companies that make ready-to-eat products\nlike hot dogs and deli meats do not voluntarily provide the\ngovernment with test results for even the most general, and least\nharmful, types of bacteria in their plants, then the department will\nexpand its own testing. The agency is also working on a new rule to\nrequire companies to test their processing areas for listeria, Dr.\nMurano said, so 'you can find it before it gets into the product.'\nFelicia Nestor, an official at the Government Accountability Project,\nan advocacy group that has been helping Mr. Erthal and other\nwhistle-blowers, said, 'The regulations focused on direct product\ncontamination, and it's only now that USDA is adding a focus on\nenvironmental testing, which is an acknowledgment that they have left\nconsumers without adequate protection up till now.' Dr. Murano said\nthat if the agency had known before the outbreak that Wampler's own\ntests had detected the more general types of listeria in the plant,\n'we would have acted.'\nRon Morris, the senior vice president for turkey operations at\nPilgrim's Pride, said the company had shared its listeria testing\nresults, both positive and negative, with the government by placing\nthem in a file drawer with other records available to the inspectors.\nBut department officials said the inspector in charge, Debra Martin,\nwho declined to comment, has denied knowing anything about the\ncompany's test results, and Mr. Erthal said he never saw the logs in\nthe drawer.\nStill, Mr. Erthal said that over time company employees told him\ninformally that the tests were finding general types of listeria in\nthe plant. Experts say that many listeria [species] can be harmless,\nbut their presence can also signal that conditions are ripe for _L.\nmonocytogenes_, the deadly type.\nMr. Erthal said that when Ms. Martin walked around with him in his\nfirst days at the plant, he pointed to the algae on the walls,\nflaking paint, and condensation on air-conditioning ducts. But, he\nsaid, Ms. Martin told him that under the new regulatory system, such\nhazards were not a high priority unless they threatened to\ncontaminate meat directly. Then, in the fall of 2001, Mr. Erthal\nsaid, Ms. Martin disagreed with his suggestion that the violations\nwarranted broader enforcement action.

But the\ninspector, Vincent Erthal, said inspection officials had failed to\ncrack down on some of the problems in part because of what he and\nother critics see as confusion and indecision in a new federal system\nfor regulating the nation's food companies. Still, food-safety experts say Mr. Erthal's complaints raise new\nquestions about the Agriculture Department's inspection and\nbacteria-testing program, which has come under scrutiny as a result\nof huge recalls of contaminated beef and poultry at some of the\nnation's largest processing companies since mid-July 2002. To safety\nadvocates, government auditors and some meat inspectors, the biggest\nfailures have come in how the department's Food Safety and Inspection\nService has implemented changes that grew out of a 1993 outbreak of\n_E. coli_ O157:H7 at the Jack-in-the-Box hamburger chain. But\nwhen it comes to broader sanitation problems, he and others said,\nmany inspectors are waiting longer to intervene out of a sense that\nit is now the company's role to deal with those issues unless there\nare repeated failures. Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and the\nranking minority member on the House Committee on Government Reform,\nsaid, 'I think what we're seeing is a picture of a department that\nhas abdicated its responsibility to protect the public in the area of\nfood safety.' Jan T. Behney, the district manager in Philadelphia, and John Sworen,\nthen the district's top enforcement officer, said that their aides\nreviewed the material within several working days and agreed that the\nviolations were documented well enough to support a notice.\n Under the plan, if companies that make ready-to-eat products\nlike hot dogs and deli meats do not voluntarily provide the\ngovernment with test results for even the most general, and least\nharmful, types of bacteria in their plants, then the department will\nexpand its own testing. The program was phased in over several years, and\nsupporters credit it with helping to reduce the frequency of serious\nfood-borne illnesses from _E. coli_, _Salmonella_ and _L.\nmonocytogenes_, which caused the recent outbreak.\n A Federal meat inspector said a Pennsylvania poultry plant, 1 of 2\noperations under investigation as a likely source of a listeria\noutbreak that has killed 8 people since July 2002, had persistent\nsanitation problems that could have fostered the bacteria. But department officials said the inspector in charge, Debra Martin,\nwho declined to comment, has denied knowing anything about the\ncompany's test results, and Mr. Erthal said he never saw the logs in\nthe drawer. Mr. Erthal also said that as health\nauthorities issued the first alerts about the outbreak in late August\n2002, he and a supervisor recommended that top regional inspection\nofficials consider forcing the Wampler plant to close for repairs. Several Agriculture Department officials said sanitation problems,\nincluding mold and algae on the walls and condensation dripping from\nductwork over the processing tables, were chronic enough to justify\nclosing the plant. The department ordered the plant closed\ntemporarily on 13 Oct 2002 after the strain of _Listeria\nmonocytogenes_ that caused the deaths was found in the plant's\ndrains. Both the government and Wampler officials\nsaid none of the meat returned under the recall had tested positive\nfor the same rare strain of _L. monocytogenes_ that caused the\noutbreak. Dr. Murano said\nthat if the agency had known before the outbreak that Wampler's own\ntests had detected the more general types of listeria in the plant,\n'we would have acted.' Rodney Leonard, a former administrator of the\ninspection service, said the result is 'a clear `don't ask, don't\ntell' mandate' that is causing inspectors to miss 'red flags all over\nthe place.'", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2002-11-13 00:00:00", "2040-03-26 00:00:00", "2002-09-27 00:00:00", "2002-08-28 00:00:00", "2002-12-26 00:00:00", "1993-03-26 00:00:00", "2002-03-26 00:00:00", "2002-07-26 00:00:00", "2000-05-26 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Philadelphia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Camden", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Connecticut", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the Emerald City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Franconia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Jersey", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2202664", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - USA (multistate) (06): correction", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2202664", "date": "2002-10-07 23:50:00", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - USA (MULTISTATE) (06): CORRECTION\n***********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail, a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\nDate: Mon, 7 Oct 2002 07:30:17 -0600 (CST)\nFrom: James Perdue <jperdue@DisCon.TDH.state.tx.us>\n\nRe previous post: >Forty people...have become sick, and 40 have died...from\nlisteria...<\n100 percent mortality from listeriosis...???... seems high...even for\nlisteriosis..\n--\nJames N.

The\ncompany pulled 295 000 pounds of turkey and chicken products Wednesday 9\nOct 2002, but expanded the recall over the weekend after tests came back\npositive for a strain of the potentially fatal bacteria, the company said\nSunday, 13 Oct 2002.\nThe nationwide recall covers meat processed at the company's plant in\nsuburban Franconia from 1 May through 11 Oct 2002. The recall covers deli\nmeat primarily sold under the company's Wampler Foods brand, though it is\nalso sold under brands including Block & Barrel, Bonos, Golden Acre,\nReliance, and a variety of private labels. The products include turkey and\npoultry sold freshly sliced or made into sandwiches at deli counters and in\nindividually sold packages of sliced deli meats.\nBecause consumers might not have access to the meat's original packaging,\nthe best way to know whether a product falls under the recall is to ask if\nit comes from a package that bears the plant number P-1351 inside the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture mark of inspection, said company spokesman Ray\nAtkinson. Production dates also can be found on that part of the\nlabel. The deli products were sold in retail groceries, in delicatessens\nand by food service distributors.\nConsumers were urged by the company to return any affected meat to the\nstore or deli where it was purchased for a full refund. The discovery\nfollowed an investigation of a listeria outbreak in 8 northeast states\nsince early summer that caused at least 120 illnesses and 20 deaths, the\nUSDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said. ``We want consumers to be\naware of the recall because of the potential for foodborne illness,'' said\nDr. Garry L. McKee, the inspection service's administrator.\nNo products have been linked to that outbreak, said David Van Hoose,\nWampler's chief executive officer. The genetic strain that caused the\noutbreak is different from the strain found at the plant, officials\nsaid. 'We don't have any scientific evidence at this point that there is a\nconnection, but our analysis of sampling in that plant is not complete,''\nsaid the USDA's Steven Cohen. He said the recall was the largest in U.S.\nhistory.\nCompany officials said the recall didn't include fresh turkeys, and that it\nshould have no effect on the holiday season.\nListeria can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea,\naccording to the USDA. It can be fatal in young children, the elderly and\npeople with weak immune systems and can cause miscarriages and\nstillbirths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site for\nlisteriosis recommends that left-over or ready-to-eat foods should be\ncooked until steaming hot before eating.\nThe company said it halted all production Saturday at the plant about 25\nmiles north of Philadelphia so that it could be thoroughly cleaned. The\nmeat being recalled makes up roughly 6 percent of the company's total\npoultry production, Van Hoose said. The company didn't say how much revenue\nit would lose as a result of the shutdown.\nThe largest previous meat recall in US history was in 1997, when Hudson\nFoods recalled 25 million pounds of ground beef after 15 people in Colorado\nfell ill from _E. coli_ after eating hamburger from its plant in Columbus,\nNeb.

Thus far, 46 ill persons infected with the\noutbreak strain of Listeria have been detected since mid-July; most were\nhospitalized, 7 have died, and 3 pregnant women have had miscarriages or\nstillbirths. Epidemiologic data indicate that precooked, sliceable turkey\ndeli meat is the cause of this outbreak.\nAs part of the outbreak investigation, the United Stated Department of\nAgriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) obtained\nfood and environmental samples from Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, located in\nFranconia, Pennsylvania. One food product and 25 environmental samples\ntested positive for Listeria. USDA-FSIS laboratories performed DNA\nfingerprinting on these bacteria. Comparison of different strains was\nconducted through PulseNet, which is a network of public health and\nregulatory laboratories that perform DNA fingerprinting of bacteria and\nelectronically share results. The food product had a strain of Listeria\ndifferent from the outbreak strain. Of the 25 environmental Listeria\nstrains fingerprinted, 1 matched that of the food product and 3 matched\nthat of patients in the current outbreak. On 13 October 2002, the plant\nvoluntarily shut down operations and issued a recall of approximately 27\nmillion pounds of fresh and frozen ready-to-eat turkey and chicken products\nproduced since May 1, 2002. Turkey meat products included in the recall\nshould not be eaten. Information on specific products and brands covered by\nthe recall is available at:\n<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/recalls/prelease/pr090-2002.htm>.\nListeriosis is a serious foodborne disease that can be life-threatening to\ncertain individuals, including the elderly or those with weakened immune\nsystems. It can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women.\nThe affected patients live in 8 states: Pennsylvania (14 cases), New York\n(11 cases in New York City, 7 in other locations), New Jersey (5 cases),\nDelaware (4 cases), Maryland (2 cases), Connecticut (1 case), Michigan (1\ncase), and Massachusetts (1 case). Twenty-eight patients were male and 18\nwere female. Fifteen patients were age 65 or above, 14 patients were age 1\nto 64 years and had an immunocompromising medical condition, 7 others were\npregnant, and 3 were neonates; 6 patients were age 1 to 64 years and were\nnot pregnant or known to have an immunocompromising condition. Of the 7\npatients who died, 6 had immunocompromising conditions (3 of these patients\nwere also age 65 or older), and one was a neonate. The most recent patient\nbecame ill on September 30.\nIn addition to the patients whose illnesses have been confirmed as part of\nthe outbreak, CDC and state and local health departments have learned about\nother cases of Listeria infection in the same region during the outbreak\ntime period. DNA fingerprinting has shown that strains from 64 patients in\nthese same states are different from the outbreak strain and 18 of these\npatients have died; these illnesses are part of the 'background' of\nsporadic Listeria infections and are likely due to a variety of different\nfoods. In addition, testing of strains from several additional persons is\nongoing, some of these may be identified as the outbreak strain. Because\npregnant women, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are\nat higher risk for listeriosis, we recommend the following measures for\nthose persons:\nDo not eat hot dogs and luncheon meats, unless they are reheated until\nsteaming hot.\nAvoid cross-contaminating other foods, utensils, and food preparation\nsurfaces with fluid from hot dog packages, and wash hands after handling\nhot dogs.\nDo not eat soft cheeses such as Feta, Brie and Camembert cheeses,\nblue-veined cheeses, and Mexican-style cheeses such as 'queso blanco\nfresco.' Cheeses that may be eaten include hard cheeses; semi-soft cheeses\nsuch as mozzarella; pasteurized processed cheeses such as slices and\nspreads; cream cheese; and cottage cheese.\nDo not eat refrigerated p\u00e2t\u00e9s or meat spreads. Canned or shelf-stable p\u00e2t\u00e9s\nand meat spreads may be eaten.\nDo not eat refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is contained in a cooked\ndish, such as a casserole. Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon,\ntrout, whitefish, cod, tuna or mackerel, is most often labeled as\n'nova-style,' 'lox,' 'kippered,' 'smoked,' or 'jerky.' The fish is found in\nthe refrigerator section or sold at deli counters of grocery stores and\ndelicatessens. Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood may be eaten.\nDo not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat foods that contain\nunpasteurized milk.\nAbout 2500 cases of listeriosis occur each year in the United States. The\ninitial symptoms are often fever, muscle aches, and sometimes\ngastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. The illness may be\nmild and ill persons sometimes describe their illness as flu-like. If\ninfection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache, stiff\nneck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. Most cases of\nlisteriosis and most deaths occur in adults with weakened immune systems,\nthe elderly, pregnant women, and newborns. However, infections can occur\noccasionally in otherwise healthy persons. Infections during pregnancy can\nlead to miscarriages, stillbirths, and infection of newborn infants.\nPrevious outbreaks of listeriosis have been linked to a variety of foods\nespecially processed meats (such as hot dogs, deli meats, and pat\u00e9) and\ndairy products made from unpasteurized milk.\nThe risk of an individual person developing Listeria infection after\nconsumption of a contaminated product is very small. If you have eaten a\ncontaminated product and do not have any symptoms, we do not recommend that\nyou have any tests or treatment, even if you are in a high risk group.\nHowever, if you are in a high risk group, have eaten the contaminated\nproduct, and within a month become ill with fever or signs of serious\nillness, you should contact your health care provider and inform him or her\nabout this exposure.\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nOffice of Communication\nDivision of Media Relations\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This is an excellent example of using environmental sampling to identify\npotential sources of contamination.

Because\npregnant women, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are\nat higher risk for listeriosis, we recommend the following measures for\nthose persons:\n Fifteen patients were age 65 or above, 14 patients were age 1\nto 64 years and had an immunocompromising medical condition, 7 others were\npregnant, and 3 were neonates; 6 patients were age 1 to 64 years and were\nnot pregnant or known to have an immunocompromising condition. The affected patients live in 8 states: Pennsylvania (14 cases), New York\n(11 cases in New York City, 7 in other locations), New Jersey (5 cases),\nDelaware (4 cases), Maryland (2 cases), Connecticut (1 case), Michigan (1\ncase), and Massachusetts (1 case). In addition to the patients whose illnesses have been confirmed as part of\nthe outbreak, CDC and state and local health departments have learned about\nother cases of Listeria infection in the same region during the outbreak\ntime period. Thus far, 46 ill persons infected with the\noutbreak strain of Listeria have been detected since mid-July; most were\nhospitalized, 7 have died, and 3 pregnant women have had miscarriages or\nstillbirths. On 13 October 2002, the plant\nvoluntarily shut down operations and issued a recall of approximately 27\nmillion pounds of fresh and frozen ready-to-eat turkey and chicken products\nproduced since May 1, 2002. However, if you are in a high risk group, have eaten the contaminated\nproduct, and within a month become ill with fever or signs of serious\nillness, you should contact your health care provider and inform him or her\nabout this exposure. As part of the outbreak investigation, the United Stated Department of\nAgriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) obtained\nfood and environmental samples from Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, located in\nFranconia, Pennsylvania. Comparison of different strains was\nconducted through PulseNet, which is a network of public health and\nregulatory laboratories that perform DNA fingerprinting of bacteria and\nelectronically share results. Of the 25 environmental Listeria\nstrains fingerprinted, 1 matched that of the food product and 3 matched\nthat of patients in the current outbreak. Cheeses that may be eaten include hard cheeses; semi-soft cheeses\nsuch as mozzarella; pasteurized processed cheeses such as slices and\nspreads; cream cheese; and cottage cheese. Previous outbreaks of listeriosis have been linked to a variety of foods\nespecially processed meats (such as hot dogs, deli meats, and pat\u00e9) and\ndairy products made from unpasteurized milk. Of the 7\npatients who died, 6 had immunocompromising conditions (3 of these patients\nwere also age 65 or older), and one was a neonate. Do not eat soft cheeses such as Feta, Brie and Camembert cheeses,\nblue-veined cheeses, and Mexican-style cheeses such as 'queso blanco\nfresco.' Most cases of\nlisteriosis and most deaths occur in adults with weakened immune systems,\nthe elderly, pregnant women, and newborns. Avoid cross-contaminating other foods, utensils, and food preparation\nsurfaces with fluid from hot dog packages, and wash hands after handling\nhot dogs. If you have eaten a\ncontaminated product and do not have any symptoms, we do not recommend that\nyou have any tests or treatment, even if you are in a high risk group.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2002-10-13 00:00:00", "2021-09-30 00:00:00", "2002-05-01 00:00:00", "2002-10-15 00:00:00", "2002-03-26 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Jersey", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Massachusetts", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Delaware", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Michigan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States Department", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maryland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Listeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Connecticut", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Turkey", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Franconia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2202673", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Listeriosis - USA (multistate) (07)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2202673", "date": "2002-10-08 23:50:00", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - USA (MULTISTATE) (07)\n***********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail, a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\nDate: 8 Oct 2002\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Press Release [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r021008.htm>\n\nUpdate: Listeriosis Outbreak Investigation\n-------------------------------------------\nCDC and several state health departments are investigating an outbreak of\nlisteriosis, primarily affecting persons in the northeastern U.S. Thus far,\n43 ill persons with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have\nbeen detected; all were hospitalized, 7 died, and 3 pregnant women had\nmiscarriages or stillbirths. These patients live in 7 states: Pennsylvania\n(14 cases), New York (11 cases in New York City, 6 in other locations), New\nJersey (4 cases), Delaware (4 cases), Maryland (2 cases), Connecticut (1\ncase), and Michigan (1 case).\nAnalysis of data collected to date indicate that the leading suspect food in\nthis outbreak is sliced turkey deli[catessen] meat. Federal, state, and\nlocal health and officials are continuing to investigate to determine the\nbrand(s) and origin of the product involved.\nListeriosis is a very serious foodborne disease that can be life-threatening\nto certain individuals, including the elderly or those with weakened immune\nsystems. It can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women,\nso we need to continue to remind persons at high risk to thoroughly heat\ndeli meats before eating them. Persons in these risk groups who reside in\nthe affected states may reduce their risk of infection by not eating sliced\nturkey deli meats or by thoroughly heating them. This is consistent with\nstandard recommendations for persons at high risk:\n* Avoid foods from deli counters or thoroughly heat deli meat products\nbefore eating.\n* Heat hot dogs until steaming before eating.\n* Avoid cross-contaminating other foods, utensils, and food preparation\nsurfaces with fluid from hot dog packages, and wash hands after handling hot\ndogs.\n* Avoid soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, Camembert, blue-veined, and\nMexican-style cheese. (Hard cheeses, processed cheeses, cream cheese,\ncottage cheese, and yogurt need not be avoided).\nThe following additional food safety measures, which should be routine for\nall persons, can also reduce the risk of listeriosis:\n* Thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources, such as beef, pork, or\npoultry.\n* Wash raw vegetables thoroughly before eating.\n* Keep uncooked meats separate from vegetables and from cooked foods.\n* Avoid raw (unpasteurized) milk or foods made from raw milk.\n* Wash hands, knives, and cutting boards after handling uncooked foods.\nIn addition to the 40 patients whose illnesses have been confirmed as part\nof the outbreak, CDC and State Health Departments have learned about other\ncases of Listeria infection in the same region. DNA subtyping has shown that\nstrains from over 30 patients in these same states are different from the\noutbreak strain; these illnesses are part of the 'background' of sporadic\nListeria infections and are likely due to a variety of different foods.\nAbout 2500 cases of listeriosis occur each year in the United States. The\ninitial symptoms are often fever, muscle aches, and sometimes\ngastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. The illness may be\nmild, and ill persons sometimes describe their illness as flu-like. If\ninfection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache, stiff\nneck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur.

Zimmerman Jr. today announced that his\ndepartment and the Philadelphia Department of Health are conducting an\ninvestigation into cases of _Listeria monocytogenes_ that have occurred in\nJuly and August 2002 in the western and southeastern parts of the\nCommonwealth. The infection occurs when people eat contaminated food\nproducts.\n\nTo date, a total of 20 cases have been reported throughout Pennsylvania (7\nin Philadelphia residents); 2 of the 20 people have died.\n\n'While Listeria can be dangerous for some, most people who are exposed will\nexperience minor, if any, symptoms,' Secretary Zimmerman said. 'Taking\nsimple, common-sense approaches to food handling and preparation can prevent\nthe spread of the bacteria. These include washing and cooking food\nthoroughly; keeping uncooked food separate from cooked foods; and washing\nhands, knives, and other food preparation items.'\n\nAn epidemiological and laboratory investigation into these cases is ongoing.\nAt this time, no specific food product has been identified as a cause for\nthe infections. Laboratory specimens from cases are being collected and\nforwarded to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for further\ntesting.\n\nListeria is an infrequent cause of illness and death in the very young and\nthe very old. It is most frequently contracted through eating contaminated\nfood products. Pregnant women in particular can become infected and spread\nthe infection to their newborns, who then experience severe symptoms such as\nmeningitis.\n\nListeria bacteria are found in soil and water. Vegetables can become\ncontaminated from the soil or from manure used as fertilizer. Listeria has\nbeen found in a variety of raw foods, such as uncooked meats and vegetables,\nas well as in processed foods that become contaminated after processing,\nsuch as soft cheeses and cold cuts at the deli counter. Unpasteurized (raw)\nmilk or foods made from unpasteurized milk also may contain the bacterium.\n\nNationally, an estimated 2500 people become seriously ill with Listeria each\nyear. In Pennsylvania, fewer than 2 dozen cases are reported in most years.\nHowever, Listeria infection only became a reportable disease statewide this\nyear [2002]. Now that reporting is mandatory, those numbers may increase in\nfuture years.\n\nInvestigation of Listeria infection can be difficult because symptoms can\nsurface anywhere from a few days to more than 2 months after a person eats\ncontaminated food. Fortunately, most people who eat foods containing\nListeria bacteria do not become ill.\n\nPeople who develop Listeria infection may experience a range of symptoms\nincluding fever, muscle aches and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea\nor diarrhea. If infection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as\nheadache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance or convulsions can occur.\n\nPregnant women are at increased risk for Listeria infection compared to\nother healthy adults. About one-third of Listeria cases happen during\npregnancy. Infected pregnant women may experience only a mild, flu-like\nillness; however, infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery,\ninfection of the newborn, or even stillbirth. There is no routine screening\ntest for susceptibility to [infection with?] Listeria during pregnancy.\n\n--\nJerry Zuckerman, MD\nHospital Epidemiologist\nAlbert Einstein Medical Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\n<zuckermj@einstein.edu>\n\n*****\n[2]\nDate: Sat, 31 Aug 2002 12:30:31 +0100\nFrom: 'Pablo Nart' <p.nart@virgin.net>\nSource: KYW news radio 1060, 31st August 2002 [edited]\n<http://www.kyw1060.com/news_story_detail.cfm?newsitemid=23558>\n\n\nPhiladelphia health officials are warning about an outbreak in Pennsylvania\nof a food-borne illness that has already claimed two lives.\n\nOfficials say in the past 2 months 22 cases of the bacterium Listeria have\noccurred throughout the state, including 7 in Philadelphia; 2 of the 22\ndied, though neither fatality was in the city.

Hyde <Jlhdvm@aol.com>\n\nIn ProMED Digest Tue 17 Sep 2002 Volume 2002: Number 257,\nListeriosis - USA (Multistate) (02) (posting 20020917.5334),the\nfollowing statement appears as one of the recommendations [from the\nFDA news release - Mod.LL] under 'People at risk for listeriosis and\ntheir family members or individuals preparing food for them should\ntake the following precautions:\n'Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat foods that contain\nunpasteurized milk.'\nThis implies that pasteurization inactivates _Listeria monocytogenes_.\nWhile it is true that many organisms are killed during regular\npasteurization, not all are. Pasteurization inactivates tubercle\nbacilli and was [originally - Mod.LL] the major reason for using it\nto process milk. It does not result in sterile milk. An unopened\ncontainer of regular pasteurized milk placed in the refrigerator for\nabout 5-7 days will show this.\nPerhaps some are mistaking regular pasteurization with 'Ultra high\ntemperature (UHT) Processing Method' which, when properly done,\nresults in sterile milk which can be kept at room temperatures for\nweeks and even months.\nWith the increased numbers of individuals with compromised immune\nsystems, it would seem prudent that all liquid milk for human\nconsumption be required by Public Heath Law to be 'Ultra High\nTemperature (UHT) Processed'.\nBergey's Manual addresses strains of Listeria that survive regular\npasteurization or high temperature-short time (HTST) processing.\n--\nJohn L. Hyde, DVM, MS\nUSDA/ ARS/ 'Retired'\nIthaca NY\n<Jlhdvm@aol.com>\n[ProMED-mail agrees with Dr. Hyde that pasteurization is not\nequivalent to sterilization. Certainly, raw or inadequately\npasteurized milk can be a vehicle for a variety of pathogens\nincluding species of salmonella, listeria, brucella, and yersinia as\nwell as _E. coli_ (1). It is also the case that _L. monocytogenes_\nis considered to be more heat-resistant than many other bacterial\npathogens. However, it appears that the pasteurization process is\nadequate to kill _L. monocytogenes_ (2). This reference from the CDC\nsummarizes the information is this regard and is reprinted below.\nHowever, even if a large inoculum were present and some organisms\nsurvived the process, pasteurized milk and cream products are\nrefrigerated and have a short shelf life, so that any\ncold-temperature replication (which can occur with this pathogen) is\nnot likely to produce an adequate inoculum.\nBe that as it may, Fleming, et al. (citation 6 in the CDC reference)\ndid report an outbreak of listeriosis in Massachusetts in 1983 for\nwhich, despite no evidence of improper pasteurization in the plant,\npasteurized milk was implicated epidemiologically (no pasteurized\nmilk cultures were positive) as the source, albeit a 'distinctly\nuncommon one.' Despite the rarity of cases of human listeriosis\nlinked to pasteurized milk, researchers in Spain (3) and Turkey (4)\nhave reported pasteurized milk samples from which Listeria was\nisolated.\nOne cannot argue with Dr. Hyde's suggestion that all milk for human\nconsumption should be ultrapasteurized. It may be even more prudent\nfor the recommendation to be made that for individuals at substantial\nrisk for morbidity and mortality from this infection, such as the\ncellularly immunocompromised person (i.e., organ transplant\nrecipients, those receiving chemotherapy or corticosteroids) or the\npregnant woman consume only ultrapasteurized milk products.\n1.

Other reports suggesting that _L.\nmonocytogenes_ is relatively resistant to heat have raised concern\nabout the effectiveness of pasteurization for eliminating this\norganism from milk (1, 5).\nIn an outbreak of listeriosis that occurred in Massachusetts in 1983,\npasteurized whole or 2 percent milk was implicated as the source of\ninfection (6). An inspection of the milk-producing plant detected no\napparent breach in the pasteurization process, thereby prompting\nfurther interest in the effectiveness of pasteurization. Since then,\nseveral studies have shown that _L. monocytogenes_ is inactivated by\nstandard pasteurization practices (4, 7-10). This report summarizes\ninformation regarding the effectiveness of pasteurization in\neliminating _L. monocytogenes_ from milk.\nCurrent state and local regulations throughout the United States\nspecify time and temperature conditions for pasteurization. These\nregulations call for milk to be heated to at least 71.7 C for 15\nseconds (i.e., high-temperature short-time (HTST) process) or to 62.8\nC for 30 minutes (11). In one study using milk artificially\ninoculated with _L. monocytogenes_, investigators found that 0.9\nseconds at 71.7 C is needed for each one log10 reduction in the\nnumber of _L. monocytogenes_ organisms (7). Other studies of\nartificially inoculated milk have concluded that at the same\ntemperature, a period of 2.75 to 3.1 seconds is needed for each log10\nreduction (4). Since the concentration of _L. monocytogenes_ likely\nto be present in contaminated raw milk is estimated to be\napproximately 10 organisms per mL, these data suggest that there is a\nsubstantial margin of safety in the HTST pasteurization process (4).\nAnother study found that at 62 C, each log10 reduction in the number\nof surviving _L. monocytogenes_ organisms could be achieved in 6 to\n20 seconds, well within the 30 minutes required for pasteurization at\nthis temperature (8). Other investigators also have concluded that\n_L. monocytogenes_ will not survive the normal milk pasteurization\nprocess (9) and have questioned previously reported methods that\nsuggested _L. monocytogenes_ could survive pasteurization (8,9).\nIn a pasteurization study designed to simulate the natural situation\nmore closely, milk from cows that had been purposefully infected with\n_L. monocytogenes_ was used, along with several different _L.\nmonocytogenes_ isolation procedures (12). Viable _L. monocytogenes_\ncould be recovered after minimum HTST treatment (71.7 C for 15\nseconds), although not after treatment at 76.4 C-77.8 C for 15\nseconds. This survival was attributed in part to protection of _L.\nmonocytogenes_ within leukocytes in milk (intracellular _L.\nmonocytogenes_ organisms are found in milk from infected cows but not\nin artificially inoculated milk). Because this milk had L.\nmonocytogenes concentrations of 103 to 104 per mL, higher\nconcentrations than are usually found when _L. monocytogenes_ is\npresent in raw milk, these findings may not be applicable to usual\nproduction conditions. In another study in which investigators\nidentified cows that had been naturally infected with _L.\nmonocytogenes_ (10), proper pasteurization was found to inactivate\n_L. monocytogenes_ in milk contaminated through natural infection as\nwell as in artificially inoculated milk.\nAfter reviewing these studies, a World Health Organization Working\nGroup on foodborne listeriosis recently concluded that\n'pasteurization is a safe process which reduces the number of _L.\nmonocytogenes_ occurring in raw milk to levels that do not pose an\nappreciable risk to human health' (4).\nReported by: Milk Safety Br, Div of Cooperative Programs, Center for\nFood Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration.\nMeningitis and Special Pathogens Br, Div of Bacterial Diseases,\nCenter for Infectious Diseases, CDC.\nEditorial Note: Improperly performed pasteurization and the\noccurrence of contamination after pasteurization are the most likely\nexplanations for the presence of _L. monocytogenes_ in pasteurized\nmilk. In a survey conducted during 1987 and 1988 as part of the Food\nand Drug Administration's (FDA's) Dairy Product Safety Initiatives, 2\npercent of pasteurized milk samples from more than 700 U.S.\nmilk-producing plants were culture-positive for Listeria species,\nprimarily _L. monocytogenes_, (13). Even when pasteurized milk is\nproven to be contaminated by bacteria, the exact source and mode of\ncontamination may be difficult to identify. For example, in a recent\nlarge epidemic of salmonellosis in Illinois, the epidemic strain of\n_Salmonella typhimurium_ was isolated from patients and the\nimplicated pasteurized milk products they had drunk (14). However, an\ninspection of the plant by a task force of FDA officials and other\nexperts could not prove how the milk was contaminated. Efforts to\nensure that milk is safe from _L. monocytogenes_ contamination should\nfocus on promoting proper methods of pasteurization and on\nidentifying and eliminating sources of postpasteurization\ncontamination.\n1.

However, even if a large inoculum were present and some organisms\nsurvived the process, pasteurized milk and cream products are\nrefrigerated and have a short shelf life, so that any\ncold-temperature replication (which can occur with this pathogen) is\nnot likely to produce an adequate inoculum.\n It may be even more prudent\nfor the recommendation to be made that for individuals at substantial\nrisk for morbidity and mortality from this infection, such as the\ncellularly immunocompromised person (i.e., organ transplant\nrecipients, those receiving chemotherapy or corticosteroids) or the\npregnant woman consume only ultrapasteurized milk products.

Perhaps some are mistaking regular pasteurization with 'Ultra high\ntemperature (UHT) Processing Method' which, when properly done,\nresults in sterile milk which can be kept at room temperatures for\nweeks and even months. Certainly, raw or inadequately\npasteurized milk can be a vehicle for a variety of pathogens\nincluding species of salmonella, listeria, brucella, and yersinia as\nwell as _E. coli_ (1).

The action raises to four the number of companies recalling their\nmeat out of concern for _Listeria_ over the past month. In one case\ninvolving meat produced by Bil Mar Foods, a division of Sara Lee Corp, at\nleast 11 people died and three women had miscarriages, according to the\nCentres for Disease Control. Agriculture Department officials said there\nwas no evidence to link the cases. No illnesses have been reported in\nconnection with the new recalls, officials said.\nOn Friday, Thorn Apple Valley Inc. recalled hot dogs and luncheon kits\nproduced over six months at its Forrest City, Ark., plant after government\ntests discovered _Listeria_ bacteria in meat produced by the Southfield,\nMich.-based company. Recalled products include 'EST 13529' and 'EST\nP-13529' on the packaging. Thorn Apple Valley is recalling products\nproduced from July 6 through Dec. 30 that were sold nationwide by a variety\nof companies and packaged under different names, including Kroger and\nSafeway grocery stores. The products were also sold to companies in South\nKorea and in Russia, the department said. Agriculture Department and\ncompany officials said they did not know the quantity of meat that was\nbeing recalled in the case, but some said that due to the broad range of\nproduction dates, the amount was sure to be big.\n>From July to December, the Agriculture Department said tests found\n_Listeria_ in five out of 20 ready-to-eat product samples it collected.\n'Based on these repetitive findings, as well as conditions found in the\nplant, the agency concluded that there may be a significant public health\nrisk associated with the product being recalled,' the department said in a\nstatement. The Agriculture Department withdrew its meat inspectors from the\nForrest City plant on Dec. 31, effectively shutting it down after the\ncompany did not comply with 'sanitation requirements,' the USDA said. The\nplant remains closed.\nIn the second case announced Friday, Bosell Foods, Inc., of Cleveland\nrecalled 350 pounds -- a tiny amount by meat production standards -- of\nsliced ham. The meat was only distributed in the Cleveland area, the USDA\nsaid. Involved in the recall are half-pound packages of the 'Dinner Bell'\nVirginia Brand Cooked Ham, Water Added, with sell-by code 2-18-1999.\nPackages are marked with EST 2587 in the USDA seal.\nA week ago, Oscar Mayer Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos. , voluntarily\nrecalled two types of luncheon meat after an elderly man in Kansas City,\nMo., became sick after eating the company's deli meat. Agriculture\nDepartment tests discovered _Listeria_ bacteria in samples of the meat. Bil\nMar's voluntary nationwide recall began a month ago and company officials\nsaid they expected to retrieve approximately 15 million pounds of meat. The\ncompany Wednesday took out full-page advertisements in 60 U.S. newspapers\nto apologize to customers...\nConsumers with questions can call the Agriculture Department's Meat and\nPoultry hotline, 800-535-4555, Thorn Apple Valley, 800-316-2855, or Bosell\nFoods, Inc., 216-911-7600.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n......................................es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

CHACKRABORTY\nABSTRACT\nHumans are frequently exposed to _Listeria monocytogenes_, and high numbers\nmay be ingested during consumption of certain types of food. However,\nepidemiological investigations show that listeriosis is a rare disease.\nRisk assessment studies using an animal mouse model indicate that almost all\n_L. monocytogenes_ serovars present in food have clear virulent properties.\nThe intravenous dose causing infection in 50% (IV ID50) of mice not\npreviously exposed to _L. monocytogenes_ (non protected mice) was 1.8 log10\nunits. For mice previously exposed to _L. monocytogenes_ (immunologically\nprotected mice), the IV ID50 was 5.6 log10 units. The ID50 of orally exposed\nnon protected mice amounted to 6.5 log10 units. And no significant effects of\ntype of food (water/milk) and storage time at 5C (milk) were observed. The\noral ID50 of immunologically protected mice was >9.0 log10 units.\nFurthermore, there was approximately 1-2 log10 difference between the ID50\nand the lethal dose causing death in 50% (LD50).\nThe results show that both the intestinal barrier and the specific immune\ndefense mechanism are highly effective in preventing infection of mice\norally exposed to _L. monocytogenes_. Delaying the immune defense had no\neffect on the protective activity of the intestinal barrier, indicating that\nthese protective mechanisms operate independently. The risk assessment\nresults obtained in the mouse model support the epidemiological finding that\nlisteriosis is a rare disease in humans, despite frequent exposure to the\norganism.\n--\nDr. Michael Meredith, M.A., B.Sc., B.Vet.Med., Ph.D., MRCVS\nPig Disease Information Centre Ltd.\nM.D.'s Electronic mail: meredith@farmline.com\ne-mail: pdic@btinternet.com\n[This interesting paper goes part of the way to describe why this disease is\nessentially seen only in children, the elderly, and pregnant women. - Mod.MHJ]\n......................................mhj/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The prime suspects are hot dogs and cold cuts, the federal Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Thursday. Neither the CDC nor\nofficials at the Agriculture Department, in charge of meat safety, would\nconfirm which brands or manufacturer were under suspicion in the continuing\ninvestigation. But the CDC said people at the greatest risk from food\npoisoning -- pregnant women, the elderly and people with weak immune\nsystems -- should take precautions. 'If they want to reduce their risk,\nthey should avoid those foods or thoroughly reheat their cold cuts before\neating them,' CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said.\nBil Mar Foods in Zeeland, Mich., a division of Sara Lee, is cooperating\nwith government investigators, but at this time cannot say if a number of\nbrands of meat products packaged there are the source of the _Listeria_,\nsaid Sara Lee spokesman Jeffrey Smith. 'We would need to know that there is\na connection between the sources of _Listeria_ and this product' before\ndeciding whether to recall any foods, Smith said. 'The safety of our\nconsumers is of the utmost importance to us and ... as more information\nbecomes available, we'll provide it.' Genetic fingerprinting of the\nbacterium helped health officials link the cases, and they suspect hot dogs\nand cold cuts because those are foods the patients have in common.\nThe CDC expects laboratory test results from products within two days that\ncould determine the brands involved, Skinner said. Agriculture officials\nthen would determine if any recalls are required. He said that while the\nlast known patient became ill in late November, 'if there still is\ncontaminated product out there, we might see more cases.' _Listeria_ is a\nbacterium that healthy people often fight off with no more than flu-like\nsymptoms. But it also can kill through meningitis or blood infection. It's\nespecially dangerous during pregnancy, when bacteria passed to the fetus\ncan cause miscarriage or stillbirth even if the mother has no symptoms.\nCases are under investigation in Ohio, New York, Tennessee, Massachusetts,\nMichigan, West Virginia, Connecticut, Oregon and Vermont.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n......................................es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Seven of these 8 patients presented with infection of the central\nnervous system and 1 with bacteremia; 5 patients had underlying medical\nconditions or were being treated with immunosuppressants, and so were at\nrisk for listeriosis. One of these 5 patients has died. Five of the 8 cases\nwere from 2 departments (Moselle and Bas-Rhin) in eastern France, and the\nothers are in 3 different departments [see map of cases on the\nEurosurveillance Weekly website - Mod.MPP].\nThe coordinating committee for listeria investigations was mobilized to\ncoordinate investigations, which included the obtaining of food histories\nof cases, the analysis of the supply channels of products on sale in shops\nwhere the patients had bought food in order to identify common suppliers,\nsampling of foods from these shops and from the patients' refrigerators,\nand screening for the epidemic clone among strains isolated from food\nproducts in France since January 2002. German health authorities have been\ninformed and asked to identify any cases that could possibly be linked to\nthis outbreak close to the German border.\nThe main vehicle for transmission has been identified as spreadable\nsausage, a ready-to-eat food prepared from raw pork and fat. Among its\ncollection of strains isolated from foods and food plants, the National\nReference Center identified a strain with the same characteristics as the\noutbreak strain. This strain had been isolated from an unopened package of\nspreadable sausage produced by a manufacturer in eastern France. Of the 7\npatients for whom this information was available, 5 reported having eaten\nthis type of product.\nOn 2 Jul 2002, the manufacturer recalled this spreadable sausage product.\nOn 3 Jul 2002, all pork products from this manufacturer were withdrawn from\nthe market. These products include different meat products sold under the\nbrand names Stoeffler, Dulano, and Claude Leger, and specific supermarket\nchain brands. All these products bear the establishment number 67-348-02.\nOn the same day, a notification was sent to all member states of the\nEuropean Union through the Rapid Alert System For Food (RASFF). Analysis of\nexport distribution channels for the products is continuing.\nConsumers have been advised to throw away the affected products, or return\nthem to the point of purchase. Since the risk of developing listeria\ninfection after eating a contaminated product is very low, people who have\neaten the implicated product have been informed that they do not need any\nspecial medical evaluation or treatment, even if they are in high risk\ngroups.

Seven of these 8 patients presented with infection of the central\nnervous system and 1 with bacteremia; 5 patients had underlying medical\nconditions or were being treated with immunosuppressants, and so were at\nrisk for listeriosis. Among its\ncollection of strains isolated from foods and food plants, the National\nReference Center identified a strain with the same characteristics as the\noutbreak strain. The first 2 strains were isolated in week 22 (27 May-2 June), 2 more were\nisolated in week 23 (3-9 June), and 4 were isolated in week 24 (10-16\nJune).
