Further progress in the\ndevelopment of a reliable diagnostic test was simultaneously announced by\nthe same team.\nUsing a special cell line, the Hong Kong scientists isolated the virus from\nthe lung tissue of a patient who developed pneumonia following contact with\na professor from Guangdong Province in southern China. Both the professor\nand the contact have died. Isolation of the virus now lays the solid\nfoundation for very rapid development of a diagnostic test.\nThe Hong Kong scientists have devised a basic test, relying on the\ntechnique of neutralizing antibodies. In today\u0092s experiments, designed to\ndetermine the accuracy of the test, scientists found that it was able to\ndetect tell-tale antibodies in sera taken from 8 SARS patients. The\nconsistency of these findings indicates that the test is reliably\nidentifying cases of SARS infection.\nThis 'hand-made' test will now be further developed into a more\nsophisticated diagnostic test. A rapid and reliable diagnostic test for\nSARS is needed urgently to assist the many clinicians who need a tool for\nrapid confirmation of genuine cases. Such a test can also help reassure the\nmany 'worried well' who are flooding health facilities as international\nconcern about this disease and its rapid spread to new areas continues to\nincrease. Many common and usually self-healing illnesses mimic the symptoms\nof SARS in its early stage.\nWith the virus now isolated, scientists in Hong Kong and elsewhere can move\nforward quickly to characterize the agent, determine its relationship with\nknown viruses, and establish a definitive identity. Results will be shared\namong 11 leading laboratories in a network set up on Mon 17 Mar 2003 by WHO.\nThe virus responsible for SARS is considered by some research groups to be\na member of the well-known Paramyxoviridae family. Yesterday, Canadian\nresearchers released findings suggesting that the metapneumovirus, which\nbelongs to this family, may be the cause. The metapneumovirus was first\ndiscovered by Dutch scientists in June 2001 at a laboratory that is also\nincluded in the new WHO network. At the time of its discovery, the virus\nwas known to cause respiratory disease in humans, including some cases of\npneumonia, but showed a different transmission pattern and was much less\nsevere than the SARS agent. At this point, it cannot be ruled out that an\nentirely different virus from another family may be responsible for the\nSARS outbreak.\nWHO cautions that the race to identify the SARS causative agent is by no\nmeans over. Although the virus has now been isolated, its identity remains\nelusive. Other research groups in the network of collaborating labs are\nproducing hints that the causative agent may belong to another virus family.\nSARS is an emerging disease, first recognized in Asia in mid-February 2003,\nthat has made over 380 people ill on 3 continents and caused severe\npneumonia in a large proportion of patients. A cumulative list of affected\ncountries and numbers of cases and deaths is released each day on the WHO\nwebsite. Today\u0092s data indicate that slightly more than half of currently\nreported cases have occurred in health care workers and medical students.\nThe remaining cases are in family members and other persons in close\ncontact with patients.\nA WHO team of 5 experts is now en route to China to investigate the\npossibility that an outbreak of a disease having similar symptoms and\naffecting similar groups \u00ad- health care workers and close contacts of\npatients -\u00ad may be linked to the current SARS outbreak.\nAs of today, Hong Kong remains the most seriously affected area.\nAuthorities there have reported a total of 222 cases in health care\nworkers, medical students, and family members and hospital visitors who\nhave been in close contact with patients. Of these, 217 have developed\nsymptoms of pneumonia, and many are in serious condition.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[We join in praising the international collaboration whose work has led to\nsuch rapid promising results.

(The count for residents has gone down from\nearlier postings due to a record review and application of the case\ndefinition).\n11 residents remain symptomatic and isolated, 1 is hospitalized and isolated.\n2 staff members remain with symptoms and 4 are excluded from work.\nClinical Spectrum:\n--------------\nStaff: Among 49 affected staff, symptoms have been mild (coryza, cough), and\nthere have been no cases of pneumonia, hospitalization, or death.\nResidents: Among affected residents, mild symptoms have been the general rule\n(fever 20 percent, cough 62 percent, rhinitis 60 percent). However,\npneumonia has occurred in 10 residents connected with the outbreak, with 9\nhospitalizations in which pneumonia contributed along with other underlying\nillness.\n11 deaths have been recorded in the facility over the past 7.5 weeks\n(baseline mortality at the facility runs approximately 4 per month). In 6\ncases, pneumonia was present at death (though often with other factors),\nthere were 2 vascular deaths and 3 deaths occurred in residents under\npalliative conditions who had been in decline from prior to the onset of the\noutbreak.\nA clinical-pathological review is under way of all pneumonia cases,\nhospitalizations, and deaths. Early reports from the team have indicated\nthat:\n- radiographic picture of pneumonia has most often been lobar\n- diffuse atypical pneumonia patterns are not yet reported from the review\nand ARDS has not been observed\n- pathology from one patient deceased with a positive [SARS] PCR (cause of\ndeath was vascular) revealed no ARDS, hyaline membrane formation etc.\nMore to follow on these reviews.\nMicrobiology:\n-----------\nA broad array of testing for typical bacteria, atypicals (Mycoplasma, _C.\npneumoniae_, psittacosis, legionella) and conventional viral etiologies\n(influenza, parainfluenza 1-4, RSV, adenovirus, enterovirus, etc.) have\nbeen negative.\n4 patients tested positive at the National Medical Laboratory (NML) for\nhuman metapneumovirus.\nSARS Co-V testing:\n----------------\nRT-PCR was reactive on an initial 9/19 patients for whom specimens were\nevaluated. This testing involved several primer sets and was conducted in\n2 separate laboratories at the NML.\nSerological testing on 4/7 initially tested patients was reactive at the NML.\nOne patient was positive both by PCR and serology.\nPreliminary sequencing work at NML of a total of 750 bp yields close match\nto SARS Co-V. About 98 percent of the genome of this agent remains\nunexplored -- a mutation or deletion in any part of which might account for\nthe observed clinical picture.\nMany more specimens have been collected and are currently being processed.\nFurther PCR, serological and sequencing work is under way at the BC Centre\nfor Disease Control, Canadian National Medical Laboratory and the British\nColumbia Cancer Agency's Michael Smith Genome Science Centre to confirm and\nclarify these findings. In addition, aliquots of sera have also been\nforwarded to CDC Atlanta for independent evaluation.\nSynthesis:\n-------\nThe identification of an agent testing positive for SARS Co-V in this\nsetting of generally mild disease may seem surprising, but is the result of\ndeliberate efforts to look for re-emergent SARS Co-V or related agents.\nPossibilities at present:\n--------------------\n1) This could be SARS Co-V exhibiting a milder clinical spectrum than\npreviously described. This might be conceivable given the earlier focus on\nsevere respiratory disease in case definitions used globally.\n2) This could be an attenuated SARS Co-V with an important deletion or\nmutation accounting for a different clinical picture\n3) This might still be a closely related agent now detectable by newly\ninvented tests.\n(Laboratory artifact seems unlikely given a convergence of findings using\nvarious technologies in different locations).\nOf note, the existing descriptions of disease causes by other human\ncoronaviruses (e.g., OC 43) include the spectrum from common cold to\npneumonia.\nPresent Actions:\n--------------\nFraser Health Authority and BCCDC are employing SARS-type precautions\naround symptomatic people and their contacts, strictly limiting visits to\nthe facility, restricting staff movement between institutions, and\nmaintaining enhanced surveillance for unusual patterns of respiratory\nillness elsewhere -- including SARS coV testing of any cases of ARDS and\nof atypical pneumonia presenting to acute care institutions. Even prior to\nthis event, facilities have been using enhanced respiratory precautions.\nFurther epidemiologic characterization of this event is taking the course of:\n- the above-mentioned intensive clinical / pathological review\n- a deliberate attempt to seek links between this event and any known SARS\ncoV activity globally\n- further analysis of patterns of illness in contacts\n- continued tracking of the course in the facility.\nAnd key -- we are working on obtaining sufficient RNA through viral\npropagation or specimen extraction to get a broad view of the genome of the\nagent.\n--\nDavid M.

Analysis from\nlaboratories in Canada and the United States did not confirm the initial\nconcern that SARS had mutated into a milder disease.\n2 lines of evidence have converged to dismiss the SARS concern.\nClinically, the disease itself was strikingly different from the SARS\noutbreak in the spring of 2003. The features of the current outbreak\nincluded a low case fatality, runny nose, lack of fever in most patients,\nand no SARS-like changes in the lung seen on X-ray.\nNow, sequencing of a portion of the virus causing the outbreak has led to\nthe finding that it was not the SARS coronavirus but another human\ncoronavirus known as OC43.

The nurse was among the 1st wave of health-care\nworkers and patients stricken by SARS [severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome] in early 2003, but the 5-month outbreak that killed 800\npeople worldwide, including 44 in the Toronto area, is far from done\namong those who survived the disease.\n\nPatients who were infected but came through the epidemic are learning\nthat severe acute respiratory syndrome can leave lingering physical\nand psychological effects, which not only don't resolve over time but\ncan actually get worse. 'I have not been able to return back to the\nfront line at all,' said Gordon, 57, of her 22-year nursing career.\n'It's very difficult because one day you're feeling really well and\nthe next day you're not.'\n\nSARS, initially considered a severely acute illness that would\nresolve like other pneumonias, has turned out to be a chronic disease\nwith symptoms that researchers speculate could persist for life. 'It\ncertainly is something that's unfolding that we're learning about,'\nsaid Dr. Paula Gardner, a psychologist at St. John's Rehab Hospital\nin Toronto, who is studying the long-term effects of SARS. 'We\ncouldn't know this before because it's a completely new disease. 'And\nso we're sort of watching and waiting and measuring and trying to see\nwhat's going to happen.'\n\nGardner and a team of researchers at St. John's Rehab have been\nfollowing 40 people who contracted SARS in 2003, most of them\nhealth-care workers. Their study, presented last month [August 2010]\nat an International Congress of Behavioural Medicine meeting in\nWashington, used questionnaires to assess the physical and\npsychological health of participants in 2004 and again in 2007. 'So\nwhat we could do was get a snapshot at one year and at 4 years\n(post-SARS), and then we could compare across time,' Gardner said.\n'At both time frames, the ratings of their general health and mental\nhealth and vitality were all reduced from the norm.'\n\nWhat surprised the researchers was that patients not only weren't\ngetting better as time went on, many seemed to be getting\nsignificantly worse. The study found that in 2007, almost 88 per cent\nof patients were below average for measures of general health,\ncompared with about 49 per cent 3 years earlier. Participants, who\nhad an average age of 50, reported shortness of breath, muscle and\njoint pain, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, and fatigue.\n'And it's not the kind of fatigue like 'I just feel kind of tired\ntoday.' It's the kind of fatigue where you do something for an hour,\nyou have to rest. You have no choice,' Gardner said.\n\nPatients, all of whom had been taking part in a SARS-rehabilitation\nprogram at St. John's, also tended to have increased symptoms of\ndepression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. In fact, about 30 per\ncent of study participants showed distinct signs of post-traumatic\nstress disorder, or PTSD, even 4 years after contracting SARS.\n\nPTSD, a condition increasingly being diagnosed in war veterans, can\ncause nightmares and flashbacks and lead the person to avoid talking\nabout the traumatic event or returning to the place where it\noccurred. Many exhibit signs of hyperarousal, including irritability,\njumpiness and being constantly alert for danger.\n\n'I guess what was surprising to us is that the number is so high,\neven after such a long time,' said Gardner. But she stressed that for\nmany with SARS, having the disease was a highly traumatic event.\n'People came near death in most cases. It was a life-threatening\nillness,' she said. 'You were isolated, so you were isolated away\nfrom family and loved ones in a room, some people without a window.\nAnd that went on for days and days. You didn't know if you were going\nto live or die and see your family before that happened.'\n\nGordon was a coronary intensive care nurse at Scarborough Grace\nHospital when she got SARS after caring for a patient admitted with\nrespiratory distress in March 2003. Hospital staff didn't know the\nman had SARS, a new disease that had just begun striking people in\nChina. She was among 14 health-care workers from Scarborough Grace\nplaced into isolation for 2 weeks at another Toronto hospital, where\nher husband and daughter were not allowed to visit. Some of her\ncolleagues or their family members died, as did the man who had infected her.\n\n'It was just overwhelming,' said Gordon, who believes she was among\nthose SARS patients who developed PTSD. 'Mentally, I'm still very\ncautious about diseases, where I go and hospital settings,' she said.\n'So it all interrelates, the physical and the psychological. It's\nhard to differentiate when one is at work or if it's the other at\nwork.' SARS patients also suffered from stigmatization because of\npeople's fear that any contact would mean certain infection and\npossibly death, said Gardner, exacerbating the sense of isolation.\n\nGordon, who experienced depression and anxiety, recalls withdrawing\nfrom people, in part because of the stigma that seemed to linger long\nafter she was no longer contagious. 'I remember going into my dentist\n4 years post-SARS, and she just panicked when I told her I had SARS,'\nshe said. 'She just freaked right out.'\n\nWhile she has worked through a lot of her emotional issues -- among\nthem anger at how health-care workers were kept in the dark about the\nnew infectious threat and put unwittingly in harm's way -- Gordon\nsaid that the physical residues of SARS are what most concern her\nnow. 'I've come to terms with a lot of the issues that surrounded the\nwhole thing,' she said. 'But physically, I think I have to contend\nwith this forever.'\n\n[Byline: Sheryl Ubelacker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap alerts via\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory\nillness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus\n(SARS-CoV).

According to the World Health\nOrganization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with\nSARS during the 2003 outbreak. Of these, 774 died.\n\nIn general, SARS begins with a high fever (temperature greater than\n100.4 F [38.0 C]). Other symptoms may include headache, an overall\nfeeling of discomfort, and body aches. Some people also have mild\nrespiratory symptoms at the outset. About 10 percent to 20 percent of\npatients have diarrhea. After 2 to 7 days, SARS patients may develop\na dry cough.

Centre for\nDisease Control, said a WHO representative is going to Winnipeg\nbecause 'it may be the first time in the world that the virus has\nbeen found outside of the typical SARS picture,' referring to the\nfact that the virus may still be lurking, in a mild way, in many\ncommunities, but B.C. is the first place to begin such a thorough\nsearch.\nThe investigation has been prompted by the fact that since the\nbeginning of July 2003, 97 of 142 nursing home residents at the\nKinsmen Place Lodge nursing home and 46 of 160 staff have come down\nwith influenza-like symptoms. Visitors are not allowed in, residents\nare discouraged from going out, and 19 employees at Surrey Memorial\nHospital who are healthy but who had contact with a nursing home\nresident have been forced into quarantine as a precaution.\nThe female nursing home resident is in isolation at the hospital with\nrespiratory problems, and the patient has tested positive for the\nspecific coronavirus associated with SARS, or Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndrome.\nAlthough he did not say B.C. is facing a SARS outbreak, the comments\nby Plummer appeared to annoy B.C. public health officials, who want\nto prevent people jumping to the conclusion that SARS has killed 7\nnursing home residents since 1 Jul 2003, not to mention causing mild\nillness in 150 nursing home residents and employees.\n'We do not have severe acute respiratory syndrome here -- we have\nsome positive lab samples,' insisted Dr. Roland Guasparini, chief\nmedical health officer for the Fraser Health Authority.\nDr. David Patrick, chief epidemiologist for the B.C. Centre for\nDisease Control, also cautioned that the results from the Winnipeg\nlab do not yet draw a direct line between the cold-like symptoms in\nnearly 150 nursing home residents and staff at the Kinsmen Place\nLodge, because not enough of the SARS genome has been sequenced, and\nthe lab does not yet have sufficient samples to definitively say\nwhether a mutated or less severe SARS virus is circulating in the\ncommunity.\nBoth Patrick and Guasparini said the test is so new, it may be\nyielding false positives. Plummer did not disagree. He said his\nresults are proof of laboratory, not clinical, findings. Plummer said\nthat lab testing done so far 'is 100 percent identical to the SARS\ncoronavirus, and it is very unlikely that it is the common cold in\nthe coronavirus family that we are misdiagnosing.'\nPatrick said he is withholding his judgment until further testing is\ndone. 'The lab may be seeing a microorganism that might be SARS and\nif it is, then it is different from the illness which earlier in the\nyear was defined as a severe respiratory illness,' said Patrick,\nreferring to the fact that in Toronto and China, SARS was contagious,\ncausing many deaths, while the current outbreak in Surrey is mild by\ncomparison.\nPatrick said 7 nursing home deaths in 6 weeks is typical of the\nmortality rate seen in nursing homes; of the 7 deaths, 3 were in\npeople with pneumonia-like symptoms, and 4 other deaths were\nostensibly from causes like cardiovascular disease.\nHe did acknowledge the virus could have mutated into something that\nis causing less severe illness. Most medical experts agree it is\nunlikely SARS just suddenly vanished. B.C.'s chief medical health\nofficer, Dr. Perry Kendall, said if the current outbreak is\nconclusively proven to be SARS, he doubts B.C. is the only place\nwhere the virus is circulating.\nExperts agree that if it proves to be a disease that can cause few or\nno symptoms, as well as life-threatening symptoms, it will have to\nundergo a name change.\nPlummer said scores of Canadians tested positive for the SARS virus\nbut never actually got sick last spring, and research is currently\nunder way in Toronto to determine whether they belong to a distinct\nclass of viral carriers who can unwittingly infect others and whether\nthey are like the current B.C. cases, who may get a mild version of\nthe virus.\nIn that study, Health Canada has found evidence of the coronavirus\nlinked to SARS in 172 out of 2000 people tested but classified as\nneither suspect or probable cases. The Toronto samples were sent to\nthe Winnipeg lab because the people they came from were either\nexposed to the virus at a hospital, had mild symptoms, were around a\nsick family member, or had travelled to a SARS hot spot in Asia.\nPatrick said since Plummer has confirmed the preliminary findings,\nB.C. officials are now trying to send more tissue, blood, and other\nsamples from deceased nursing home residents and others who were ill,\nso that more extensive testing can be conducted.\nPathologists preserve samples for several weeks, he said. 'Our\npriority now is to get more tissue so they can grow the virus and get\nsamples rich in genetic material. At this point, we can't say SARS\ncaused these deaths. We can only say that a test designed to detect\nSARS found some positive results,' Patrick said.\nGuasparini said health officials here are now checking to see what\nsamples were sent to Winnipeg. He said he remains somewhat skeptical\nabout the laboratory findings because the genetic testing is too new\nto be definitely foolproof. 'Maybe if they tested everyone with a\ncold, some would test positive,' he said.\nAlso on Monday, Kendall announced that no new cases of illness have\nbeen reported in residents and workers at the nursing home in the\npast 3 days, and if the pattern continues, the quarantine on 19\nhealth care workers will be lifted by 28 Aug 2003, at the latest. The\nno-visiting policy at the nursing home will also be reviewed.\nTo prevent the spread of the illness to other nursing homes and\nhealth care facilities, any Kinsmen employee who also works elsewhere\nis being told not to go to the other job.\n[Byline: Pamela Fayerman]\n******\n[2]\nDate: 19 Aug 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CBC Canada 18 Aug 18 2003 08:30 PM PDT [edited]\n\nSurrey SARS virus confirmed, but questions remain\n---------------------------\nA nursing home in Surrey is dealing with an outbreak of the SARS\nvirus, not a SARS-like virus, says the director of Canada's National\nMicrobiology Lab.\nLast week, it was reported that patients and staff at the Kinsmen\nPlace Lodge were falling ill, but were complaining only of minor\nsymptoms. So scientists at the microbiology lab in Winnipeg took the\n'fingerprint' of 4 genes from the virus infecting the Surrey patients\nand compared them [with the genes of] the SARS coronavirus that\nplagued Toronto.\nThe lab's director, Dr. Frank Plummer, says that in 10 of the\nspecimens, his people got a perfect match.\n'The little piece that we're looking at, so far, is 100 percent\nidentical to the SARS coronavirus,' says Plummer.\nBut Dr. David Patrick of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control says the\nresults still don't make sense clinically. He notes the Surrey\npatients were only mildly ill with runny noses and sore throats, and\nthat few had pneumonia or fevers, the classic symptoms of SARS.\n'When we see the common cold in 48 staff members with no pneumonia,\nthat's not SARS. When we see the vast majority of even frail, elderly\npatients only have common cold symptoms, that's not SARS,' he says.\nHowever, this isn't the first time patients in Canada have tested\npositive for SARS, but weren't all that sick.

Centre for\nDisease Control, also cautioned that the results from the Winnipeg\nlab do not yet draw a direct line between the cold-like symptoms in\nnearly 150 nursing home residents and staff at the Kinsmen Place\nLodge, because not enough of the SARS genome has been sequenced, and\nthe lab does not yet have sufficient samples to definitively say\nwhether a mutated or less severe SARS virus is circulating in the\ncommunity.\n Dr. David Patrick, chief epidemiologist with the B.C. Centre for\nDisease Control, said a WHO representative is going to Winnipeg\nbecause 'it may be the first time in the world that the virus has\nbeen found outside of the typical SARS picture,' referring to the\nfact that the virus may still be lurking, in a mild way, in many\ncommunities, but B.C. is the first place to begin such a thorough\nsearch. Plummer said scores of Canadians tested positive for the SARS virus\nbut never actually got sick last spring, and research is currently\nunder way in Toronto to determine whether they belong to a distinct\nclass of viral carriers who can unwittingly infect others and whether\nthey are like the current B.C. cases, who may get a mild version of\nthe virus. The lab may be seeing a microorganism that might be SARS and\nif it is, then it is different from the illness which earlier in the\nyear was defined as a severe respiratory illness,' said Patrick,\nreferring to the fact that in Toronto and China, SARS was contagious,\ncausing many deaths, while the current outbreak in Surrey is mild by\ncomparison. The information available in the newswires mentions that there have\nbeen 3 deaths due to pneumonia, but have not mentioned whether the\npneumonia deaths were consistent with a primary viral pneumonia, an\nARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome -- the pathology seen with\nSARS), or a secondary bacterial pneumonia seen following viral\nrespiratory infections. A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Although he did not say B.C. is facing a SARS outbreak, the comments\nby Plummer appeared to annoy B.C. public health officials, who want\nto prevent people jumping to the conclusion that SARS has killed 7\nnursing home residents since 1 Jul 2003, not to mention causing mild\nillness in 150 nursing home residents and employees. Patrick said 7 nursing home deaths in 6 weeks is typical of the\nmortality rate seen in nursing homes; of the 7 deaths, 3 were in\npeople with pneumonia-like symptoms, and 4 other deaths were\nostensibly from causes like cardiovascular disease.\n ----------------------------------------------\nGenetic testing of blood and other samples from dead and ill Surrey\nnursing home residents and workers is so far consistent with SARS,\nthe scientific director of Health Canada's National Microbiology\nLaboratory in Winnipeg told The Vancouver Sun Monday. The female nursing home resident is in isolation at the hospital with\nrespiratory problems, and the patient has tested positive for the\nspecific coronavirus associated with SARS, or Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndrome.\n The Toronto samples were sent to\nthe Winnipeg lab because the people they came from were either\nexposed to the virus at a hospital, had mild symptoms, were around a\nsick family member, or had travelled to a SARS hot spot in Asia.\n Dr. Frank Plummer, who doubles as the director-general of the Centre\nfor Infectious Disease Prevention and Control in Ottawa, said the\nresults are so intriguing that a virologist from the World Health\nOrganization in Geneva is expected to visit the Winnipeg laboratory\ntoday to view the samples. The investigation has been prompted by the fact that since the\nbeginning of July 2003, 97 of 142 nursing home residents at the\nKinsmen Place Lodge nursing home and 46 of 160 staff have come down\nwith influenza-like symptoms. Also on Monday, Kendall announced that no new cases of illness have\nbeen reported in residents and workers at the nursing home in the\npast 3 days, and if the pattern continues, the quarantine on 19\nhealth care workers will be lifted by 28 Aug 2003, at the latest. Patrick said since Plummer has confirmed the preliminary findings,\nB.C. officials are now trying to send more tissue, blood, and other\nsamples from deceased nursing home residents and others who were ill,\nso that more extensive testing can be conducted. [The above newswires discuss the current laboratory evidence\nsuggesting that the virus responsible for this outbreak of a milder,\nmore flu-like respiratory illness may be related to the coronavirus\nthat was associated with the SARS outbreak. B.C.'s chief medical health\nofficer, Dr. Perry Kendall, said if the current outbreak is\nconclusively proven to be SARS, he doubts B.C. is the only place\nwhere the virus is circulating. Plummer said\nthat lab testing done so far 'is 100 percent identical to the SARS\ncoronavirus, and it is very unlikely that it is the common cold in\nthe coronavirus family that we are misdiagnosing.' Visitors are not allowed in, residents\nare discouraged from going out, and 19 employees at Surrey Memorial\nHospital who are healthy but who had contact with a nursing home\nresident have been forced into quarantine as a precaution. So scientists at the microbiology lab in Winnipeg took the\n'fingerprint' of 4 genes from the virus infecting the Surrey patients\nand compared them [with the genes of] the SARS coronavirus that\nplagued Toronto. There's a very broad spectrum of illness caused by\nthis virus, and what we saw in the epidemic in terms of the very\nsevere cases is only the tip of the iceberg, and there's much more\nout there.' To prevent the spread of the illness to other nursing homes and\nhealth care facilities, any Kinsmen employee who also works elsewhere\nis being told not to go to the other job.\n The National\nMicrobiology Lab revealed in June 2003 it had 170 positive SARS\nresults in Ontario residents who had never been diagnosed with the\ndisease. A nursing home in Surrey is dealing with an outbreak of the SARS\nvirus, not a SARS-like virus, says the director of Canada's National\nMicrobiology Lab. In that study, Health Canada has found evidence of the coronavirus\nlinked to SARS in 172 out of 2000 people tested but classified as\nneither suspect or probable cases. He said he remains somewhat skeptical\nabout the laboratory findings because the genetic testing is too new\nto be definitely foolproof. ' Our\npriority now is to get more tissue so they can grow the virus and get\nsamples rich in genetic material. He notes the Surrey\npatients were only mildly ill with runny noses and sore throats, and\nthat few had pneumonia or fevers, the classic symptoms of SARS. Last week, it was reported that patients and staff at the Kinsmen\nPlace Lodge were falling ill, but were complaining only of minor\nsymptoms.

Through July and early August [2003], 97 of 142 residents of\nthe facility have been affected, with most experiencing only mild cold-like\nsymptoms such as runny nose and cough. Of 160 staff, 46 have also shown\nsimilar symptoms. The majority of residents and staff have fully recovered.\nAlthough health officials are aware of the deaths of 7 residents over the\npast 6 weeks, 4 of these deaths were unrelated. In 3 of the deaths,\npneumonia was a contributing factor.\n'BC has a strong network of public health surveillance and health officials\ntake any disease outbreak very seriously,' said Dr David Patrick, director\nof epidemiology at BCCDC. 'As with any situation where a large number of\npatients and staff are affected by an outbreak, we are working to identify\nthe cause.'\nFraser Health Authority is working with BCCDC, the provincial health\nofficer, and Health Canada to conclusively identify the cause. Tests\nperformed by the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg have yielded a range\nof results for possible viruses, including positives for both human\nmetapnuemavirus and a virus similar to the SARS coronavirus. None of these\npatients fits the profile of previous SARS cases in BC and Ontario earlier\nthis year.\n'These laboratory findings are surprising given the nature of the\noutbreak,' said Patrick. 'The symptoms and progression of illness are not\nconsistent with SARS infection and there is no evidence anyone related to\nthe outbreak has traveled to an affected area or had contact with a SARS\ncase. While the virus looks like the SARS coronavirus, it doesn't appear to\nact like the SARS virus we've come to know,' said Patrick.\nAs a precautionary measure and in addition to the infection control\nmeasures already in place, Kinsmen Place Lodge will be considered a site\nwhere transmission of SARS virus may have occurred in residents or visitors\nsince 1 Jul 2003. 'Until such time as we determine the cause through sound\nmedical and clinical research, we are erring on the side of caution,' said\nDr Roland Guasparini, medical health officer for Fraser Health Authority.\n'Infection control procedures have been used as a standard practice during\nthe course of this outbreak. Given these recent lab results, there are\nestablished protocols around SARS precautions that Fraser Health is\nfamiliar with and will maintain.'\nSince the outbreak began in early July, full precautions have been taken to\nlimit the spread of the illness. The outbreak has been contained and the\nrate of transmission and number of new cases has dropped to very low\nlevels. Kinsmen Place Lodge has had visiting and admissions restrictions in\nplace since the outbreak was first identified. Isolation precautions were\ninstituted around symptomatic patients and will continue. In addition,\nstaff have been directed not to work between different facilities and ill\nstaff have been directed not to work.\nVisitors to Kinsmen Place Lodge after 1 Jul 2003 who have a cough and fever\nover 38 degrees Celsius have been asked to contact BC NurseLine.\nMedia Contact Information:\nSally Greenwood\nDirector, Communications\nTransplant, Renal and Public Health, PHSA\nHelen Carkner\nDirector, Public Affairs\nCommunication, Fraser Health Authority\n******\n[2]\nDate: 15 Aug 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Yahoo news\n<http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=553&ncid=751&e=10&u=/ap/20030815/ap_wo_en_he/na_gen_canada_mystery_illness>\n\nWHO rules out SARS as mystery illness at Canadian nursing home\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia: - The World Health Organization said on Friday\nthat a pneumonia-like illness that sickened dozens of people at a British\nColumbia nursing home probably was not SARS. 7 people have died, 3 of them\ndue to respiratory illness, since the unknown disease first appeared 6\nweeks ago at the Kinsman Place Lodge in the Vancouver suburb of Surrey,\nsaid Dr Shaun Peck, the British Columbia deputy medical health officer.\nIn Geneva, WHO spokesman Iain Simpson said some tests showed the cause\ncould be a virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as\nSARS, but no other similarities exist. Simpson noted patients at the\nnursing home lacked the high fever, breathing difficulties, and other\nsymptoms associated with SARS. 'At the moment we don't exactly understand\nwhat is happening,' Simpson said. 'They have found 10 positive results for\nthe SARS virus. We don't believe this is an outbreak of SARS but the local\nauthorities in Vancouver are taking a very conservative approach.' The\nillness could be a milder form of SARS than previously encountered, Simpson\nsaid. 'We are waiting for more information from Canada,' he said.

While stressing\nthis was not another outbreak of SARS, which killed more than 40 people in\nthe Toronto area this year, officials said they were treating like the\ndeadly form of pneumonia until they learn more about it.\nThe illness struck Kinsman Place Lodge in suburban Surrey, infecting 97 out\nof 142 residents and 46 of 160 staff members over the last 6 weeks, Dr\nShaun Peck, BC deputy medical health officer, said on Thursday.\n'There have been 7 deaths, although only 3 of them have been directly\nassociated with a respiratory illness,' Peck told a news briefing.\nOfficials said nursing homes such as the Kinsman Place Lodge normally can\naverage 4 to 5 deaths a month. Preliminary tests from the National\nMicrobiology Laboratory in Winnipeg show the disease 'appears to be a\nSARS-like virus,' said Peck. 'Although clinically it is not an illness that\nwe associate with SARS, we felt obliged to let everybody know about it.'\nStaff and residents infected by the illness showed only mild, cold-like\nsymptoms such as runny nose with no fever, said Dr David Patrick of the BC\nCentre for Disease Control. 'This is not a typical SARS picture,' he said.\nHe said 2 of the deaths being probed were patients already in palliative\ncare, 2 were from vascular causes and 3 others had pneumonia as a\ncontributing factor along with an underlying illness. Lab tests produced\nsome positive results for a SARS-like corona virus, said Patrick.\n'These findings around a SARS-like virus from the lab are unexpected,' he\nsaid. 'The outbreak hasn't behaved at all like SARS as manifested in Hong\nKong, Toronto, Singapore, Vancouver, et cetera, in the past.' Peck said\nthis could be the SARS virus behaving less aggressively or a closely\nrelated, less virulent virus previously unknown, or a SARS virus weakened\nthrough genetic alternation. 'All these possibilities remain and they need\nto be clarified,' he said.\nScientists at Winnipeg and the US Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention in Atlanta will try to identify the virus and compare it with\nthe known SARS virus. 'In the meantime though and until this is clear,\nwe're playing it safe,' said Peck. The outbreak was initially treated as\ninfluenza -- common in nursing homes -- but tests for the flu virus proved\nnegative, said Dr Roland Guasparini, chief medical officer for the Fraser\nHealth Authority. Early tests for SARS also came back negative, he said.\nBut when the new results came in, precautions were stepped up, he said.\n'Based on these preliminary lab findings ... we're going to consider this\nlong-term care facility as a site where transmission of SARS may have\noccurred in residents or visitors since 1 Jul 2003,' said Guasparini. He\nnoted there was no evidence the illness had been transmitted outside the\nnursing home.\nGuasparini said one patient remained isolated in hospital with pneumonia\nand staff who were exposed are being tracked for possible quarantine and\nobservation. 'We're going to adopt a very careful public-health approach to\nthis, as we did in the past, when we were investigating the cases of SARS\nand suspect SARS that we had,' he said.\nGuasparini said the public should take normal precautions against the new\nillness, such as reducing contact with others if one has cold symptoms and\nmaintaining hygiene. Visitors to the stricken nursing home who develop a\nfever of more than 38 degrees, along with a cough, should telephone a local\npublic health hotline. Those who become seriously ill should contact their\ndoctors.\nSymptoms shown by the nursing-home residents included cough, sore throat,\njoint pain, muscle pain and extreme fatigue. The nursing home had a sign at\nthe front door Thursday warning visitors the facility was dealing with a\n'respiratory outbreak,' and recommending people do not enter.\n[byline: Emily Yearwood-Lee]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The description of the illness is that of a mild respiratory illness.\nAccording to the numbers provided, there were 97 out of 142 residents\n(clinical attack rate 68 per cent) and 46 of 160 staff members (attack rate\n29 per cent) with 3 deaths (overall case fatality rate 2 per cent with a\ncase fatality rate of 3 per cent among residents).

These cases have either recently traveled to Hong\nKong or have had close contact with these individuals. The details of the\ncases to date are as follows:\nOntario: In a single family, 3 people have been admitted to hospital with\nsevere pneumonia of unknown cause, 2 other members have died. In addition,\nindividuals (2) with close contact with this family have been admitted to\nhospital. Also in Ontario, a separate, unrelated case who had traveled\nrecently to Hong Kong has also been admitted to hospital.\nBritish Columbia: one person has been admitted to hospital with SARS.\nAt this time, the cause of SARS remains unknown, but national and\ninternational laboratory testing and collaboration is ongoing. Here are the\nmost recent developments:\nScientists at Health Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg\nreport that they have found evidence of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in\nspecimens from 6 of the 8 cases they are studying. The metapneumovirus is\npart of paramyxoviridae family. These findings are consistent with the\nresults previously released by scientists in Germany and Hong Kong.\nThe findings of the National Microbiology Laboratory are significant in\nthat a common thread has been found in a majority of cases in Canada. This\nis a promising step in the investigation. Scientists will continue their\nwork to try to verify the findings and to determine if there are other\nfactors involved that are influencing the severity of this outbreak.\nParamyxoviruses can be responsible for mumps, measles, pneumonia and the\ncommon cold. The metapneumovirus was only recently identified in humans. It\ncauses respiratory symptoms that are not usually as severe as those seen in\nthe current outbreak. To date no antiviral medications have been developed\nspecifically to treat metapneumovirus. These findings will not likely alter\nthe current treatment for SARS patients.\nHealth Canada has initiated the following activities:\nWe have expanded health alert card distribution at major airports in\nCanada. In addition to Pearson and Vancouver, these cards are being\ndistributed at all airports that receive international flights from all\ndestinations other than the United States.\nHealth Canada issued revised travel advice on 19 Mar 2003. The overall risk\nfor travelers appears to be low at this time. However, because of recent\nincreases in cases of SARS in the city of Hanoi, Vietnam, Hong Kong Special\nAdministrative Region, and Singapore and that transmission may not be\nlimited to the hospital setting, Health Canada advises that people planning\nelective or nonessential travel to the city of Hanoi, Vietnam, Hong Kong\nSpecial Administrative Region, and Singapore may wish to postpone their\ntrips until further notice.\nIn collaboration with the provinces, territories, and local health units,\nHealth Canada has begun enhanced surveillance for the recognition of SARS\ncases. Health Canada has also asked officials at the Pearson and Vancouver\nInternational Airports to carefully monitor passengers arriving from Hong\nKong and Singapore to see if anyone has flu-like symptoms. Health Canada\nhas sent staff to Pearson and Vancouver International Airports to support\nairport staff. Health professionals have been sent to each airport to help\nmonitor passengers arriving on direct flights from Hong Kong and Singapore\nfor flu-like symptoms and to assist those who appear to be ill. They have\nstarted distributing Health Alert Notices to all passengers arriving in or\nreturning from Hong Kong and Singapore which will ask passengers to see a\nphysician if they begin to have any symptoms related to SARS. These\nsymptoms include a fever over 38.0 degrees Celsius AND one or more of the\nfollowing respiratory symptoms: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty\nbreathing.\nHealth Canada's Workplace Health and Public Safety Programme is providing\nadvice to federal employers on occupational health and safety matters.\nHealth professionals from Health Canada's Workplace Health and Public\nSafety Programme were on site at the Pearson and Vancouver airports to\nprovide information sessions for federal employees. They are available, at\nthe employer's request, to provide sessions for federal employees at all\nairports that receive international flights from all destinations other\nthan the United States. The Workplace Health and Safety Programme has\nissued an advisory notice and has spoken to or met with representatives of\na number of federal departments to provide them with information and advice\nthey can use in determining what health and safety measures they deem\nappropriate for their employees. It is Health Canada's position that\nGovernment of Canada workers are not considered to be at high risk of\ninfection because of the limited contact with and proximity to the\nindividuals. Therefore, Health Canada advises that the use of masks is not\nnecessary. Health Canada continues to provide employer departments with the\nmost current information and advice available on SARS.\nHealth Canada will continue to do everything it can to keep Canadians\ninformed and will continue to work with the provinces and territories so\nthat medical officers are fully informed and appropriate steps are taken to\nmitigate risk.

The 5 additional patients reported today comprise 4\nhospital staff and 1 close contact of a patient. Three patients have been\ndischarged from hospital. The other 41 patients are still in hospital. All\nthe patients are stable except for 8 patients who are in a serious condition.\nTo date, apart from the 3 initial people who had travelled to Hong Kong, a\ntotal of 20 family, friends and those who had close contacts with the\ncases, and 21 hospital staff have been diagnosed with SARS. So far, all the\ncases of SARS have been linked to the initial 3 cases. No new index cases\nhave been reported. In addition, no further cases have occurred among\nhospital staff as a result of infection from known or suspected cases of\nSARS after the implementation of enhanced infection control precautions.\nThough the SARS situation in Singapore is contained, the Ministry of Health\nis stepping up precautionary measures to cut off secondary transmission\nespecially among hospital staff and reduce risk of any community spread.\nThese include:\nA) Centralising all suspected and probable SARS cases\nAt present, the vast majority of suspect and probable cases of SARS are\nbeing isolated and treated in TTSH and CDC. As these cases require\nisolation facilities for up to 2-3 weeks, the initial provisions made by\nTTSH and CDC to handle these cases are becoming fully utilised. At the same\ntime, TTSH is continuing to carry its normal hospital load of clinical care\nand this is stretching staff and other resources.\nIn view of these considerations, the decision has been made to continue to\nmanage all suspected and probable cases, including pediatric cases,\ncentrally at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and the Centre for Communicable\nDiseases. This will facilitate the management of these patients and reduce\nthe risk of secondary transmission of the disease. To free up TTSH's\nresources to isolate and treat all SARS cases, TTSH will not admit new\npatients for the next 2 weeks. As such, ambulance cases will be diverted to\nother hospitals and the public will be advised to seek accident and\nemergency care at other hospitals. TTSH will also scale down its specialist\noutpatient clinics activities over the next 2 weeks. TTSH has also\ncancelled elective surgeries which might require intensive care unit wards.\nB) Added protection measures for hospital staff\nNo further cases have occurred among hospital staff from infection from\nrecognised cases since we implemented enhanced precautions and control\nmeasures. However, we are not taking any chances with any possible\nunrecognised cases. TTSH and CDC will be instituting tighter measures to\nbreak the cycle of transmission among hospital staff. These include\nphysically cordoning off areas in TTSH which manage suspected or probable\nSARS patients. Entry of staff and relatives will be closely controlled.\nThere will also be an exclusive set of hospital staff dealing with SARS\npatients and they will not perform outpatient clinics and other inpatient jobs.\nAs an added protective measure, hospital staff in open wards in TTSH and\nnot treating SARS patients will also observe enhanced infection control\nmeasures. These include wearing masks, gloves and gowns. Existing non-SARS\npatients in TTSH who are currently being treated as inpatients will\ncontinue to be managed there. There should be no cause of concern for these\npatients, as they will continue to be kept physically separate from SARS\npatients who will be under isolation.\nC) Precautionary measures for schoolchildren\n[see ProMED-mail Severe acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (14)\n20030321.0704, recommendations are unchanged from posting of 21 Mar 2003 -\nMod.MPP]\nD) Pay heed to travel advice and symptoms\nThe public should continue to avoid travel to Hong Kong, Hanoi and\nGuangdong province in China for the time being, unless absolutely\nnecessary.

This major step towards the\ndevelopment of a diagnostic test has occurred despite the failure, up to\nnow, to pinpoint the exact identity of the causative agent.\nResearchers at the laboratory took serum samples from the blood of\nrecovering SARS patients and a matching number of healthy volunteers in\nwhat is known as a 'blinded' test. Serum from patients infected by a virus\nusually contains neutralizing antibodies that stop the growth of the virus\n-- whatever its identity -- when added to a cell culture in which the virus\nhas been successfully grown. When the researchers added serum from SARS\npatients to the cell culture, virus growth was halted. Serum from\nuninfected healthy controls had no effect on the virus.\n'This is not just some light at the end of the tunnel,' said WHO virologist\nDr Klaus St\u00f6hr, who is coordinating the collaborative laboratory efforts.\n'This is a real ray of sunshine.'\nWHO cautions, however, that the number of patients in the test was small\nand more work needs to be done. The scientific community is excited by the\nnews, which could be regarded as the first important step towards the\ndevelopment of a diagnostic test.\nThe infectious agent resembles the morphology of a Paramyxovirus.\nScientists cannot, however, be certain about the identity of the virus,\nwhich may indeed be a new Paramyxovirus or another virus with a similar\nmorphology.\nThe laboratory is one of 11 leading labs participating in an international\nmulticentre research project. The project was set up by WHO on Monday to\nexpedite identification of the causative agent -- considered by several\nresearch groups to be a member of the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses --\nand rapidly develop a diagnostic test.\nWHO team of experts travelling to China:\nA WHO team of 5 infectious disease experts will be travelling over the\nweekend to China to support investigations there of an outbreak of atypical\npneumonia that began in Guangdong Province in mid-November. The\nmultinational team was assembled in response to a request from the Chinese\nMinistry of Health for epidemiological and laboratory support to aid\nongoing investigation of the outbreak. The team will also assist in\nlaboratory work that might lead to identification of the causative agent.\nThe team includes experts in virology, laboratory techniques,\nepidemiological investigation, and the control of unusual infectious\ndiseases. Team members, of American, Australian, British, and German\nnationality, have been drawn from institutes participating in the WHO\nGlobal Outbreak Alert and Response Network.\nThe outbreak in southern China is linked geographically and by timing to\nthe current outbreak of SARS, which first surfaced in Asia in mid-February\nand caused its first known death on 13 Mar 2003. Cases of this new disease\nhave now been detected in 13 countries on three continents. Hong Kong SAR\nChina, which as of today accounts for 203 of the 350 suspected or probable\ncases reported worldwide, remains the most severely affected area.\nApart from searching for the causative agent, the WHO team is expected to\nhelp Chinese scientists determine whether the Guangdong outbreak included\ncases that fit the current definition of SARS.\nConclusive identification of the causative agent, which is thought to be a\nvirus of the Paramyxoviridae family, would greatly aid the investigation by\nChinese scientists and the WHO team, which is expected to begin on Monday.\nResearch on the identity of the SARS pathogen is progressing rapidly within\na network of 11 leading laboratories set up by WHO earlier this week. WHO\nremains optimistic that a definitive announcement of the cause of SARS can\nbe made soon.\nHistory of the Guangdong outbreak:\nWHO was first officially informed of the outbreak on 11 Feb 2003, when the\nChinese Ministry of Health reported that 305 cases of acute respiratory\nsyndrome of unknown cause had occurred in six municipalities in Guangdong\nProvince in southern China. [see ProMED-mail 10 Feb 2003: Pneumonia - China\n(Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357 - Mod.MPP] 5 deaths were reported.\nTransmission of the disease was largely confined to health care workers\n(105 doctors, nurses, and other medical workers) and household contacts of\npatients.\nOn 14 Feb 2003, WHO was informed by the Chinese Ministry of Health that the\noutbreak was clinically consistent with atypical pneumonia. Reported\nsymptoms included fever, dizziness, muscle soreness, and bouts of coughing.\nPatients had acute symptoms, included high fever, dry cough, muscle pain,\nand weakness, and required hospitalization. The Chinese authorities also\nprovided information that cases had been detected in the province as far\nback as 16 Nov 2002.\nIn mid-February 2003, some Chinese experts concluded that the outbreak was\ncaused by chlamydial organisms. Others speculated that a virus might be the\ncause. It is hoped that the WHO team can help authorities quickly resolve\nthese and other outstanding questions about the Guangdong outbreak.\nUpdate on cases and affected countries As of 21 March, 350 suspected and\nprobable cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries.\nThese figures represent an additional 44 cases and two new countries\ncompared with the previous day. The number of deaths remains unchanged.\nCountries reported their first suspected cases are Italy and the Republic\nof Ireland, each reporting one case. New cases were reported in Hong Kong\n(30), Singapore (5), Taiwan, China (2), Thailand (3), and the United States\nof America (2).\nNew guidelines for health authorities WHO has today posted on its web site\n2 documents to assist national authorities in the investigation and\nmanagement of cases. The first gives a more complete, though still\npreliminary, clinical picture of SARS, pooled from findings provided by\nclinicians treating SARS patients in seven countries. It is anticipated\nthat the clinical description will help health authorities recognize cases\nwith greater precision.\nThe second document provides advice, including recommended laboratory tests\nand radiological findings, that can guide the safe discharge and follow-up\nof convalescent cases. The policy advice aims to ensure that the release of\nrecovered patients carries no risks for family members and other close\ncontacts. Until more is known about the etiological agent, and the\npotential for continued carriage, WHO is recommending a cautious approach.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The above notice is very promising towards having identified the etiologic\nagent for SARS. As is mentioned in this report, serum from cases of SARS\nhas inhibited the growth of the suspected etiologic agent, an as yet\nunidentified member of the paramyxovirus family, suggesting that patients\nwith SARS have developed protective antibodies against this agent, whereas\nhealthy controls do not have these protective antibodies. Again caution is\nadvised as these tests have been conducted on a small number of the cases\nand controls, and larger studies are necessary to draw definitive conclusions.\nAs an addendum to the history of the outbreak in Guangdong, ProMED-mail\nreceived a report of an outbreak of pneumonia in Guangdong on 10 Feb 2003\nfrom Stephen O Cunnion, MD, PhD, MPH <cunnion@erols.com> stating 'An\nacquaintance of mine from a teacher's chat room lives there (Guangdong)\nand reports that the hospitals there have been closed and people are\ndying.'

In addition, no\nfurther cases have occurred among hospital staff as a result of infection\nfrom known or suspected cases of SARS after the implementation of enhanced\ninfection control precautions.\n\nSchools and preschool facilities will reopen on 24 Mar 2003. The Ministry\nof Health and the Ministry of Education have assessed that there is no need\nto extend the school break. The spread of SARS is still confined to family\nand friends, and hospital staff who have had close contacts with infected\npatients. As an added precautionary measure, the children of contacts of\nknown cases will be asked to stay away from school for another week. This\nis to prevent any community spread. MOH is also working closely with the\nMinistry of Education and the Ministry of Community Development and Sports\nto step up vigilance in schools, preschools and child care centres.\nChildren who have fever will be asked to seek medical attention and to\nreturn to school only when they are well.\n\nMOH would like to appeal to all parents whose children have been to Hong\nKong, Guangdong province in China, or Hanoi to closely monitor their\nchildren. They should not be sent to school if they have fever and should\nbe seen by a doctor immediately. All schools and preschools have been\nadvised through the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Community\nDevelopment and Sports to look out for children who are unwell with fever\nand have been to the affected areas.

The consultant in\ncharge of the Disease Prevention and Control Division of DH, Dr Tse\nLai-yin, said the 4 children comprised two 15 year old twin sisters, a 5\nyear old girl and a 7 year old boy. They are among the 165 people confirmed\ntoday to have contracted atypical pneumonia.\n\nThe twin sisters have been taking sick leave from their schools, namely Tak\nOi Secondary School and CCC Heep Woh College in Wong Tai Sin since 13 Mar\n2003. They were admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) on 14 Mar\n2003 and they are in a serious condition.\n\n'DH staff visited their schools on 14 Mar 2003. Investigations showed that\nthe general environmental condition of the schools is good and that\nstudents and teaching staff have not reported unusual patterns of sickness\nin relation to the outbreak,' Dr Tse stressed.\n\n'The 2 sisters are likely to have contracted the disease from their mother\nwho is a health care worker in the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) and has\nbeen confirmed to have contracted the disease earlier,' Dr Tse added.\n\nThe other 2 cases, the 5 year old girl and the 7 year old boy, were\nadmitted to PWH on 16 and 18 Mar 2003, respectively. They are in a stable\ncondition. 'They developed symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection on\n13 and 17 Mar 2003, respectively.\n\n'DH has informed the kindergarten and school, namely Diana Anglo-Chinese\nKindergarten and SKH Holy Spirit Primary School in Sha Tin, of the\nsituation. There is no sign that other students there have been infected,'\nDr Tse said. 'We believed that the sources of the virus were not in the\nschool and the kindergarten concerned. It is most likely that they\ncontracted the disease from their sick family members who have been under\ntreatment in PWH,' Dr Tse noted.\n\nMeanwhile, DH is investigating a suspected atypical pneumonia cases in\nwhich the younger sister of the boy, aged 4, is suspected to have\ncontracted the disease. She developed symptoms on 14 Mar 2003 and was\nadmitted to PWH for observation.\n\n'The Department and the Education and Manpower Bureau (EMB) will continue\nto closely monitor the health conditions of students and staff of these\nschools,' Dr Tse said, adding that 'there is no sign of spread of atypical\npneumonia among the student population at this stage.'\n\nEMB has issued school circulars to all schools on 13 and 18 Mar 2003\nrespectively, reminding them to disseminate to students and parents DH's\nhealth advice on the prevention of respiratory tract infections. DH and EMB\nwill jointly hold 2 briefing sessions tomorrow for all school principals to\nremind them of the precautionary measures, followed by health talks for all\nteachers on 25, 27, and 28 Mar 2003, respectively.\n\nTo enable parents of the schools involved in these cases to have a full\npicture on the situation and obtain proper health advice, DH and EMB have\nalready arranged a seminar for parents whose children are studying in the\ntwo Wong Tai Sin schools. Health talks for parents of the primary school\nand the kindergarten involved will also be lined up soon.\n\nDr Tse reiterated that child care centres, kindergartens, and schools\nshould take the following precautionary measures to prevent respiratory\ntract infections:\n- Cleanse toys and furniture properly;\n- Put on a mask if you develop symptoms of respiratory tract infection, or\nwhen you are taking care of a sick person who has respiratory symptoms;\n- Cover nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing;\n- Wash hands when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions - for\nexample, after sneezing;\n- Use liquid soap for hand washing and disposable towel for drying hands;\n- Do not share towels;\n- To take sick leave and have good rest when feeling unwell;\n- Ensure adequate ventilation of indoor premises;\n- Maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\n******\n[3]\nPart 1: Update\nDate: Sat, 22 Mar 2003 00:27:01 +0800 (CST)\nFrom: Prof Peter WS Chang <wpc94@yahoo.com> [edited]\n\n\nSARS case update from Taiwan CDC 21 Mar 2003\n--------------------------------------------\nThe Center for Disease Control, Department of Health, Taiwan, reports the\n5th and 6th cases of probable SARS at this day. The 5th case is a 37 year\nold woman who traveled to Guangdong, China, from 2 Feb 2003 to 11 Mar 2003,\nand returned to Taiwan. On 13 Mar 2003, she developed symptoms compatible\nwith SARS. Chest radiography revealed infiltrates over bilateral lower lobes.\n\nThe 6th case is a 25 year old man who had not recently travelled to China\nor Hong Kong, or the regions with epidemic. He developed symptoms\ncompatible with SARS on 17 Mar 2003, while his father was the index case in\nthe family and also the first reported case in Taiwan. His chest\nradiographs showed infiltrates in both the upper lobes. His father\ntravelled to Guandong, China, during the period 5 to 21 Feb 2003 and\nreturned with symptoms of flu and developed SARS early in March 2003. Both\ncases are already treated in isolated environment.\n\nAll necessary sampling for pathogen study and isolation procedure have been\nundertaken.

Local transmission, however, has\nonly been reported from Canada, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan\n(2). From 1 Feb 2003 to 19 Mar 2003, 219 suspect or probable cases have\nbeen reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), including 9 cases\nthat have died (2).\n\nTwo probable cases in the United Kingdom (UK) had been reported to the PHLS\nCommunicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) by 20 Mar 2003. The first\nis a man aged 65 years who was returning from Hong Kong to Manchester via\nAmsterdam on 15 Mar 2003. He is in hospital under strict isolation\nmeasures. His condition is reported to be improving (3). The second case is\na man aged 30 years from London, who flew back from Taiwan on 16 Mar 2003\nafter visiting his family for 3 days. He is in hospital and his condition\nis stable. Both cases have abnormal signs on chest x-ray, a compatible\nrespiratory infection, and fulfil the WHO case definition for SARS. Neither\nis known to have been in contact with any probable or suspect cases.\nPassengers travelling on the same flights as the 2 cases have been advised\nto seek medical assistance if they develop high fever and respiratory\nsymptoms within 10 days of their return. The same advice is given to all\npeople visiting places where local transmission has been reported.

It would be premature, however, to attribute\nthe outbreak to this source.\n\nThe DoH and the PHLS have issued a joint press release, presenting the key\npoints of the UK specific response to this international threat (5):\n- All doctors have been alerted to identify any illness in returning\ntravellers that may be associated with this outbreak\n- Travellers returning to the UK from any of the affected countries and\npresenting symptoms compatible with the case definition should seek medical\nadvice\n- People from the UK are not restricted from travelling to any of the\naffected countries.\n\nGuidance on microbiological investigations has been developed by the\nInfluenza Laboratory, and the Respiratory and Systemic Infection Laboratory\nof the PHLS Central Public Health Laboratory.

' \n\n--\nProMED-mail\n< The spread of SARS is still confined to family\nand friends, and hospital staff who have had close contacts with infected\npatients. \n\n--\nDirector-General\n Available at\n<http://www.phls.co.uk/press_media/id_bulletins/archive/2003/030316id.htm>\n\n******\n The total number of admissions is released after collating, analysing, and\nconfirming the clinical symptoms and test results of the patients\nconcerned. The health authority in Taiwan continues to keep close\nobservation and surveillance and to provide all necessary health care for\nthese individuals. The experts said that doctors have ruled out plague and bird flu as\npossible causes of the pneumonia, and efforts continue to identify the\nvirus. Patients, patient's family members & visitors PWH, PMH, KWH, PYNEH, QEH,\nTKOH & Queen Mary Hospital 93 (91)\n admitted to:\nKwong Wah Hospital 4 (4)\n Local transmission, however, has\nonly been reported from Canada, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan\n(2). The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n The epidemic, which has\nbeen afflicting the province since November last year [2002], has been\nbrought under control, experts from the departments said. MOH is also working closely with the\nMinistry of Education and the Ministry of Community Development and Sports\nto step up vigilance in schools, preschools and child care centres. It is most likely that they\ncontracted the disease from their sick family members who have been under\ntreatment in PWH,' Dr Tse noted. The Ministry\nof Health and the Ministry of Education have assessed that there is no need\nto extend the school break.

Previous tests conducted in a number of top laboratories failed to\ndetect the presence of any known bacteria or viruses, including the\ninfluenza viruses, recognized as causes of pneumonia or respiratory\nsymptoms, or known to be widespread in the most affected geographical areas.\nThe failure of all previous efforts to detect the presence of bacteria and\nviruses known to cause respiratory disease strongly suggests that the\ncausative agent may be a novel pathogen.\nFirm conclusions about the identity of the causative agent are premature.\nAll teams have stressed that these are preliminary results only. Further\nstudies are needed before it can be concluded, with confidence, that the\ncausative agent has been identified.\nCollaborative efforts continue. All research teams are participants in the\ninternational multicentre SARS research project, linking together 11\nleading laboratories, that was set up on Monday 17 Mar 2003. Coordinated\nresearch is expected to expedite definitive identification of the causative\nagent.\nThe detection of paramyxovirus particles in samples from infected patients\nis the first lead to a possible cause of SARS and will be extremely\nimportant in focusing ongoing research. Definitive identification of the\ncausative agent will help physicians move from the current 'hit-or-miss'\napproach to treatment to a more precise selection of drugs with a greater\nprospect of cure. Knowledge of the causative agent will also speed\ndevelopment of a diagnostic test and thus give physicians and national\nhealth authorities a powerful tool for the identification of cases. It will\nalso reassure the many 'worried well' now presenting at health facilities,\nand reduce the number of false alarms.\nUpdate on countries and cases\nAs of Wednesday 19 Mar 2003, a cumulative total of 264 suspected or\nprobable cases and 9 deaths have been reported from 10 countries (Canada,\nChina, Germany Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom,\nthe United States of America, and Viet Nam). Hong Kong SAR, Hanoi (Viet\nNam), and Singapore continue to be the most affected areas. Full details\nare provided in tabular form.\nAwareness of the disease is now very high throughout the world.\nSurveillance is proving to be sensitive, with suspected cases rapidly\ndetected, reported to national authorities and WHO, and investigated\naccording to the standard case definition.\nThe Paramyxoviridae family\nViruses in the Paramyxoviridae family include many common, well-known\nagents associated with respiratory infections, such as respiratory\nsyncytial virus, and childhood illnesses, including the viruses that cause\nmumps and measles. Some of these viruses are widespread, particularly\nduring the winter season. Screening of specimens could therefore be\nexpected to detect particles of these common viruses. At this point, it\ncannot be ruled out entirely that tests for the SARS agent are detecting\nsuch 'background' viruses rather than the true causative agent.\nThe Paramyxoviridae family also includes two recently recognized pathogens,\nHendra virus and Nipah virus. These related viruses are unusual in the\nfamily in that they can infect and cause potentially fatal disease in a\nnumber of animal hosts, including humans. Most other viruses in the family\ntend to infect a single animal species only.\nNipah virus first began to cause deaths in humans in Peninsular Malaysia in\n1998 in persons in close contact with pigs. The outbreak caused 265 cases\nof human encephalitis, including 105 deaths. Two separate outbreaks of\nHendra virus, associated with severe respiratory disease in horses, caused\ntwo human deaths in Australia in 1994 and 1995. No human-to-human\ntransmission was documented in either outbreak. No treatment was available\nfor cases caused by either of these two viruses. Human-to-human\ntransmission did not occur.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Tam and Chan for submitting this first hand report\non their preliminary findings of RT-PCR findings consistent with a\nparamyxovirus from 4 patients with SARS in Hong Kong SAR.

I believe that this is a clear\nmessage here for the improvement in international surveillance and in risk\ncommunication to the public.\n\nIt is worth noting that there is no agent identified; this could be a\nworrisome indication of the intrusion of a new agent or represent the\naccidental concatenation of unrelated diseases. I have to recall the\n'plague epidemic' in Surat in 1994 which was of course never reliably\nelucidated, but nevertheless resulted in billions of dollars in economic\nimpact and considerable human suffering, panic, and aggravation. Then\nthere are the Ebola outbreaks that have so far responded to fairly orthodox\ninfection control measures; although the case fatality rate is high, the\ncommunicability is greatly over-exaggerated in most popular reports.\n\nA quality laboratory capacity and adequate epidemiological expertise will\ncontinue to be crucial in being able to understand the real significance of\noutbreaks early on. By making an early and accurate diagnosis and\nunderstanding the nature of transmission, control measures can be started\nearly and the public can be appropriately warned or reassured as is\nappropriate.\n\nIf this is a highly transmissible and lethal pulmonary infection, the\nwisdom of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in including emerging\ninfections in the brief of their biodefense activities and in supporting\nthe construction of additional high containment laboratories will be\nconfirmed in a very immediate and practical way.\n\nIn 1992 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued the landmark report Emerging\nInfections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States and many of\nthe issues were identified and actions urged. A considerable change in\nattitude resulted and some of the problems were addressed. However, the\nIOM revisited the problem in a report to be released on 19 March\n2003. Unfortunately, the conclusions of the report were that many of the\ninadequacies of our system have not been corrected and that the external\nevents leading to emergence of new problems have continued to escalate. A\nlook at Microbial Threats to Health: Emergence, Detection, and Response is\nworthwhile and a little scary.\n\n--\nC. J. Peters, MD\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch\n3.146 Keiller Building\n301 University Blvd\nGalveston, TX 77555-0609\n<cjpeters@utmb.edu >\n\n[Dr. Peters is raising some very good points in his discussion. It seems\nonly logical that a good infrastructure that will allow for early detection\nand identification of emerging infectious diseases would be a major\ncomponent of biologic terrorism.

We understand that you are closer to identifying the cause of this\ndisease. Is that true? Could we have more information?\nA. Dr Klaus Stohr: Since yesterday [Thurs 20 Mar 2003], 2 more laboratories\nhave identified the Paramyxoviridae virus in specimens from patients with\nSARS. One of the laboratories could identify one of these viruses as a\nvirus that could be isolated with culture outside the patient. The tests\nare currently ongoing. We are having another telephone conference today at\n13:30. We really have to look at the data. We are cautiously optimistic.\nBut we also want to come out with the facts. We have to wait until we have\nthe data.\nQ. Have you pursued this line of investigation in China as well? Has the\nteam arrived there?\nA. Dr David Heymann: As you know, we have had reports from the Chinese\ngovernment on tests that they\u0092ve done and also on some organism that they\nhave identified. They have identified Chlamydia but incidentally. But they\ndon\u0092t think this is the cause of the outbreak. A WHO team will arrive this\nweekend to review the records supplied by the Chinese authorities. We\nexpect to have more information available early next week. We are now\ncloser to reality that this Paramyxoviridae virus has caused this, you have\nto realize this is a whole range of different viruses, from some that cause\nmeasles and mumps and from some that cause common respiratory infections in\nmany people and which are sometimes even asymptomatic. Just because we\nfound it circulating in some people does not mean that it is not\ncirculating in others. A whole series of studies have to be done to find\nout if this is the cause. And if this is the cause, what this extended\nspread would be.\nQ. Could you please expand on your statement that you are 'cautiously\noptimistic' that you have found the causative agent?\nA. Dr Klaus Stohr: The WHO collaborating multi-centre project is turning\naround data within one week which are normally distributed and digested and\nlook at in months or years. More and more laboratories are finding\nParamyxoviridae virus. What is promising is that many other Paramyxoviridae\nviruses can be excluded. Hendra and Nipah virus have not been found, nor\nhave mumps and measles. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in few\nsamples. What is promising is that in one sample the virus was found by\nelectron microscope and no other Paramyxoviridae virus could be detected.\nSo we have a Paramyxoviridae virus-like particle which is not any of the\nknown Paramyxoviridae viruses. That is what we are looking at. Next steps\nare more cell culture, and more particle trials perhaps in animals. In\nessence, we are turning around information usually generated in months or\nyears within hours and days.\nQ. I am not a medical expert, but once you have virus detected and\nidentified and determined, what do we do next? Where do we go from here?\nA. Dr David Heymann: Let me try and explain. Once the cause is identified,\nthen a diagnostic test can be made. A test which may detect infection in\nblood or other body secretions. Once this had been done we must use what we\ncall 'Koch's postulate' to tell us if we have an organism, and we must be\nclear that this organism is causing the disease. Then epidemiological\nstudies are needed to determine whether the disease is asymptomatic in some\npeople who have become sick or whether they are healthy and can be removed\nfrom the list. There is a whole process of epidemiological investigations\nafter the virus is identified.\nQ. Last time, WHO's overall assessment was that the outbreak was being\ncontained outside China, Hong Kong, and Viet Nam. What is your assessment\nbased on information now?\nA. Dr Julie Hall: Figures of verified and confirmed cases are published on\nthe web every afternoon. There will be more figures this afternoon. I think\nthat what is clear is that the major areas of transmission of this disease\nare in Hong Kong, Viet Nam and, obviously we have yet to see, China.\nHopefully we will have much more information next week. What we do know is\nthat cases that have occurred outside these countries have occurred in\nhospital with no further spread of infection. What is very promising is\nthat heightened surveillance, early signs and symptoms, people can be taken\ninto protective hospital environment to prevent further transmission of\nthis disease.\nThe WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network has 3 field teams\ncurrently undertaking advanced epidemiological investigations. In Viet Nam,\nWHO has a 9-person team, in Hong Kong 6 persons, and by the end of the\nweekend we hope to have 5 people in Beijing. Institutions from the\nfollowing countries and people drawn from WHO and GOARN are represented in\nthese teams \u00ad- New Zealand, USA, Japan, Australia, Sweden, Germany, France,\nand the UK. These 3 field teams are working extremely hard to get as much\ninformation as possible on what is happening in hospitals and in\ncommunities. Where we have effective hospital infection control\ntransmission is dramatically reduced. And where patients are given good\nsupportive care, especially in intensive care units, a small number of\npatients are stabilizing and may be discharged from hospital.\nQ. You mentioned earlier that for the core cases of chlamydia identified by\nthe Chinese authorities, they did not believe that this was cause of\noutbreak. Once the team is in China, do you expect that we will have a\nclearer picture?\nA. Dr David Heymann: What the Chinese have told us is that they identified\nChlamydia in core specimens and that these were preliminary results. They\nhave not yet determined what is causing the outbreak in China.\nQ. We ask whether we have a community outbreak in Hong Kong, but the Hong\nKong authorities maintain that this is not the case.\nA. Dr David Heymann: What we see is that initial cases are admitted to a\nhospital. Those cases are then in close contact with health workers and it\nis health workers who became infected first. So last Saturday, based on the\ninformation from we had from Hong Kong and Viet Nam, more than 90 per cent\nof all the cases were health workers, the other 10 per cent were index\ncases, that is cases who were admitted to hospital with the disease before\nhealth workers were infected or their family members had got infection.\nWhat we are trying to prevent is the cases going from family members and\nhealth workers to others who are not in the family. If that would occur, it\nwould be a community outbreak, that is, within the larger community than\nhealth workers and their families.\nDr Guenael Rodier: When dealing with a community outbreak, it means that\nthe chain of transmission spreads rapidly and it is difficult to trace it\nretrospectively. The question is who infected whom. In these cases, it was\neasier because it always starts with a health care worker and the disease\nis transmitted by close contact with the patient. We have a major pattern\nof nosocomial or hospital acquired infection.\nDr Max Hardiman: The WHO travel advisory issued last Saturday was based on\na risk assessment and the quality of the cases being described and located\nwithin hospitals. Other than health care workers and their families, there\nis no transmission going on in communities to which travellers may become\nexposed. That is why we have reviewed the new information and the WHO\nadvice stills stands: no restriction on travel is recommended.\nQ. Given what has happened over the past 10 days, how would you rate the\ninternational health community\u0092s performance in coping this new and\nmysterious disease?\nA. Dr David Heymann: For the past 7 years we have been strengthening WHO\u0092s\nability to deal with infections that are of global and international\nimportance. We have done this through various measures that permit us now\nto alert health facilities very rapidly. This is particularly important now\nthat diseases have potential to travel around the world, or where a disease\nis naturally occurring without known cause or suspected of being\ndeliberately caused. We have learned many lessons in the past week and see\nplaces where the links can be strengthened through our ministries of\nhealth, between countries and within WHO to make the next event more easy\nto manage. This is being undertaken within the context of the revision of\nthe International Health Regulations. We have seen that WHO can be\noperational in this area. Through the global surveillance network, WHO has\nprevented many additional cases of transmission.\nDr Guenael Rodier: This has been a good exercise in preparation. The global\ncommunity is responding very positively and seriously to this alert. This\nreal exercise shows that the system can work and that there is\njustification for such a global alert, which will be a mechanism that\nfunctions as the operational arm of the International Heath Regulations.\nQ. You said there was room for improvement. Could you elaborate?\nA. Dr David Heymann: We live in a world that is not only globalized but\ninter-connected. We need to make that interconnection even stronger. This\nwill be part of the strengthening of the International Health Regulations\nso that better channels of communication exist to communicate directly with\ngovernments. We had several ways of communicating the global alert and we\nchose the press to disseminate this information directly to governments. In\nthe future we can choose the press and electronic networks.\nDr Julie Hall: Through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network WHO\nis able to mount a response within 24 hours. The network consists of over\n150 institutions around the world. Through the network, we have been able\nto get personnel to go to the field, to get guidance and advice and to\ngather protective equipment and other supplies within 24 hours. WHO was\nable to mount an unprecedented response to this infection through the\nglobal alert.\nQ. What is the WHO global updated figure, including China, of suspected\ncases and deaths? Last time I asked you whether you had given up on influenza.\nA. Dr David Heymann: Influenza has not been isolated from any of the\npatients in this outbreak. Therefore influenza as a working hypothesis has\nbeen replaced by that of Paramyxoviridae virus. Influenza is very low on\nour list of suspicion. Global figures as of today will be released at\n16h00. [see part [1] above].\nQ. Do I understand from what you have said that Paramyxoviridae virus may\nbe present in healthy people?\nA. Dr David Heymann: The reason that we need to have a diagnostic test is\nto be sure that Paramyxoviridae virus is not floating around in\nasymptomatic people. We need to see if these people were exposed less\nintensively than others who got a mild infection or did not show any\nsymptoms at all. Regarding China, there may have been a related outbreak in\nthe same geographical area and in same time period in Guangdong where 305\ncases were found. Those cases were given to us by the Chinese government in\nFebruary [2003]. This will be verified as teams begin to work in China and\nwill be fully reported.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In today's update there are now 350 reported suspected/confirmed cases of\nSARS with 10 reported deaths; a case fatality rate of 2.9 per cent.

The new cases are both close contacts of the\ncases. In total, 23 cases of SARS have been reported. Other than the\ninitial 3 cases, the additional 20 patients are all close contacts of\npatients with SARS, 8 of them being hospital staff. All the patients are\nstable, except for 4 patients who are in a serious condition.\nThe Ministry of Health would like to appeal to the public to avoid travel\nto Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Guangdong province in China for the time being,\nunless absolutely necessary. This would help us greatly in our efforts to\ncontain the number of new cases. We hope that we will continue to see a\ndecreasing number of cases of SARS as we have put in place the necessary\nprecautionary measures.\nWe also advise you to stay calm and continue with your daily routine.\nThough SARS is infectious, there is no need for alarm as your risk of SARS\nis low. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that the disease\nis spread from person to person but only through close contact with an\ninfected person. There is no evidence to date that the disease spreads\nthrough casual contact. Apart from the initial 3 cases, those who came down\nwith SARS in Singapore were family members and friends, and hospital staff\nwho had come into close contacts with the infected patients.\nThe Ministry would like to reiterate that you should seek immediate medical\nattention if you have:\n- fever (greater than 38 degrees Celsius) and respiratory symptoms\nincluding cough, shortness of breath, or breathing difficulty;\nAND\n- have travelled to Hong Kong, Hanoi, or Guangdong province in China,\nwithin 2 weeks of onset of the symptoms; or\n- are a close contact of a person(s) diagnosed with SARS.

The number\nof cases without such close contact remains small, and no data indicate\nthat this number is rapidly increasing. Based on current knowledge, WHO\nconsiders that the emergency travel advice issued on Sat 15 Mar 2003\nremains valid.\nWHO advises that no restrictions on travel to any destination are\nnecessary. Persons travelling to Asia and the Far East should be aware of\nthe major symptoms of SARS, and of the need to report promptly to a health\ncare worker in the unlikely event that they fall ill during their travel or\nafter returning home.\nFor the full WHO travel advice and additional information about this\ndisease go to <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/>.\nCurrent situation: Isolated cases of suspected SARS continue to be reported\nin new countries. As of today, health authorities are investigating\nreported cases in Canada, China, Taiwan (China), Germany, Hong Kong Special\nAdministrative Region of China, Singapore, Slovenia, Thailand, Viet Nam,\nand the United Kingdom. Further details, including cumulative number of\ncases and deaths, are given in the table below\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/tablemarch18/en/>.\nCumulative number of reported suspect and probable cases from 1 Feb to 18\nMar 2003\nCountry / cumulative no. cases / no. deaths / local transmission\nGermany / 2 / 0/ none*\nCanada / 8 / 2/ yes\nChina / +\nSingapore/ 23 / 0 / yes\nHong Kong SAR China/ 123 / 1** / yes\nTaiwan, China/ 3 / 0 / yes\nThailand / 1 / 0 / none*\nViet Nam / 57 / 1 / yes\nSlovenia / 1 / 0 / none*\nUnited Kingdom / 1 / 0 / none*\nTotal: 219 / 4 / not applicable\nIt is possible for the status of a reported case to change over time. SARS\nis a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that whenever a known cause is\nfound that could fully account for a patient's clinical condition, this\npatient should no longer be considered to be a case of SARS.\nTwo cases attributed to Switzerland on 17 Mar 2003 no longer fulfilled the\ncase definition of SARS after further clinical assessment.\n+ The Chinese authorities have reported suspect and probable cases in\nGuangdong province. Figures are being updated.\n* No documented secondary transmission in-country. No affected areas.\n**The death attributed to Hong Kong SAR of China occurred in a case\nmedically transferred from Viet Nam.\nAt present, the vast majority of cases are concentrated in Hong Kong\nSpecial Administrative Region of China and Hanoi, Viet Nam. Singapore is\ncurrently reporting the third largest number of cases. All reported cases\nin other parts of the world are linked to travel within the past 10 days to\none of these destinations. It remains undetermined whether an outbreak of\natypical pneumonia in southern China, which began in November, is related\nto the current outbreaks.\nIn Hanoi, 13 of the 57 patients are showing signs of clinical improvement.\nAwareness of the disease is now very high throughout the world.\nSurveillance is proving to be sensitive, with suspected cases rapidly\ndetected, reported to national authorities and WHO, and investigated\naccording to the standard case definition. An increase in the number of\nsuspected cases is to be expected in such an atmosphere of heightened\nawareness.\nIn areas where person to person transmission has been documented, cases\nhave occurred almost exclusively in health care workers or in people in\nvery close contact with patients, such as family members. Currently\navailable data indicate that transmission of the infectious agent requires\ndirect and close contact. There is no evidence of transmission following\ncasual contact.\nDue to heightened awareness, cases are now being quickly identified and\nimmediately isolated. No cases of secondary transmission are occurring\nfollowing the detection and proper management of imported cases.\nProtective measures and strict barrier nursing procedures are now in place\nin hospitals in all areas where cases have been reported. In areas where\nperson to person transmission has occurred, these measures are expected to\ndecrease transmission to health staff and families of patients. Strict\nprotective measures in countries managing imported cases are likewise\nexpected to reduce the risk that the disease will spread to others within\nthese countries.\nEfforts are under way to expedite identification of the causative agent,\nimprove diagnostic precision, and develop a diagnostic test. A network of\n11 highly qualified laboratories in 10 countries was established yesterday\nand has begun data sharing and regular reporting today.\nMany countries have activated well designed national preparedness plans for\ndealing with an emerging infectious disease. The global surveillance\nsystem, which WHO coordinates, is working well in the ways needed to\nprevent the outbreak from becoming a global epidemic.\n******\n[4]\nDate: 18 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CNN 18 Mar 2003 13:40 GMT [edited]\n<http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/03/18/mystery.disease.patient.ap/index.html>\n\nHONG KONG (AP): A pneumonia patient believed to have spread a mysterious\nrespiratory illness to dozens of hospital workers in Hong Kong traveled to\nmainland China before he became ill. Dr Leung Ping-chung, who has been\nworking throughout the pneumonia outbreak at Hong Kong's hardest-hit\nhospital, told the Associated Press the patient believed to have spread the\nillness was a man aged in his 40s who had visited Hainan island and other\nparts of southern China.

If we have inadvertently omitted your name,\nplease accept our apologies and our continued thanks for keeping us updated.\nAs we have mentioned in prior postings, the newswires are filled with\narticles on SARS. Numerous reports of suspected cases are followed only\nhours later by reports which say that the original suspected cases have\nbeen ruled out after further evaluation. (for example, the suspected cases\nin Leipzig Germany that we reported yesterday have been ruled out as cases\ntoday). Given this, we are choosing to be very cautious in our selection of\nnewswire reports for posting to avoid contributing to rumor mongering. At\nthis point, in the absence of a definitive etiology for SARS, suspected and\nprobable cases are defined based on clinical and epidemiologic criteria.\nMany of the newswire reports we have reviewed may be said to have, as a\nfunctional case definition, anyone with a respiratory illness who has been\nin areas identified as having cases of SARS (see [3] Worldwide update - WHO\nabove), and once evaluated by the formal sector are found not to meet the\ncase definitions established by WHO (see\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/casedefinition/en/>).\nIn [3] Worldwide update - WHO, there is mention that 'isolated cases of\nsuspected SARS continue to be reported in new countries. As of today,\nhealth authorities are investigating reported cases in Canada, China,\nTaiwan (China), Germany, Hong Kong SAR of China, Singapore, Slovenia,\nThailand, Viet Nam, and the United Kingdom.' Newswire reports also mention\nsuspected cases in the USA, Sweden, and Austria. Additional countries are\nlikely to be added to the list as the heightened alert brings cases to the\nattention of the authorities. In this era of rapid transport and extensive\ntravel, we live in a global village and should not be surprised to have\ncases among travellers who may have had close contact with SARS cases in\ncountries where transmission has been identified.\nIn [4] above, it is interesting that there was travel to southern China\npreceded the onset of illness.

Also it\nappears that barrier nursing precautions (see WHO Hospital Infection\nControl Guidance <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/infectioncontrol/en/>) in\nhospitals may be reducing transmission in this setting.

All\nare in hospital, except for 2 patients who have since recovered and been\ndischarged. These 2 patients were the initial cohort who had travelled to\nHong Kong. All the patients are stable except for 4 patients who are in\nserious condition.\nThe 8 additional patients reported today comprise 3 family members and\nfriends of patients, and 5 hospital staff who had attended to the patients.\nApart from the 3 initial people who had travelled to Hong Kong, a total of\n15 family and friends of cases, and 13 hospital staff have been diagnosed\nwith SARS. So far, all the cases of SARS have been linked to the initial 3\ncases. No new index cases have been reported. In addition, no further cases\nhave occurred among health care workers after the implementation of\nenhanced infection control precautions.\nPreliminary investigations by the Pathology Department at the Singapore\nGeneral Hospital and the Defence Medical Research Institute have identified\nthe likely infective agent to belong to the paramyxovirus family. This\ncorroborates early investigation results by overseas centers in Germany and\nHong Kong.\nThe Ministry of Health would like to appeal to the public to avoid travel\nto Hong Kong, Hanoi and Guangdong province in China for the time being,\nunless absolutely necessary. This would help us greatly in our efforts to\ncontain the number of new cases.\nWe also advise you to stay calm and continue with your daily routine.\nThough SARS is infectious, there is no need for alarm as your risk to SARS\nis low. WHO has reported that the disease is spread from person to person\nbut only through close contact with an infected person. There is no\nevidence to date that the disease spreads through casual contact.\nThe Ministry would like to reiterate that you should seek immediate medical\nattention if you have:\n- Fever (more than 38 degrees Celsius) and respiratory symptoms including\ncough, shortness of breath, or breathing difficulty;\nAND\n- have travelled to Hong Kong, Hanoi or Guangdong province in China, within\n2 weeks of onset of the symptoms; or\n- are a close contact of persons diagnosed with SARS.

They\ndeveloped pneumonia symptoms between 15 and 27 Feb 2003. The local\nresident, who has been identified as the index patient in the outbreak of\nPrince of Wales Hospital, had visited his friend staying in the hotel from\n15 to 23 Feb 2003. One patient, who became sick one week before staying at\nthe hotel, is believed to be the source of the infection.\nDr Chan stressed that there is no cause for panic among the hotel staff and\nvisitors staying in the hotel as well as residents living in the area as no\nother new cases have been detected since end of February 2003.\n'Investigations showed that the general environmental condition of the\nhotel is good and that hotel staff had not reported any sickness related to\nthe outbreak. The department considered that the source of the virus has\nnow been removed from the hotel. We believe there is no residual risk for\nresidents in the hotel. We believe that the transmission of the virus is by\nclose contact and should have been transient. There is no evidence of\nactive disease currently occurring in the hotel,' Dr Chan said.\nOn the request of DH, the hotel management has isolated the whole floor for\nthorough cleansing and disinfection as precautionary measures. 'The floor\nwill be re-opened upon DH's satisfaction with the process. Health advice\nwill be given to the hotel staff and DH will keep close medical\nsurveillance of them,' Dr Chan said.\nDH has set up a hotline (2961 8968) to provide health advice on the\nprevention of upper respiratory track infection.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) multi-country outbreak - update 5\n------------------------------------\nHighly specialized testing of specimens from patients ill with SARS\ncontinues at top speed in top labs, expedited by electronic sharing of\nresults. The World Health Organization (WHO) is increasingly optimistic\nthat conclusive identification of the causative agent can be announced\nsoon. The development of a precise diagnostic test could follow quickly.\nCollaboration in the race to find the causative agent is taking place\nwithin the framework of a network of labs set up on Monday.\n\nResearch is now focused on the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses. This\nfamily includes several well known viruses, such as those causing mumps,\nmeasles, and common respiratory ailments. It also includes a subfamily of\nviruses capable of infecting multiple animal species, including humans.\nThis subfamily was implicated in the emergence during the 1990s of new and\nsevere diseases in humans caused by Hendra and Nipah viruses. The virus\njumped directly from animal hosts (horses and pigs) to humans. No person to\nperson transmission was documented in outbreaks caused by either virus.\n\nWHO has today established a cooperative network of clinicians for SARS\ndiagnosis and treatment. The network brings together, via two daily\nteleconferences, clinicians in the most heavily affected Asian countries\nand in Europe and North America. Clinicians participate on the basis of\neither first-hand experience in the management of SARS cases or leading\nexpertise in the diagnosis and management of unusual infectious diseases.\n\nParticipants are pooling data on cases and sharing x-ray pictures. Chest\nx-rays are, at present, one of the main tools for distinguishing between\nsuspected and probable cases. Treatment guidelines, including criteria for\nsafe discharge of patients from hospitals, are also being established on\nthe basis of shared experiences.\n\nPending definitive identification of the causative agent, efforts to cure\ncases are based on a trial-and-error approach. WHO is providing support, in\nthe form of protective equipment and supplies, to help the most heavily\naffected hospitals prevent further spread within hospital settings, where\nthe overwhelming majority of new infections have occurred.\n\nIf a paramyxovirus is confirmed to be the cause, WHO will be in a much\nbetter position to recommend a treatment. The antiviral drug, ribavirin,\nmay be responsible for some degree of clinical improvement observed in\ncritically ill patients in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of\nChina. Intensive and good supportive care have also been associated with\nimproved prospects of recovery.\n\nAs of 20 Mar 2003, 306 suspected and probable cases, including 10 deaths,\nhave been reported from 11 countries. These figures represent an additional\n42 cases and one death compared with the previous day. Increases were\nreported in Canada (1), Hong Kong (23), Singapore (3), Taiwan, China (1),\nthe United Kingdom (1), and Viet Nam (6). Switzerland, reporting 7\nsuspected cases, was added to the list.\n\nPress reports have referred to 2 suspected cases of SARS, one in an airline\ncrew member and a second in a passenger, travelling on separate flights\nfrom Hong Kong and Taipei to Viet Nam. Both suspected cases have been\ninvestigated and are now ruled out as cases of SARS.\n\nWHO has welcomed a report from the Hong Kong Department of Health, released\nyesterday, that may have identified the 'index' case in the outbreak in the\nPrince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. In an outstanding example of\ndetective work, epidemiologists have determined that 7 people who\ncontracted SARS recently stayed in or visited the Metropole hotel in\nKowloon last month. The 7 people investigated include 3 visitors from\nSingapore, 2 from Canada, one China mainland visitor, and a local Hong Kong\nresident.\n\nThe investigation revealed that all 7 stayed in or visited the same floor\nof the hotel between 12 Feb 2003 and 2 Mar 2003. The local Hong Kong\nresident is believed to be the index case, who subsequently infected other\nearly cases in the outbreak. He had visited an acquaintance staying at the\nhotel from 15 to 23 Feb 2003. The visitor from mainland China, who became\nsick a week before staying at the hotel, is considered the original source\nof the infection. No further cases have been linked to the hotel.\n\nWHO is underscoring the need for continued vigilance. Experience with other\nemerging diseases makes it clear that, should the causative agent turn out\nto be a virus, the new disease could establish endemicity, especially in\nlight of abundantly documented human-to-human transmission. The world must\nprotect itself against the widespread establishment of another new\ninfectious disease.\n\nWHO's concern is now increasingly focused on preparation to assist\nvulnerable countries in the likely event that cases continue to spread. Up\nto now, all imported cases have occurred in countries well equipped and\nwell prepared to institute WHO-recommended precautions, including isolation\nand barrier nursing practices, for preventing spread to others, whether\nhealth care workers or family members. In view of the rapid spread of this\ndisease to new countries via exposed air travellers, any country with an\ninternational airport is potentially at risk.\n\nThis focus on preparedness underscores the need for a concerted effort to\ndefend global public health security. In an era of close interconnectedness\nand rapid air travel, an outbreak anywhere in the world is a potential\nthreat to health everywhere.\n\nInternational collaboration -\u00ad on the part of the medical and research\ncommunities, multinational teams in the field, and health authorities\naround the world \u00ad- in the reporting, investigation, and management of this\noutbreak has been outstanding.\n\nB.

This 32 year old male had a trip to Gaungdong, China, and Hong Kong\nfrom 4 to 6 Mar 2003. On 13 Mar 2003, he suffered from high fever,\nheadache, and cough with sputum. He visited a regional hospital in Chia-yi\nCounty in Taiwan, and his chest radiograph disclosed pulmonary infiltrates\nover the left lower lobe. He was immediately hospitalized and under the\nsuspicion of SARS.\n\nAll necessary sampling for pathogen studies and isolation procedures have\nbeen undertaken for this individual. CDC in Taiwan has implemented the\nsurveillance system for SARS. A 24 hour 0-800 toll-free hotline and timely\nupdated website <http://www.cdc.gov.tw/atyp/> have been established. So\nfar, there has been no evidence of community spread except the second case\nwho is the wife of the first reported case. However, a few suspected\nindividuals have been reported to the CDC, Taiwan, to this day and further\nconfirmation is undertaken.\n\nAs of March 20, 4 cases of SARS were identified in Taiwan, in 3 families\nand currently treated in 3 hospitals. With respect to results of lab\ndiagnosis, specimen tests for influenza virus type A,BB, BH5, BH7, BH9,\nparainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Herpes virus,\nand Nipah virus are all negative.\n\n(Additional comment by Prof Peter WS Chang MD, PMP, ScD: 'Director Dr Chen\nof the Taiwan Center for Disease Control has just submitted this update of\nSARS case report in Taiwan and other related information. As I am aware,\nthe doctors in Taiwan have observed viral particles under the electron\nmicroscope at March 18th, same as reported in Germany and Hong Kong. They\nare working on the molecular confirmation at these hours. However, it is\nstill not clear the paramyxovirus are the real etiology for the SARS, even\nit is in the specimen. It can be an associate factor, though. Also, it\nneeds more study on the immunity of these patients and the exploration/\nunderstanding on the mechanisms for this epidemic. The answers remained to\nbe worked out by collaborative efforts in the region in the coming days.')\n\n[The nomenclature used in this report for the influenza viral testing is\nnot the conventional nomenclature. There are no accepted H and N antigenic\ntype designations for influenza B viruses. The B viruses do not exhibit as\nmuch antigenic variation as the A viruses and influenza B viruses have no\nanimal reservoirs. The H5, H7 and H9 designations presumably refer to avian\ninfluenza viruses, but rather than speculate it is better to request\nfurther clarification of this. With respect to the other viruses, it is\ncrucial to know the nature of the diagnostic tests employed in order to\nfully interpret these results.

The illness is being referred to as severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome (SARS). This report describes the scope of the outbreak,\npreliminary case definition, and interim infection control guidance for the\nUnited States.\n\nOn 11 Feb 2003, the Chinese Ministry of Health notified WHO that 305 cases\nof acute respiratory syndrome of unknown etiology had occurred in 6\nmunicipalities in Guangdong province in southern China from 16 Nov 2002 to\n9 Feb 2003. The disease was characterized by transmission to health care\nworkers and household contacts; 5 deaths were reported (1). On 26 Feb 2003,\na man aged 47 years who had traveled in mainland China and Hong Kong became\nill with a respiratory illness and was admitted to hospital shortly after\narriving in Hanoi, Vietnam. Health care providers at the hospital in Hanoi\nsubsequently developed a similar illness. The patient died on 13 Mar 2003\nafter transfer to an isolation facility in Hong Kong. In late February, an\noutbreak of a similar respiratory illness was reported in Hong Kong among\nworkers at another hospital; this cluster was linked to a patient who had\ntraveled previously to southern China. On 12 Mar 2003, WHO issued a global\nalert about the outbreak and instituted worldwide surveillance.\n\nAs of 19 Mar 2003, WHO has received reports of 264 patients from 11\ncountries with suspected and probable* SARS [see table on website\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5211a5.htm>, the same table\ncontained in the ProMED-mail posting of 19 Mar 2003 with WHO worldwide\nupdate figures]. Areas with reported local transmission include Hong Kong\nand Guangdong province, China; Hanoi, Vietnam; and Singapore. More limited\ntransmission has been reported in Taipei, Taiwan, and Toronto, Canada. The\ninitial cases reported in Singapore, Taiwan, and Toronto had all traveled\nto China.\n\nOn 15 Mar 2003, after issuing a preliminary case definition for suspected\ncases (Box, CDC initiated enhanced domestic surveillance for SARS, CDC also\nadvised that people planning nonessential travel to Hong Kong, Guangdong,\nor Hanoi consider postponing their travel\n(http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/acute_resp_syn_multi.htm). On 16 Mar 2003,\nCDC began advising passengers arriving on direct flights from these 3\nlocations to seek medical attention if they had symptoms of febrile\nrespiratory illness. As of 18 Mar 2003, about 12 000 advisory notices had\nbeen distributed to airline passengers. In addition, surveillance is being\nheightened for suspected cases of SARS among arriving passengers. As of 19\nMar 2003, a total of 11 suspected cases of SARS in the United States are\nunder investigation by CDC and state health authorities.\n\nAmong patients reported worldwide as of 19 Mar 2003, the disease has been\ncharacterized by rapid onset of high fever, myalgia, chills, rigor, and\nsore throat, followed by shortness of breath, cough, and radiographic\nevidence of pneumonia. The incubation period has generally been 3 to 5 days\n(range: 2 to 7 days). Laboratory findings have included thrombocytopenia\nand leukopenia. Many patients have had respiratory distress or severe\npneumonia requiring hospital admission, and several have required\nmechanical ventilation. Of the 264 suspected and probable cases reported by\nWHO, 9 people (3 per cent) have died. In addition, secondary attack rates\nof greater than 50 per cent have been observed among health care workers\ncaring for patients with SARS in both Hong Kong and Hanoi. Additional\nclinical and epidemiological details are available from WHO at\n<http://www.who.int/wer/pdf/2003/wer7812.pdf>.\n\nIn the United States, initial diagnostic testing for people with suspected\nSARS should include chest radiograph, pulse oximetry, blood cultures,\nsputum Gram stain and culture, and testing for viral respiratory pathogens,\nparticularly influenza types A and B and respiratory syncytial virus.\nClinicians should save any available clinical specimens (for example,\nrespiratory samples, blood, serum, tissue, and biopsies) for additional\ntesting until diagnosis is confirmed. Instructions for specimen collection\nare available from CDC at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/pdf/specimencollection-sars.pdf>. Specimens\nshould be forwarded to CDC by state health departments after consultation\nwith the SARS State Support Team at the CDC Emergency Operations Center.\n\nClinicians evaluating suspected cases should use standard precautions (for\nexample, hand hygiene) together with airborne (for example, N-95\nrespirator) and contact (for example, gowns and gloves) precautions\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/infectioncontrol.htm>). Until the mode of\ntransmission has been defined more precisely, eye protection also should be\nworn for all patient contact. As more clinical and epidemiological\ninformation becomes available, interim recommendations will be updated.\n\nReported by: CDC SARS Investigative Team; AT Fleischauer, PhD, EIS Officer,\nCDC.\n\nMMWR Editorial Note:\nDuring 2000, about 83 million nonresident passengers arrived in China, 13\nmillion in Hong Kong, and 2 million in Vietnam, and about 460 000 residents\nof China, Hong Kong, and Vietnam traveled to the United States (2). During\n1 Jan 1997 -- 18 Mar 2003, an estimated 5 per cent of ill tourists\nworldwide who sought post-travel care from one of 35 worldwide GeoSentinel\ntravel clinics had pneumonia (International Society of Tropical Medicine,\nunpublished data, 2003). In the United States, about 500 000 people with\npneumonia require hospital admission each year; in about half of these\ncases, no etiologic agent is identified despite intensive investigation\n(3,4). On the basis of these data and the broad and necessarily nonspecific\ncase definition, cases meeting the criteria for SARS are anticipated\nworldwide and in the United States. However, most of the anticipated cases\nare expected to be unrelated to the current outbreak.\n\nElectron microscopic identification of paramxyovirus-like particles has\nbeen reported from Germany and Hong Kong (5). This family of viruses\nincludes measles, mumps, human parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory\nsyncytial virus in addition to the recently identified henipaviruses and\nmetapneumovirus. Additional testing is under way to confirm a definitive\netiology. Identification of the causative agent should lead to specific\ndiagnostic tests, simplify surveillance, and focus treatment guidelines and\ninfection control guidance.\n\nReferences\n1.

As of 19 Mar 2003, 264\nsuspect and probable cases have been reported to WHO since 1 Feb 2003 (2).\nThe surveillance case definitions have been modified (see below).\nSo far, 56 cases have been reported in Hanoi (Vietnam) and 150 cases in\nHong Kong, the 2 areas where the first cases were reported (3), 31 cases\nhave been notified in Singapore, 3 in Taiwan, one imported case from Hanoi\nhas been reported in Thailand, 8 patients have been reported in Canada, one\nin Germany, one in Slovenia, and 2 in the United Kingdom (UK).\n\nCase definitions for surveillance of SARS, revised 18 Mar 2003\n\nSuspect Case\nA person presenting after 1 Feb 2003 with history of high fever (greater\nthan 38 C)\nAND\none or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath,\ndifficulty breathing\nAND one or more of the following:\n- close contact (having cared for, having lived with, or having had direct\ncontact with respiratory secretions and body fluids of a person with SARS),\nwithin 10 days of onset of symptoms, with a person who has been diagnosed\nwith SARS\n- history of travel, within 10 days of onset of symptoms, to an area in\nwhich there are reported foci of transmission of SARS.\n\nProbable Case\nA suspect case with chest x-ray findings of pneumonia or respiratory\ndistress syndrome\nOR\nA person with an unexplained respiratory illness resulting in death, with\nan autopsy examination demonstrating the pathology of respiratory distress\nsyndrome without an identifiable cause.\n\nIn addition to fever and respiratory symptoms, SARS may be associated with\nother symptoms including headache, muscular stiffness, loss of appetite,\nmalaise, confusion, rash, and diarrhea. To date, 5 deaths in the recent\noutbreak have been reported. Over 90 per cent of the cases are in health\ncare workers, of whom most have been in close contact with other cases.\n\nThe mode of transmission is not confirmed, but is thought to occur by\ndroplet spread and/or body fluid contact. There is no evidence so far that\ntransmission can occur through casual contact. The incubation period ranges\nfrom 4 to 7 days. Although a wide range of laboratory tests have been\nconducted, no causal agent has yet been found. It has been reported that a\nvirus of the Paramyxoviridae family has been recently identified in samples\nfrom some cases (4), but it seems too early at this point to attribute the\noutbreak to this cause.\n\nNo recommendation to restrict travel to any country has been issued, but\nWHO stresses the importance for travellers and airlines to be aware of the\nmain symptoms of the disease (1).\n\nInvestigations are ongoing in the affected countries. Epidemiologists, and\nexperts in case management, infection control and microbiology from WHO and\nseveral European and international organisations are assisting in the\nmanagement of the outbreak (2). In Europe, public health institutes are\ndeveloping national response plans based on WHO recommendations (1). On 18\nMarch, the European Commission convened a meeting of European experts to\nagree a common response to this outbreak and propose consensus guidelines\nfor advice and information.\n\nUpdates on the developing situation are also available from WHO, on ProMED,\nand at the websites of various national public health organisations,\nincluding CDC, Health Canada, and the Public Health Laboratory Service in\nthe UK.\n\nReferences :\n1.

It has been reported that a\nvirus of the Paramyxoviridae family has been recently identified in samples\nfrom some cases (4), but it seems too early at this point to attribute the\noutbreak to this cause. In the United States, initial diagnostic testing for people with suspected\nSARS should include chest radiograph, pulse oximetry, blood cultures,\nsputum Gram stain and culture, and testing for viral respiratory pathogens,\nparticularly influenza types A and B and respiratory syncytial virus. \n\nAdditional national website links for information on SARS reported in\ncountries not mentioned in the above posting include: United Kingdom - PHLS\n<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/menu.htm>\n On 16 Mar 2003,\nCDC began advising passengers arriving on direct flights from these 3\nlocations to seek medical attention if they had symptoms of febrile\nrespiratory illness. Since late February 2003, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) have been supporting the World Health Organization (WHO) in the\ninvestigation of a multicountry outbreak of atypical pneumonia of unknown\netiology. In the United States, about 500 000 people with\npneumonia require hospital admission each year; in about half of these\ncases, no etiologic agent is identified despite intensive investigation\n(3,4). In late February, an\noutbreak of a similar respiratory illness was reported in Hong Kong among\nworkers at another hospital; this cluster was linked to a patient who had\ntraveled previously to southern China. On 26 Feb 2003,\na man aged 47 years who had traveled in mainland China and Hong Kong became\nill with a respiratory illness and was admitted to hospital shortly after\narriving in Hanoi, Vietnam. With respect to results of lab\ndiagnosis, specimen tests for influenza virus type A,BB, BH5, BH7, BH9,\nparainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Herpes virus,\nand Nipah virus are all negative. This family of viruses\nincludes measles, mumps, human parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory\nsyncytial virus in addition to the recently identified henipaviruses and\nmetapneumovirus.

Updates on the developing situation are also available from WHO, on ProMED,\nand at the websites of various national public health organisations,\nincluding CDC, Health Canada, and the Public Health Laboratory Service in\nthe UK. Experience with other\nemerging diseases makes it clear that, should the causative agent turn out\nto be a virus, the new disease could establish endemicity, especially in\nlight of abundantly documented human-to-human transmission. In an outstanding example of\ndetective work, epidemiologists have determined that 7 people who\ncontracted SARS recently stayed in or visited the Metropole hotel in\nKowloon last month. On 18\nMarch, the European Commission convened a meeting of European experts to\nagree a common response to this outbreak and propose consensus guidelines\nfor advice and information. WHO is providing support, in\nthe form of protective equipment and supplies, to help the most heavily\naffected hospitals prevent further spread within hospital settings, where\nthe overwhelming majority of new infections have occurred.

On the basis of these data and the broad and necessarily nonspecific\ncase definition, cases meeting the criteria for SARS are anticipated\nworldwide and in the United States.

Clinicians participate on the basis of\neither first-hand experience in the management of SARS cases or leading\nexpertise in the diagnosis and management of unusual infectious diseases. So\nfar, there has been no evidence of community spread except the second case\nwho is the wife of the first reported case. No recommendation to restrict travel to any country has been issued, but\nWHO stresses the importance for travellers and airlines to be aware of the\nmain symptoms of the disease (1). In addition to fever and respiratory symptoms, SARS may be associated with\nother symptoms including headache, muscular stiffness, loss of appetite,\nmalaise, confusion, rash, and diarrhea. Clinicians should save any available clinical specimens (for example,\nrespiratory samples, blood, serum, tissue, and biopsies) for additional\ntesting until diagnosis is confirmed. De Benoist, A-C, Boccia D. WHO initiates enhanced global surveillance in\nresponse to acute respiratory syndrome in China, Vietnam, and Hong Kong,\nspecial administrative region (SAR) of China. During 2000, about 83 million nonresident passengers arrived in China, 13\nmillion in Hong Kong, and 2 million in Vietnam, and about 460 000 residents\nof China, Hong Kong, and Vietnam traveled to the United States (2). In addition, secondary attack rates\nof greater than 50 per cent have been observed among health care workers\ncaring for patients with SARS in both Hong Kong and Hanoi. \nCumulative number of cases includes number of deaths.\n SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME - WORLDWIDE (11)\n**************************************************\n Patients, patients' family members & visitors PWH, PMH, KWH, PYNEH, QEH,\nTKOH & Queen Mary Hospital 74 (71)\n The total number of admissions is released after collating, analysing, and\nconfirming the clinical symptoms and test results of the patients\nconcerned. There was some\nnewswire coverage of a few possible SARS cases in Beijing, but official\nreports are still pending. This report describes the scope of the outbreak,\npreliminary case definition, and interim infection control guidance for the\nUnited States. This\nfamily includes several well known viruses, such as those causing mumps,\nmeasles, and common respiratory ailments. In an era of close interconnectedness\nand rapid air travel, an outbreak anywhere in the world is a potential\nthreat to health everywhere. Identification of the causative agent should lead to specific\ndiagnostic tests, simplify surveillance, and focus treatment guidelines and\ninfection control guidance. However, a few suspected\nindividuals have been reported to the CDC, Taiwan, to this day and further\nconfirmation is undertaken. This means that whenever a known cause is\nfound that could fully account for a patient's clinical condition, this\npatient should no longer be considered to be a case of SARS. The B viruses do not exhibit as\nmuch antigenic variation as the A viruses and influenza B viruses have no\nanimal reservoirs. Treatment guidelines, including criteria for\nsafe discharge of patients from hospitals, are also being established on\nthe basis of shared experiences. Highly specialized testing of specimens from patients ill with SARS\ncontinues at top speed in top labs, expedited by electronic sharing of\nresults. Incidence of community-acquired\npneumonia requiring hospitalization: results of a population-based active\nsurveillance study in Ohio. In view of the rapid spread of this\ndisease to new countries via exposed air travellers, any country with an\ninternational airport is potentially at risk. China: +\nGermany 1 / 0 / none*\n admitted to:\nKwong Wah Hospital 4 (4)\n As I am aware,\nthe doctors in Taiwan have observed viral particles under the electron\nmicroscope at March 18th, same as reported in Germany and Hong Kong. The World Health Organization (WHO) is increasingly optimistic\nthat conclusive identification of the causative agent can be announced\nsoon. With respect to the other viruses, it is\ncrucial to know the nature of the diagnostic tests employed in order to\nfully interpret these results. The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n Also, it\nneeds more study on the immunity of these patients and the exploration/\nunderstanding on the mechanisms for this epidemic. Until the mode of\ntransmission has been defined more precisely, eye protection also should be\nworn for all patient contact. The H5, H7 and H9 designations presumably refer to avian\ninfluenza viruses, but rather than speculate it is better to request\nfurther clarification of this.

Any\ntraveller who develops these symptoms is advised not to undertake further\ntravel until they have recovered.\n\nAIRLINES: Should a passenger or crew member who meets the criteria above\ntravel on a flight, the aircraft should alert the destination airport. On\narrival the sick passenger should be referred to airport health authorities\nfor assessment and management. The aircraft passengers and crew should be\ninformed of the person's status as a suspect case of SARS. The passengers\nand crew should provide all contact details for the subsequent 14 days to\nthe airport health authorities. There are currently no indications to\nrestrict the onward travel of healthy passengers, but all passengers and\ncrew should be advised to seek medical attention if they develop the\nsymptoms highlighted above. There is currently no indication to provide\npassengers and crew with any medication or investigation unless they become\nill.\n\nIn the absence of specific information regarding the nature of the organism\ncausing this illness, specific measures to be applied to the aircraft\ncannot be recommended.

SARS is an infectious disease of unknown\netiology characterized by atypical pneumonia (see WHO press release of 15\nMar 2003 and additional information at <http://www.who.int>)\nThe disease is spread from person to person but only through close contact\nwith a case. To date, almost all reported cases have occurred in health\nworkers involved in the direct care of reported cases or in close contacts,\nsuch as family members. There is no evidence to date that the disease\nspreads though casual contact.\nThe WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network is coordinating an\ninternational multicenter effort to identify the causative agent. The\nproject unites 11 laboratories in 10 countries. Participating laboratories\nhave the most experience to date in diagnosis of cases, or are known for\ntheir high-level facilities and expertise. The collaborative effort will\nalso improve diagnostic precision and move work forward on the development\nof a diagnostic test. WHO is also working with health authorities to\nidentify an effective treatment for SARS.\nWHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response teams in Hanoi and Hong Kong Special\nAdministrative Region (SAR), China, where the most new cases are presently\nconcentrated, are assisting health authorities in outbreak management and\nin the collection of epidemiological and clinical data that can improve\nunderstanding of SARS.\nThrough its regional office in Manila, Philippines, WHO is establishing\nlogistics bases and supply chains to ensure rapid provision of protective\nequipment and medicines needed for outbreak response.\nChinese authorities have now issued a summary report on an outbreak of what\nmay be the same or a related disease that began in Guangdong province in\nsouthern China in November 2002 and peaked in mid-February 2003. The\nChinese report, which includes data on the diagnosis and management of more\nthan 300 cases, is presently undergoing analysis and is expected to further\ncontribute to understanding about the syndrome and possible links among the\nvarious outbreaks. The Chinese report, which covers the largest number of\ncases to date, may also boost international efforts to establish effective\ntreatment guidelines, should a relationship between the outbreaks be\nestablished.\nThe Ministry of Health of China has requested support from an international\nteam. A WHO team is now being assembled.\nHealth authorities around the world are now alert to the risk of SARS.\nTracking of the course of the epidemic shows that surveillance systems are\nsensitive, communication channels are open, and reporting is rapid.\nInformation on cases compiled over the past 3 weeks is expected to shed new\nlight on the behaviour of this disease.\nThe speed of international travel creates a risk of rapid spread to\nadditional areas. Because the clinical course and epidemiological behaviour\nof this disease are poorly understood, WHO is calling upon national health\nauthorities to maintain close vigilance for suspected cases. There is no\ncurrent justification for any restriction in travel or trade.\nDaily summary of reported cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\nCumulative number of reported suspect and probable cases of Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndrome (SARS)\n<http://www.who.int/csr/table/en/index.html>\nFrom: 1 Feb 2003\nTo: 17 Mar 2003\nCountry: Total no. case(s) / No. deaths / Local transmission\nGermany: 1 / 0/ None*\nCanada: 8/ 2/ Yes\nSingapore: 20/ 0/ Yes\nHong Kong SAR China: 95 / 1**/ Yes\nSwitzerland: 2/ 0/ To be determined\nThailand: 1/ 0/ None*\nViet Nam: 40/ 1/ Yes\nTotal: 167/ 4\nNotes:\n* Imported cases immediately isolated.

The patient is a medical doctor from Singapore who treated one\nof the earliest cases of SARS there between 3 and 9 Mar 2003. On 9 Mar 2003\nhe himself developed fever (39.4\u00b0C), myalgia\nand bone pain but did not have cough, dyspnoea or sore throat. Despite\nthis, he flew to New York City to attend a medical meeting, accompanied by\nhis wife who is also a doctor and by his mother-in-law. In New York he\nexperienced a disseminated, transient rash. Because of persistent fever he\nsought medical attention in New York. A chest X-ray revealed a pneumonic\ninfiltrate of the lingula (left lobe), and antibiotic treatment using\nlevofloxacin was initiated.\nBecause he continued to feel unwell, he decided to return to Singapore via\nFrankfurt on 14 Mar 2003. During the first leg of this flight he developed\nfever again with deterioration of his general condition. In addition, his\nmother-in-law had developed a sore throat the day before and became febrile\non the day of departure (14 Mar 2003). In accordance with the global alert\nabout cases of atypical pneumonia recently issued by WHO\n(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2003/pr22/en/>), an international\nhealth alert was declared after consultation between the Ministry of Health\nof Singapore and the German Health Authorities and the plane was met at\nFrankfurt airport by health officials (see also\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_15/en/>). The index patient, his\nmother-in-law and his pregnant wife - who felt well and had no signs or\nsymptoms - were admitted to the Isolation Unit at Frankfurt University\nHospital under full biosafety precautions.\nAt admission, the index patient was still febrile up to 39.6\u00b0C, with\nelevated CRP [C-reactive protein - used to assess an acute phase reaction\nin inflammatory and infective processes with an elevated value interpreted\nas an indication of an acute phase response or active disease - Mod.MPP],\nleukopenia and mild elevation of transaminases and LDH. His chest X-ray\nstill showed an infiltrate of the lingula. Antibiotic treatment was\nbroadened by adding imipenem, vancomycin, doxycyclin and oseltamivir to\nlevofloxacin. Nevertheless, he has now developed a cough and difficulty\nbreathing and today transiently requires oxygen through a mask at 4 l/min.\nCRP and white blood cell count increase, other laboratory markers have not\nchanged significantly since admission. The pulmonary infiltrates now extend\nto the left and right upper lobes.\nHis mother-in-law is currently afebrile, but she also developed a cough;\nsince admission, her CRP has increased from 6.8 mg/dl to 9.9 mg/dl (normal\nrange, <0.5 mg/dl), and her white blood cell count decreased slightly from\n10.2/nl to 8.8/nl. Her chest X-ray shows no abnormalities. Coagulation\nparameters and renal function are normal in both patients. She is on\nimipenem, and levofloxacin, doxycyclin and tamiflu.\nEmergency microbiological tests undertaken in Frankfurt have yielded no\nevidence of Legionella infection; electron microscopy of respiratory swab\nsamples was negative for virus particles, and testing for influenza antigen\nwas negative. The results of viral cultures are pending. Further tests for\ninfluenza viruses are being performed by the Institute for Virology in\nMarburg and the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin; so far, the results of\nelectron microscopy and PCR are negative. Further testing (serology, PCR\netc.) is under way.\nUp to Sunday [16 Mar 2003], the patient's wife has remained well without\nany symptoms; she is quarantined in a side room apart from her relatives.\nOver the past hours, however, she, too, has developed a fever (38.2 C at 8\nPM local time, later 37.6 C spontaneously). Therefore we started treatment\nof the pregnant wife with erythromycin.\nAfter thorough cleaning and disinfection, the aircraft has in the meantime\nflown back to Singapore, albeit without passengers, due to demands by the\nSingaporean authorities. 83 fellow passengers resident in Germany are\ncurrently under 'domestic quarantine'; they have been told to stay at home\nduring the incubation period of 2 to 7 days and are being looked after by\ntheir local health authorities.\n--\nPD Dr. med.

The federal public\nhealth agency:\nIssued a health alert to hospitals and clinicians on Sat 15 Mar 2003\nBriefed state health officials on Sat 15 mar 2003\nIs investigating illness among travelers who may have passed through the\nUnited States after having potential exposure to the virus.\nIs preparing health alert cards to give to travelers returning from\nSoutheast Asia.\nIs preparing guidance to assist public health departments, health care\nfacilities and clinicians in monitoring and identifying potential cases.\nDeployed 8 CDC scientists to assist the WHO in the global investigation.\nIs analyzing specimens to identify a cause for the illness.\nCDC has been working with the World Health Organization (WHO) since late\nFebruary [2003] to investigate and confirm outbreaks of this severe form of\npneumonia in Viet Nam, Hong Kong, and parts of China. No cases have been\nidentified to date in the United States.\n'The emergence of 2 clusters of this illness on the North American\ncontinent indicates the potential for travelers who have been in the\naffected areas of Southeast Asia to have been exposed to this serious\nsyndrome,' said Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, CDC Director. 'The World Health\nOrganization has been leading a global effort, in which CDC is\nparticipating, to understand the cause of this illness and how to prevent\nits spread. We do know that it may progress rapidly and can be fatal.\nTherefore, we are instituting measures aimed at identifying potential cases\namong travelers returning to the United States and protecting the people\nwith whom they may come into contact.'\nThe WHO issued a global alert about the outbreak on 12 Mar 2003, cautioning\nthat the severe respiratory illness may spread to hospital staff. No link\nhas been made between this illness and any known influenza, including the\n'bird flu' (A[H5N1]) outbreak reported in Hong Kong on 19 Feb 2003.\n******\n[3]\nDate: 15 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: New York Times 16 Mar 2003 (from website)\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/16/health/16INFE.html?pagewanted=all&position=top>\n\nAs a mysterious respiratory illness spread to more countries, the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) yesterday issued a rare health alert, declaring\nthe ailment 'a worldwide health threat' and urging all countries to help in\nseeking its cause and control.\nThe agency said that in the last week it had received reports of more than\n150 new suspected cases of the illness, now known as Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndrome, or SARS. The syndrome has caused at least 9 deaths,\nthe last one a nurse in Hanoi. It apparently does not respond to antiviral\nand antibiotic drugs. [according to a Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) telebriefing held today, 15 Mar 2003 (available at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030315.htm>) Dr. Gerberding's\nresponse about efficacy of antimicrobials was: '...there is no consistent\nutilization of antibiotics or antiviral therapy in the areas that have had\nthe most cases, and so we have no real information to help tell us whether\nor not anything is having a clinical impact. At best we could just provide\nanecdotal suggestions and no data or advice.', hence a conclusion that\nthere is no response to antiviral and antibiotics maybe premature. - Mod. MPP]\nReported cases have come from Canada and 6 countries in Asia \u0097 Hong Kong\nand elsewhere in China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and\nVietnam, the health organization said. There have been no reports of the\nillness in the United States. But yesterday [today - 15 Mar 2003], an ill\npassenger and 2 companions who traveled from New York City were removed\nfrom a flight after it arrived in Frankfurt and put in isolation in a\nGerman hospital.\nThe ill passenger is a doctor from Singapore who treated one of the\nearliest cases there, and who flew to a medical meeting in New York City,\nsaid Dick Thompson, a WHO spokesman. The doctor may have gone to a hospital\nin New York \u0097 the agency is not certain which one \u0097 before flying back to\nSingapore via Frankfurt with his wife and another doctor. Before boarding\nthe flight, the doctor called a colleague in Singapore to describe his\nsymptoms, and the colleague notified WHO.\nThe cause has not been identified, and scientists do not know whether it is\na virus or even an infectious agent. Although health officials have\nsuspected avian influenza, which has infected a small number of people\nsporadically in Hong Kong since 1997, laboratory tests have not detected\nthat rare strain, known as influenza A(H5N1). As a result, laboratory\nscientists are focusing on the possibility of a previously unknown\ninfectious agent.\nDr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of CDC, said in a news conference\nyesterday [today - 15 Mar 2003] that it appeared to take direct and\nsustained contact to transmit the illness from an affected individual to\nother people. 'There is no evidence to suggest that this can be spread\nthrough brief contact or assemblages of large numbers of people,' she said.\nAsked whether this might be an instance of bioterrorism, she replied, 'We\nare keeping an open mind.'\nIn an emergency advisory issued yesterday, WHO said that 'there is\npresently no indication to restrict travel to any destination.'\nBut Dr. Gerberding said, 'We are advising persons planning nonessential or\nelective travel to affected areas that they may wish to postpone their trip\nuntil further notice.'\nUpdated information will be posted on the centers' Web site,\n.\nWHO and American officials urged all travelers to be aware of the main\nsigns. In addition to the breathing problems, the illness can cause a dry\ncough and other flulike symptoms that are thought to develop 2 to 7 days\nafter exposure. They usually start with a sudden onset of high fever and go\non to include muscle aches, headache, sore throat and shortness of breath.\nStandard lab tests often show low numbers of white blood cells and\nplatelets, which help blood to clot.\nThe health agency said any passenger or airline crew member who developed\nsuch symptoms should immediately seek medical attention and ensure that\ninformation about their recent travel was passed on to the health care\nstaff. 'Any traveler who develops these symptoms is advised not to\nundertake further travel until they have recovered,' it said.\nIf a passenger became ill on a flight, the agency asked airlines to alert\nthe airport of destination and to refer any ill passengers to airport\nhealth officials.\n'There are currently no indications to restrict the onward travel of well\npassengers, but all passengers and crew should be advised to seek medical\nattention if they develop' symptoms, the agency said.\nIn another rare step, the CDC activated its emergency operations center in\nAtlanta, including sophisticated communications technology, to enhance its\nability to coordinate information from other countries and to investigate\nany suspect cases in this country.\nThe CDC has used the operations center only twice before, for the\nmosquito-borne West Nile fever epidemic last year and the anthrax attacks\nin 2001. The last time it issued a global health alert was in 1993, to\nenhance measures to control tuberculosis. WHO officials said they could not\nrecall the last time an emergency global travel advisory was issued.\nThe CDC and New York City health officials are now investigating the travel\nhistories of the passengers now in a German hospital as well as one of the\n8 cases suspected to be the new syndrome in Toronto and Vancouver, British\nColumbia [Canada].\nTwo hours before the plane landed, the WHO notified German health\nofficials, who had the plane moved to a separate runway where the doctor,\nhis wife and a colleague disembarked and were taken to a nearby hospital.\nGerman health officials advised the other passengers to monitor their\nhealth and gave them a telephone number to call if they developed any\nsymptoms. Officials did not release any information on his condition.\nMr. Thompson, the spokesman for the WHO, said the cases in Toronto involved\na family who returned home after flying to Hong Kong. A woman, died shortly\nafter her return. Five other family members who had not been to Hong Kong\nhave since become ill; 4 are still in the hospital while the fifth, [the\nfatal case's] son, died on 13 Mar 2003, according to Toronto Public Health\nofficials.\nToronto health officials said they were aware of 2 other cases in\nVancouver, both people who had recently traveled to Hong Kong. CDC\nofficials are aiding in the investigation because [the fatal case's]\ndaughter, who is being treated in Toronto, had flown to Atlanta recently,\nMr. Thompson said.\nSo far, laboratory scientists have not been able to identify a known or\nnovel infectious agent, said Dr. David L. Heymann, a WHO official.\nJapanese officials said their tests showed that the influenza virus was not\nthe cause of the illness.

Although health officials have\nsuspected avian influenza, which has infected a small number of people\nsporadically in Hong Kong since 1997, laboratory tests have not detected\nthat rare strain, known as influenza A(H5N1). \nGerman health officials advised the other passengers to monitor their\nhealth and gave them a telephone number to call if they developed any\nsymptoms. The emergence of 2 clusters of this illness on the North American\ncontinent indicates the potential for travelers who have been in the\naffected areas of Southeast Asia to have been exposed to this serious\nsyndrome,' said Dr. Julie L.

From 16 Nov 2002 until 9 Feb 2003, 305 cases, including 5 deaths were\nreported in 6 of the municipalities of the province. The syndrome was\ndescribed as an atypical pneumonia, with non-specific symptoms, including\nfever, headache, joint ache, and overall fatigue and weariness. 2 of the\ncases were diagnosed with _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ infection, but no cause\nhas been confirmed in the other cases. Investigation of this outbreak\ncontinues.\nIn late February 2003, a Hong Kong resident became ill with a pneumonic\nillness shortly after arriving in Hanoi, Vietnam. He was initially cared\nfor in a hospital in Hanoi and was then evacuated to a hospital in Hong\nKong. Approximately 20 hospital staff involved in his care in Hanoi have\nsubsequently developed a similar illness. In Hong Kong, an outbreak of a\nsimilar respiratory illness has occurred among hospital workers in another\nhospital (not the hospital in which the Hong Kong resident from Hanoi was\ncared for).\nDespite intensive investigation, no cause for these outbreaks has so far\nbeen determined other than the 2 cases of _C. pneumoniae_ infection in the\nGuangdong outbreak. Influenza virus infection has not been demonstrated. No\nclear epidemiological link between these 3 separate outbreaks has been\nidentified, nor any link with the earlier outbreak of influenza due to the\navian influenza A H5N1 in Hong Kong reported in February 2003 (3).\nThe signs and symptoms of the illness in Hanoi most commonly include an\ninitial influenza-like illness (rapid onset of high fever followed by\nmuscle aches, headache, and sore throat). In some cases, but not all, this\nis followed by bilateral pneumonia and occasionally acute respiratory\ndistress requiring assisted breathing on a respirator. Some patients are\nrecovering but others remain critically ill.

He felt unwell during his journey and fell ill shortly after arrival in\nHanoi from Shanghai and Hong Kong SAR, China. Following his admission\nto the hospital, approximately 20 hospital staff became sick with similar\nsymptoms.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of the disease in Hanoi include initial flu-like illness\n(rapid onset of high fever followed by muscle aches, headache and sore\nthroat). These are the most common symptoms. Early laboratory findings\nmay include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and leucopenia (low white\nblood cell count). In some, but not all cases, this is followed by bilateral\npneumonia, in some cases progressing to acute respiratory distress\nrequiring assisted breathing on a respirator. Some patients are recovering\nbut some patients remain critically ill.\n\nChina (Hong Kong SAR)\n----------------------\nToday, the Department of Health Hong Kong SAR has reported on an\noutbreak of respiratory illness in one of its public hospitals. As of midnight\n11 March, 50 health care workers had been screened and 23 of them were\nfound to have febrile illness. They were admitted to the hospital for\nobservation as a precautionary measure. In this group, 8 have developed\nearly chest x-ray signs of pneumonia. Their conditions are stable. 3 other\nhealth care workers self-presented to hospitals with febrile illness and 2 of\nthem have chest x-ray signs of pneumonia.\n\nInvestigation by Hong Kong SAR public health authorities is on-going. The\nHospital Authority has increased infection control measures to prevent the\nspread of the disease in the hospital. So far, no link has been found between\nthese cases and the outbreak in Hanoi.\n\nChina (Guangdong province)\n-----------------------\nIn mid February 2003, the Government of China reported that 305 cases of\natypical pneumonia, with 5 deaths, had occurred in Guangdong province. In\n2 cases that died, chlamydia infection was found.

SARS is an atypical pneumonia for\nwhich the cause has not yet been determined.\n\nFour new patients with SARS have been admitted since the MOH Press Release\nyesterday. As at 16 March 2003, we have a total of 20 patients of SARS.\nOther than the initial three cases, there are an additional 17 patients who\nhave been admitted to hospital. All these have been in close contact with\npatients of SARS. Ten are family members and friends, and seven are\nhospital staff who had attended to the patients when they were first\nadmitted to the hospitals. All these patients are stable. Patients are\nbeing isolated and the hospital staff have been informed to observe\nenhanced infection control procedures when attending to suspected cases.\n\nThe Ministry advises you to seek immediate medical attention if you have:\n- Fever (>38 C) and respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of\nbreath or breathing difficulty;\nAND\n- have travelled to Hong Kong, Hanoi or Guangdong province in China, within\n2 weeks of onset of the symptoms;\nOR\n- are a close contact of persons diagnosed with SARS. (Close contact means\nhaving cared for, having lived with, or having had direct contact with\nrespiratory secretions and body fluids of a person with SARS)\n\nAs a precautionary measure, the Ministry strongly advises you to avoid\ntravel to Hong Kong, Hanoi and Guangdong province in China for the time\nbeing, unless absolutely necessary.\n\n******\n[2]\n\nDate: 16 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Department of Health Honk Kong SAR 16 Mar 2003\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\nNumber of Healthcare Workers Infected\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n\nAs at 1pm today (16 Mar 2003), the admission statistics of healthcare\nworkers who suffered from respiratory tract infection are as follow:\n\nTotal Admissions (The numbers in bracket are those with Pneumonia Symptoms)\n\nStaff of Prince of Wales Hospital admitted to:\nPrince of Wales Hosptial 36 (29)\nKwong Wah Hospital 1 (1)\nPrincess Margaret Hosptial 1 (1)\nStaff of Kwong Wah Hospital admitted to:\nKwong Wah Hosptial 2 (2)\nStaff of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital admitted to:\nPamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital 6 (6)\nStaff of Private Clinic admitted to:\nPrincess Margaret Hospital 3 (3)\n\nTotal admissions 49 (42)\n\n******\n[3]\n\nDate: 16 Mar 2003\nFrom: Susan Poutanen MD for 'Donald E.

(See Health Canada's preliminary definitions of probable and\nsuspect cases at the end of this report.)\n\nThe first 6 cases involved 6 adults in one family (composed of 7 adults and\n3 children) who have been admitted to hospitals in the GTA with\nprobable/suspect SARS. The index case and her husband had traveled to Hong\nKong 13 Feb 2003 to 23 Feb 2003. She had respiratory symptoms upon her\nreturn to Toronto and died at home on 5 Mar 2003. Four of her adult\nchildren/children-in-law (3 of whom lived with her) and her husband\nultimately developed symptoms and were diagnosed with\nprobable(4)/suspect(1) SARS. None of the 3 young children in the family\nhave shown signs of SARS although one (5 months old) has been admitted to\nhospital for observation. This child was noted to have a rash described as\nerythema multiforme minor after exposure to probable cases in his family\nnoted by his family doctor on 6 Mar 2003 but which resolved by 10 Mar\n2003. Two probable cases from this family have died. One probable case\nfrom this family is requiring mechanical ventilation but is stable. The\nremaining probable/suspect cases from this family are stable on medical wards.\n\nThe seventh case involves the family physician who assessed at least one\nprobable and one suspect case from this family. She has also been\ndiagnosed with suspect SARS and has been admitted to a medical ward and is\ncurrently stable. She saw these patients on 6 Mar 2003 for approximately\n45 minutes and on 9 Mar 2003 she developed a temperature of 40 C (104 F)\nwhich has persisted to date (16 Mar 2003). On 14 Mar 2003, she developed\na dry non-productive cough with adventitious sounds in the left lower lobe\nbut has had a normal chest x-ray.\n\nThe eighth case has been diagnosed on 16 Mar 2003 with probable SARS. He\nis not related to the first 6 cases and is the first non-Asian case in\nToronto. For the first 2 weeks of Mar 2003, he was traveling in Southeast\nAsia (including Hong Kong on 10 Mar 2003). He developed symptoms on 12\nMar 2003 with pleuritic chest pain, sore throat and light headedness that\ndeveloped into productive cough with hemoptysis [coughing up blood] and\nshortness of breath on 14 Mar 2003. He was assessed and noted to have a\ntemperature of 40 C (104 F) on 15 Mar 2003 and is requiring 40 percent\noxygen by mask. Pulmonary embolism has been ruled out.\n\nClinical specimens from all cases, including autopsy specimens from one of\nthe probable cases that died have been sent to local, regional, and\nnational laboratories for diagnostic testing. Initial results have\nrevealed no etiology. Histological examination of lung from one of the\ndeceased patients was compatible with adult respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nDescription of the Toronto SARS Cases:\n\nIn 3 probable cases where there was a defined exposure, the estimated\nincubation period ranged from 2-5 days. In all 8 cases, the initial\nsymptoms were primarily fever and malaise. Some, but not all also had\nheadache and myalgias [muscle pains]. While respiratory symptoms were\ncommon to all cases (primarily dry cough and shortness of breath), it is\nworth noting that respiratory symptoms occurred later in the illness in\nsome patients. At presentation to hospital, most have been febrile, short\nof breath and hypoxic. However, some have not had a fever in\nhospital. Several patients have had gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea.\nThe chest x-ray abnormalities have been subtle initially, and despite\nrespiratory symptoms, some have had normal chest x-rays. As illness\nprogressed, most developed bilateral and symmetrical pulmonary\ninfiltrates. Total white blood cell counts have been slightly abnormal and\n4 patients have been lymphopenic [low number of lymphocytes]. Most\npatients have had some elevation in transaminases (AST/ALT/GGT 1- 3x upper\nlimit of normal) [these are indicative of liver abnormalities -\nMod.MPP]. Three patients have had elevations in creatine kinase [this is\nindicative of muscle cell damage - Mod.MPP].\n\nAddendum:\n\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\nCase Definitions (Recommended by Health Canada as of 16 Mar 2003)\n\nSuspect Case:\n\nA person presenting with a history of:\n- Fever (over 38 degrees Celsius)\nAND\n- One or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath,\ndifficulty breathing\nAND\nOne or more of the following:\n- Close contact* with a probable case\n- Recent history of travel (within 10 days) to Asia, especially in areas\nreporting cases of SARS (see below)\n\n*Close contact means having cared for, lived with or had face-to-face\n(within 1 metre) contact with, or having had direct contact with\nrespiratory secretions and/or body fluids of a person with SARS.\n\nProbable Case:\nA person meeting the suspect case definition together with severe\nprogressive respiratory illness suggestive of atypical pneumonia or acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome with no known cause.\nOR\nA person with an unexplained acute respiratory illness resulting in death,\nwith an autopsy examination demonstrating the pathology of acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome with no known cause.\n\nComments:\n- In addition to fever and respiratory symptoms, SARS may be associated\nwith other symptoms including: headache, myalgia, loss of appetite,\nmalaise, confusion, rash and diarrhea.\n- Severe respiratory illness may be characterized by decreased oxygen\nsaturation requiring oxygen support including ventilation. Chest X-ray\nabnormalities may or may not be present.\n\nAreas in Asia Reporting Cases of SARS (16 Mar 2003 14:00 EST)\nChina: Guangdong province, Hong Kong SAR\nVietnam: City of Hanoi\nSingapore\n\n\nSource of Information:\nAllison McGeer MD MSc\nSusan M.

WHO is\nco-ordinating the international investigation of this outbreak and is\nworking closely with health authorities in the affected countries to\nprovide epidemiological, clinical and logistical support as required.\n\nSARS was first recognised on 26 Feb 2003 in Hanoi, Viet Nam. The causative\nagent has yet to be identified. The main symptoms and signs include high\nfever (greater than 38 degrees C), cough, shortness of breath or breathing\ndifficulties. A proportion of patients with SARS develop severe pneumonia;\nsome of whom have needed ventilator support. As of 15 Mar 2003, 4 deaths\nhave been reported.\n\nAs of 15 Mar 2003 the majority of cases have occurred in people who have\nhad very close contact with other cases and over 90 percent of cases have\noccurred in health care workers.\n\nThe mode of transmission and the causative agent have yet to be determined.\nAerosol and/or droplet spread is possible as is transmission from body\nfluids. Respiratory isolation, strict respiratory and mucosal barrier\nnursing are recommended for cases. Cases should be treated as clinically\nindicated. (see below for further details).\n\n- Hospital Infection Control Guidance\n- Management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\n\nAn epidemic of atypical pneumonia had previously been reported by the\nChinese government starting in November 2002 in Guangdong Province. This\nepidemic is reported to be under control.\n\nHanoi, Viet Nam\n\nOn 26 Feb 2003, a man (index case) was admitted to hospital in Hanoi with a\nhigh fever, dry cough, myalgia and mild sore throat. Over the next 4 days\nhe developed increasing breathing difficulties, severe thrombocytopenia,\nand signs of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and required ventilator\nsupport. Despite intensive therapy he died on 13 Mar 2003 after being\ntransferred to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.\n\nOn 5 Mar 2003, seven health care workers who had cared for the index case\nalso became ill (high fever, myalgia, headache and less often sore throat).\nThe onset of illness ranged from 4 to 7 days after admission of the index case.\n\nAs of 15 Mar 2003, 43 cases have been reported in Viet Nam. At least 5 of\nthese patients are currently requiring ventilator support. Two deaths have\noccurred. With the exception of one case (the son of a health care worker)\nall cases to date have had direct contact with the hospital where the index\ncase had first received treatment.\n\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region of China\n\nInfluenza A(H5N1) reported in February\n\nOn 12 Mar 2003, 20 health care workers developed influenza-like symptoms\n(high fever, headache and lower respiratory symptoms). Since then the\nnumber of reported cases has increased daily.\n\nAs of 15 Mar 2003, over 100 reported cases have been hospitalised, at least\n2 of whom are receiving ventilatory support. One death (index case from\nViet Nam) has been reported.\n\nSingapore\n\nOn 13 Mar 2003, the Ministry of Health in Singapore reported three cases of\nSARS in people who had recently returned to Singapore after travelling to\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.\n\nAs of 15 Mar 2003, 13 additional cases have been reported. All 13 of these\ncases have had very close contact with one or more of the initial three cases.\n\nAll 16 cases are reported to be in a stable condition and are being cared\nfor in isolation.\n\nThailand\n\nAs of 15 March 2003, one imported case has been reported in Thailand. The\ncase (a health care worker) travelled to Thailand on the 11 Mar 2003 from\nHanoi, Viet Nam. The case is known to have had close contact with the Hanoi\nindex case and to have been unwell on arrival in Thailand. The case was\nimmediately isolated on arrival in Thailand and reported to be in a stable\ncondition and is being cared for in isolation. There is no evidence of\ntransmission of SARS in Thailand.\n\nCanada\n\nAs of 15 Mar 2003, 7 cases have been reported in Canada; 2 of whom have\ndied. The cases have occurred in 2 separate extended family clusters. In\nboth clusters at least one member of the family had travelled to Hong Kong\nSpecial Administrative Region of China within a week of developing symptoms.\n\nPhilippines and Indonesia\n\nUnconfirmed reports of a single case in the Philippines to date. However\none close contact of the Hanoi index case is under observation in an\nisolation facility. This person is reported to be well.\n\nUnconfirmed reports of a single case in Indonesia were received on the 15\nMar 2003. However further reports have confirmed that this person does not\nfulfill the case definition. As of 16 Mar 2003, there are therefore no\nreported cases in Indonesia.\n\nNew York, USA \u0096 Frankfurt, Germany\n\nOn 15 Mar 2003, a health care worker from Singapore who was visiting New\nYork boarded a flight from New York to Frankfurt. The health care worker\nwas known to be unwell and to have had recent close contact with a reported\ncase of SARS in Singapore. German health authorities were notified and the\nhealth care worker was transferred to an isolation unit in Frankfurt as\nsoon as the flight landed. There is no evidence of transmission in Germany.\n\nLaboratory Investigation\n\nVarious specimens have been collected from cases and post-mortum\nexaminations. A wide range of laboratory tests have been conducted to date\nbut no agent has been definitively identified. Laboratory investigations\nare continuing.\n\nInternational Response\n\nWHO is assisting affected countries in responding to the various outbreaks.\nExtensive epidemiological and clinical investigation are ongoing in all\naffected countries.\n\nWHO/ Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network team of epidemiologists,\ncase management, infection control experts and laboratory experts is\nassisting the Vietnamese health authorities. The following organisations\nare contributing personnel and materials to the Hanoi team:\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States\nCentre of International Health, Australia\nEpicentre\nInstitut National de Veille Sanitaire, France\nInstitut Pasteur, France and Viet Nam\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\nNational Health Service, Department of Health, United Kingdom\nRobert Koch Institute, Germany\nCentral Field Epidemiology Group Smittskyddsinstitutet (SMI), Sweden\nBilateral assistance has also been mobilised from France and Japan. WHO is\nproviding epidemiological support to health authorities in Hong Kong.\n\nTravel Advice\n\nThere is presently no recommendations to restrict travel to any\ndestination. However, guidance has been issued by WHO and is available.\nWorld Health Organization issues emergency travel advisory\n\nFurther Information\n\nThroughout this outbreak, WHO plans to update its web site on a daily basis.\n\n***************\n[5]\n\nDate: 16 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: ABC News [edited]\n<http://abcnews.go.com/wire/Living/ap20030316_1038.html>\n\n\nThe illness, which carries flu-like symptoms, has killed 9 people, 7 in\nAsia and 2 in North America. Its rapid spread in southeast Asia in recent\nweeks caused a rare worldwide health alert to be issued on Saturday.\n\nHealth officials say it may be several more days before they are able to\nidentify the disease. However, they said several of its features suggest it\nis caused by a virus, which can often be difficult to pinpoint quickly\nusing standard lab tests.\n\n'Certainly influenza is on the minds of many people,' said Dr. David\nHeymann, communicable diseases chief for the World Health Organization.\n\nLab tests have ruled out some varieties of flu as well as some viruses that\ncause hemorrhagic fever. However, many other possibilities remain, Heymann\nsaid.\n\nThose include 'a new strain of influenza' or such exotic diseases as the\nclosely related Hendra and Nipah viruses both newly recognized, causing\nflu-like symptoms and capable of being spread from animals to people.\n\nExperts discounted the possibility that terrorism is the source and believe\nit almost certainly is a contagious infection that spreads most easily from\nvictims to their doctors, nurses and families through coughing, sneezing\nand other contact with nasal fluids. 'Nothing about that pattern suggests\nbioterrorism,' said Dr. Julie Gerberding, head of the U.S. Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nOfficials said they are encouraged that some recent victims seem to be\nrecovering, although they are unsure whether that is because of the many\nantibiotic and antiviral drugs they have been given or simply the natural\ncourse of the disease. Heymann said 3 or 4 patients had stabilized enough\nto be moved out of intensive care Sunday in Hanoi, Vietnam, although all\nstill had breathing problems.\n\nThe illness is being called 'severe acute respiratory syndrome,' or SARS.\nThe incubation period appears to be 3 to 7 days. It often begins with a\nhigh fever and other flu-like symptoms, such as headache and sore throat.\nVictims typically develop coughs, pneumonia, shortness of breath and other\nbreathing difficulties. Death results from respiratory failure.\n\nThe WHO estimates that perhaps 500 people in all have been sickened if an\nearlier outbreak that peaked last month in Guangdong province in China\nturns out to be part of the same disease, as they suspect it is.\n\nNinety percent of the most recent cases have been in health care workers.\n\nThe CDC prepared cards that were being given to travelers arriving from\nHanoi, Hong Kong or Guangdong province in China, warning they may have been\nexposed. It recommended they see a doctor if they get a fever accompanied\nby a cough or difficulty breathing over the next week.\n\nInvestigators suspect a virus is involved, because victims do not seem to\nrespond well to standard antibiotics, which kill only bacteria, and because\ntheir white blood counts drop. That typically happens with viral infections\nbut not bacterial ones.\n\nTests so far have ruled out the H5N1 bird flu, which has popped up\noccasionally in China [see ProMED-mail posting below] and which many fear\ncould be catastrophic if it spread widely among humans.\n\nNo cases have been confirmed in the United States, but Gerberding said the\nCDC is checking out a few calls. The North American fatalities were a woman\nand her son who died in Toronto after visiting Hong Kong.\n\nA 32-year-old physician from Singapore suspected of having the disease was\ntaken off an airliner during a stopover in Frankfurt, Germany, on Saturday\nafter being in New York City for a medical conference. He was held in\nquarantine, along with his mother, who had a fever, and his wife, who\nremained healthy. However, on Sunday, the man's physician, Dr.\nHanns-Reinhardt Brodt, said he was uncertain the case was SARS; he was\ntreating him for ordinary pneumonia.\n\nAlso on Sunday, the WHO released a report from the China Ministry of Health\non the Guangdong outbreak, which said 'the epidemic situation has been\ncontrolled and the patients are being cured one by one.'\n\nIn that outbreak, the Chinese said, most victims were young adults, and the\ndisease apparently was spread similarly to SARS. The outbreak peaked\nbetween 3 Feb 2003 and 14 Feb 2003 in Guangzhou City and has since\ndecreased markedly.\n\nThe Chinese said 7 percent of patients required breathing tubes, but most\neventually got better, especially if they were not also infected with\nbacteria. The disease seemed to weaken as it passed from person to person.\n\n******\n[6]\n\nDate: 16 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: AP [edited]\n\nA Slovene woman might suffers from atypical pneumonia\n-----------------\nLJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) - A Slovene woman, who came from Vietnam 10 days\nago, could suffer from a mysterious form of pneumonia that hit parts of\nAsia recently, but her state is relatively good, the health minister, Dusan\nKeber, said late Sunday.\n\nKeber told national television that the woman, who came on a flight via\nParis, had 'symptoms similar to those found in the cases recorded so far'\nof the mystery disease that has claimed at least 9 lives so far. 'There is\na high probability' that she suffers from the atypical pneumonia that has\nsickened 150 people and caused four deaths in recent days, mainly in China,\nHong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam, Keber said.\n\nLab tests carried out on the unidentified woman 'ruled out all other known\nforms of pneumonia,' Keber said. She was put under quarantine within the\nLjubljana clinic. People who were in contact with her are under medical\nobservation and were advised to stay home, Keber said. Asked about the\nwoman's health, Keber said she was 'relatively fine.'\n\nThis weekend, a 32-doctor was quarantined at a Frankfurt hospital and is\nbelieved to be the first in Europe to be afflicted with the disease. If\nconfirmed, the Slovene woman would be the second case in Europe.\n\nKnown as acute respiratory syndrome, the disease has been declared a\n'worldwide health threat' in a rare emergency warning by the World Health\nOrganization.\n\nExperts are unsure if the cases are caused by bacteria or a virus and also\ndon't know whether any or all were caused by the same strain of disease.\nPatients deteriorate quickly after initially coming down with simple\nflu-like symptoms, doctors say.\n\nKeber said doctors will keep examining the woman and a crisis headquarters\nhas been set up at the clinic.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to thank Pablo Nart <p.nart@virgin.net>, Joe Shea\n<josephshea@attbi.com>, Rashid Chotani <rchotani@jhsph.edu> for submitting\ninformation on this unfolding outbreak.\n\nThe etiology of this outbreaks remains unknown. As information becomes\navailable, ProMED-mail will post the information. As mentioned in\nyesterday's posting, we are trying to synthesize all information currently\navailable, and are attempting to avoid dissemination of rumors and\nunfounded speculations, yet at the same time keep our readers informed on\ncurrent lines of thought.\n\nIn the above reports we have included official reports from\nMinistries/Departments of Health, the WHO and 2 newswire reports of newly\nsuspected cases - one in Slovenia (reported by the Minister of Health) and\nanother case in Ontario Canada with a history of contact with the original\ncases. Again as mentioned yesterday, we are in the early stages of\ninvestigation of this outbreak of SARS, and therefore the numbers of\nsuspected cases will vary from report to report, with case numbers both\nincreasing and decreasing, especially as we are still in the influenza\nseason in the Northern Hemisphere so that febrile respiratory illness is\nnot an uncommon event. An example of this fluctuation is the now ruled out\nreport of a suspected case in Indonesia (see report [3] Worldwide update -\nWHO).\n\nWe are very curious to learn more about the outbreak in Guangdong China as\ninformation becomes available. ProMED-mail covered this outbreak in\nFebruary 2003 (see references below). The etiology of the outbreak in\nGuangdong was not definitively identified, as only 2 of the serious cases\nwere reported to have had _chlamydia pneumoniae_ isolated as the\npresumptive diagnosis for their unusual respiratory illness. If that\noutbreak is shown to be related to this current outbreak of SARS, the\ninformation in the newswire mentioning that 7 percent of cases (it is\nunclear if the 7 percent is of all hospitalized cases or all cases) had\nrespiratory distress severe enough to require artificial ventilation is\nsomewhat more comforting than current speculations on SARS.

Heymann said 3 or 4 patients had stabilized enough\nto be moved out of intensive care Sunday in Hanoi, Vietnam, although all\nstill had breathing problems. An example of this fluctuation is the now ruled out\nreport of a suspected case in Indonesia (see report [3] Worldwide update -\nWHO).

The case was\nimmediately isolated on arrival in Thailand and reported to be in a stable\ncondition and is being cared for in isolation. However\none close contact of the Hanoi index case is under observation in an\nisolation facility. The Chinese said 7 percent of patients required breathing tubes, but most\neventually got better, especially if they were not also infected with\nbacteria. None of the 3 young children in the family\nhave shown signs of SARS although one (5 months old) has been admitted to\nhospital for observation. However, on Sunday, the man's physician, Dr.\nHanns-Reinhardt Brodt, said he was uncertain the case was SARS; he was\ntreating him for ordinary pneumonia. German health authorities were notified and the\nhealth care worker was transferred to an isolation unit in Frankfurt as\nsoon as the flight landed. Ten are family members and friends, and seven are\nhospital staff who had attended to the patients when they were first\nadmitted to the hospitals.

Health authorities have\nnot been able to establish any link between outbreaks in the 2 places, but\nexperts studying the Hong Kong cases believe they were caused by rapidly\nspreading viruses that have yet to be identified. 'It must have come from a\npatient and is probably spread from human to human in very close contact by\naerosol, like sneezing,' said Professor John Tam, who is among a team of\ndoctors treating those battling the virus in Hong Kong. 'It affects a lot\nof people very quickly and their conditions can deteriorate very quickly,'\nTam said.\n\nAn American businessman who died on Thursday in a Hong Kong hospital had\nbeen flown in from Hanoi, where he had been admitted to hospital shortly\nafter arriving from Shanghai and Hong Kong with severe respiratory\nproblems, the WHO said. Following his admission, some 20 staff in the Hanoi\nhospital fell sick with similar symptoms and some have developed pneumonia\nand acute respiratory distress, it said. Some of the Hanoi victims remain\ncritically ill. That hospital has since been shut for cleaning and will not\nreopen until late next week, according to an employee there.\n\nIn Hong Kong, more medical staff have fallen ill with flu-like symptoms. By\nlate Thursday, 38 hospital staff had been admitted and 24 of them were\nshowing signs of pneumonia. None of those in Hong Kong is known to have had\nany contact with the American. 2 of the 24 are in serious condition.\n\nVietnam's state-run media on Thursday quoted Vice Health Minister Nguyen\nVan Thuong as saying: 'Preliminary results showed this is the influenza\nvirus type B.' Earlier this week an official at the Hanoi-based Epidemic\nHygiene Institute told Reuters: 'The virus can be fatally dangerous to\nhumans and it can spread really fast.'\n\nHong Kong's Health Minister Yeoh Eng-kiong told reporters: 'There is a\npossibility that it can mutate or it may be a virus that is not known to\nus.' News of the infections worried many in Hong Kong. In some of the\nterritory's hospitals, staff and patients, and even those seeking\noutpatient treatment, wore surgical masks. Pneumonia is the number 4 killer\nin Hong Kong, where some 300 people are admitted into hospital every week.\nBut the current cases in Hong Kong are of special concern, coming so soon\nafter a much-feared avian influenza virus killed a man and infected his son\nin February 2003. The father's flu-like illness deteriorated into pneumonia\nbefore he died. A government spokesman said earlier that the latest virus\nwas not influenza A virus H5N1, or the deadly bird-flu virus which sparked\na global WHO alert and widespread panic in February.\n\nThere was an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in China's southern Guangdong\nprovince in mid-February 2003 that infected 305 people, killing 5. It is\nnot known whether the Guangdong cases are linked to the ones in Hanoi or\nHong Kong.\n\n[Byline: Tan Ee Lyn]\n\n******\n[2]\n\nDate: Thu 13 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org> & Pablo Nart <p.nart@virgin.net>\nSource: BBC News online, Thu 13 Mar 2003 [edited]\n<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2846243.stm>\n\nSingapore: 3 Cases of Atypical Pneumonia in Travellers from Hong Kong\n---------------------------------------------------\nHealth officials have issued a global warning about a virulent flu and\npneumonia that has swept through hospitals in Hong Kong and Vietnam. One\nman has died, dozens of hospital workers have fallen ill, and some of these\nare reportedly in a critical condition. The precise origin of the infection\nis still unknown, but the key case involved an American businessman who\ndied on Thursday morning in a Hong Kong hospital. He had arrived into Hanoi\nin Vietnam from Shanghai on a business trip already suffering from severe\nrespiratory problems. When his condition deteriorated, he was transferred\nto Hong Kong for specialist care. World Health Organisation experts are\nconcerned that he may have passed the infection on to many others on the\nway. It has issued a 'global alert' warning public health surveillance\nteams throughout the world to be vigilant for outbreaks.\n\n'Any time you cannot diagnose the cause of a disease, it's very serious,'\nsaid the World Health Organisation's David Heyman. 'What's fortunate is\nthat at present it seems to be confined to hospital workers who have had\ncontact with the patients; although now we're looking to see whether people\nmight be sick in the community.' After the US patient's admission in Hanoi,\n20 hospital staff fell ill with the same infection, and so far 50 staff in\nHong Kong have shown similar flu-like symptoms, and some have been admitted\nto hospital. Of these, 23 are already showing clear signs of pneumonia. The\ncondition of some of these is described as 'critical'. None of the staff\nare known to have had any direct contact with the American -- so no direct\nlink with either his death, or the Hanoi outbreak, can be established.\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Health says it is also closely monitoring 3 people\nadmitted to hospital with an unusual form of pneumonia, all of whom had\nrecently visited Hong Kong. Professor John Tam, one of those treating the\nvirus patients in Hong Kong, said: 'It must have come from a patient and is\nprobably spread from human to human in very close contact by aerosol, like\nsneezing.' Concerns over the highly-contagious illness have prompted many\nstaff and patients attending hospitals in Hong Kong to wear surgical masks.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of the disease in Hanoi include initial flu-like\nillness, with rapid onset of high fever followed by muscle aches, headache,\nand sore throat. In some, but not all cases, this is followed by double\npneumonia -- with some patients needing help from a ventilator to stay alive.\n\nHong Kong Health Minister Yeoh Eng-kiong said that testing was being\ncarried out to try to identify the virus involved. Tests have so far\n[implicated] Influenza B virus. He said: 'The rate of infection is very\nhigh. But Hong Kong Government officials said the illness was not related\nto a strain of 'bird-flu' that killed a man in February, [which was an\navian influenza A virus]. It is possible the outbreak is linked to a spate\nof 'atypical pneumonia' cases in the southern Guangdong province of China\nin February, which killed 5 people and infected hundreds more.\n\n******\n[3]\n\nDate: Thu 13 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: SG news, Ministry of Health [Singapore] Press Statement, Thu 13 Mar\n2003 [edited]\n<http://cgi.wn.com/?action=display&article=19264397&template=worldnews/index.txt&index=recent>\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has on Wed 12 March 2003 issued a\nglobal alert about outbreaks of cases of a severe form of pneumonia in Hong\nKong, Vietnam and Guangdong province in China.\n\nIn Vietnam, the outbreak began when a traveller was hospitalised on 26 Feb\n2003 for the treatment of severe and acute breathing difficulties of\nunknown origin.

Some of these staff are\nrecovering but some remain critically ill.\n\nIn Hong Kong, an outbreak of respiratory illness has been reported on 11\nMar 2003 in the Prince of Wales Hospital. More than 20 hospital staff were\nadmitted for observation after they developed fever. Some of these staff\nalso developed pneumonia. Their conditions are stable.\n\nIn February 2003, it was reported that about 300 cases of atypical\npneumonia, with 5 deaths, had occurred in Guangdong province in China. The\nsigns and symptoms of the disease include initial flu-like illness (rapid\nonset of high fever followed by muscle aches, headache, and sore throat).\nIn some cases, they developed pneumonia progressing to difficulty in breathing.\n\nThe outbreaks in Hong Kong and Hanoi appear to be confined to the hospital\nenvironment. No link has so far been made between the outbreaks of\npneumonia in Hong Kong and Hanoi and the earlier outbreak of avian\ninfluenza (H5N1) in Hong Kong in February this year. Investigations into\nthe cause of the outbreaks are currently being carried out by the WHO.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is closely monitoring the situation. The Ministry\nhad been notified of 3 persons who had travelled to Hong Kong at the end of\nFebruary and who were admitted to hospital for pneumonia after they\nreturned to Singapore. 2 of them have recovered and been discharged from\nhospital. The remaining case is recovering in hospital. Investigations\nsuggest a viral origin, however no causative organism has been identified.\nThe Ministry has conducted contact tracing and given advice to the contacts\nof these cases to seek medical attention early should they become ill. The\nhospital staff attending to these cases were advised to take the necessary\ninfection control precautions. None of the hospital staff attending to\nthese patients have reported ill. So far, the Ministry has not established\nthat these cases are related to the outbreak in Hong Kong and Hanoi.\n\nSurveillance has shown that there has not been any increase in the number\nof cases of acute respiratory infections.

The\nsickness causes flu-like symptoms, including a high fever, and appears\nhighly contagious at least for hospital workers who treat infected\npatients, health officials around the region said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has been especially concerned about the\nspread among hospital workers, because it may make them leery of caring for\nfurther patients if the disease spreads. Dr. Dick Thompson, a spokesman for\nthe World Health Organization in Geneva, cautioned that because laboratory\nresearchers could not isolate the cause of the sickness, it remains unclear\nwhether the dozens of cases in various countries were caused by a single\n[agent].\n\nDr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, Hong Kong's Secretary of Health, Welfare and Food, said\nthat 43 hospital staff had been admitted to hospitals with symptoms of the\nsickness, and 29 had been found to show signs of pneumonia. An American\nbusinessman who lived in Shanghai died of pneumonia at a hospital here on\nThu 13 Mar 2003. The businessman had passed through Hong Kong to Hanoi,\nwhere he fell ill, entered a hospital and was then evacuated here, when his\ncondition deteriorated and the disease began spreading through the hospital\nstaff. Officials in Vietnam said that 30 doctors and other employees had\nfallen ill at the hospital where the man was treated.\n\nDr. Yeoh pointed out at a press conference this afternoon that there are\n1500 to 2000 cases of pneumonia each month in Hong Kong, and that pneumonia\nis a common problem around the world. But Dr. Yeoh said that the current\noutbreak was troubling because its pattern of transmission appeared\nconsistent with a virus that travels as droplets through the air. By\ncontrast, bacterial infections are the most common causes of pneumonia\nhere, although so-called atypical pneumonia cases also occur, triggered by\ninfluenza and other respiratory viruses. Seeking to allay concerns that\nmight hurt the territory's important tourism industry, however, Dr. Yeoh\nsaid that the disease still appeared to be confined to medical workers and\nwas not spreading through the general population. Hospital officials here\nacknowledged, however, that there might be additional cases among family\nmembers of hospital workers.\n\nTaiwan authorities announced after Dr. Yeoh's press conference that a\nbusinessman had developed pneumonia and his wife was developing flu-like\nsymptoms following their recent trip to Shenzhen, the mainland city\nadjacent to Hong Kong, in China's Guangdong Province. The couple had passed\nthrough Hong Kong on the way home. While Taiwan mildly discouraged its\ncitizens from taking unessential trips to Hong Kong and Guangdong Province,\nSingapore's Ministry of Health issued an unusually strong warning to\ncitizens there. 'As a precautionary measure, the ministry advises you to\navoid travel to Hong Kong, Hanoi and Guangdong province in China for the\ntime being, unless absolutely necessary,' the ministry said at the end of a\nstatement announcing the illnesses there.\n\nChina's Guangdong Province has acknowledged 305 cases earlier this year, a\nthird of them involving medical workers. Mr. Thompson said that the Chinese\ngovernment had asked for technical assistance from the World Health\nOrganization in investigating the Guangdong outbreak, a rare request from\nBeijing, which prides itself on self-sufficiency in technical expertise.\nThe World Health Organization is assembling experts to go to China. The\ngroup already has 6 specialists in Hanoi, Vietnam, to analyze the outbreak\nthere, with more on the way, and one in Hong Kong, Mr. Thompson added.\n\nNone of the people currently suffering from pneumonia has so far been found\nto be infected with the avian influenza that killed a man here and\ntemporarily sickened his son last month, although tests are continuing.\n\n[Byline: Keith Bradsher]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: Fri 14 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hoover's online, Associated Press report, Fri 14 Mar 2003 [edited]\n<http://huknews.hoovers.com/fp.asp?layout=displaynews&doc_id=NR20030314140.5_d38d000d0537d7fb>\n\n\nHong Kong SAR: Government Says Pneumonia Outbreak Confined to Hospitals\n---------------------------------------------------\n5 more hospital workers showed symptoms of pneumonia on Friday, bringing\nthe total to 29 in an outbreak that raised fears of a mystery illness. But\nHong Kong's top health official insisted no epidemic is afoot. 'We are not\ntalking about any outbreak in the community,' said Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, Hong\nKong's secretary for health, welfare and food. 2 of the hospital workers\nwere in serious condition but most were stable, officials said.\n\n43 workers from 4 Hong Kong hospitals have fallen ill, and 29 displayed\nsigns of pneumonia, raising fears that an atypical form of pneumonia that\nrecently killed 5 people in neighboring Guangdong province had made its way\nto this former British colony. Health officials were also trying to see\nwhether there are any links to a disease that spread through a hospital in\nVietnam, forcing its closure early this week. An American businessman from\nShanghai became ill with atypical pneumonia on a trip to Hanoi and infected\n26 workers there before being flown to Hong Kong, where he died Thursday.\n\nThe World Health Organization has issued a global alert, but no links have\nbeen confirmed among the disease outbreaks in Hong Kong, mainland China,\nand Vietnam. Yeoh told reporters Friday the new cases reported in Hong Kong\nwere atypical pneumonia caused by influenza or other viruses, instead of\nthe bacteria that cause regular pneumonia. Yeoh said the territory has not\nseen a jump in overall pneumonia cases or atypical cases, but the hospital\nworkers were vulnerable because they may have treated patients with\natypical pneumonia. Hong Kong gets about 1500 to 2000 cases of pneumonia\neach month, with about half of them atypical, Yeoh said, adding that both\ntypes are commonly seen all over the world. Despite such assurances, many\nHong Kong residents are frightened. Most of the pneumonia cases have\noccurred in workers at the Prince of Wales Hospital in suburban Shatin,\nwhere residents have been snapping up surgical masks. The American man died\nfar away in another part of Hong Kong, in a hospital that has not reported\nany of its employees ill with pneumonia.\n\nAlthough just 6 people have died in the outbreaks under investigation, WHO\nspokesman Dick Thompson said officials were worried because the disease\nspread quickly, and they are not sure what caused it. In Taipei, officials\nat Chiang Kai-shek International Airport put up posters and handed out\nleaflets warning Taiwanese travelers about the outbreak in Hong Kong and\nurging them to be cautious if they go to Hong Kong or mainland China.\n\n[Byline: Min Lee]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The common feature of all these reports is that no viral (or non-viral)\ninfectious agent that is unequivocally associated with these outbreaks has\nyet been isolated.

Robertson <grobertson@erols.com>\n\nAn international team of physicians is investigating an outbreak of an\nunidentified infection that sickened about 25% of the population of four\nremote villages in southern Sudan, and killed about 20% of those who fell\nill.\nThe outbreak occurred in a roadless region near the Ethiopian border among\npeople who have scarcely any contact with the outside world. It began in\nlate July and was over by the end of September, shortly before a team\nheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) arrived. The only contact\nwith the area during the epidemic came in early August, when a Sudanese\nmedical agency sent in eight investigators, two of whom became ill and one\nof whom died.\nThe disease [was] characterized by pneumonia that is often rapidly fatal.\nPreliminary analysis of blood samples has ruled out most viruses as the\ncause, including Ebola virus, which killed 151 people in southern Sudan in\n1976 in one of the first two recorded epidemics of that disease. Many\nbacteria have also been ruled out.\n'There are no viable candidates [as a cause for the disease] now. We really\ndon't know,' said David L. Heymann, head of WHO's division of communicable\ndiseases.\nIt is possible the illness was caused by a known, common pathogen [which]\nthe population has never been exposed to because of its extreme isolation.\nMeasles and influenza, for example, cause high mortality in unexposed\npopulations.\nHowever, 'if it was something new, then it is very worrisome because it\ncould act the same in other populations,' Heymann said.\nOf roughly 2,000 people in the four villages, 110 died. After interviewing\nsurvivors and other villagers, the epidemiologists estimated that at least\n550 people had come down with the illness.\nThat 'case-fatality' rate of 20% is low compared with some infections. In\noutbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, for example, 50-90% of people who\nbecome ill die. Nevertheless, the high prevalence of the infection,\ncombined with its mortality, worries the WHO investigators.\n'If 5% of a population dies within a three-month period, that makes it a\nsignificant event even within a developing country setting,' said Thomas\nGrein, an epidemiologist at the WHO's Geneva headquarters who was part of\nthe international team.\n'The only good thing about this sad event is that it occurred in such a\nsmall population. If you extrapolate this to a much larger population, then\nit would be quite horrendous.'\nThe village complex is called Meyon, and is in a savanna about 3,500 feet\nabove sea level east of the Sudanese town of Boma. It took the WHO team 13\nhours on foot to reach the area from the last road. Much of the trip was\nthrough 6-foot-high grass. They forded four rivers.\nThe four villages are separated from one another by walks of 30 minutes to\ntwo hours duration. The inhabitants are exclusively farmers, growing corn\nand sorghum, and keeping some goats and poultry. Although there is famine\nin parts of southern Sudan, this area is relatively prosperous, and Grein\nsaid the people were healthy and well-nourished.\nThe illness struck all age groups. Infants and toddlers accounted for 6% of\nthe deaths; older children, 23%; adults, 55%; and the elderly, 16%.\nThe epidemiologists identified no 'risk factors' for infection other than\ncontact with other people who were ill. For that reason, they are\nreasonably certain the microbe is transmitted through the air in close\nquarters. In a sub-sample of a village, they found that 42% of households\nhad no cases of the illness, 33% had one, 18% had two, and 7% had more than\ntwo.\nThe incubation for the illness was about five days, and people who became\nseriously ill died in about two days, with fever and a cough producing\nbloody phlegm. This picture more closely fits a bacterial cause than a\nviral one, Grein said.\nSome of the roughly 40 blood samples carried out by the investigators show\nsigns of streptococcal infection. Three people who were given ampicillin --\nan antibiotic effective against strep and many other bacteria -- by the\noriginal Sudanese medical team recovered. However, streptococcal pneumonia\nrarely occurs in epidemics, and Heymann said the pathogen would be an\nunlikely explanation for the outbreak.\nThe team that visited Meyon during the epidemic was from an organization\ncalled Sudan Medical Care. Two of its members became ill, and one died,\nwhen they returned to Boma in August. A woman in Boma was apparently also\ninfected by one of them, but recovered.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[I believe this is the same epidemic that was earlier considered one of\n'acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome'. If so, the location is in Kashipo\nvillage, Boma, Eastern Equatoria. This is a disturbing report and we look\nforward to receiving more information about it. - Mod.CHC]\n....................................chc/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
