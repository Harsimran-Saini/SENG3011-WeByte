In July 2020, local epizootics in the habitat of long-tailed ground squirrels were registered on the territory of Mongun-Tayginskiy and Ovyursky [districts] of the Republic of Tuva. An active epizootic process was registered at one of the sites,\" Rospotrebnadzor said.\n\nThe watchdog added that as many as 4810 people had been vaccinated in the republic's affected areas.\n\n\"Field deratization has been carried out on 3.9 hectares [9.6 acres] of land. Medical institutions' epidemic readiness has been checked and training sessions to identify patients with plague have been carried out. Health education is also underway,\" Rospotrebnadzor noted.\n\nIn early July [2020], the republic's Agriculture Ministry called on the residents to observe preventive measures in connection with the bubonic plague outbreak in Mongolia. Since 2016, Russia has registered no cases of plague in humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-SoAs from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents.

Of the 28 big cats researchers tested, 12 were infected or had been infected, according to the study published in Environmental Conservation.\n\n\"This suggests that: (bubonic plague) may be present at higher levels in the GYE than previously assumed,\" it said, also adding that plague may be a \"significant\" cause of death for the animals.\n\nResearchers carried out the study over the course of 9 years, following the discovery of 2 dead cougars, a mother and her cub, in Wyoming, the Smithsonian Magazine said.\n\nThe deaths weren't in and of themselves surprising, lead researcher Mark Elbroch told Livescience.\n\nIt was the winter, and so starvation was the presumed culprit, but when the true cause of death was discovered, it \"was a shocker,\" he told the outlet.\n\nResearchers said it's very unlikely the average person would ever catch plague from a mountain lion, but given that the disease is capable of animal-to-human transmission, they recommended warnings for some.\n\n\"We would also emphasize that hunters and others handling pumas in this region should be made aware of the possibility of exposure,\" the study said.\n\nCougar behavior makes them a poor means of transferring diseases to people, but as Elbroch's team points out, their high rate of infection means the Yellowstone ecosystem itself could be a hotbed of plague.\n\nA Boy Scout came down with plague in 2008 following a camping trip in Yellowstone National Park, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported.\n\n\"Plague is very much a part of the landscape in the western U.S., and wild animals are frequently exposed to it,\" a USDA researcher Sarah Bevins told National Geographic. \"Human plague infections are still relatively rare ... but untreated plague infections are still just as deadly as they were 500 years ago.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels, chipmunks and prairie dogs are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.\n\nCarnivores (like cougars) may be infected through fleabite or ingestion of infected rodents. Studies of black bears (another carnivore) in California found plague antibody prevalence from 15% to 36%.\n\nThe study referred to can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892920000065. The abstract reads: \"We tested for plague (_Yersinia pestis_) in a puma population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) over 9 years, overlapping a case when a boy in the area became infected with plague. Antibodies to _Y. pestis_ were detected in 8 of 17 (47%) pumas tested by complementenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the organism itself was detected in 4 of 11 (36%) pumas tested after necropsy. Neither puma sex nor age was significantly associated with _Y. pestis_ exposure or mortality, although our sample size was small.

Of the 28 big cats researchers tested, 12 were infected or had been infected, according to the study published in Environmental Conservation.\n\n\"This suggests that: (bubonic plague) may be present at higher levels in the GYE than previously assumed,\" it said, also adding that plague may be a \"significant\" cause of death for the animals.\n\nResearchers carried out the study over the course of 9 years, following the discovery of 2 dead cougars, a mother and her cub, in Wyoming, the Smithsonian Magazine said.\n\nThe deaths weren't in and of themselves surprising, lead researcher Mark Elbroch told Livescience.\n\nIt was the winter, and so starvation was the presumed culprit, but when the true cause of death was discovered, it \"was a shocker,\" he told the outlet.\n\nResearchers said it's very unlikely the average person would ever catch plague from a mountain lion, but given that the disease is capable of animal-to-human transmission, they recommended warnings for some.\n\n\"We would also emphasize that hunters and others handling pumas in this region should be made aware of the possibility of exposure,\" the study said.\n\nCougar behavior makes them a poor means of transferring diseases to people, but as Elbroch's team points out, their high rate of infection means the Yellowstone ecosystem itself could be a hotbed of plague.\n\nA Boy Scout came down with plague in 2008 following a camping trip in Yellowstone National Park, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported.\n\n\"Plague is very much a part of the landscape in the western U.S., and wild animals are frequently exposed to it,\" a USDA researcher Sarah Bevins told National Geographic. \"Human plague infections are still relatively rare ... but untreated plague infections are still just as deadly as they were 500 years ago.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels, chipmunks and prairie dogs are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.\n\nCarnivores (like cougars) may be infected through fleabite or ingestion of infected rodents. Studies of black bears (another carnivore) in California found plague antibody prevalence from 15% to 36%.\n\nThe study referred to can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892920000065. The abstract reads: \"We tested for plague (_Yersinia pestis_) in a puma population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) over 9 years, overlapping a case when a boy in the area became infected with plague. Antibodies to _Y. pestis_ were detected in 8 of 17 (47%) pumas tested by complementenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the organism itself was detected in 4 of 11 (36%) pumas tested after necropsy. Neither puma sex nor age was significantly associated with _Y. pestis_ exposure or mortality, although our sample size was small. The overall prevalence of exposure we recorded was similar to that found along the western slope of Colorado, which is adjacent to the Four Corners region, a known plague hotspot in the USA. This suggests that: (1) _Y. pestis_ may be present at higher levels in the GYE than previously assumed; (2) plague is a significant source of mortality for local pumas (6.6% of sub-adult and adult mortality); and (3) pumas may be a useful sentinel for potential risk of plague exposure to humans throughout the West.

This infection was behind several pandemics including the Black Death of the late middle ages, which is estimated to have killed up to 60% of the European population.\n\nThe 2 new cases being treated at a hospital in Beijing are of the pneumonic form, which is even more serious than bubonic plague. According to the CDC, plague typically spreads to humans who have handled an infected animal or who have been bitten by a flea hosted by an infected animal. However, in the case of pneumonic plague, it can be spread when an infected person coughs. Pneumonic plague is highly contagious and is fatal if not treated quickly with [antimicrobials].\n\nThe WHO said it understood that close contacts were being screened and managed. \"The [Chinese] National Health Commission are implementing efforts to contain and treat the identified cases and increasing surveillance,\" said Fabio Scano, of WHO China.\n\nIt is not the 1st time in recent history that China has dealt with cases of plague. In 2014 the city of Yumen was sealed off and 151 people were placed in quarantine after a man died from the disease.\n\nAccording to the CDC, plague -- largely of the bubonic form -- continues to crop up in rural areas of the USA, including northern Arizona, southern Colorado, and southern Oregon. In 2014 there were 16 cases and 4 deaths in the USA, including that of a man from Utah thought to have come into contact with an infected flea or dead animal.\n\nRecent epidemics have been reported in Africa, Asia, and South America, predominately in rural regions. The WHO reported 3248 cases and 584 deaths from plague worldwide between 2010 and 2015.\n\nIn 2017 Madagascar had an outbreak of plague, with 2348 cases and 202 deaths, of which 1791 cases were pneumonic plague.\n\nThis year, 2019, in Mongolia a couple died from plague apparently after eating raw marmot kidney, triggering a 6-day quarantine in the region.\n\n[Byline: Nicola Davis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 12 Nov 2019\nSource: Xinhua [edited]\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/12/c_138549881.htm\n\n\nTwo people have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague in Beijing, local health authorities confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAccording to the government website of Chaoyang District in Beijing, 2 patients from north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, which doctors in Beijing confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAt present, the 2 patients have received proper treatment in a relevant medical institution of Chaoyang District, and relevant disease prevention and control measures have been taken.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 13 Nov 2019\nSource: Slate.com [edited]\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/pneumonic-plague-black-death-china-sparks-fears-outbreak.html\n\n\nThe Chinese government announced Tuesday [12 Nov 2019] that 2 people in Beijing have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague, a deadly pandemic, once known as the Black Death, that killed tens of millions of people across Europe in the Middle Ages. The 2 patients were 1st treated in Inner Mongolia, a sparsely populated area in northern China, but after persistent respiratory problems and high fever, 2 symptoms of the plague, they were taken to a hospital in Beijing's Chaoyang District. A local news outlet said police quarantined the patients' room on Monday night [11 Nov 2019], but a now-deleted social media post by a doctor at the hospital indicated the pair 1st sought treatment as long back as 10 days ago [3 Nov 2019].\n\nThe timeline of the diagnosis is significant for multiple reasons in assessing the pandemic risk of the highly infectious illness, which can be transmitted by humans. First, although the pneumonic plague is universally fatal when left untreated, if diagnosed and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of showing symptoms, the recovery rate is high, according to the World Health Organization. That would make the timing of the initial hospital visit and when the patients showed symptoms particularly important, as well as whom they may have come into contact with in the meantime.\n\n\"On Tuesday [12 Nov 2019], Chinese censors instructed online news aggregators in China to 'block and control' online discussion related to news about the plague,\" according to a directive seen and reported on by The New York Times. \"Skeptical Chinese internet users have charged the government with being slow to disclose news about the disease, which is transmitted between humans and kills even faster than the more-common bubonic form. China has a history of covering up and being slow to announce infectious outbreaks, prompting many people to call for transparency this time.\"\n\n[Byline: Elliot Hannon]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The cases occurred in Inner Mongolia and were transferred to Beijing for therapy. Based on the 3rd post stating that the illness or illnesses began 10 days before and that without therapy plague pneumonia has a rapid progression to death, it is likely that the cases began with bubonic plague and spread to the lungs in at least one case.\n\nMost cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a \"bubo\". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness.

This infection was behind several pandemics including the Black Death of the late middle ages, which is estimated to have killed up to 60% of the European population.\n\nThe 2 new cases being treated at a hospital in Beijing are of the pneumonic form, which is even more serious than bubonic plague. According to the CDC, plague typically spreads to humans who have handled an infected animal or who have been bitten by a flea hosted by an infected animal. However, in the case of pneumonic plague, it can be spread when an infected person coughs. Pneumonic plague is highly contagious and is fatal if not treated quickly with [antimicrobials].\n\nThe WHO said it understood that close contacts were being screened and managed. \"The [Chinese] National Health Commission are implementing efforts to contain and treat the identified cases and increasing surveillance,\" said Fabio Scano, of WHO China.\n\nIt is not the 1st time in recent history that China has dealt with cases of plague. In 2014 the city of Yumen was sealed off and 151 people were placed in quarantine after a man died from the disease.\n\nAccording to the CDC, plague -- largely of the bubonic form -- continues to crop up in rural areas of the USA, including northern Arizona, southern Colorado, and southern Oregon. In 2014 there were 16 cases and 4 deaths in the USA, including that of a man from Utah thought to have come into contact with an infected flea or dead animal.\n\nRecent epidemics have been reported in Africa, Asia, and South America, predominately in rural regions. The WHO reported 3248 cases and 584 deaths from plague worldwide between 2010 and 2015.\n\nIn 2017 Madagascar had an outbreak of plague, with 2348 cases and 202 deaths, of which 1791 cases were pneumonic plague.\n\nThis year, 2019, in Mongolia a couple died from plague apparently after eating raw marmot kidney, triggering a 6-day quarantine in the region.\n\n[Byline: Nicola Davis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 12 Nov 2019\nSource: Xinhua [edited]\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/12/c_138549881.htm\n\n\nTwo people have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague in Beijing, local health authorities confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAccording to the government website of Chaoyang District in Beijing, 2 patients from north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, which doctors in Beijing confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAt present, the 2 patients have received proper treatment in a relevant medical institution of Chaoyang District, and relevant disease prevention and control measures have been taken.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 13 Nov 2019\nSource: Slate.com [edited]\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/pneumonic-plague-black-death-china-sparks-fears-outbreak.html\n\n\nThe Chinese government announced Tuesday [12 Nov 2019] that 2 people in Beijing have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague, a deadly pandemic, once known as the Black Death, that killed tens of millions of people across Europe in the Middle Ages. The 2 patients were 1st treated in Inner Mongolia, a sparsely populated area in northern China, but after persistent respiratory problems and high fever, 2 symptoms of the plague, they were taken to a hospital in Beijing's Chaoyang District. A local news outlet said police quarantined the patients' room on Monday night [11 Nov 2019], but a now-deleted social media post by a doctor at the hospital indicated the pair 1st sought treatment as long back as 10 days ago [3 Nov 2019].\n\nThe timeline of the diagnosis is significant for multiple reasons in assessing the pandemic risk of the highly infectious illness, which can be transmitted by humans. First, although the pneumonic plague is universally fatal when left untreated, if diagnosed and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of showing symptoms, the recovery rate is high, according to the World Health Organization. That would make the timing of the initial hospital visit and when the patients showed symptoms particularly important, as well as whom they may have come into contact with in the meantime.\n\n\"On Tuesday [12 Nov 2019], Chinese censors instructed online news aggregators in China to 'block and control' online discussion related to news about the plague,\" according to a directive seen and reported on by The New York Times. \"Skeptical Chinese internet users have charged the government with being slow to disclose news about the disease, which is transmitted between humans and kills even faster than the more-common bubonic form.

Based on the 3rd post stating that the illness or illnesses began 10 days before and that without therapy plague pneumonia has a rapid progression to death, it is likely that the cases began with bubonic plague and spread to the lungs in at least one case.\n\nMost cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a \"bubo\". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum.

This infection was behind several pandemics including the Black Death of the late middle ages, which is estimated to have killed up to 60% of the European population.\n\nThe 2 new cases being treated at a hospital in Beijing are of the pneumonic form, which is even more serious than bubonic plague. According to the CDC, plague typically spreads to humans who have handled an infected animal or who have been bitten by a flea hosted by an infected animal. However, in the case of pneumonic plague, it can be spread when an infected person coughs. Pneumonic plague is highly contagious and is fatal if not treated quickly with [antimicrobials].\n\nThe WHO said it understood that close contacts were being screened and managed. \"The [Chinese] National Health Commission are implementing efforts to contain and treat the identified cases and increasing surveillance,\" said Fabio Scano, of WHO China.\n\nIt is not the 1st time in recent history that China has dealt with cases of plague. In 2014 the city of Yumen was sealed off and 151 people were placed in quarantine after a man died from the disease.\n\nAccording to the CDC, plague -- largely of the bubonic form -- continues to crop up in rural areas of the USA, including northern Arizona, southern Colorado, and southern Oregon. In 2014 there were 16 cases and 4 deaths in the USA, including that of a man from Utah thought to have come into contact with an infected flea or dead animal.\n\nRecent epidemics have been reported in Africa, Asia, and South America, predominately in rural regions. The WHO reported 3248 cases and 584 deaths from plague worldwide between 2010 and 2015.\n\nIn 2017 Madagascar had an outbreak of plague, with 2348 cases and 202 deaths, of which 1791 cases were pneumonic plague.\n\nThis year, 2019, in Mongolia a couple died from plague apparently after eating raw marmot kidney, triggering a 6-day quarantine in the region.\n\n[Byline: Nicola Davis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 12 Nov 2019\nSource: Xinhua [edited]\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/12/c_138549881.htm\n\n\nTwo people have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague in Beijing, local health authorities confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAccording to the government website of Chaoyang District in Beijing, 2 patients from north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, which doctors in Beijing confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAt present, the 2 patients have received proper treatment in a relevant medical institution of Chaoyang District, and relevant disease prevention and control measures have been taken.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 13 Nov 2019\nSource: Slate.com [edited]\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/pneumonic-plague-black-death-china-sparks-fears-outbreak.html\n\n\nThe Chinese government announced Tuesday [12 Nov 2019] that 2 people in Beijing have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague, a deadly pandemic, once known as the Black Death, that killed tens of millions of people across Europe in the Middle Ages. The 2 patients were 1st treated in Inner Mongolia, a sparsely populated area in northern China, but after persistent respiratory problems and high fever, 2 symptoms of the plague, they were taken to a hospital in Beijing's Chaoyang District. A local news outlet said police quarantined the patients' room on Monday night [11 Nov 2019], but a now-deleted social media post by a doctor at the hospital indicated the pair 1st sought treatment as long back as 10 days ago [3 Nov 2019].\n\nThe timeline of the diagnosis is significant for multiple reasons in assessing the pandemic risk of the highly infectious illness, which can be transmitted by humans. First, although the pneumonic plague is universally fatal when left untreated, if diagnosed and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of showing symptoms, the recovery rate is high, according to the World Health Organization. That would make the timing of the initial hospital visit and when the patients showed symptoms particularly important, as well as whom they may have come into contact with in the meantime.\n\n\"On Tuesday [12 Nov 2019], Chinese censors instructed online news aggregators in China to 'block and control' online discussion related to news about the plague,\" according to a directive seen and reported on by The New York Times. \"Skeptical Chinese internet users have charged the government with being slow to disclose news about the disease, which is transmitted between humans and kills even faster than the more-common bubonic form.

Based on the 3rd post stating that the illness or illnesses began 10 days before and that without therapy plague pneumonia has a rapid progression to death, it is likely that the cases began with bubonic plague and spread to the lungs in at least one case.\n\nMost cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a \"bubo\". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum.

This infection was behind several pandemics including the Black Death of the late middle ages, which is estimated to have killed up to 60% of the European population.\n\nThe 2 new cases being treated at a hospital in Beijing are of the pneumonic form, which is even more serious than bubonic plague. According to the CDC, plague typically spreads to humans who have handled an infected animal or who have been bitten by a flea hosted by an infected animal. However, in the case of pneumonic plague, it can be spread when an infected person coughs. Pneumonic plague is highly contagious and is fatal if not treated quickly with [antimicrobials].\n\nThe WHO said it understood that close contacts were being screened and managed. \"The [Chinese] National Health Commission are implementing efforts to contain and treat the identified cases and increasing surveillance,\" said Fabio Scano, of WHO China.\n\nIt is not the 1st time in recent history that China has dealt with cases of plague. In 2014 the city of Yumen was sealed off and 151 people were placed in quarantine after a man died from the disease.\n\nAccording to the CDC, plague -- largely of the bubonic form -- continues to crop up in rural areas of the USA, including northern Arizona, southern Colorado, and southern Oregon. In 2014 there were 16 cases and 4 deaths in the USA, including that of a man from Utah thought to have come into contact with an infected flea or dead animal.\n\nRecent epidemics have been reported in Africa, Asia, and South America, predominately in rural regions. The WHO reported 3248 cases and 584 deaths from plague worldwide between 2010 and 2015.\n\nIn 2017 Madagascar had an outbreak of plague, with 2348 cases and 202 deaths, of which 1791 cases were pneumonic plague.\n\nThis year, 2019, in Mongolia a couple died from plague apparently after eating raw marmot kidney, triggering a 6-day quarantine in the region.\n\n[Byline: Nicola Davis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 12 Nov 2019\nSource: Xinhua [edited]\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/12/c_138549881.htm\n\n\nTwo people have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague in Beijing, local health authorities confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAccording to the government website of Chaoyang District in Beijing, 2 patients from north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, which doctors in Beijing confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAt present, the 2 patients have received proper treatment in a relevant medical institution of Chaoyang District, and relevant disease prevention and control measures have been taken.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 13 Nov 2019\nSource: Slate.com [edited]\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/pneumonic-plague-black-death-china-sparks-fears-outbreak.html\n\n\nThe Chinese government announced Tuesday [12 Nov 2019] that 2 people in Beijing have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague, a deadly pandemic, once known as the Black Death, that killed tens of millions of people across Europe in the Middle Ages. The 2 patients were 1st treated in Inner Mongolia, a sparsely populated area in northern China, but after persistent respiratory problems and high fever, 2 symptoms of the plague, they were taken to a hospital in Beijing's Chaoyang District. A local news outlet said police quarantined the patients' room on Monday night [11 Nov 2019], but a now-deleted social media post by a doctor at the hospital indicated the pair 1st sought treatment as long back as 10 days ago [3 Nov 2019].\n\nThe timeline of the diagnosis is significant for multiple reasons in assessing the pandemic risk of the highly infectious illness, which can be transmitted by humans. First, although the pneumonic plague is universally fatal when left untreated, if diagnosed and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of showing symptoms, the recovery rate is high, according to the World Health Organization. That would make the timing of the initial hospital visit and when the patients showed symptoms particularly important, as well as whom they may have come into contact with in the meantime.\n\n\"On Tuesday [12 Nov 2019], Chinese censors instructed online news aggregators in China to 'block and control' online discussion related to news about the plague,\" according to a directive seen and reported on by The New York Times. \"Skeptical Chinese internet users have charged the government with being slow to disclose news about the disease, which is transmitted between humans and kills even faster than the more-common bubonic form.

Based on the 3rd post stating that the illness or illnesses began 10 days before and that without therapy plague pneumonia has a rapid progression to death, it is likely that the cases began with bubonic plague and spread to the lungs in at least one case.\n\nMost cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a \"bubo\". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum.

This infection was behind several pandemics including the Black Death of the late middle ages, which is estimated to have killed up to 60% of the European population.\n\nThe 2 new cases being treated at a hospital in Beijing are of the pneumonic form, which is even more serious than bubonic plague. According to the CDC, plague typically spreads to humans who have handled an infected animal or who have been bitten by a flea hosted by an infected animal. However, in the case of pneumonic plague, it can be spread when an infected person coughs. Pneumonic plague is highly contagious and is fatal if not treated quickly with [antimicrobials].\n\nThe WHO said it understood that close contacts were being screened and managed. \"The [Chinese] National Health Commission are implementing efforts to contain and treat the identified cases and increasing surveillance,\" said Fabio Scano, of WHO China.\n\nIt is not the 1st time in recent history that China has dealt with cases of plague. In 2014 the city of Yumen was sealed off and 151 people were placed in quarantine after a man died from the disease.\n\nAccording to the CDC, plague -- largely of the bubonic form -- continues to crop up in rural areas of the USA, including northern Arizona, southern Colorado, and southern Oregon. In 2014 there were 16 cases and 4 deaths in the USA, including that of a man from Utah thought to have come into contact with an infected flea or dead animal.\n\nRecent epidemics have been reported in Africa, Asia, and South America, predominately in rural regions. The WHO reported 3248 cases and 584 deaths from plague worldwide between 2010 and 2015.\n\nIn 2017 Madagascar had an outbreak of plague, with 2348 cases and 202 deaths, of which 1791 cases were pneumonic plague.\n\nThis year, 2019, in Mongolia a couple died from plague apparently after eating raw marmot kidney, triggering a 6-day quarantine in the region.\n\n[Byline: Nicola Davis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 12 Nov 2019\nSource: Xinhua [edited]\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/12/c_138549881.htm\n\n\nTwo people have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague in Beijing, local health authorities confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAccording to the government website of Chaoyang District in Beijing, 2 patients from north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, which doctors in Beijing confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAt present, the 2 patients have received proper treatment in a relevant medical institution of Chaoyang District, and relevant disease prevention and control measures have been taken.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 13 Nov 2019\nSource: Slate.com [edited]\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/pneumonic-plague-black-death-china-sparks-fears-outbreak.html\n\n\nThe Chinese government announced Tuesday [12 Nov 2019] that 2 people in Beijing have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague, a deadly pandemic, once known as the Black Death, that killed tens of millions of people across Europe in the Middle Ages. The 2 patients were 1st treated in Inner Mongolia, a sparsely populated area in northern China, but after persistent respiratory problems and high fever, 2 symptoms of the plague, they were taken to a hospital in Beijing's Chaoyang District. A local news outlet said police quarantined the patients' room on Monday night [11 Nov 2019], but a now-deleted social media post by a doctor at the hospital indicated the pair 1st sought treatment as long back as 10 days ago [3 Nov 2019].\n\nThe timeline of the diagnosis is significant for multiple reasons in assessing the pandemic risk of the highly infectious illness, which can be transmitted by humans. First, although the pneumonic plague is universally fatal when left untreated, if diagnosed and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of showing symptoms, the recovery rate is high, according to the World Health Organization. That would make the timing of the initial hospital visit and when the patients showed symptoms particularly important, as well as whom they may have come into contact with in the meantime.\n\n\"On Tuesday [12 Nov 2019], Chinese censors instructed online news aggregators in China to 'block and control' online discussion related to news about the plague,\" according to a directive seen and reported on by The New York Times. \"Skeptical Chinese internet users have charged the government with being slow to disclose news about the disease, which is transmitted between humans and kills even faster than the more-common bubonic form. China has a history of covering up and being slow to announce infectious outbreaks, prompting many people to call for transparency this time.\"\n\n[Byline: Elliot Hannon]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The cases occurred in Inner Mongolia and were transferred to Beijing for therapy. Based on the 3rd post stating that the illness or illnesses began 10 days before and that without therapy plague pneumonia has a rapid progression to death, it is likely that the cases began with bubonic plague and spread to the lungs in at least one case.\n\nMost cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a \"bubo\". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of \"primary\" plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nBeijing, China: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/353\nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/356]\nSee Also\nPlague - Congo DR (03): (IT) Guinea pig, comments 20191018.6734330\nPlague - Congo DR (02): (IT) fatal 20191016.6731137\nPlague - Congo DR: (IT) fatal, human, rodent 20191006.6710185\nPlague - Madagascar (02): (AV) bubonic 20190814.6622982\nPlague - Mongolia (03): (BO) bubonic, marmot, fatal, quarantine 20190506.6456511\nPlague - Mongolia (02): (BO) bubonic, marmot, fatal, quarantine 20190503.6454287\nPlague - Mongolia: (BO) bubonic, susp., fatal, quarantine 20190502.6452212\nPlague - Uganda: Congo DR border, pneumonic, fatal 20190312.6363171\n2018\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (06) 20181002.6065963\nPlague - Madagascar (05) 20180924.6048975\nPlague - Madagascar (04) 20180921.6043410\nPlague - Madagascar (03) 20180919.6039244\nPlague - USA (03): (WY) feline 20180829.5995755\nPlague - Peru: (LB) septicemic, fatal 20180714.5905474\nPlague - USA (02): (ID) 20180614.5856107\nPlague - Madagascar (02): 2017-2018 20180502.5780275\nPlague - Bolivia: (LP) bubonic, fatal 20180417.5752357\nPlague - USA: (NM) canine 20180331.5721677\nPlague - Madagascar: (AV) bubonic 20180122.5572973\n2017\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (37): fatal 20171221.5518585\nPlague - China : (GS) septicemic, fatal 20171215.5506305\n.................................................ll/mj/lxl/ll/rd/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "1791-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2037-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Inner Mongolia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Congo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yumen", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Utah", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Oregon", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Arizona", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6734330", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague - Congo DR (03): (IT) Guinea pig, comments", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6734330", "date": "2019-05-06 22:24:49", "main_text": "PLAGUE - MONGOLIA (03): (BAYAN-OLGIY) BUBONIC, MARMOT, FATAL, QUARANTINE\n************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 4 May 2019\nSource: Siberian Times [edited]\nhttps://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/town-in-mongolia-closed-for-quarantine-after-bubonic-plague-claimed-two-lives/\n\n\nThe Mongolian Ministry of Health confirmed 2 people -- a 38-year-old man and his pregnant wife, 37 -- died from plague after consuming raw meat and internal organs of a marmot.

The swollen gland is called a \"bubo.\" Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in the report above, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of \"primary\" plague pneumonia.

The swollen gland is called a \"bubo.\" Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in the report above, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of \"primary\" plague pneumonia.

The aetiological agent is an oomycete fungus, _Aphanomyces astaci_, which is now widespread in Europe as well as in North America.\n\n\"The disease first occurred in Europe in the 3rd quarter of the 19th century in the Franco-German border region. From there, a steady spread of infection occurred, principally in 2 directions, down the Danube into the Balkans and towards the Black Sea, and across the north German plain into Russia and from there south to the Black Sea and north-west to Finland and finally, in 1907, to Sweden. In the 1960s the 1st outbreaks in Spain were reported and in the 1980s further spread of infection to the British Isles, Turkey, Greece, and Norway was reported.\n\n\"The European crayfish species, the noble crayfish _Astacus astacus_ of north-west Europe, the stone crayfish _Austropotamobius pallipes_ of south-west and west Europe, the related _Austropotamobius torrentium_ (mountain streams of south-west Europe), and the slender clawed or Turkish crayfish _Astacus leptodactylus_ of eastern Europe and Asia Minor are all highly susceptible.\" (https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/crayfish-plague). - Mod.CRD\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Northern Ireland, United Kingdom: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/36315]\nSee Also\n2017\n----\nCrayfish plague - Ireland (04): white-clawed crayfish, conf.

Fleas spread the disease between animals. The disease can also be transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected animals or their fleas. Person-to-person transmission is extremely rare and this case was not a risk to others.\n\nSymptoms of plague usually occur within 2 to 6 days of exposure and include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases, there is also a painful swelling of the lymph node [called a bubo - Mod.LL] in the groin, armpit, or neck. Plague signs in cats and dogs include fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph nodes under the jaw of pets. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment can greatly reduce the risk of death in people and pets.\n\nPlague was identified in 2015 and 2016 in ground squirrels in both Elmore and south Ada counties.

The department collected blood in September [2017] from 2 bears killed under depredation permits, and the samples tested positive for antibodies to _Yersinia pestis_, the bacterium that causes plague.\n\nThe California Department of Fish and Wildlife issued the depredation permits. Tanya Espinosa, spokesperson for U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said she could not reveal the location the bears were found because they were not on public lands.\n\nThey were removed by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services because they were damaging private lands and an agricultural resource, Espinosa said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services routinely submits blood samples from bears and other predators it encounters in wildlife management activities. This is, in part, to determine whether they have been exposed to plague in the past.\n\nPlague is a flea-borne disease spread through contact with infected animals, dead or alive, and flea bites. In the 1300s, it killed millions in Europe, and took on the name of the Black Death. Symptoms include fever, nausea, headaches, weakness and swollen, tender lymph nodes. If caught early, it's treatable in the modern age with antibiotics.\n\nPredators like bears often prey on rodents, which are the primary carriers of plague, according to the state Public Health Department. When bears scavenge a plague-infected rodent, they are exposed to plague bacteria and develop antibodies. These bears were infected with the bacterium that causes plague, but unlike humans, bears do not become ill from plague infection, according to the state.\n\nThe public health department can get an indication of plague activity in a geographic area by testing bear blood samples and finding plague antibodies. Positive samples help identify areas where the state department or local agencies can focus rodent surveillance activities to determine the risk to humans and if there is increased plague activity.\n\nPlague routinely occurs in the Sierra Nevada, where the state public health department suspects the bears were most likely exposed, in the mountains east of Paradise. It's hard to pin down exactly where the plague exposure occurred because bears have large home ranges, according to the department.\n\nHistorically, about 12 percent of bear samples have tested positive for plague antibodies, according to California Department of Public Health.

When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.\n\nThe pathogen occurs in California most commonly in chipmunks, ground squirrels, and other rodents, where infection can be subclinical or contribute to mass die-offs.

The department collected blood in September [2017] from 2 bears killed under depredation permits, and the samples tested positive for antibodies to _Yersinia pestis_, the bacterium that causes plague.\n\nThe California Department of Fish and Wildlife issued the depredation permits. Tanya Espinosa, spokesperson for U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said she could not reveal the location the bears were found because they were not on public lands.\n\nThey were removed by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services because they were damaging private lands and an agricultural resource, Espinosa said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services routinely submits blood samples from bears and other predators it encounters in wildlife management activities. This is, in part, to determine whether they have been exposed to plague in the past.\n\nPlague is a flea-borne disease spread through contact with infected animals, dead or alive, and flea bites. In the 1300s, it killed millions in Europe, and took on the name of the Black Death. Symptoms include fever, nausea, headaches, weakness and swollen, tender lymph nodes. If caught early, it's treatable in the modern age with antibiotics.\n\nPredators like bears often prey on rodents, which are the primary carriers of plague, according to the state Public Health Department. When bears scavenge a plague-infected rodent, they are exposed to plague bacteria and develop antibodies. These bears were infected with the bacterium that causes plague, but unlike humans, bears do not become ill from plague infection, according to the state.\n\nThe public health department can get an indication of plague activity in a geographic area by testing bear blood samples and finding plague antibodies. Positive samples help identify areas where the state department or local agencies can focus rodent surveillance activities to determine the risk to humans and if there is increased plague activity.\n\nPlague routinely occurs in the Sierra Nevada, where the state public health department suspects the bears were most likely exposed, in the mountains east of Paradise. It's hard to pin down exactly where the plague exposure occurred because bears have large home ranges, according to the department.\n\nHistorically, about 12 percent of bear samples have tested positive for plague antibodies, according to California Department of Public Health. Positive bear samples have been found in 32 counties in California.\n\n[Byline: Ashiah Scharaga]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.\n\nThe pathogen occurs in California most commonly in chipmunks, ground squirrels, and other rodents, where infection can be subclinical or contribute to mass die-offs. Carnivores (like bears) may be infected through fleabite or ingestion of infected rodents. Studies of black bears in California found plague antibody prevalence from 15 percent to 36 percent. - Mod.PMB\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map: California, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>]\nSee Also\nPlague -

The department collected blood in September [2017] from 2 bears killed under depredation permits, and the samples tested positive for antibodies to _Yersinia pestis_, the bacterium that causes plague.\n\nThe California Department of Fish and Wildlife issued the depredation permits. Tanya Espinosa, spokesperson for U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said she could not reveal the location the bears were found because they were not on public lands.\n\nThey were removed by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services because they were damaging private lands and an agricultural resource, Espinosa said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services routinely submits blood samples from bears and other predators it encounters in wildlife management activities. This is, in part, to determine whether they have been exposed to plague in the past.\n\nPlague is a flea-borne disease spread through contact with infected animals, dead or alive, and flea bites. In the 1300s, it killed millions in Europe, and took on the name of the Black Death. Symptoms include fever, nausea, headaches, weakness and swollen, tender lymph nodes. If caught early, it's treatable in the modern age with antibiotics.\n\nPredators like bears often prey on rodents, which are the primary carriers of plague, according to the state Public Health Department. When bears scavenge a plague-infected rodent, they are exposed to plague bacteria and develop antibodies. These bears were infected with the bacterium that causes plague, but unlike humans, bears do not become ill from plague infection, according to the state.\n\nThe public health department can get an indication of plague activity in a geographic area by testing bear blood samples and finding plague antibodies. Positive samples help identify areas where the state department or local agencies can focus rodent surveillance activities to determine the risk to humans and if there is increased plague activity.\n\nPlague routinely occurs in the Sierra Nevada, where the state public health department suspects the bears were most likely exposed, in the mountains east of Paradise. It's hard to pin down exactly where the plague exposure occurred because bears have large home ranges, according to the department.\n\nHistorically, about 12 percent of bear samples have tested positive for plague antibodies, according to California Department of Public Health. Positive bear samples have been found in 32 counties in California.\n\n[Byline: Ashiah Scharaga]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.\n\nThe pathogen occurs in California most commonly in chipmunks, ground squirrels, and other rodents, where infection can be subclinical or contribute to mass die-offs. Carnivores (like bears) may be infected through fleabite or ingestion of infected rodents. Studies of black bears in California found plague antibody prevalence from 15 percent to 36 percent. - Mod.PMB\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map: California, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>]\nSee Also\nPlague -

The department collected blood in September [2017] from 2 bears killed under depredation permits, and the samples tested positive for antibodies to _Yersinia pestis_, the bacterium that causes plague.\n\nThe California Department of Fish and Wildlife issued the depredation permits. Tanya Espinosa, spokesperson for U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said she could not reveal the location the bears were found because they were not on public lands.\n\nThey were removed by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services because they were damaging private lands and an agricultural resource, Espinosa said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services routinely submits blood samples from bears and other predators it encounters in wildlife management activities. This is, in part, to determine whether they have been exposed to plague in the past.\n\nPlague is a flea-borne disease spread through contact with infected animals, dead or alive, and flea bites. In the 1300s, it killed millions in Europe, and took on the name of the Black Death. Symptoms include fever, nausea, headaches, weakness and swollen, tender lymph nodes. If caught early, it's treatable in the modern age with antibiotics.\n\nPredators like bears often prey on rodents, which are the primary carriers of plague, according to the state Public Health Department. When bears scavenge a plague-infected rodent, they are exposed to plague bacteria and develop antibodies. These bears were infected with the bacterium that causes plague, but unlike humans, bears do not become ill from plague infection, according to the state.\n\nThe public health department can get an indication of plague activity in a geographic area by testing bear blood samples and finding plague antibodies. Positive samples help identify areas where the state department or local agencies can focus rodent surveillance activities to determine the risk to humans and if there is increased plague activity.\n\nPlague routinely occurs in the Sierra Nevada, where the state public health department suspects the bears were most likely exposed, in the mountains east of Paradise. It's hard to pin down exactly where the plague exposure occurred because bears have large home ranges, according to the department.\n\nHistorically, about 12 percent of bear samples have tested positive for plague antibodies, according to California Department of Public Health. Positive bear samples have been found in 32 counties in California.\n\n[Byline: Ashiah Scharaga]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.\n\nThe pathogen occurs in California most commonly in chipmunks, ground squirrels, and other rodents, where infection can be subclinical or contribute to mass die-offs. Carnivores (like bears) may be infected through fleabite or ingestion of infected rodents. Studies of black bears in California found plague antibody prevalence from 15 percent to 36 percent. - Mod.PMB\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map: California, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>]\nSee Also\nPlague -

The AI-2 system is implicated in regulating various bacterial virulence genes in diverse environmental niches. Deletion of the gene encoding the synthetic enzyme for the AI-2 substrate, luxS, leads to either no significant change or, paradoxically, an increase in in-vivo bacterial virulence. We showed that deletion of the rbsA and lsrA genes, components of ABC transport systems that interact with AI-2, synergistically disrupted AI-2 signaling patterns and resulted in a more-than-50-fold decrease in _Y. pestis_ strain CO92 virulence in a stringent pneumonic plague mouse model. Deletion of luxS or lsrK (encoding AI-2 kinase) from the ArbsA AlsrA background strain or complementation of the ArbsA AlsrA mutant with the corresponding gene(s) reverted the virulence phenotype to that of the wild-type _Y. pestis_ CO92. Furthermore, the administration of synthetic AI-2 in mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS mutant strain attenuated this triple mutant to a virulence phenotype similar to that of the ArbsA AlsrA strain in a pneumonic plague model. Conversely, the administration of AI-2 to mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS AlsrK mutant did not rescue animals from lethality, indicating the importance of the AI-2-LsrK axis in regulating bacterial virulence. By performing high-throughput RNA sequencing, the potential role of some AI-2-signaling-regulated genes that modulated bacterial virulence was determined. We anticipate that the characterization of AI-2 signaling in _Y. pestis_ will lead to reexamination of AI-2 systems in other pathogens and that AI-2 signaling may represent a broad-spectrum therapeutic target to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which represent a global crisis of the 21st century.\n\n\"_Yersinia pestis_ is the bacterial agent that causes the highly fatal disease plague. The organism represents a significant concern because of its potential use as a bioterrorism agent, beyond the several thousand naturally occurring human infection cases occurring globally each year. While there has been development of effective antibiotics, the narrow therapeutic window and challenges posed by the existence of antibiotic-resistant strains represent serious concerns. We sought to identify novel virulence factors that could potentially be incorporated into an attenuated vaccine platform or be targeted by novel therapeutics. We show here that a highly conserved quorum-sensing system, autoinducer-2, significantly affected the virulence of _Y. pestis_ in a mouse model of pneumonic plague. We also identified steps in autoinducer-2 signaling which had confounded previous studies and demonstrated the potential for intervention in the virulence mechanism(s) of autoinducer-2. Our findings may have an impact on bacterial pathogenesis research in many other organisms and could result in identifying potential broad-spectrum therapeutic targets to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which represent a global crisis of the 21st century.\" - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]\nSee Also\nPlague - Madagascar (29): fatal 20171104.5422504\nPlague - Madagascar (28): fatal, WHO 20171102.5420572\nPlague - Madagascar (27): fatal, revised numbers 20171101.5417971\nPlague - Madagascar (26): fatal, revised numbers, transportation 20171031.5415688\nPlague - Madagascar (25): fatal, revised numbers, health care transmission 20171026.5405650\nPlague - Madagascar (24): fatal 20171021.5395549\nPlague - Madagascar (23): fatal 20171020.5394246\nPlague - Madagascar (22): fatal 20171020.5392390\nPlague - Madagascar (21): fatal, numbers growing, WHO, MOH 20171019.5389292\nPlague - Seychelles (06): NOT, WHO results 20171018.5388827\nPlague - Madagascar (20): fatal, numbers growing 20171017.5386317\nPlague - Mauritius: ex Madagascar, NOT 20171017.5384887\nPlague - Seychelles (05) 20171015.5382291\nPlague - Madagascar (19): Seychelles ex Madagascar cases 20171014.5380658\nPlague - Seychelles (04): poss. local spread 20171013.5379530\nPlague - Madagascar (18): fatal 20171013.5378893\nPlague - Madagascar (17): South Africa (ex Madagascar) RFI 20171012.5375932\nPlague - Madagascar (16): fatal 20171011.5374264\nPlague - Seychelles (02): poss. local spread, RFI 20171011.5373068\nPlague - Seychelles: ex Madagascar, RFI 20171010.5371382\nPlague - Madagascar (15): fatal 20171009.5369168\nPlague - Madagascar (14): fatal 20171009.5367613\nPlague - Madagascar (13): fatal, more cases, exportations 20171008.5367506\nPlague - Madagascar (12): fatal 20171007.5366522\nPlague - Madagascar (11): fatal, WHO 20171006.5363591\nPlague - Madagascar (10): fatal 20171004.5361339\nPlague - Madagascar (09): fatal, WHO 20171002.5355599\nPlague - Madagascar (08): fatal 20171001.5353252\nPlague - Madagascar (07): fatal 20170929.5349814\nPlague - Madagascar (06): fatal 20170927.5344842\nPlague - Madagascar (05): fatal 20170922.5334851\nPlague - Madagascar (04): fatal 20170920.5329820\nPlague - Madagascar (03): fatal 20170912.5311663\nPlague - Madagascar (02): 2nd cluster 20170122.4784059\nPlague - Uganda: 2011-2014, ciprofloxacin efficacy 20170217.4846917\nPlague - Madagascar: fatalities 20170110.4754927\n.................................................ll/ao/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1947-03-16 00:00:00", "1947-03-16 00:00:00", "1437-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "2021-03-28 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Madagascar", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5481202", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague - Peru: (LL) infected fleas", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5481202", "date": "2017-11-06 17:59:10", "main_text": "PLAGUE - MADAGASCAR (30): FATAL\n*******************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 6 Nov 2017\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/plague-outbreak-update-1947-cases-143-deaths-madagascar-69245/\n\n\nPlague outbreak update: 1947 cases, 143 deaths in Madagascar\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIn an update on the plague outbreak in Madagascar, UN officials now put the ever changing case tally in the epidemic that began on [1 Aug 2017] at 1947 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of plague through [3 Nov 2017].

The AI-2 system is implicated in regulating various bacterial virulence genes in diverse environmental niches. Deletion of the gene encoding the synthetic enzyme for the AI-2 substrate, luxS, leads to either no significant change or, paradoxically, an increase in in-vivo bacterial virulence. We showed that deletion of the rbsA and lsrA genes, components of ABC transport systems that interact with AI-2, synergistically disrupted AI-2 signaling patterns and resulted in a more-than-50-fold decrease in _Y. pestis_ strain CO92 virulence in a stringent pneumonic plague mouse model. Deletion of luxS or lsrK (encoding AI-2 kinase) from the ArbsA AlsrA background strain or complementation of the ArbsA AlsrA mutant with the corresponding gene(s) reverted the virulence phenotype to that of the wild-type _Y. pestis_ CO92. Furthermore, the administration of synthetic AI-2 in mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS mutant strain attenuated this triple mutant to a virulence phenotype similar to that of the ArbsA AlsrA strain in a pneumonic plague model. Conversely, the administration of AI-2 to mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS AlsrK mutant did not rescue animals from lethality, indicating the importance of the AI-2-LsrK axis in regulating bacterial virulence. By performing high-throughput RNA sequencing, the potential role of some AI-2-signaling-regulated genes that modulated bacterial virulence was determined. We anticipate that the characterization of AI-2 signaling in _Y. pestis_ will lead to reexamination of AI-2 systems in other pathogens and that AI-2 signaling may represent a broad-spectrum therapeutic target to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which represent a global crisis of the 21st century.\n\n\"_Yersinia pestis_ is the bacterial agent that causes the highly fatal disease plague. The organism represents a significant concern because of its potential use as a bioterrorism agent, beyond the several thousand naturally occurring human infection cases occurring globally each year. While there has been development of effective antibiotics, the narrow therapeutic window and challenges posed by the existence of antibiotic-resistant strains represent serious concerns. We sought to identify novel virulence factors that could potentially be incorporated into an attenuated vaccine platform or be targeted by novel therapeutics.

The AI-2 system is implicated in regulating various bacterial virulence genes in diverse environmental niches. Deletion of the gene encoding the synthetic enzyme for the AI-2 substrate, luxS, leads to either no significant change or, paradoxically, an increase in in-vivo bacterial virulence. We showed that deletion of the rbsA and lsrA genes, components of ABC transport systems that interact with AI-2, synergistically disrupted AI-2 signaling patterns and resulted in a more-than-50-fold decrease in _Y. pestis_ strain CO92 virulence in a stringent pneumonic plague mouse model. Deletion of luxS or lsrK (encoding AI-2 kinase) from the ArbsA AlsrA background strain or complementation of the ArbsA AlsrA mutant with the corresponding gene(s) reverted the virulence phenotype to that of the wild-type _Y. pestis_ CO92. Furthermore, the administration of synthetic AI-2 in mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS mutant strain attenuated this triple mutant to a virulence phenotype similar to that of the ArbsA AlsrA strain in a pneumonic plague model. Conversely, the administration of AI-2 to mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS AlsrK mutant did not rescue animals from lethality, indicating the importance of the AI-2-LsrK axis in regulating bacterial virulence. By performing high-throughput RNA sequencing, the potential role of some AI-2-signaling-regulated genes that modulated bacterial virulence was determined. We anticipate that the characterization of AI-2 signaling in _Y. pestis_ will lead to reexamination of AI-2 systems in other pathogens and that AI-2 signaling may represent a broad-spectrum therapeutic target to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which represent a global crisis of the 21st century.\n\n\"_Yersinia pestis_ is the bacterial agent that causes the highly fatal disease plague. The organism represents a significant concern because of its potential use as a bioterrorism agent, beyond the several thousand naturally occurring human infection cases occurring globally each year. While there has been development of effective antibiotics, the narrow therapeutic window and challenges posed by the existence of antibiotic-resistant strains represent serious concerns.

The AI-2 system is implicated in regulating various bacterial virulence genes in diverse environmental niches. Deletion of the gene encoding the synthetic enzyme for the AI-2 substrate, luxS, leads to either no significant change or, paradoxically, an increase in in-vivo bacterial virulence. We showed that deletion of the rbsA and lsrA genes, components of ABC transport systems that interact with AI-2, synergistically disrupted AI-2 signaling patterns and resulted in a more-than-50-fold decrease in _Y. pestis_ strain CO92 virulence in a stringent pneumonic plague mouse model. Deletion of luxS or lsrK (encoding AI-2 kinase) from the ArbsA AlsrA background strain or complementation of the ArbsA AlsrA mutant with the corresponding gene(s) reverted the virulence phenotype to that of the wild-type _Y. pestis_ CO92. Furthermore, the administration of synthetic AI-2 in mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS mutant strain attenuated this triple mutant to a virulence phenotype similar to that of the ArbsA AlsrA strain in a pneumonic plague model. Conversely, the administration of AI-2 to mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS AlsrK mutant did not rescue animals from lethality, indicating the importance of the AI-2-LsrK axis in regulating bacterial virulence. By performing high-throughput RNA sequencing, the potential role of some AI-2-signaling-regulated genes that modulated bacterial virulence was determined. We anticipate that the characterization of AI-2 signaling in _Y. pestis_ will lead to reexamination of AI-2 systems in other pathogens and that AI-2 signaling may represent a broad-spectrum therapeutic target to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which represent a global crisis of the 21st century.\n\n\"_Yersinia pestis_ is the bacterial agent that causes the highly fatal disease plague. The organism represents a significant concern because of its potential use as a bioterrorism agent, beyond the several thousand naturally occurring human infection cases occurring globally each year. While there has been development of effective antibiotics, the narrow therapeutic window and challenges posed by the existence of antibiotic-resistant strains represent serious concerns. We sought to identify novel virulence factors that could potentially be incorporated into an attenuated vaccine platform or be targeted by novel therapeutics. We show here that a highly conserved quorum-sensing system, autoinducer-2, significantly affected the virulence of _Y. pestis_ in a mouse model of pneumonic plague.

Our findings may have an impact on bacterial pathogenesis research in many other organisms and could result in identifying potential broad-spectrum therapeutic targets to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which represent a global crisis of the 21st century.\" - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]\nSee Also\nPlague - Madagascar (29): fatal 20171104.5422504\nPlague - Madagascar (28): fatal, WHO 20171102.5420572\nPlague - Madagascar (27): fatal, revised numbers 20171101.5417971\nPlague - Madagascar (26): fatal, revised numbers, transportation 20171031.5415688\nPlague - Madagascar (25): fatal, revised numbers, health care transmission 20171026.5405650\nPlague - Madagascar (24): fatal 20171021.5395549\nPlague - Madagascar (23): fatal 20171020.5394246\nPlague - Madagascar (22): fatal 20171020.5392390\nPlague - Madagascar (21): fatal, numbers growing, WHO, MOH 20171019.5389292\nPlague - Seychelles (06): NOT, WHO results 20171018.5388827\nPlague - Madagascar (20): fatal, numbers growing 20171017.5386317\nPlague - Mauritius: ex Madagascar, NOT 20171017.5384887\nPlague - Seychelles (05) 20171015.5382291\nPlague - Madagascar (19): Seychelles ex Madagascar cases 20171014.5380658\nPlague - Seychelles (04): poss. local spread 20171013.5379530\nPlague - Madagascar (18): fatal 20171013.5378893\nPlague - Madagascar (17): South Africa (ex Madagascar) RFI 20171012.5375932\nPlague - Madagascar (16): fatal 20171011.5374264\nPlague - Seychelles (02): poss. local spread, RFI 20171011.5373068\nPlague - Seychelles: ex Madagascar, RFI 20171010.5371382\nPlague - Madagascar (15): fatal 20171009.5369168\nPlague - Madagascar (14): fatal 20171009.5367613\nPlague - Madagascar (13): fatal, more cases, exportations 20171008.5367506\nPlague - Madagascar (12): fatal 20171007.5366522\nPlague - Madagascar (11): fatal, WHO 20171006.5363591\nPlague - Madagascar (10): fatal 20171004.5361339\nPlague - Madagascar (09): fatal, WHO 20171002.5355599\nPlague - Madagascar (08): fatal 20171001.5353252\nPlague - Madagascar (07): fatal 20170929.5349814\nPlague - Madagascar (06): fatal 20170927.5344842\nPlague - Madagascar (05): fatal 20170922.5334851\nPlague - Madagascar (04): fatal 20170920.5329820\nPlague - Madagascar (03): fatal 20170912.5311663\nPlague - Madagascar (02): 2nd cluster 20170122.4784059\nPlague - Uganda: 2011-2014, ciprofloxacin efficacy 20170217.4846917\nPlague - Madagascar: fatalities 20170110.4754927\n.................................................ll/ao/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1947-03-16 00:00:00", "1947-03-16 00:00:00", "1437-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "2021-03-28 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Madagascar", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5422504", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague - Madagascar (29): fatal", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5422504", "date": "2017-10-20 11:15:02", "main_text": "PLAGUE - MADAGASCAR (22): FATAL\n*******************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\nDate: Thu 19 Oct 2017 2:50 PM\nSource: Voice of America (VOA) News [edited]\nhttps://www.voanews.com/a/un-says-madagascar-plague-cases-top-1000-mark/4077923.html\n\n\nThe number of cases of plague in Madagascar has doubled during the past 5 days, according to the UN.

The government had already prohibited crowds from gathering in order to curb the further spread of the dangerous disease that had sickened 343 people as of [Sun 8 Oct 2017], according to Health Ministry figures. On [Fri 6 Oct 2017], the ministry put the death toll at 36, with 250 sickened.\n\n\"In the heavily populated capital, Antananarivo, 142 people have been infected. Schools in the affected cities of Antananarivo, Toamasina and other regions have been closed for a week,\" the health ministry said. Outbreaks of bubonic plague are common in Madagascar, which lies off Africa's southeastern coast, but the most recent outbreak has included cases of the more serious pneumonic form of plague. About 400 cases of plague are reported in Madagascar every year, most of them bubonic, which is transmitted by fleas. The much rarer pneumonic strain of the disease that is spread person-to-person is fatal unless treated within 24 hours.\n\nThe WHO said it had delivered 1.4 million doses of antimicrobials to Madagascar in view of the plague. With this up to 5000 infected people can be treated and 100 000 can be given a prophylaxis. With early diagnosis, the chances of recovery are good,\" said WHO.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Exportations\nDate: Sat 7 Oct 2017\nSource: UPI [edited]\nhttps://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/10/07/WHO-acting-to-contain-Madagascar-plague-outbreak/9891507406347/\n\n\nThe WHO issued a warning about a worrisome outbreak of plague on the African island of Madagascar that has caused 200 infections and 33 deaths since September 2017 [as above, now 343 and 42 - Mod.LL].\n\nThe outbreak of plague is an annual occurrence in Madagascar, which normally reports about 400 cases per year, usually in the remote island highlands. What makes this outbreak different, according to the WHO, is that many of the infected live in more densely populated towns and the capital Antananarivo. Also, the infections reported are pneumatic plague, which is transmitted through the air, making it much more difficult to control.\n\nPneumatic plague is different from bubonic plague, which is the more common form on Madagascar. Bubonic plague is transmitted when an infected individual is bitten by fleas carried by rats. On Madagascar, the outbreaks are more common in rural rice farming areas and are not as easily transmitted. Both versions of the plague were the cause of the Black Death epidemic in the mid-14th century, which wiped out a 3rd of Europe's population.\n\nIn response to the threat, Madagascar's government has closed schools, businesses and outlawed large public gatherings including concerts and sporting events where the disease could be spread to dozens or even hundreds of people at a time.\n\nThe disease is already confirmed to have left the island after several participants in an international basketball tournament displayed symptoms after arriving home. One coach from the Indian Ocean island nation Seychelles died and another from South Africa was diagnosed but survived. Other tournament participants are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nThe outbreak is similar in some respects to the deadly Ebola outbreak that ravaged parts of west Africa in 2014. Similar to Madagascar's outbreak, a single individual infected in an isolated area traveled to a population center, sparking a deadly outbreak.\n\n[Byline: Eric DuVall]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The case count is growing. The date below is generally the day before the date of the report:\n\nDate / Cases / Deaths\n__________________\n14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 5\n30 Sep 2017 / 73 / 17\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42\n\nIt was difficult to see that the fatality in the Seychelles basketball case had presented after returning home and apparently there is a related case in South Africa with a nonfatal outcome. The analogy to the west Africa Ebola outbreak is somewhat fitting as both had a primarily rural infection introduced in an urban setting. Certainly, cases in an urban setting are a major concern locally and with the possibility of air travel spread. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]\nSee Also\nPlague - Madagascar (12): fatal 20171007.5366522\nPlague - Madagascar (11): fatal, WHO 20171006.5363591\nPlague - Madagascar (10): fatal 20171004.5361339\nPlague - Madagascar (09): fatal, WHO 20171002.5355599\nPlague - Madagascar (08): fatal 20171001.5353252\nPlague - Madagascar (07): fatal 20170929.5349814\nPlague - Madagascar (06): fatal 20170927.5344842\nPlague - Madagascar (05): fatal 20170922.5334851\nPlague - Madagascar (04): fatal 20170920.5329820\nPlague - Madagascar (03): fatal 20170912.5311663\nPlague - Madagascar (02): 2nd cluster 20170122.4784059\nPlague - Uganda: 2011-2014, ciprofloxacin efficacy 20170217.4846917\nPlague - Madagascar: fatalities 20170110.4754927\n2016\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (02): (AS) fatalities 20161214.4698685\nPlague - Zambia: (ES) 2015 20160812.4410640\nPlague - Madagascar 20160108.3920609\n2015\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (05): (IT) fatal 20151118.3801914\nPlague - Madagascar (04): (AO) pneumonic, fatal, WHO 20150908.3631683\nPlague - Madagascar (03): (AO) pneumonic, fatal 20150827.3603984\nPlague - Zambia: (ES) bubonic, susp 20150417.3305202\nPlague - Madagascar (02) 20150212.3162376\nPlague - Madagascar 20150108.3076901\n.................................................sb/ll/ec/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-09-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Madagascar", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5375932", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague - Madagascar (17): South Africa (ex Madagascar) RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5375932", "date": "2017-10-08 16:07:43", "main_text": "PLAGUE - MADAGASCAR (13): FATAL, MORE CASES, EXPORTATIONS\n*********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this posting:\n[1] More Cases\n[2] Exportations\n\n******\n[1] More Cases\nDate: Sun 8 Oct 2017\nSource: Premium Times [edited]\nhttps://www.premiumtimesng.com/foreign/africa/245444-plague-madagascar-schools-closed-death-toll-rises-42.html\n\n\nSchools in several cities across Madagascar will stay closed this week [week of Sun 8 Oct 2017] due to an outbreak of bubonic plague, with the death toll rising to 42, the Health Ministry said on [Sun 8 Oct 2017].

Also, the infections reported are pneumatic plague, which is transmitted through the air, making it much more difficult to control.\n\nPneumatic plague is different from bubonic plague, which is the more common form on Madagascar. Bubonic plague is transmitted when an infected individual is bitten by fleas carried by rats. On Madagascar, the outbreaks are more common in rural rice farming areas and are not as easily transmitted. Both versions of the plague were the cause of the Black Death epidemic in the mid-14th century, which wiped out a 3rd of Europe's population.\n\nIn response to the threat, Madagascar's government has closed schools, businesses and outlawed large public gatherings including concerts and sporting events where the disease could be spread to dozens or even hundreds of people at a time.\n\nThe disease is already confirmed to have left the island after several participants in an international basketball tournament displayed symptoms after arriving home. One coach from the Indian Ocean island nation Seychelles died and another from South Africa was diagnosed but survived. Other tournament participants are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nThe outbreak is similar in some respects to the deadly Ebola outbreak that ravaged parts of west Africa in 2014.

Both versions of the plague were the cause of the Black Death epidemic in the mid-14th century, which wiped out a 3rd of Europe's population.\n\nIn response to the threat, Madagascar's government has closed schools, businesses and outlawed large public gatherings including concerts and sporting events where the disease could be spread to dozens or even hundreds of people at a time.\n\nThe disease is already confirmed to have left the island after several participants in an international basketball tournament displayed symptoms after arriving home. One coach from the Indian Ocean island nation Seychelles died and another from South Africa was diagnosed but survived. Other tournament participants are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nThe outbreak is similar in some respects to the deadly Ebola outbreak that ravaged parts of west Africa in 2014. Similar to Madagascar's outbreak, a single individual infected in an isolated area traveled to a population center, sparking a deadly outbreak.\n\n[Byline: Eric DuVall]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The case count is growing. The date below is generally the day before the date of the report:\n\nDate / Cases / Deaths\n__________________\n14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 5\n30 Sep 2017 / 73 / 17\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42\n\nIt was difficult to see that the fatality in the Seychelles basketball case had presented after returning home and apparently there is a related case in South Africa with a nonfatal outcome. The analogy to the west Africa Ebola outbreak is somewhat fitting as both had a primarily rural infection introduced in an urban setting. Certainly, cases in an urban setting are a major concern locally and with the possibility of air travel spread. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]\nSee Also\nPlague - Madagascar (12): fatal 20171007.5366522\nPlague - Madagascar (11): fatal, WHO 20171006.5363591\nPlague - Madagascar (10): fatal 20171004.5361339\nPlague - Madagascar (09): fatal, WHO 20171002.5355599\nPlague - Madagascar (08): fatal 20171001.5353252\nPlague - Madagascar (07): fatal 20170929.5349814\nPlague - Madagascar (06): fatal 20170927.5344842\nPlague - Madagascar (05): fatal 20170922.5334851\nPlague - Madagascar (04): fatal 20170920.5329820\nPlague - Madagascar (03): fatal 20170912.5311663\nPlague - Madagascar (02): 2nd cluster 20170122.4784059\nPlague - Uganda: 2011-2014, ciprofloxacin efficacy 20170217.4846917\nPlague - Madagascar: fatalities 20170110.4754927\n2016\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (02): (AS) fatalities 20161214.4698685\nPlague - Zambia: (ES) 2015 20160812.4410640\nPlague - Madagascar 20160108.3920609\n2015\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (05): (IT) fatal 20151118.3801914\nPlague - Madagascar (04): (AO) pneumonic, fatal, WHO 20150908.3631683\nPlague - Madagascar (03): (AO) pneumonic, fatal 20150827.3603984\nPlague - Zambia: (ES) bubonic, susp 20150417.3305202\nPlague - Madagascar (02) 20150212.3162376\nPlague - Madagascar 20150108.3076901\n.................................................sb/ll/ec/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-09-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Madagascar", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5366522", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague - Madagascar (12): fatal", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5366522", "date": "2017-09-25 15:24:27", "main_text": "PLAGUE - IRAQ (02): (BAGHDAD) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 24 Sep 2017\nSource: Alghad Press [in Arabic, trans.

For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs.

It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection. - Mod.PMB\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/233.]\nSee Also\nPlague -

It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection. - Mod.PMB\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/233.]\nSee Also\nPlague -

There were also 4 cases in 2015, but one resulted in death.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 percent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 percent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nPlague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Today, modern antibiotics are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death. Presently, human plague infections continue to occur in the western United States, but significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from CDC.

There were also 4 cases in 2015, but one resulted in death.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 percent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 percent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nPlague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Today, modern antibiotics are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death. Presently, human plague infections continue to occur in the western United States, but significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from CDC.

There were also 4 cases in 2015, but one resulted in death.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 percent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 percent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nPlague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Today, modern antibiotics are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death. Presently, human plague infections continue to occur in the western United States, but significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from CDC.

USA: (NEW MEXICO) CANINE\n*****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 10 Feb 2017 10:10 PM\nSource: KOB4 [edited]\nhttp://www.kob.com/health-news/plague-found-east-mountains-new-mexico-health-department/4397147/\n\n\nThe New Mexico Department of Health says it's discovered plague in 3 dogs in the East Mountains.\n\nThe department says in a news release that the dogs were several miles from Edgewood and were confirmed to have plague this year.\n\nPlague is a bacterial disease that can be fatal but in most cases causes fever, chills, headache and weakness.\n\nIt can be passed from animals to people by direct contact.\n\nNew Mexico saw 4 human plague cases in 2016, although nobody died. There were also 4 cases in 2015, but one resulted in death.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 percent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 percent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nPlague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Today, modern antibiotics are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death. Presently, human plague infections continue to occur in the western United States, but significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from CDC.

USA: (NEW MEXICO) CANINE\n*****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 10 Feb 2017 10:10 PM\nSource: KOB4 [edited]\nhttp://www.kob.com/health-news/plague-found-east-mountains-new-mexico-health-department/4397147/\n\n\nThe New Mexico Department of Health says it's discovered plague in 3 dogs in the East Mountains.\n\nThe department says in a news release that the dogs were several miles from Edgewood and were confirmed to have plague this year.\n\nPlague is a bacterial disease that can be fatal but in most cases causes fever, chills, headache and weakness.\n\nIt can be passed from animals to people by direct contact.\n\nNew Mexico saw 4 human plague cases in 2016, although nobody died. There were also 4 cases in 2015, but one resulted in death.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 percent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 percent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nPlague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Today, modern antibiotics are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death. Presently, human plague infections continue to occur in the western United States, but significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from CDC.

On 10 Apr 2015, Zambia's Ministry of Health was notified by the Eastern Provincial Medical Office of possible bubonic plague cases in Nyimba District [Eastern Province]. 11 patients with acute fever and cervical lymphadenopathy had been evaluated at 2 rural health centers during 28 Mar to 9 Apr 2015; 3 patients died. To confirm the outbreak and develop control measures, the Zambia Ministry of Health's Field Epidemiology Training Program (ZFETP) conducted epidemiologic and laboratory investigations in partnership with the University of Zambia's schools of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine and the provincial and district medical offices.\n\n21 patients with clinically compatible plague were identified, with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. The median age was 8 years, and all patients were from the same village. Blood specimens or lymph node aspirates from 6 (29 per cent) patients tested positive for _Yersinia pestis_ by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There is an urgent need to improve early identification and treatment of plague cases. PCR is a potential complementary tool for identifying plague, especially in areas with limited microbiologic capacity. 12 (57 per cent) patients, including all 6 with PCR-positive plague and all 3 who died, also tested positive for malaria by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Plague patients coinfected with malaria might be misdiagnosed as solely having malaria, and appropriate antibacterial treatment to combat plague might not be given, increasing risk for mortality. Because patients with malaria might be coinfected with other pathogens, broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nEpidemiologic investigation\n---------------------------\nAfter the initial report of possible plague cases, the Nyimba District Medical Office began active case finding in the health center catchment areas. During 26 Mar to 5 May 2015, a total of 111 patients with fever or recent history of fever, and swollen lymph nodes were identified and evaluated for possible plague; 82 (75 per cent) patients were admitted to the health centers, treated with intravenous gentamicin and benzyl penicillin, and observed for at least one night. The remaining 29 patients received oral doxycycline and cotrimoxazole as outpatients.\n\nThe ZFETP investigation team arrived on 29 Apr 2015 to support the local response. Illness clinically compatible with plague was defined as temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) or history of recent fever, and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: 1) painful, visibly enlarged cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes; 2) evidence of sepsis (prostration, reduced responsiveness, or hypotension); or 3) severe pneumonia (cough with respiratory distress or hemoptysis). A suspected case of plague was defined as a clinically compatible illness in a resident of Nyimba District, with symptom onset during 15 Mar to 5 May 2015.\n\nAmong the 82 patients who had been hospitalized, 25 (not including any of the 21 identified with clinically compatible plague with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015) were available for physical examination. None had lymph node enlargement consistent with buboes, and none met the case definition. Based on medical record review, among all 82 hospitalized patients, 21 (26 per cent) from the same village met the suspected plague case definition. Among these patients, the earliest reported symptom onset was 26 Mar 2015, and the number of cases peaked during 6-7 Apr 2015 (Figure [for figure and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The median age was 8 years (range 3-18 years), and 95 per cent were aged less than 15 years. 11 (52 per cent) patients were male. After fever, the commonest signs and symptoms were swollen cervical lymph nodes (90 per cent), cough (38 per cent), and headache (33 per cent) (Table 1). 2 patients who died lacked documentation of enlarged nodes, although both had reported neck pain.\n\nAmong the 21 suspected cases, blood specimens were collected from 11 (52 per cent) patients, and lymph node aspirates were collected from 3 (14 per cent) patients for culture. Both blood and lymph node aspirates were obtained from 2 patients (Table 2). Specimens were stored at the district hospital laboratory at 39-46 degrees F (4-8 degrees C) before being transported to the University Teaching Hospital reference laboratory in Lusaka, a process that took 3-17 days. Blood from 4 patients was placed in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes, making these specimens unsuitable for culture. The remaining 7 blood specimens remained negative for _Y. pestis_ after 7 days, including one that likely grew a contaminant. All 3 lymph node aspirates were culture-negative. 5 blood specimens and 2 lymph node aspirates (6 patients) tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR targeting a 478-base pair region of the _Y. pestis_ plasminogen activator gene (2) (Table 2).\n\nAmong 18 (86 per cent) suspected plague patients tested for malaria during initial evaluation by RDT (SD-Bioline Malaria Ag, Standard Diagnostic Incorporation, St Ingbert, Germany), 12 (57 per cent) tested positive, including all 6 who tested PCR-positive for plague. All of the 1st (according to date of symptom onset) 4 suspected plague patients tested positive for malaria and were treated with antimalarials (coartem and arteminisin combination therapy) on their 1st visit. However 3 of the 4 patients had antimicrobials added to their treatment regimen on their 2nd visits to the health center. 2 of the 3 patients who experienced this delayed initiation of antimicrobial therapy died.\n\nStructured interviews conducted with suspected plague patients or their caretakers and families of the decedents revealed that all 21 cases slept on reed mats on the floors of their huts, which was the practice among children in the village. Although no comparison group was interviewed, village elders reported that adults generally slept on beds or mats elevated off the ground.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, indoor spraying of 1303 (96 per cent) households in the 2 rural health center catchment areas was conducted using organophosphates (fenitrothion and pirimiphos-methyl), aimed at reducing the flea population, and recommendations were made to local leaders regarding risks for plague transmission, including that no one should sleep on the floor. Heightened surveillance for possible plague cases was initiated in this catchment area.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe 1st recorded outbreak of bubonic plague in Nyimba District, Zambia resulted in 21 suspected cases and 3 deaths, primarily among children, during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. Although no cases were confirmed by culture (the gold standard), 6 patients tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR. The median age of cases in this outbreak was much lower than that in previous outbreaks in Africa (3,4). One possible explanation for the younger age distribution and absence of cases among adults was the practice of children sleeping on the floor, which might have brought children into closer contact with fleas, whereas adults generally slept on beds elevated off the floor. The identification of exclusively cervical buboes was unexpected, but it is not clear that examination of inguinal or axillary areas was performed consistently. A higher frequency of cervical buboes in plague cases in children compared with adults has been reported, although the inguinal region was the most common bubo location in all age groups (3).\n\nA large proportion (57 per cent) of cases, including all 3 fatal cases and all 6 PCR-positive plague cases, also tested positive for malaria. Malaria positivity might have delayed diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic treatment in some early cases in this outbreak, which might have contributed to poor outcomes. Malaria is often overdiagnosed in regions of Africa with endemic malaria, potentially delaying appropriate therapy for other bacterial illnesses (5). In areas where malaria is highly endemic, parasitemic patients can be acutely coinfected with another pathogen (6), including _Y. pestis_ (7). Malaria parasitemia in Nyimba is high (21.2 per cent) (8), so testing of febrile patients for malaria is routine. The availability of malaria RDTs in health facilities might influence a health provider to treat an RDT-positive patient for only malaria without considering bacterial coinfections. Malaria treatment guidelines published by the Zambia Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization recommend antibiotics for all patients with severe disease. This recommendation could be strengthened by explicit guidance that antibiotic treatment of severely ill patients should be administered even if the patient tests positive for malaria. The antibiotic regimens that were given to the suspected cases were appropriate for the treatment of plague and might have reduced the possibility of developing worse outcomes.\n\nPCR supported the plague diagnosis in Nyimba, because _Y. pestis_ was not isolated from blood specimens or lymph node aspirates obtained from suspected cases. Bacterial isolation is difficult in rural Zambia because of the lack of local microbiology capacity, inexperience with specimen collection and handling, and transport delays to the reference microbiology and PCR laboratory, 217 miles (350 kilometers) away. Blood specimens from the 1st cases were improperly collected, and at least one culture was contaminated with skin flora, suggesting breaches in sterile specimen collection technique. _Y. pestis_ grows on general nutrient-rich media, but at 98.6 degrees F (37 degrees C), its growth rate is slower than that of most other bacteria; therefore, organisms that replicated faster (9) might have masked its presence. Further, it is likely that most patients received antibiotics before specimen collection, although this was not documented. Under these challenging conditions, PCR testing might be more sensitive than culture, because it does not rely on detection of viable organisms. Microbiologic confirmation has been lacking in previous plague outbreaks in Zambia (10) and elsewhere in Africa (4). However, PCR is not considered the gold standard for plague, because false-positive results can occur with specimen cross-contamination.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, among 111 patients identified through active case finding, medical records of 29 (26 per cent) were unavailable for review, which might have resulted in underascertainment of cases. Second, only 25 patients were available for examination during their acute illness, leaving investigators to rely on review of medical records to classify cases. Although follow-up interviews with patients or their parents allowed investigators to confirm symptoms, the number of actual cases might have been underestimated because of missing and incomplete data. Finally, the lack of a control group limited the ability to assess risk factors for illness compatible with plague.\n\nPlague is probably underdetected in Zambia because of limited clinical recognition and laboratory capacity. Had the multiple subsequent cases not raised alarm, the initial cases in Nyimba would likely have been attributed to severe malaria, and plague might not have been recognized. PCR might improve detection, but will not influence clinical management given the long diagnostic delays. A point-of-care diagnostic test could improve early diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy. Efforts to increase awareness of plague among frontline health workers can improve early case recognition and treatment. Broad spectrum antibiotic treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nReferences\n1.

On 10 Apr 2015, Zambia's Ministry of Health was notified by the Eastern Provincial Medical Office of possible bubonic plague cases in Nyimba District [Eastern Province]. 11 patients with acute fever and cervical lymphadenopathy had been evaluated at 2 rural health centers during 28 Mar to 9 Apr 2015; 3 patients died. To confirm the outbreak and develop control measures, the Zambia Ministry of Health's Field Epidemiology Training Program (ZFETP) conducted epidemiologic and laboratory investigations in partnership with the University of Zambia's schools of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine and the provincial and district medical offices.\n\n21 patients with clinically compatible plague were identified, with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. The median age was 8 years, and all patients were from the same village. Blood specimens or lymph node aspirates from 6 (29 per cent) patients tested positive for _Yersinia pestis_ by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There is an urgent need to improve early identification and treatment of plague cases. PCR is a potential complementary tool for identifying plague, especially in areas with limited microbiologic capacity. 12 (57 per cent) patients, including all 6 with PCR-positive plague and all 3 who died, also tested positive for malaria by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Plague patients coinfected with malaria might be misdiagnosed as solely having malaria, and appropriate antibacterial treatment to combat plague might not be given, increasing risk for mortality. Because patients with malaria might be coinfected with other pathogens, broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nEpidemiologic investigation\n---------------------------\nAfter the initial report of possible plague cases, the Nyimba District Medical Office began active case finding in the health center catchment areas. During 26 Mar to 5 May 2015, a total of 111 patients with fever or recent history of fever, and swollen lymph nodes were identified and evaluated for possible plague; 82 (75 per cent) patients were admitted to the health centers, treated with intravenous gentamicin and benzyl penicillin, and observed for at least one night. The remaining 29 patients received oral doxycycline and cotrimoxazole as outpatients.\n\nThe ZFETP investigation team arrived on 29 Apr 2015 to support the local response. Illness clinically compatible with plague was defined as temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) or history of recent fever, and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: 1) painful, visibly enlarged cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes; 2) evidence of sepsis (prostration, reduced responsiveness, or hypotension); or 3) severe pneumonia (cough with respiratory distress or hemoptysis). A suspected case of plague was defined as a clinically compatible illness in a resident of Nyimba District, with symptom onset during 15 Mar to 5 May 2015.\n\nAmong the 82 patients who had been hospitalized, 25 (not including any of the 21 identified with clinically compatible plague with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015) were available for physical examination. None had lymph node enlargement consistent with buboes, and none met the case definition. Based on medical record review, among all 82 hospitalized patients, 21 (26 per cent) from the same village met the suspected plague case definition. Among these patients, the earliest reported symptom onset was 26 Mar 2015, and the number of cases peaked during 6-7 Apr 2015 (Figure [for figure and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The median age was 8 years (range 3-18 years), and 95 per cent were aged less than 15 years. 11 (52 per cent) patients were male. After fever, the commonest signs and symptoms were swollen cervical lymph nodes (90 per cent), cough (38 per cent), and headache (33 per cent) (Table 1). 2 patients who died lacked documentation of enlarged nodes, although both had reported neck pain.\n\nAmong the 21 suspected cases, blood specimens were collected from 11 (52 per cent) patients, and lymph node aspirates were collected from 3 (14 per cent) patients for culture. Both blood and lymph node aspirates were obtained from 2 patients (Table 2). Specimens were stored at the district hospital laboratory at 39-46 degrees F (4-8 degrees C) before being transported to the University Teaching Hospital reference laboratory in Lusaka, a process that took 3-17 days. Blood from 4 patients was placed in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes, making these specimens unsuitable for culture. The remaining 7 blood specimens remained negative for _Y. pestis_ after 7 days, including one that likely grew a contaminant. All 3 lymph node aspirates were culture-negative. 5 blood specimens and 2 lymph node aspirates (6 patients) tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR targeting a 478-base pair region of the _Y. pestis_ plasminogen activator gene (2) (Table 2).\n\nAmong 18 (86 per cent) suspected plague patients tested for malaria during initial evaluation by RDT (SD-Bioline Malaria Ag, Standard Diagnostic Incorporation, St Ingbert, Germany), 12 (57 per cent) tested positive, including all 6 who tested PCR-positive for plague. All of the 1st (according to date of symptom onset) 4 suspected plague patients tested positive for malaria and were treated with antimalarials (coartem and arteminisin combination therapy) on their 1st visit. However 3 of the 4 patients had antimicrobials added to their treatment regimen on their 2nd visits to the health center. 2 of the 3 patients who experienced this delayed initiation of antimicrobial therapy died.\n\nStructured interviews conducted with suspected plague patients or their caretakers and families of the decedents revealed that all 21 cases slept on reed mats on the floors of their huts, which was the practice among children in the village. Although no comparison group was interviewed, village elders reported that adults generally slept on beds or mats elevated off the ground.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, indoor spraying of 1303 (96 per cent) households in the 2 rural health center catchment areas was conducted using organophosphates (fenitrothion and pirimiphos-methyl), aimed at reducing the flea population, and recommendations were made to local leaders regarding risks for plague transmission, including that no one should sleep on the floor. Heightened surveillance for possible plague cases was initiated in this catchment area.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe 1st recorded outbreak of bubonic plague in Nyimba District, Zambia resulted in 21 suspected cases and 3 deaths, primarily among children, during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. Although no cases were confirmed by culture (the gold standard), 6 patients tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR. The median age of cases in this outbreak was much lower than that in previous outbreaks in Africa (3,4). One possible explanation for the younger age distribution and absence of cases among adults was the practice of children sleeping on the floor, which might have brought children into closer contact with fleas, whereas adults generally slept on beds elevated off the floor. The identification of exclusively cervical buboes was unexpected, but it is not clear that examination of inguinal or axillary areas was performed consistently. A higher frequency of cervical buboes in plague cases in children compared with adults has been reported, although the inguinal region was the most common bubo location in all age groups (3).\n\nA large proportion (57 per cent) of cases, including all 3 fatal cases and all 6 PCR-positive plague cases, also tested positive for malaria. Malaria positivity might have delayed diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic treatment in some early cases in this outbreak, which might have contributed to poor outcomes. Malaria is often overdiagnosed in regions of Africa with endemic malaria, potentially delaying appropriate therapy for other bacterial illnesses (5). In areas where malaria is highly endemic, parasitemic patients can be acutely coinfected with another pathogen (6), including _Y. pestis_ (7). Malaria parasitemia in Nyimba is high (21.2 per cent) (8), so testing of febrile patients for malaria is routine. The availability of malaria RDTs in health facilities might influence a health provider to treat an RDT-positive patient for only malaria without considering bacterial coinfections. Malaria treatment guidelines published by the Zambia Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization recommend antibiotics for all patients with severe disease. This recommendation could be strengthened by explicit guidance that antibiotic treatment of severely ill patients should be administered even if the patient tests positive for malaria. The antibiotic regimens that were given to the suspected cases were appropriate for the treatment of plague and might have reduced the possibility of developing worse outcomes.\n\nPCR supported the plague diagnosis in Nyimba, because _Y. pestis_ was not isolated from blood specimens or lymph node aspirates obtained from suspected cases. Bacterial isolation is difficult in rural Zambia because of the lack of local microbiology capacity, inexperience with specimen collection and handling, and transport delays to the reference microbiology and PCR laboratory, 217 miles (350 kilometers) away. Blood specimens from the 1st cases were improperly collected, and at least one culture was contaminated with skin flora, suggesting breaches in sterile specimen collection technique. _Y. pestis_ grows on general nutrient-rich media, but at 98.6 degrees F (37 degrees C), its growth rate is slower than that of most other bacteria; therefore, organisms that replicated faster (9) might have masked its presence. Further, it is likely that most patients received antibiotics before specimen collection, although this was not documented. Under these challenging conditions, PCR testing might be more sensitive than culture, because it does not rely on detection of viable organisms. Microbiologic confirmation has been lacking in previous plague outbreaks in Zambia (10) and elsewhere in Africa (4). However, PCR is not considered the gold standard for plague, because false-positive results can occur with specimen cross-contamination.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, among 111 patients identified through active case finding, medical records of 29 (26 per cent) were unavailable for review, which might have resulted in underascertainment of cases. Second, only 25 patients were available for examination during their acute illness, leaving investigators to rely on review of medical records to classify cases. Although follow-up interviews with patients or their parents allowed investigators to confirm symptoms, the number of actual cases might have been underestimated because of missing and incomplete data. Finally, the lack of a control group limited the ability to assess risk factors for illness compatible with plague.\n\nPlague is probably underdetected in Zambia because of limited clinical recognition and laboratory capacity. Had the multiple subsequent cases not raised alarm, the initial cases in Nyimba would likely have been attributed to severe malaria, and plague might not have been recognized. PCR might improve detection, but will not influence clinical management given the long diagnostic delays. A point-of-care diagnostic test could improve early diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy. Efforts to increase awareness of plague among frontline health workers can improve early case recognition and treatment. Broad spectrum antibiotic treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nReferences\n1.

During 26 Mar to 5 May 2015, a total of 111 patients with fever or recent history of fever, and swollen lymph nodes were identified and evaluated for possible plague; 82 (75 per cent) patients were admitted to the health centers, treated with intravenous gentamicin and benzyl penicillin, and observed for at least one night. The remaining 29 patients received oral doxycycline and cotrimoxazole as outpatients.\n\nThe ZFETP investigation team arrived on 29 Apr 2015 to support the local response. Illness clinically compatible with plague was defined as temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) or history of recent fever, and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: 1) painful, visibly enlarged cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes; 2) evidence of sepsis (prostration, reduced responsiveness, or hypotension); or 3) severe pneumonia (cough with respiratory distress or hemoptysis). A suspected case of plague was defined as a clinically compatible illness in a resident of Nyimba District, with symptom onset during 15 Mar to 5 May 2015.\n\nAmong the 82 patients who had been hospitalized, 25 (not including any of the 21 identified with clinically compatible plague with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015) were available for physical examination. None had lymph node enlargement consistent with buboes, and none met the case definition. Based on medical record review, among all 82 hospitalized patients, 21 (26 per cent) from the same village met the suspected plague case definition. Among these patients, the earliest reported symptom onset was 26 Mar 2015, and the number of cases peaked during 6-7 Apr 2015 (Figure [for figure and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The median age was 8 years (range 3-18 years), and 95 per cent were aged less than 15 years. 11 (52 per cent) patients were male. After fever, the commonest signs and symptoms were swollen cervical lymph nodes (90 per cent), cough (38 per cent), and headache (33 per cent) (Table 1). 2 patients who died lacked documentation of enlarged nodes, although both had reported neck pain.\n\nAmong the 21 suspected cases, blood specimens were collected from 11 (52 per cent) patients, and lymph node aspirates were collected from 3 (14 per cent) patients for culture. Both blood and lymph node aspirates were obtained from 2 patients (Table 2). Specimens were stored at the district hospital laboratory at 39-46 degrees F (4-8 degrees C) before being transported to the University Teaching Hospital reference laboratory in Lusaka, a process that took 3-17 days. Blood from 4 patients was placed in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes, making these specimens unsuitable for culture. The remaining 7 blood specimens remained negative for _Y. pestis_ after 7 days, including one that likely grew a contaminant. All 3 lymph node aspirates were culture-negative. 5 blood specimens and 2 lymph node aspirates (6 patients) tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR targeting a 478-base pair region of the _Y. pestis_ plasminogen activator gene (2) (Table 2).\n\nAmong 18 (86 per cent) suspected plague patients tested for malaria during initial evaluation by RDT (SD-Bioline Malaria Ag, Standard Diagnostic Incorporation, St Ingbert, Germany), 12 (57 per cent) tested positive, including all 6 who tested PCR-positive for plague. All of the 1st (according to date of symptom onset) 4 suspected plague patients tested positive for malaria and were treated with antimalarials (coartem and arteminisin combination therapy) on their 1st visit. However 3 of the 4 patients had antimicrobials added to their treatment regimen on their 2nd visits to the health center. 2 of the 3 patients who experienced this delayed initiation of antimicrobial therapy died.\n\nStructured interviews conducted with suspected plague patients or their caretakers and families of the decedents revealed that all 21 cases slept on reed mats on the floors of their huts, which was the practice among children in the village. Although no comparison group was interviewed, village elders reported that adults generally slept on beds or mats elevated off the ground.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, indoor spraying of 1303 (96 per cent) households in the 2 rural health center catchment areas was conducted using organophosphates (fenitrothion and pirimiphos-methyl), aimed at reducing the flea population, and recommendations were made to local leaders regarding risks for plague transmission, including that no one should sleep on the floor. Heightened surveillance for possible plague cases was initiated in this catchment area.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe 1st recorded outbreak of bubonic plague in Nyimba District, Zambia resulted in 21 suspected cases and 3 deaths, primarily among children, during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. Although no cases were confirmed by culture (the gold standard), 6 patients tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR. The median age of cases in this outbreak was much lower than that in previous outbreaks in Africa (3,4). One possible explanation for the younger age distribution and absence of cases among adults was the practice of children sleeping on the floor, which might have brought children into closer contact with fleas, whereas adults generally slept on beds elevated off the floor. The identification of exclusively cervical buboes was unexpected, but it is not clear that examination of inguinal or axillary areas was performed consistently. A higher frequency of cervical buboes in plague cases in children compared with adults has been reported, although the inguinal region was the most common bubo location in all age groups (3).\n\nA large proportion (57 per cent) of cases, including all 3 fatal cases and all 6 PCR-positive plague cases, also tested positive for malaria. Malaria positivity might have delayed diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic treatment in some early cases in this outbreak, which might have contributed to poor outcomes. Malaria is often overdiagnosed in regions of Africa with endemic malaria, potentially delaying appropriate therapy for other bacterial illnesses (5). In areas where malaria is highly endemic, parasitemic patients can be acutely coinfected with another pathogen (6), including _Y. pestis_ (7). Malaria parasitemia in Nyimba is high (21.2 per cent) (8), so testing of febrile patients for malaria is routine. The availability of malaria RDTs in health facilities might influence a health provider to treat an RDT-positive patient for only malaria without considering bacterial coinfections. Malaria treatment guidelines published by the Zambia Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization recommend antibiotics for all patients with severe disease. This recommendation could be strengthened by explicit guidance that antibiotic treatment of severely ill patients should be administered even if the patient tests positive for malaria. The antibiotic regimens that were given to the suspected cases were appropriate for the treatment of plague and might have reduced the possibility of developing worse outcomes.\n\nPCR supported the plague diagnosis in Nyimba, because _Y. pestis_ was not isolated from blood specimens or lymph node aspirates obtained from suspected cases. Bacterial isolation is difficult in rural Zambia because of the lack of local microbiology capacity, inexperience with specimen collection and handling, and transport delays to the reference microbiology and PCR laboratory, 217 miles (350 kilometers) away. Blood specimens from the 1st cases were improperly collected, and at least one culture was contaminated with skin flora, suggesting breaches in sterile specimen collection technique. _Y. pestis_ grows on general nutrient-rich media, but at 98.6 degrees F (37 degrees C), its growth rate is slower than that of most other bacteria; therefore, organisms that replicated faster (9) might have masked its presence. Further, it is likely that most patients received antibiotics before specimen collection, although this was not documented. Under these challenging conditions, PCR testing might be more sensitive than culture, because it does not rely on detection of viable organisms. Microbiologic confirmation has been lacking in previous plague outbreaks in Zambia (10) and elsewhere in Africa (4). However, PCR is not considered the gold standard for plague, because false-positive results can occur with specimen cross-contamination.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, among 111 patients identified through active case finding, medical records of 29 (26 per cent) were unavailable for review, which might have resulted in underascertainment of cases. Second, only 25 patients were available for examination during their acute illness, leaving investigators to rely on review of medical records to classify cases. Although follow-up interviews with patients or their parents allowed investigators to confirm symptoms, the number of actual cases might have been underestimated because of missing and incomplete data. Finally, the lack of a control group limited the ability to assess risk factors for illness compatible with plague.\n\nPlague is probably underdetected in Zambia because of limited clinical recognition and laboratory capacity. Had the multiple subsequent cases not raised alarm, the initial cases in Nyimba would likely have been attributed to severe malaria, and plague might not have been recognized. PCR might improve detection, but will not influence clinical management given the long diagnostic delays. A point-of-care diagnostic test could improve early diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy. Efforts to increase awareness of plague among frontline health workers can improve early case recognition and treatment. Broad spectrum antibiotic treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nReferences\n1.

On 10 Apr 2015, Zambia's Ministry of Health was notified by the Eastern Provincial Medical Office of possible bubonic plague cases in Nyimba District [Eastern Province]. 11 patients with acute fever and cervical lymphadenopathy had been evaluated at 2 rural health centers during 28 Mar to 9 Apr 2015; 3 patients died. To confirm the outbreak and develop control measures, the Zambia Ministry of Health's Field Epidemiology Training Program (ZFETP) conducted epidemiologic and laboratory investigations in partnership with the University of Zambia's schools of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine and the provincial and district medical offices.\n\n21 patients with clinically compatible plague were identified, with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. The median age was 8 years, and all patients were from the same village. Blood specimens or lymph node aspirates from 6 (29 per cent) patients tested positive for _Yersinia pestis_ by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There is an urgent need to improve early identification and treatment of plague cases. PCR is a potential complementary tool for identifying plague, especially in areas with limited microbiologic capacity. 12 (57 per cent) patients, including all 6 with PCR-positive plague and all 3 who died, also tested positive for malaria by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Plague patients coinfected with malaria might be misdiagnosed as solely having malaria, and appropriate antibacterial treatment to combat plague might not be given, increasing risk for mortality. Because patients with malaria might be coinfected with other pathogens, broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nEpidemiologic investigation\n---------------------------\nAfter the initial report of possible plague cases, the Nyimba District Medical Office began active case finding in the health center catchment areas.

On 10 Apr 2015, Zambia's Ministry of Health was notified by the Eastern Provincial Medical Office of possible bubonic plague cases in Nyimba District [Eastern Province]. 11 patients with acute fever and cervical lymphadenopathy had been evaluated at 2 rural health centers during 28 Mar to 9 Apr 2015; 3 patients died. To confirm the outbreak and develop control measures, the Zambia Ministry of Health's Field Epidemiology Training Program (ZFETP) conducted epidemiologic and laboratory investigations in partnership with the University of Zambia's schools of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine and the provincial and district medical offices.\n\n21 patients with clinically compatible plague were identified, with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. The median age was 8 years, and all patients were from the same village. Blood specimens or lymph node aspirates from 6 (29 per cent) patients tested positive for _Yersinia pestis_ by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There is an urgent need to improve early identification and treatment of plague cases. PCR is a potential complementary tool for identifying plague, especially in areas with limited microbiologic capacity. 12 (57 per cent) patients, including all 6 with PCR-positive plague and all 3 who died, also tested positive for malaria by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Plague patients coinfected with malaria might be misdiagnosed as solely having malaria, and appropriate antibacterial treatment to combat plague might not be given, increasing risk for mortality. Because patients with malaria might be coinfected with other pathogens, broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nEpidemiologic investigation\n---------------------------\nAfter the initial report of possible plague cases, the Nyimba District Medical Office began active case finding in the health center catchment areas. During 26 Mar to 5 May 2015, a total of 111 patients with fever or recent history of fever, and swollen lymph nodes were identified and evaluated for possible plague; 82 (75 per cent) patients were admitted to the health centers, treated with intravenous gentamicin and benzyl penicillin, and observed for at least one night. The remaining 29 patients received oral doxycycline and cotrimoxazole as outpatients.\n\nThe ZFETP investigation team arrived on 29 Apr 2015 to support the local response. Illness clinically compatible with plague was defined as temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) or history of recent fever, and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: 1) painful, visibly enlarged cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes; 2) evidence of sepsis (prostration, reduced responsiveness, or hypotension); or 3) severe pneumonia (cough with respiratory distress or hemoptysis). A suspected case of plague was defined as a clinically compatible illness in a resident of Nyimba District, with symptom onset during 15 Mar to 5 May 2015.\n\nAmong the 82 patients who had been hospitalized, 25 (not including any of the 21 identified with clinically compatible plague with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015) were available for physical examination. None had lymph node enlargement consistent with buboes, and none met the case definition. Based on medical record review, among all 82 hospitalized patients, 21 (26 per cent) from the same village met the suspected plague case definition. Among these patients, the earliest reported symptom onset was 26 Mar 2015, and the number of cases peaked during 6-7 Apr 2015 (Figure [for figure and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The median age was 8 years (range 3-18 years), and 95 per cent were aged less than 15 years. 11 (52 per cent) patients were male. After fever, the commonest signs and symptoms were swollen cervical lymph nodes (90 per cent), cough (38 per cent), and headache (33 per cent) (Table 1). 2 patients who died lacked documentation of enlarged nodes, although both had reported neck pain.\n\nAmong the 21 suspected cases, blood specimens were collected from 11 (52 per cent) patients, and lymph node aspirates were collected from 3 (14 per cent) patients for culture. Both blood and lymph node aspirates were obtained from 2 patients (Table 2). Specimens were stored at the district hospital laboratory at 39-46 degrees F (4-8 degrees C) before being transported to the University Teaching Hospital reference laboratory in Lusaka, a process that took 3-17 days. Blood from 4 patients was placed in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes, making these specimens unsuitable for culture. The remaining 7 blood specimens remained negative for _Y. pestis_ after 7 days, including one that likely grew a contaminant. All 3 lymph node aspirates were culture-negative. 5 blood specimens and 2 lymph node aspirates (6 patients) tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR targeting a 478-base pair region of the _Y. pestis_ plasminogen activator gene (2) (Table 2).\n\nAmong 18 (86 per cent) suspected plague patients tested for malaria during initial evaluation by RDT (SD-Bioline Malaria Ag, Standard Diagnostic Incorporation, St Ingbert, Germany), 12 (57 per cent) tested positive, including all 6 who tested PCR-positive for plague. All of the 1st (according to date of symptom onset) 4 suspected plague patients tested positive for malaria and were treated with antimalarials (coartem and arteminisin combination therapy) on their 1st visit. However 3 of the 4 patients had antimicrobials added to their treatment regimen on their 2nd visits to the health center. 2 of the 3 patients who experienced this delayed initiation of antimicrobial therapy died.\n\nStructured interviews conducted with suspected plague patients or their caretakers and families of the decedents revealed that all 21 cases slept on reed mats on the floors of their huts, which was the practice among children in the village. Although no comparison group was interviewed, village elders reported that adults generally slept on beds or mats elevated off the ground.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, indoor spraying of 1303 (96 per cent) households in the 2 rural health center catchment areas was conducted using organophosphates (fenitrothion and pirimiphos-methyl), aimed at reducing the flea population, and recommendations were made to local leaders regarding risks for plague transmission, including that no one should sleep on the floor. Heightened surveillance for possible plague cases was initiated in this catchment area.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe 1st recorded outbreak of bubonic plague in Nyimba District, Zambia resulted in 21 suspected cases and 3 deaths, primarily among children, during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. Although no cases were confirmed by culture (the gold standard), 6 patients tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR. The median age of cases in this outbreak was much lower than that in previous outbreaks in Africa (3,4). One possible explanation for the younger age distribution and absence of cases among adults was the practice of children sleeping on the floor, which might have brought children into closer contact with fleas, whereas adults generally slept on beds elevated off the floor. The identification of exclusively cervical buboes was unexpected, but it is not clear that examination of inguinal or axillary areas was performed consistently. A higher frequency of cervical buboes in plague cases in children compared with adults has been reported, although the inguinal region was the most common bubo location in all age groups (3).\n\nA large proportion (57 per cent) of cases, including all 3 fatal cases and all 6 PCR-positive plague cases, also tested positive for malaria. Malaria positivity might have delayed diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic treatment in some early cases in this outbreak, which might have contributed to poor outcomes. Malaria is often overdiagnosed in regions of Africa with endemic malaria, potentially delaying appropriate therapy for other bacterial illnesses (5). In areas where malaria is highly endemic, parasitemic patients can be acutely coinfected with another pathogen (6), including _Y. pestis_ (7). Malaria parasitemia in Nyimba is high (21.2 per cent) (8), so testing of febrile patients for malaria is routine. The availability of malaria RDTs in health facilities might influence a health provider to treat an RDT-positive patient for only malaria without considering bacterial coinfections. Malaria treatment guidelines published by the Zambia Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization recommend antibiotics for all patients with severe disease. This recommendation could be strengthened by explicit guidance that antibiotic treatment of severely ill patients should be administered even if the patient tests positive for malaria. The antibiotic regimens that were given to the suspected cases were appropriate for the treatment of plague and might have reduced the possibility of developing worse outcomes.\n\nPCR supported the plague diagnosis in Nyimba, because _Y. pestis_ was not isolated from blood specimens or lymph node aspirates obtained from suspected cases. Bacterial isolation is difficult in rural Zambia because of the lack of local microbiology capacity, inexperience with specimen collection and handling, and transport delays to the reference microbiology and PCR laboratory, 217 miles (350 kilometers) away. Blood specimens from the 1st cases were improperly collected, and at least one culture was contaminated with skin flora, suggesting breaches in sterile specimen collection technique. _Y. pestis_ grows on general nutrient-rich media, but at 98.6 degrees F (37 degrees C), its growth rate is slower than that of most other bacteria; therefore, organisms that replicated faster (9) might have masked its presence. Further, it is likely that most patients received antibiotics before specimen collection, although this was not documented. Under these challenging conditions, PCR testing might be more sensitive than culture, because it does not rely on detection of viable organisms. Microbiologic confirmation has been lacking in previous plague outbreaks in Zambia (10) and elsewhere in Africa (4). However, PCR is not considered the gold standard for plague, because false-positive results can occur with specimen cross-contamination.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, among 111 patients identified through active case finding, medical records of 29 (26 per cent) were unavailable for review, which might have resulted in underascertainment of cases. Second, only 25 patients were available for examination during their acute illness, leaving investigators to rely on review of medical records to classify cases. Although follow-up interviews with patients or their parents allowed investigators to confirm symptoms, the number of actual cases might have been underestimated because of missing and incomplete data. Finally, the lack of a control group limited the ability to assess risk factors for illness compatible with plague.\n\nPlague is probably underdetected in Zambia because of limited clinical recognition and laboratory capacity. Had the multiple subsequent cases not raised alarm, the initial cases in Nyimba would likely have been attributed to severe malaria, and plague might not have been recognized. PCR might improve detection, but will not influence clinical management given the long diagnostic delays. A point-of-care diagnostic test could improve early diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy. Efforts to increase awareness of plague among frontline health workers can improve early case recognition and treatment. Broad spectrum antibiotic treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nReferences\n1.

Illness clinically compatible with plague was defined as temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) or history of recent fever, and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: 1) painful, visibly enlarged cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes; 2) evidence of sepsis (prostration, reduced responsiveness, or hypotension); or 3) severe pneumonia (cough with respiratory distress or hemoptysis). A suspected case of plague was defined as a clinically compatible illness in a resident of Nyimba District, with symptom onset during 15 Mar to 5 May 2015.\n\nAmong the 82 patients who had been hospitalized, 25 (not including any of the 21 identified with clinically compatible plague with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015) were available for physical examination. None had lymph node enlargement consistent with buboes, and none met the case definition. Based on medical record review, among all 82 hospitalized patients, 21 (26 per cent) from the same village met the suspected plague case definition. Among these patients, the earliest reported symptom onset was 26 Mar 2015, and the number of cases peaked during 6-7 Apr 2015 (Figure [for figure and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The median age was 8 years (range 3-18 years), and 95 per cent were aged less than 15 years. 11 (52 per cent) patients were male. After fever, the commonest signs and symptoms were swollen cervical lymph nodes (90 per cent), cough (38 per cent), and headache (33 per cent) (Table 1). 2 patients who died lacked documentation of enlarged nodes, although both had reported neck pain.\n\nAmong the 21 suspected cases, blood specimens were collected from 11 (52 per cent) patients, and lymph node aspirates were collected from 3 (14 per cent) patients for culture. Both blood and lymph node aspirates were obtained from 2 patients (Table 2). Specimens were stored at the district hospital laboratory at 39-46 degrees F (4-8 degrees C) before being transported to the University Teaching Hospital reference laboratory in Lusaka, a process that took 3-17 days. Blood from 4 patients was placed in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes, making these specimens unsuitable for culture. The remaining 7 blood specimens remained negative for _Y. pestis_ after 7 days, including one that likely grew a contaminant. All 3 lymph node aspirates were culture-negative. 5 blood specimens and 2 lymph node aspirates (6 patients) tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR targeting a 478-base pair region of the _Y. pestis_ plasminogen activator gene (2) (Table 2).\n\nAmong 18 (86 per cent) suspected plague patients tested for malaria during initial evaluation by RDT (SD-Bioline Malaria Ag, Standard Diagnostic Incorporation, St Ingbert, Germany), 12 (57 per cent) tested positive, including all 6 who tested PCR-positive for plague. All of the 1st (according to date of symptom onset) 4 suspected plague patients tested positive for malaria and were treated with antimalarials (coartem and arteminisin combination therapy) on their 1st visit. However 3 of the 4 patients had antimicrobials added to their treatment regimen on their 2nd visits to the health center. 2 of the 3 patients who experienced this delayed initiation of antimicrobial therapy died.\n\nStructured interviews conducted with suspected plague patients or their caretakers and families of the decedents revealed that all 21 cases slept on reed mats on the floors of their huts, which was the practice among children in the village. Although no comparison group was interviewed, village elders reported that adults generally slept on beds or mats elevated off the ground.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, indoor spraying of 1303 (96 per cent) households in the 2 rural health center catchment areas was conducted using organophosphates (fenitrothion and pirimiphos-methyl), aimed at reducing the flea population, and recommendations were made to local leaders regarding risks for plague transmission, including that no one should sleep on the floor. Heightened surveillance for possible plague cases was initiated in this catchment area.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe 1st recorded outbreak of bubonic plague in Nyimba District, Zambia resulted in 21 suspected cases and 3 deaths, primarily among children, during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. Although no cases were confirmed by culture (the gold standard), 6 patients tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR. The median age of cases in this outbreak was much lower than that in previous outbreaks in Africa (3,4). One possible explanation for the younger age distribution and absence of cases among adults was the practice of children sleeping on the floor, which might have brought children into closer contact with fleas, whereas adults generally slept on beds elevated off the floor. The identification of exclusively cervical buboes was unexpected, but it is not clear that examination of inguinal or axillary areas was performed consistently. A higher frequency of cervical buboes in plague cases in children compared with adults has been reported, although the inguinal region was the most common bubo location in all age groups (3).\n\nA large proportion (57 per cent) of cases, including all 3 fatal cases and all 6 PCR-positive plague cases, also tested positive for malaria. Malaria positivity might have delayed diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic treatment in some early cases in this outbreak, which might have contributed to poor outcomes. Malaria is often overdiagnosed in regions of Africa with endemic malaria, potentially delaying appropriate therapy for other bacterial illnesses (5). In areas where malaria is highly endemic, parasitemic patients can be acutely coinfected with another pathogen (6), including _Y. pestis_ (7). Malaria parasitemia in Nyimba is high (21.2 per cent) (8), so testing of febrile patients for malaria is routine. The availability of malaria RDTs in health facilities might influence a health provider to treat an RDT-positive patient for only malaria without considering bacterial coinfections. Malaria treatment guidelines published by the Zambia Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization recommend antibiotics for all patients with severe disease. This recommendation could be strengthened by explicit guidance that antibiotic treatment of severely ill patients should be administered even if the patient tests positive for malaria. The antibiotic regimens that were given to the suspected cases were appropriate for the treatment of plague and might have reduced the possibility of developing worse outcomes.\n\nPCR supported the plague diagnosis in Nyimba, because _Y. pestis_ was not isolated from blood specimens or lymph node aspirates obtained from suspected cases. Bacterial isolation is difficult in rural Zambia because of the lack of local microbiology capacity, inexperience with specimen collection and handling, and transport delays to the reference microbiology and PCR laboratory, 217 miles (350 kilometers) away. Blood specimens from the 1st cases were improperly collected, and at least one culture was contaminated with skin flora, suggesting breaches in sterile specimen collection technique. _Y. pestis_ grows on general nutrient-rich media, but at 98.6 degrees F (37 degrees C), its growth rate is slower than that of most other bacteria; therefore, organisms that replicated faster (9) might have masked its presence. Further, it is likely that most patients received antibiotics before specimen collection, although this was not documented. Under these challenging conditions, PCR testing might be more sensitive than culture, because it does not rely on detection of viable organisms. Microbiologic confirmation has been lacking in previous plague outbreaks in Zambia (10) and elsewhere in Africa (4). However, PCR is not considered the gold standard for plague, because false-positive results can occur with specimen cross-contamination.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, among 111 patients identified through active case finding, medical records of 29 (26 per cent) were unavailable for review, which might have resulted in underascertainment of cases. Second, only 25 patients were available for examination during their acute illness, leaving investigators to rely on review of medical records to classify cases. Although follow-up interviews with patients or their parents allowed investigators to confirm symptoms, the number of actual cases might have been underestimated because of missing and incomplete data. Finally, the lack of a control group limited the ability to assess risk factors for illness compatible with plague.\n\nPlague is probably underdetected in Zambia because of limited clinical recognition and laboratory capacity. Had the multiple subsequent cases not raised alarm, the initial cases in Nyimba would likely have been attributed to severe malaria, and plague might not have been recognized. PCR might improve detection, but will not influence clinical management given the long diagnostic delays. A point-of-care diagnostic test could improve early diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy. Efforts to increase awareness of plague among frontline health workers can improve early case recognition and treatment. Broad spectrum antibiotic treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nReferences\n1.

On 10 Apr 2015, Zambia's Ministry of Health was notified by the Eastern Provincial Medical Office of possible bubonic plague cases in Nyimba District [Eastern Province]. 11 patients with acute fever and cervical lymphadenopathy had been evaluated at 2 rural health centers during 28 Mar to 9 Apr 2015; 3 patients died. To confirm the outbreak and develop control measures, the Zambia Ministry of Health's Field Epidemiology Training Program (ZFETP) conducted epidemiologic and laboratory investigations in partnership with the University of Zambia's schools of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine and the provincial and district medical offices.\n\n21 patients with clinically compatible plague were identified, with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. The median age was 8 years, and all patients were from the same village. Blood specimens or lymph node aspirates from 6 (29 per cent) patients tested positive for _Yersinia pestis_ by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There is an urgent need to improve early identification and treatment of plague cases. PCR is a potential complementary tool for identifying plague, especially in areas with limited microbiologic capacity. 12 (57 per cent) patients, including all 6 with PCR-positive plague and all 3 who died, also tested positive for malaria by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Plague patients coinfected with malaria might be misdiagnosed as solely having malaria, and appropriate antibacterial treatment to combat plague might not be given, increasing risk for mortality. Because patients with malaria might be coinfected with other pathogens, broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nEpidemiologic investigation\n---------------------------\nAfter the initial report of possible plague cases, the Nyimba District Medical Office began active case finding in the health center catchment areas. During 26 Mar to 5 May 2015, a total of 111 patients with fever or recent history of fever, and swollen lymph nodes were identified and evaluated for possible plague; 82 (75 per cent) patients were admitted to the health centers, treated with intravenous gentamicin and benzyl penicillin, and observed for at least one night. The remaining 29 patients received oral doxycycline and cotrimoxazole as outpatients.\n\nThe ZFETP investigation team arrived on 29 Apr 2015 to support the local response. Illness clinically compatible with plague was defined as temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) or history of recent fever, and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: 1) painful, visibly enlarged cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes; 2) evidence of sepsis (prostration, reduced responsiveness, or hypotension); or 3) severe pneumonia (cough with respiratory distress or hemoptysis). A suspected case of plague was defined as a clinically compatible illness in a resident of Nyimba District, with symptom onset during 15 Mar to 5 May 2015.\n\nAmong the 82 patients who had been hospitalized, 25 (not including any of the 21 identified with clinically compatible plague with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015) were available for physical examination.

On 10 Apr 2015, Zambia's Ministry of Health was notified by the Eastern Provincial Medical Office of possible bubonic plague cases in Nyimba District [Eastern Province]. 11 patients with acute fever and cervical lymphadenopathy had been evaluated at 2 rural health centers during 28 Mar to 9 Apr 2015; 3 patients died. To confirm the outbreak and develop control measures, the Zambia Ministry of Health's Field Epidemiology Training Program (ZFETP) conducted epidemiologic and laboratory investigations in partnership with the University of Zambia's schools of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine and the provincial and district medical offices.\n\n21 patients with clinically compatible plague were identified, with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. The median age was 8 years, and all patients were from the same village. Blood specimens or lymph node aspirates from 6 (29 per cent) patients tested positive for _Yersinia pestis_ by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There is an urgent need to improve early identification and treatment of plague cases. PCR is a potential complementary tool for identifying plague, especially in areas with limited microbiologic capacity. 12 (57 per cent) patients, including all 6 with PCR-positive plague and all 3 who died, also tested positive for malaria by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Plague patients coinfected with malaria might be misdiagnosed as solely having malaria, and appropriate antibacterial treatment to combat plague might not be given, increasing risk for mortality. Because patients with malaria might be coinfected with other pathogens, broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nEpidemiologic investigation\n---------------------------\nAfter the initial report of possible plague cases, the Nyimba District Medical Office began active case finding in the health center catchment areas. During 26 Mar to 5 May 2015, a total of 111 patients with fever or recent history of fever, and swollen lymph nodes were identified and evaluated for possible plague; 82 (75 per cent) patients were admitted to the health centers, treated with intravenous gentamicin and benzyl penicillin, and observed for at least one night. The remaining 29 patients received oral doxycycline and cotrimoxazole as outpatients.\n\nThe ZFETP investigation team arrived on 29 Apr 2015 to support the local response. Illness clinically compatible with plague was defined as temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) or history of recent fever, and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: 1) painful, visibly enlarged cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes; 2) evidence of sepsis (prostration, reduced responsiveness, or hypotension); or 3) severe pneumonia (cough with respiratory distress or hemoptysis). A suspected case of plague was defined as a clinically compatible illness in a resident of Nyimba District, with symptom onset during 15 Mar to 5 May 2015.\n\nAmong the 82 patients who had been hospitalized, 25 (not including any of the 21 identified with clinically compatible plague with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015) were available for physical examination. None had lymph node enlargement consistent with buboes, and none met the case definition. Based on medical record review, among all 82 hospitalized patients, 21 (26 per cent) from the same village met the suspected plague case definition. Among these patients, the earliest reported symptom onset was 26 Mar 2015, and the number of cases peaked during 6-7 Apr 2015 (Figure [for figure and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The median age was 8 years (range 3-18 years), and 95 per cent were aged less than 15 years. 11 (52 per cent) patients were male. After fever, the commonest signs and symptoms were swollen cervical lymph nodes (90 per cent), cough (38 per cent), and headache (33 per cent) (Table 1). 2 patients who died lacked documentation of enlarged nodes, although both had reported neck pain.\n\nAmong the 21 suspected cases, blood specimens were collected from 11 (52 per cent) patients, and lymph node aspirates were collected from 3 (14 per cent) patients for culture. Both blood and lymph node aspirates were obtained from 2 patients (Table 2). Specimens were stored at the district hospital laboratory at 39-46 degrees F (4-8 degrees C) before being transported to the University Teaching Hospital reference laboratory in Lusaka, a process that took 3-17 days. Blood from 4 patients was placed in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes, making these specimens unsuitable for culture. The remaining 7 blood specimens remained negative for _Y. pestis_ after 7 days, including one that likely grew a contaminant. All 3 lymph node aspirates were culture-negative. 5 blood specimens and 2 lymph node aspirates (6 patients) tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR targeting a 478-base pair region of the _Y. pestis_ plasminogen activator gene (2) (Table 2).\n\nAmong 18 (86 per cent) suspected plague patients tested for malaria during initial evaluation by RDT (SD-Bioline Malaria Ag, Standard Diagnostic Incorporation, St Ingbert, Germany), 12 (57 per cent) tested positive, including all 6 who tested PCR-positive for plague. All of the 1st (according to date of symptom onset) 4 suspected plague patients tested positive for malaria and were treated with antimalarials (coartem and arteminisin combination therapy) on their 1st visit. However 3 of the 4 patients had antimicrobials added to their treatment regimen on their 2nd visits to the health center. 2 of the 3 patients who experienced this delayed initiation of antimicrobial therapy died.\n\nStructured interviews conducted with suspected plague patients or their caretakers and families of the decedents revealed that all 21 cases slept on reed mats on the floors of their huts, which was the practice among children in the village. Although no comparison group was interviewed, village elders reported that adults generally slept on beds or mats elevated off the ground.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, indoor spraying of 1303 (96 per cent) households in the 2 rural health center catchment areas was conducted using organophosphates (fenitrothion and pirimiphos-methyl), aimed at reducing the flea population, and recommendations were made to local leaders regarding risks for plague transmission, including that no one should sleep on the floor. Heightened surveillance for possible plague cases was initiated in this catchment area.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe 1st recorded outbreak of bubonic plague in Nyimba District, Zambia resulted in 21 suspected cases and 3 deaths, primarily among children, during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. Although no cases were confirmed by culture (the gold standard), 6 patients tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR. The median age of cases in this outbreak was much lower than that in previous outbreaks in Africa (3,4). One possible explanation for the younger age distribution and absence of cases among adults was the practice of children sleeping on the floor, which might have brought children into closer contact with fleas, whereas adults generally slept on beds elevated off the floor. The identification of exclusively cervical buboes was unexpected, but it is not clear that examination of inguinal or axillary areas was performed consistently. A higher frequency of cervical buboes in plague cases in children compared with adults has been reported, although the inguinal region was the most common bubo location in all age groups (3).\n\nA large proportion (57 per cent) of cases, including all 3 fatal cases and all 6 PCR-positive plague cases, also tested positive for malaria. Malaria positivity might have delayed diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic treatment in some early cases in this outbreak, which might have contributed to poor outcomes. Malaria is often overdiagnosed in regions of Africa with endemic malaria, potentially delaying appropriate therapy for other bacterial illnesses (5). In areas where malaria is highly endemic, parasitemic patients can be acutely coinfected with another pathogen (6), including _Y. pestis_ (7). Malaria parasitemia in Nyimba is high (21.2 per cent) (8), so testing of febrile patients for malaria is routine. The availability of malaria RDTs in health facilities might influence a health provider to treat an RDT-positive patient for only malaria without considering bacterial coinfections. Malaria treatment guidelines published by the Zambia Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization recommend antibiotics for all patients with severe disease. This recommendation could be strengthened by explicit guidance that antibiotic treatment of severely ill patients should be administered even if the patient tests positive for malaria. The antibiotic regimens that were given to the suspected cases were appropriate for the treatment of plague and might have reduced the possibility of developing worse outcomes.\n\nPCR supported the plague diagnosis in Nyimba, because _Y. pestis_ was not isolated from blood specimens or lymph node aspirates obtained from suspected cases. Bacterial isolation is difficult in rural Zambia because of the lack of local microbiology capacity, inexperience with specimen collection and handling, and transport delays to the reference microbiology and PCR laboratory, 217 miles (350 kilometers) away. Blood specimens from the 1st cases were improperly collected, and at least one culture was contaminated with skin flora, suggesting breaches in sterile specimen collection technique. _Y. pestis_ grows on general nutrient-rich media, but at 98.6 degrees F (37 degrees C), its growth rate is slower than that of most other bacteria; therefore, organisms that replicated faster (9) might have masked its presence. Further, it is likely that most patients received antibiotics before specimen collection, although this was not documented. Under these challenging conditions, PCR testing might be more sensitive than culture, because it does not rely on detection of viable organisms. Microbiologic confirmation has been lacking in previous plague outbreaks in Zambia (10) and elsewhere in Africa (4). However, PCR is not considered the gold standard for plague, because false-positive results can occur with specimen cross-contamination.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, among 111 patients identified through active case finding, medical records of 29 (26 per cent) were unavailable for review, which might have resulted in underascertainment of cases. Second, only 25 patients were available for examination during their acute illness, leaving investigators to rely on review of medical records to classify cases. Although follow-up interviews with patients or their parents allowed investigators to confirm symptoms, the number of actual cases might have been underestimated because of missing and incomplete data. Finally, the lack of a control group limited the ability to assess risk factors for illness compatible with plague.\n\nPlague is probably underdetected in Zambia because of limited clinical recognition and laboratory capacity. Had the multiple subsequent cases not raised alarm, the initial cases in Nyimba would likely have been attributed to severe malaria, and plague might not have been recognized. PCR might improve detection, but will not influence clinical management given the long diagnostic delays. A point-of-care diagnostic test could improve early diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy. Efforts to increase awareness of plague among frontline health workers can improve early case recognition and treatment. Broad spectrum antibiotic treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nReferences\n1.

This is the 2nd cat death within the last week thought to be connected to the bacterial infection, though the cats were owned by separate families. The most recent cat lived both indoors and outdoors, and had contact with ground squirrels before becoming ill. Family members and other household pets are being monitored to ensure the cat did not spread the infection. Final lab results will be available next week.\n\nThe cat lived approximately 2 miles [3.2 km] from Mountain Home in an area not previously identified with confirmed plague. \"We want to emphasize that plague is likely present at some level in ground squirrel populations throughout the sagebrush habitat in southern Idaho. With the known confirmed cases in these areas we want to people to be aware and be able to take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their pets from plague,\" said State Wildlife Veterinarian Dr Mark Drew.\n\nPlague is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas and can cause serious illness to people and pets if not treated quickly. It also can be transmitted to people by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, rabbits and pets. Common rodents that can become infected include ground squirrels, rats, voles, and mice. Tree squirrels in Idaho are not known to carry plague.\n\nPublic health officials urge everyone to take proper precautions to protect themselves and their pets against plague regardless of where they live in proximity to the latest area of impact. To prevent plague in humans:\n- see your doctor immediately about any unexplained illness with a severe fever if you have been in the affected area;\n- avoid picking up or touching dead animals; wear gloves if you must handle dead animals;\n- do not let pets sleep in bed with you.

In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report it to their local public health district.\n\nSigns of plague in animals\n--------------------------\nPlague signs in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced.\n\nAmong pets, cats are highly susceptible to plague and may be an indicator that plague is in the area. If plague is suspected, any type of animal or human should be treated by a health professional immediately.\n\nBackground\n----------\nIn late May [2016], the Idaho Department of Fish and Game collected dead ground squirrels from several areas in Ada County and submitted them to public health laboratories for testing. The laboratory found the plague bacterium. Ground squirrel populations with plague can experience high mortality, sometimes evidenced by large numbers of carcasses. At this time, plague has been detected in ground squirrels -- not tree squirrels. Subsequently, a cat in neighboring Elmore County died of plague.\n\nPlague activity can increase in the spring and summer months when rodents are more active. However, wildlife experts say ground squirrels begin hibernating in late June/early July, at which time the threat of plague will decrease.\n\nArea of impact where plague has been identified in ground squirrels to date. Please note that rodents outside of this area may carry plague and prevention efforts should be heeded.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from: CDC. Notes from the field: 2 cases of human plague -- Oregon, 2010.

Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from: CDC. Notes from the field: 2 cases of human plague -- Oregon, 2010.

This is the 2nd cat death within the last week thought to be connected to the bacterial infection, though the cats were owned by separate families. The most recent cat lived both indoors and outdoors, and had contact with ground squirrels before becoming ill. Family members and other household pets are being monitored to ensure the cat did not spread the infection. Final lab results will be available next week.\n\nThe cat lived approximately 2 miles [3.2 km] from Mountain Home in an area not previously identified with confirmed plague. \"We want to emphasize that plague is likely present at some level in ground squirrel populations throughout the sagebrush habitat in southern Idaho. With the known confirmed cases in these areas we want to people to be aware and be able to take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their pets from plague,\" said State Wildlife Veterinarian Dr Mark Drew.\n\nPlague is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas and can cause serious illness to people and pets if not treated quickly. It also can be transmitted to people by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, rabbits and pets. Common rodents that can become infected include ground squirrels, rats, voles, and mice. Tree squirrels in Idaho are not known to carry plague.\n\nPublic health officials urge everyone to take proper precautions to protect themselves and their pets against plague regardless of where they live in proximity to the latest area of impact. To prevent plague in humans:\n- see your doctor immediately about any unexplained illness with a severe fever if you have been in the affected area;\n- avoid picking up or touching dead animals; wear gloves if you must handle dead animals;\n- do not let pets sleep in bed with you. This has been shown to increase your risk of getting plague;\n- clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles;\n- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;\n- wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants;\n- use DEET on clothing in accordance with label instructions or wear clothing pre-treated with permethrin;\n- use DEET on exposed skin, in accordance with label instructions.\n\nPlague prevention in pets:\n- do not let your pets hunt or roam in the affected area;\n- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets;\n- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian;\n- don't leave your pet's food and water where rodents can get to it.\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans\n----------------------------\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report it to their local public health district.\n\nSigns of plague in animals\n--------------------------\nPlague signs in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced.\n\nAmong pets, cats are highly susceptible to plague and may be an indicator that plague is in the area. If plague is suspected, any type of animal or human should be treated by a health professional immediately.\n\nBackground\n----------\nIn late May [2016], the Idaho Department of Fish and Game collected dead ground squirrels from several areas in Ada County and submitted them to public health laboratories for testing. The laboratory found the plague bacterium. Ground squirrel populations with plague can experience high mortality, sometimes evidenced by large numbers of carcasses. At this time, plague has been detected in ground squirrels -- not tree squirrels. Subsequently, a cat in neighboring Elmore County died of plague.\n\nPlague activity can increase in the spring and summer months when rodents are more active. However, wildlife experts say ground squirrels begin hibernating in late June/early July, at which time the threat of plague will decrease.\n\nArea of impact where plague has been identified in ground squirrels to date. Please note that rodents outside of this area may carry plague and prevention efforts should be heeded.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal.

This is the 2nd cat death within the last week thought to be connected to the bacterial infection, though the cats were owned by separate families. The most recent cat lived both indoors and outdoors, and had contact with ground squirrels before becoming ill. Family members and other household pets are being monitored to ensure the cat did not spread the infection. Final lab results will be available next week.\n\nThe cat lived approximately 2 miles [3.2 km] from Mountain Home in an area not previously identified with confirmed plague. \"We want to emphasize that plague is likely present at some level in ground squirrel populations throughout the sagebrush habitat in southern Idaho. With the known confirmed cases in these areas we want to people to be aware and be able to take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their pets from plague,\" said State Wildlife Veterinarian Dr Mark Drew.\n\nPlague is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas and can cause serious illness to people and pets if not treated quickly. It also can be transmitted to people by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, rabbits and pets. Common rodents that can become infected include ground squirrels, rats, voles, and mice. Tree squirrels in Idaho are not known to carry plague.\n\nPublic health officials urge everyone to take proper precautions to protect themselves and their pets against plague regardless of where they live in proximity to the latest area of impact. To prevent plague in humans:\n- see your doctor immediately about any unexplained illness with a severe fever if you have been in the affected area;\n- avoid picking up or touching dead animals; wear gloves if you must handle dead animals;\n- do not let pets sleep in bed with you. This has been shown to increase your risk of getting plague;\n- clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles;\n- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;\n- wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants;\n- use DEET on clothing in accordance with label instructions or wear clothing pre-treated with permethrin;\n- use DEET on exposed skin, in accordance with label instructions.\n\nPlague prevention in pets:\n- do not let your pets hunt or roam in the affected area;\n- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets;\n- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian;\n- don't leave your pet's food and water where rodents can get to it.\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans\n----------------------------\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report it to their local public health district.\n\nSigns of plague in animals\n--------------------------\nPlague signs in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced.\n\nAmong pets, cats are highly susceptible to plague and may be an indicator that plague is in the area. If plague is suspected, any type of animal or human should be treated by a health professional immediately.\n\nBackground\n----------\nIn late May [2016], the Idaho Department of Fish and Game collected dead ground squirrels from several areas in Ada County and submitted them to public health laboratories for testing. The laboratory found the plague bacterium. Ground squirrel populations with plague can experience high mortality, sometimes evidenced by large numbers of carcasses. At this time, plague has been detected in ground squirrels -- not tree squirrels. Subsequently, a cat in neighboring Elmore County died of plague.\n\nPlague activity can increase in the spring and summer months when rodents are more active. However, wildlife experts say ground squirrels begin hibernating in late June/early July, at which time the threat of plague will decrease.\n\nArea of impact where plague has been identified in ground squirrels to date. Please note that rodents outside of this area may carry plague and prevention efforts should be heeded.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from: CDC. Notes from the field: 2 cases of human plague -- Oregon, 2010.

This is the 2nd cat death within the last week thought to be connected to the bacterial infection, though the cats were owned by separate families. The most recent cat lived both indoors and outdoors, and had contact with ground squirrels before becoming ill. Family members and other household pets are being monitored to ensure the cat did not spread the infection. Final lab results will be available next week.\n\nThe cat lived approximately 2 miles [3.2 km] from Mountain Home in an area not previously identified with confirmed plague. \"We want to emphasize that plague is likely present at some level in ground squirrel populations throughout the sagebrush habitat in southern Idaho. With the known confirmed cases in these areas we want to people to be aware and be able to take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their pets from plague,\" said State Wildlife Veterinarian Dr Mark Drew.\n\nPlague is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas and can cause serious illness to people and pets if not treated quickly. It also can be transmitted to people by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, rabbits and pets. Common rodents that can become infected include ground squirrels, rats, voles, and mice. Tree squirrels in Idaho are not known to carry plague.\n\nPublic health officials urge everyone to take proper precautions to protect themselves and their pets against plague regardless of where they live in proximity to the latest area of impact. To prevent plague in humans:\n- see your doctor immediately about any unexplained illness with a severe fever if you have been in the affected area;\n- avoid picking up or touching dead animals; wear gloves if you must handle dead animals;\n- do not let pets sleep in bed with you. This has been shown to increase your risk of getting plague;\n- clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles;\n- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;\n- wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants;\n- use DEET on clothing in accordance with label instructions or wear clothing pre-treated with permethrin;\n- use DEET on exposed skin, in accordance with label instructions.\n\nPlague prevention in pets:\n- do not let your pets hunt or roam in the affected area;\n- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets;\n- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian;\n- don't leave your pet's food and water where rodents can get to it.\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans\n----------------------------\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report it to their local public health district.\n\nSigns of plague in animals\n--------------------------\nPlague signs in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced.\n\nAmong pets, cats are highly susceptible to plague and may be an indicator that plague is in the area. If plague is suspected, any type of animal or human should be treated by a health professional immediately.\n\nBackground\n----------\nIn late May [2016], the Idaho Department of Fish and Game collected dead ground squirrels from several areas in Ada County and submitted them to public health laboratories for testing. The laboratory found the plague bacterium. Ground squirrel populations with plague can experience high mortality, sometimes evidenced by large numbers of carcasses. At this time, plague has been detected in ground squirrels -- not tree squirrels. Subsequently, a cat in neighboring Elmore County died of plague.\n\nPlague activity can increase in the spring and summer months when rodents are more active. However, wildlife experts say ground squirrels begin hibernating in late June/early July, at which time the threat of plague will decrease.\n\nArea of impact where plague has been identified in ground squirrels to date. Please note that rodents outside of this area may carry plague and prevention efforts should be heeded.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from: CDC. Notes from the field: 2 cases of human plague -- Oregon, 2010.

At least 174 cases of the disease have been detected, Maherisoa Ratsitorahina, head of disease surveillance at the ministry, said in a statement Thursday [7 Jan 2016] in the capital, Antananarivo. Madagascar notified the WHO of the current outbreak in September 2015.\n\nAt least 79 people died after an outbreak in 2014 that continued into early 2015, when at least 335 cases were reported, according to the WHO. The bacterial disease is spread to people who have been bitten by infected rodent fleas, the WHO says.\n\nEfforts to curb the spread of the disease are being impeded by a build-up of garbage in Antananarivo amid a dispute between the municipality and the national government over who is responsible for waste management in the city.\n\n[Byline: Fanja Razafimahatratra]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.\n\nThe following paragraph is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm).\n\n\"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.\"\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the \"black plague\" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997; 337(10): 677-81; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004).

At least 174 cases of the disease have been detected, Maherisoa Ratsitorahina, head of disease surveillance at the ministry, said in a statement Thursday [7 Jan 2016] in the capital, Antananarivo. Madagascar notified the WHO of the current outbreak in September 2015.\n\nAt least 79 people died after an outbreak in 2014 that continued into early 2015, when at least 335 cases were reported, according to the WHO. The bacterial disease is spread to people who have been bitten by infected rodent fleas, the WHO says.\n\nEfforts to curb the spread of the disease are being impeded by a build-up of garbage in Antananarivo amid a dispute between the municipality and the national government over who is responsible for waste management in the city.\n\n[Byline: Fanja Razafimahatratra]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.\n\nThe following paragraph is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm).\n\n\"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.\"\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the \"black plague\" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997; 337(10): 677-81; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (05): (IT) fatal 20151118.3801914\nPlague - Madagascar (04): (AO) pneumonic, fatal, WHO 20150908.3631683\nPlague - Madagascar (03): (AO) pneumonic, fatal 20150827.3603984\nPlague - Madagascar (02) 20150212.3162376\nPlague - Madagascar 20150108.3076901\n2014\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (04) 20141212.3027826\nPlague - Madagascar (03) 20141125.2988538\nPlague - Madagascar (02) 20141122.2981993\nPlague - Madagascar 20140222.2290976\n2013\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (04) 20131223.2130918\nPlague - Madagascar (03): pneumonic, more cases and fatalities 20131213.2114475\nPlague - Madagascar (02): (SF) fatalities 20131210.2104065\nPlague - Madagascar: prison, urban risk, alert 20131019.2009541\n2012\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (02): fatalities 20121224.1467364\nPlague - Madagascar: fatalities 20121119.1415379\n2011\n----\nPlague, pneumonic - Madagascar (05): (AV) 20111014.3088\nPlague, pneumonic - Madagascar (04) 20110401.1006\nPlague, pneumonic - Madagascar (03) 20110318.0858\nPlague, pneumonic - Madagascar (02): (AS) Institut Pasteur report 20110221.0563\nPlague, pneumonic - Madagascar: (Antsiranana) RFI 20110220.0555\n.................................................sb/ll/je/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-01-07 00:00:00", "2015-08-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2016-01-07 00:00:00", "2015-09-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "1998-03-16 00:00:00", "1998-03-16 00:00:00", "1990-03-16 00:00:00", "1990-03-16 00:00:00", "1995-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Rasoamanana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mahajanga", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SF", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Madagascar", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3801914", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague - Madagascar (05): (IT) fatal", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3801914", "date": "2015-09-07 19:00:04", "main_text": "PLAGUE, ANIMAL - USA (14): (CALIFORNIA), SQUIRREL\n*************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 5 Sep 2015\nSource: Kolo TV [edited]\nhttp://www.kolotv.com/news/headlines/Plague-Found-in-South-Lake-Tahoe-Picnic-Area-324558161.html\n\n\nEl Dorado County, California health officials announced Friday [4 Sep 2015] that a ground squirrel in South Lake Tahoe has tested positive for plague.

They were tested by the University of South Dakota and results recently came back positive for the bacterium that causes plague.\n\nThe same bacterium that causes bubonic and pneumonic plague in humans causes sylvatic plague in wildlife. Only about 10 to 20 human cases of plague are reported in the United States each year, generally contracted in prairie settings.\n\nMason says it was 1st detected in the Nebraska National Forests and Grasslands in 2004 on both the Buffalo Gap and Fort Pierre National Grasslands in South Dakota, and has since spread to the adjacent Badlands National Park and to the Lower Brule Indian Reservation. The initial outbreak posed a serious threat to the black-footed ferret, which was successfully reintroduced over 20 years ago in the Conata Basin area of the Buffalo Gap NG and has since been introduced in other locations around the region.\n\nThe Forest Service and other agencies began an aggressive campaign of dusting the entrances of prairie dog colonies with a contact insecticide to kill fleas and keep the plague from spreading, but Mason says there are no plans at this time to extend that into the Oglala NG. As for the threat of plague spreading to humans, Mason says prevention is the best remedy. She says to avoid any contact with wild rodents such as prairie dogs, dead or alive, that may have infected fleas, never feed wildlife.

They were tested by the University of South Dakota and results recently came back positive for the bacterium that causes plague.\n\nThe same bacterium that causes bubonic and pneumonic plague in humans causes sylvatic plague in wildlife. Only about 10 to 20 human cases of plague are reported in the United States each year, generally contracted in prairie settings.\n\nMason says it was 1st detected in the Nebraska National Forests and Grasslands in 2004 on both the Buffalo Gap and Fort Pierre National Grasslands in South Dakota, and has since spread to the adjacent Badlands National Park and to the Lower Brule Indian Reservation. The initial outbreak posed a serious threat to the black-footed ferret, which was successfully reintroduced over 20 years ago in the Conata Basin area of the Buffalo Gap NG and has since been introduced in other locations around the region.\n\nThe Forest Service and other agencies began an aggressive campaign of dusting the entrances of prairie dog colonies with a contact insecticide to kill fleas and keep the plague from spreading, but Mason says there are no plans at this time to extend that into the Oglala NG. As for the threat of plague spreading to humans, Mason says prevention is the best remedy. She says to avoid any contact with wild rodents such as prairie dogs, dead or alive, that may have infected fleas, never feed wildlife. She also recommends keeping pets away from prairie dog colonies or dead rodents and to be sure outdoor pets are wearing flea collars to prevent them from bringing in infected fleas.\n\nMore information about the plague can be found at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website at http://www.cdc.gov.\n\n[byline: Chris Fankhauser]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague was not previously documented in Nebraska, although it was nearby in Wyoming.\n\nPlague is primarily a disease of wild rodents.

The districts around the capital do not seem to be the only ones infected. According to information gathered from the Ministry of Health yesterday [6 Jan 2015], 13 suspected cases were registered in the urban commune of Antananarivo, from 4 Aug 2014 to 29 Dec 2014. The disease has infected several neighborhoods, including Anosibe, Anosimahavelona, Anosizato, Manjakaray, Antanimora and Ankasina.\n\nFaced with this situation, a source from the Public Health Service District reacted, stating that: \"The situation is now under control; all these people were registered as suspects, as they presented the symptoms of this disease, namely high fever and buboes. Only 3 cases have been confirmed after laboratory analysis,\" the source said.\n\nNdranto Rakotonanahary, director of population and health at the town hall of Antananarivo, has not confirmed these 13 suspected cases. \"There is only one case, in the district of Ankasina, which was treated by the municipal health service. We are not aware of other cases,\" he said.\n\nSince the \"beginning\" of the plague season, between 4 Aug 2014 and 29 Dec 2014, 224 cases of plague were reported in the Big Island. 58 of the cases have died. The meeting between the WHO and the Ministry of Public Health, on 10 Dec 2014 in Anosy, reported 47 deaths. The number of people identified as infected with the disease was 189 at that time.\n\n[Byline: Vonjy Radasimalala and Michella Raharisoa]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.\n\nThe following paragraph is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm).\n\n\"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.\"\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the \"Black Plague\" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997; 337(10): 677-81; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]\nSee Also\n2014\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (04) 20141212.3027826\nPlague - Madagascar (03) 20141125.2988538\nPlague - Madagascar (02) 20141122.2981993\nPlague - Madagascar 20140222.2290976\n2013\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (04) 20131223.2130918\nPlague - Madagascar (03): pneumonic, more cases and fatalities 20131213.2114475\nPlague - Madagascar (02): (SF) fatalities 20131210.2104065\nPlague - Madagascar: prison, urban risk, alert 20131019.2009541\n2012\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (02): fatalities 20121224.1467364\nPlague - Madagascar: fatalities 20121119.1415379\n2011\n----\nPlague, pneumonic - Madagascar (05): (AV) 20111014.3088\nPlague, pneumonic - Madagascar (04) 20110401.1006\nPlague, pneumonic - Madagascar (03) 20110318.0858\nPlague, pneumonic - Madagascar (02): (AS) Institut Pasteur report 20110221.0563\nPlague, pneumonic - Madagascar: (Antsiranana) RFI 20110220.0555\n.................................................sb/ll/msp/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2015-01-07 00:00:00", "2015-01-06 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-12-16 00:00:00", "2014-12-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "1998-03-16 00:00:00", "1998-03-16 00:00:00", "1990-03-16 00:00:00", "1990-03-16 00:00:00", "1995-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Rasoamanana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Manjakaray", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ankasina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Anosizato", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mahajanga", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Anosimahavelona", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SF", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Madagascar", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3368466", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague, animal - USA (04): (NM) feline, canine", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3368466", "date": "2015-01-08 10:39:14", "main_text": "PLAGUE - MADAGASCAR\n*******************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 7 Jan 2015\nSource: L'Express Madagascar [edited]\nhttp://www.lexpressmada.com/blog/actualites/sante-treize-cas-suspects-de-peste-dans-la-capitale-24794\n\n\nThe capital, Antananarivo, is no longer immune to the epidemic of the plague; 10 suspected cases were identified according to arrivals information at Compte-Gouttes.\n\nThe progress of the plague epidemic becomes increasingly worrying.

One man from Adams County [Colorado] is in the hospital recovering from a form of plague. The disease is part of the fabric of nature in Colorado now, found in rodents -- mainly prairie dogs. It's transmitted through the fleas they carry.\n\n\"When the prairie dogs actually die, the fleas need somewhere to go. So once there is a prairie dog die-off, the fleas are out looking for somewhere to get a meal from,\" said Jennifer House of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\n\nIn the latest case, doctors discovered the owner of a dog contracted plague. Tests later showed the dog, which had died unexpectedly, also had the disease.\n\nThere are 3 types of plague; all can be potentially deadly, if not treated. The 1st is bubonic, which causes lymph nodes to swell. There is also septicemic, which comes about when the plague gets into the bloodstream. Finally, there is pneumonic, which is the kind the patient in Colorado has. Doctors said it can be especially worrisome. \"It's a type of pneumonia,\" Dr. John said. \"It can be spread from person to person, and that's what makes it kind of scary and kind of dangerous.\"\n\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said there have been 12 cases of plague in Colorado in the past decade [2004-2014]. The last case of pneumonic plague was in 2004. \"In humans, it's actually become fairly rare,\" House said. \"We don't see a lot of cases.\"\n\nStill, experts said to protect yourself, insect repellent with DEET helps.

Investigation revealed the family dog had recently died unexpectedly. The carcass was recovered and tested at the Colorado State University Veterinarian Diagnostic Laboratory, where tests were positive for plague.\n\nTri-County Health Department officials and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment are working together to investigate the source of exposure and to identify those who may have been exposed through close contact with the individual. Any individuals exposed will be recommended for antibiotic treatment.\n\nThe patient and the dog may have been exposed in eastern Adams County. Plague is spread from fleas on rodents, most commonly prairie dogs. People walking in open spaces and trails should avoid contact with rodents.\n\nDr. Jennifer House, public health veterinarian at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, encourages people take the following precautions to prevent plague exposure:\n\n- Do not directly handle any dead rodents.\n- Keep pets away from wildlife, especially dead rodents.\n- Don't let dogs or cats hunt prairie dogs or other rodents.\n- Don't allow pets to roam freely.\n- Treat all pets for fleas according to a veterinarian's advice.\n- Do not feed prairie dogs or other rodents - this attracts them to your property, brings them in close contact with other rodents and increases the risk of disease transmission.\n- Be aware of rodent populations in your area and report sudden die-offs or multiple dead animals to your local health department.\n\nContact your physician if you develop a high fever and other plague symptoms following a fleabite or direct contact with dead rodents. Symptoms of plague include a sudden onset of high fever, muscle pain, malaise, nausea and vomiting, or a general feeling of being ill. Individuals with bubonic plague will develop a large, swollen, painful lymph node in the area of a flea bite, usually in the groin or armpit. If untreated, the disease can enter the bloodstream or lungs, which are severe, life-threatening complications. Individuals with pneumonic plagues (the lung form) develop fever, headache, weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough which can lead to respiratory failure. Pneumonic plague is the most serious form of the disease and is the only form of plague that can be spread from person to person (by infectious droplets from coughing). Although human cases occur infrequently, plague is severe and potentially life-threatening if not detected and quickly treated with common antibiotics.\n\nPlague often is identified when there is an unusual die-off of prairie dogs in an area. When an infected animal dies, the fleas leave the carcass to find another host, thus spreading the disease. Most human plague cases occur when humans are bitten by infected fleas. Less commonly, people are infected by direct contact with blood or tissues from an infected animal or from pets that become infected and transmit the disease. Since 1957, Colorado has identified 60 cases of human plague, 9 (15 percent) of which were fatal.\n\nAdditional information on plague can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/plague\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA are reported from the 4 Corners area of the USA where the states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico come together.\n\nAs outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: \"Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague), causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate, and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\n\"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.\n\n\"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal.\"\n\nAdams County is the 5th most populous of the 64 counties of the US state of Colorado.

Although human cases occur infrequently, plague is severe and potentially life-threatening if not detected and quickly treated with common antibiotics.\n\nPlague often is identified when there is an unusual die-off of prairie dogs in an area. When an infected animal dies, the fleas leave the carcass to find another host, thus spreading the disease. Most human plague cases occur when humans are bitten by infected fleas. Less commonly, people are infected by direct contact with blood or tissues from an infected animal or from pets that become infected and transmit the disease. Since 1957, Colorado has identified 60 cases of human plague, 9 (15 percent) of which were fatal.\n\nAdditional information on plague can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/plague\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA are reported from the 4 Corners area of the USA where the states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico come together.\n\nAs outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: \"Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague), causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome.

The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate, and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\n\"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain.

Investigation revealed the family dog had recently died unexpectedly. The carcass was recovered and tested at the Colorado State University Veterinarian Diagnostic Laboratory, where tests were positive for plague.\n\nTri-County Health Department officials and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment are working together to investigate the source of exposure and to identify those who may have been exposed through close contact with the individual.

Plague is spread from fleas on rodents, most commonly prairie dogs. People walking in open spaces and trails should avoid contact with rodents.\n\nDr. Jennifer House, public health veterinarian at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, encourages people take the following precautions to prevent plague exposure:\n\n- Do not directly handle any dead rodents.\n- Keep pets away from wildlife, especially dead rodents.\n- Don't let dogs or cats hunt prairie dogs or other rodents.\n- Don't allow pets to roam freely.\n- Treat all pets for fleas according to a veterinarian's advice.\n- Do not feed prairie dogs or other rodents - this attracts them to your property, brings them in close contact with other rodents and increases the risk of disease transmission.\n- Be aware of rodent populations in your area and report sudden die-offs or multiple dead animals to your local health department.\n\nContact your physician if you develop a high fever and other plague symptoms following a fleabite or direct contact with dead rodents. Symptoms of plague include a sudden onset of high fever, muscle pain, malaise, nausea and vomiting, or a general feeling of being ill. Individuals with bubonic plague will develop a large, swollen, painful lymph node in the area of a flea bite, usually in the groin or armpit.

Investigation revealed the family dog had recently died unexpectedly. The carcass was recovered and tested at the Colorado State University Veterinarian Diagnostic Laboratory, where tests were positive for plague.\n\nTri-County Health Department officials and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment are working together to investigate the source of exposure and to identify those who may have been exposed through close contact with the individual. Any individuals exposed will be recommended for antibiotic treatment.\n\nThe patient and the dog may have been exposed in eastern Adams County. Plague is spread from fleas on rodents, most commonly prairie dogs. People walking in open spaces and trails should avoid contact with rodents.\n\nDr. Jennifer House, public health veterinarian at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, encourages people take the following precautions to prevent plague exposure:\n\n- Do not directly handle any dead rodents.\n- Keep pets away from wildlife, especially dead rodents.\n- Don't let dogs or cats hunt prairie dogs or other rodents.\n- Don't allow pets to roam freely.\n- Treat all pets for fleas according to a veterinarian's advice.\n- Do not feed prairie dogs or other rodents - this attracts them to your property, brings them in close contact with other rodents and increases the risk of disease transmission.\n- Be aware of rodent populations in your area and report sudden die-offs or multiple dead animals to your local health department.\n\nContact your physician if you develop a high fever and other plague symptoms following a fleabite or direct contact with dead rodents. Symptoms of plague include a sudden onset of high fever, muscle pain, malaise, nausea and vomiting, or a general feeling of being ill. Individuals with bubonic plague will develop a large, swollen, painful lymph node in the area of a flea bite, usually in the groin or armpit. If untreated, the disease can enter the bloodstream or lungs, which are severe, life-threatening complications. Individuals with pneumonic plagues (the lung form) develop fever, headache, weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough which can lead to respiratory failure. Pneumonic plague is the most serious form of the disease and is the only form of plague that can be spread from person to person (by infectious droplets from coughing). Although human cases occur infrequently, plague is severe and potentially life-threatening if not detected and quickly treated with common antibiotics.\n\nPlague often is identified when there is an unusual die-off of prairie dogs in an area. When an infected animal dies, the fleas leave the carcass to find another host, thus spreading the disease. Most human plague cases occur when humans are bitten by infected fleas. Less commonly, people are infected by direct contact with blood or tissues from an infected animal or from pets that become infected and transmit the disease. Since 1957, Colorado has identified 60 cases of human plague, 9 (15 percent) of which were fatal.\n\nAdditional information on plague can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/plague\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA are reported from the 4 Corners area of the USA where the states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico come together.\n\nAs outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: \"Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague), causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate, and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\n\"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.\n\n\"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream.

One man from Adams County [Colorado] is in the hospital recovering from a form of plague. The disease is part of the fabric of nature in Colorado now, found in rodents -- mainly prairie dogs. It's transmitted through the fleas they carry.\n\n\"When the prairie dogs actually die, the fleas need somewhere to go. So once there is a prairie dog die-off, the fleas are out looking for somewhere to get a meal from,\" said Jennifer House of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\n\nIn the latest case, doctors discovered the owner of a dog contracted plague. Tests later showed the dog, which had died unexpectedly, also had the disease.\n\nThere are 3 types of plague; all can be potentially deadly, if not treated. The 1st is bubonic, which causes lymph nodes to swell. There is also septicemic, which comes about when the plague gets into the bloodstream. Finally, there is pneumonic, which is the kind the patient in Colorado has. Doctors said it can be especially worrisome. \"It's a type of pneumonia,\" Dr. John said. \"It can be spread from person to person, and that's what makes it kind of scary and kind of dangerous.\"\n\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said there have been 12 cases of plague in Colorado in the past decade [2004-2014]. The last case of pneumonic plague was in 2004. \"In humans, it's actually become fairly rare,\" House said. \"We don't see a lot of cases.\"\n\nStill, experts said to protect yourself, insect repellent with DEET helps. They also recommend staying away from wildlife and making sure your pets do as well. The key is to make sure fleas that carry plague don't land on you.\n\nTo treat the plague, doctors give patients specific antimicrobial agents. As for how exactly the latest patient and the dog contracted the plague, the department of health said that was still under investigation.\n\n[Byline: Maya Rodriguez]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 9 Jul 2014\nSource: Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/news-release-pneumonic-plague-found-colorado-resident-and-pet-dog\n\n\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment laboratory yesterday [8 Jul 2014] identified pneumonic plague in a Colorado resident. Investigation revealed the family dog had recently died unexpectedly. The carcass was recovered and tested at the Colorado State University Veterinarian Diagnostic Laboratory, where tests were positive for plague.\n\nTri-County Health Department officials and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment are working together to investigate the source of exposure and to identify those who may have been exposed through close contact with the individual. Any individuals exposed will be recommended for antibiotic treatment.\n\nThe patient and the dog may have been exposed in eastern Adams County. Plague is spread from fleas on rodents, most commonly prairie dogs. People walking in open spaces and trails should avoid contact with rodents.\n\nDr. Jennifer House, public health veterinarian at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, encourages people take the following precautions to prevent plague exposure:\n\n- Do not directly handle any dead rodents.\n- Keep pets away from wildlife, especially dead rodents.\n- Don't let dogs or cats hunt prairie dogs or other rodents.\n- Don't allow pets to roam freely.\n- Treat all pets for fleas according to a veterinarian's advice.\n- Do not feed prairie dogs or other rodents - this attracts them to your property, brings them in close contact with other rodents and increases the risk of disease transmission.\n- Be aware of rodent populations in your area and report sudden die-offs or multiple dead animals to your local health department.\n\nContact your physician if you develop a high fever and other plague symptoms following a fleabite or direct contact with dead rodents. Symptoms of plague include a sudden onset of high fever, muscle pain, malaise, nausea and vomiting, or a general feeling of being ill. Individuals with bubonic plague will develop a large, swollen, painful lymph node in the area of a flea bite, usually in the groin or armpit. If untreated, the disease can enter the bloodstream or lungs, which are severe, life-threatening complications. Individuals with pneumonic plagues (the lung form) develop fever, headache, weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough which can lead to respiratory failure. Pneumonic plague is the most serious form of the disease and is the only form of plague that can be spread from person to person (by infectious droplets from coughing). Although human cases occur infrequently, plague is severe and potentially life-threatening if not detected and quickly treated with common antibiotics.\n\nPlague often is identified when there is an unusual die-off of prairie dogs in an area. When an infected animal dies, the fleas leave the carcass to find another host, thus spreading the disease. Most human plague cases occur when humans are bitten by infected fleas. Less commonly, people are infected by direct contact with blood or tissues from an infected animal or from pets that become infected and transmit the disease. Since 1957, Colorado has identified 60 cases of human plague, 9 (15 percent) of which were fatal.\n\nAdditional information on plague can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/plague\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA are reported from the 4 Corners area of the USA where the states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico come together.\n\nAs outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: \"Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague), causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate, and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\n\"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.\n\n\"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal.\"\n\nAdams County is the 5th most populous of the 64 counties of the US state of Colorado.

Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report to the New Mexico Department of Health.\n\nThe 1st 3 human plague cases in New Mexico in 2013 were in a 15-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl, both from Torrance County; and a 52-year-old man from Santa Fe County.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\n\"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a \"bubo.\" Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.\n\n\"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum.

As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal.\" - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/90Xf.]\nSee Also\nPlague - USA (03): (NM) bubonic 20130927.1972093\nPlague - USA (02): (NM) bubonic 20130910.1935879\nPlague - USA: (NM) 20130813.1878261\nPlague, animal - USA (04): (CA) squirrel 20130727.1848788\nPlague, animal - USA (03): (NM) canine, alert 20130627.1794260\nPlague, animal - USA (02): (CA) squirrel, alert 20130619.1781960\nPlague, animal - USA: (CA) squirrel, alert 20130518.1720992\n2012\n----\nPlague - USA (05): (OR), 2nd case 20120916.1296380\nPlague - USA (04): (CO) septicemic 20120828.1269118\nPlague - USA (03): (OR) septicemic, recovery 20120719.1206257\nPlague - USA (02): (OR), septicemic 20120612.1165863\nPlague - USA: (NM) 20120601.1153277\n2011\n----\nPlague - USA (05): (OR), septicemic 20110920.2855\nPlague, animal - USA (04): (NM) canine 20110701.1999\nPlague, animal - USA (03): (CO) 20110612.1792\nPlague, animal - USA (02): (OR) feline 20110610.1773\nPlague - USA (03): (NM) bubonic 20110530.1655\nPlague - USA (02): (NM) bubonic 20110510.1439\nPlague, animal - USA: (NM) canine, feline 20110421.1240\nPlague - USA: (OR), 2010, bubonic, CDC 20110224.0615\nPlague, fatal - USA: (IL), 2009, lab strain, CDC 20110224.061\nPlague - USA: (OR), 2010, bubonic, CDC 20110224.0615\nPlague, fatal - USA: (IL), 2009, lab strain, CDC 20110224.0614\n.................................................mpp/ll/je/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Utah", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Santa Fe County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bernalillo County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Arizona", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Torrance County", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2013248", "headline": "PRO/AH> Crayfish plague - Norway: (NT) OIE", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2013248", "date": "2013-08-13 12:05:13", "main_text": "PLAGUE - USA: (NEW MEXICO)\n**************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 12 Aug 2013\nFrom: Paul Ettestad <Paul.ettestad@state.nm.us> [edited]\n\n\nThe New Mexico Department of Health confirmed today, 12 Aug 2013, a case of plague in a 15 year old boy from Torrance County who is currently hospitalized in stable condition.

Mod.MPP, edited]\nhttp://www.lexpressmada.com/epidemie-madagascar/38515-six-personnes-succombent-de-la-peste.html\n\n\nThe arrival of the rain is not always good news, as rats [and their fleas], the plague vectors, take refuge in habitats, wreaking havoc.\n\nIt is the beginning of the plague season on the Big Island and it is time to start worrying. 6 patients have died of the disease in a month. The Bongolava region has paid the highest price. \"Of the 43 cases identified, 2 people died of bubonic plague on [2 Oct 2012], 2 others died on 5 Nov 2012, and another person died on 9 Nov 2012 person,\" the statistical management of health monitoring and epidemiological surveillance (DVSSE) within the Ministry of Public Health reported yesterday [14 Nov 2012].\n\nHowever, this epidemic does not affect this region alone. Another victim of the plague was also registered in the District of Mandoto in Vakinankaratra, on 9 Oct 2012. The same day, 3 other non-fatal cases were found in the district of Ambalavao in the Haute-Matsiatra region.\n\nThe cause of this deadly epidemic seems always the same. \"The plague victims sometimes live in remote areas and they self-medicate before going to a health center when the disease worsens. However, all health centers are equipped with rapid diagnostic test and medications to treat this disease immediately,\" said Alain Marcel Rahetilahy, head of epidemic and neglected diseases within the Ministry of Health. In contrast, the Regional Director of Public Health for Tsiroanomandidy refused to disclose the circumstances of this deadly epidemic in its domain, without the written permission of the Secretary General of the Ministry of Health.\n\nHowever, Alain Marcel Rahetilahy does not want to dramatize the situation. \"These cases have yet to be confirmed by the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar. And every year, only 30-40 percent of reported cases are confirmed, even if the initial result is positive by a rapid diagnosis test. So the situation is it not very disturbing,\" he reassured.\n\nYet other doctors remain cautious. \"The heat, the rain, and the bushfires that devastated several regions in recent months, forced the rats, propagation vectors of the plague, to flee to the villages. This is why people must remain vigilant,\" warned a doctor who does not wish to reveal his name. And according to the Secretary General of the Ministry of Health, Philemon Tafangy, the number of suspected cases of plague is between 300 and 500 annually.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. [The following paragraph of this posting is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4: \"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had \"virtually disappeared\" on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health-management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form especially in the port of Mahajanga each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.\"\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the \"Black Plague\" and also spread to the lung causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia.

Mod.MPP, edited]\nhttp://www.lexpressmada.com/epidemie-madagascar/38515-six-personnes-succombent-de-la-peste.html\n\n\nThe arrival of the rain is not always good news, as rats [and their fleas], the plague vectors, take refuge in habitats, wreaking havoc.\n\nIt is the beginning of the plague season on the Big Island and it is time to start worrying. 6 patients have died of the disease in a month. The Bongolava region has paid the highest price. \"Of the 43 cases identified, 2 people died of bubonic plague on [2 Oct 2012], 2 others died on 5 Nov 2012, and another person died on 9 Nov 2012 person,\" the statistical management of health monitoring and epidemiological surveillance (DVSSE) within the Ministry of Public Health reported yesterday [14 Nov 2012].\n\nHowever, this epidemic does not affect this region alone. Another victim of the plague was also registered in the District of Mandoto in Vakinankaratra, on 9 Oct 2012. The same day, 3 other non-fatal cases were found in the district of Ambalavao in the Haute-Matsiatra region.\n\nThe cause of this deadly epidemic seems always the same. \"The plague victims sometimes live in remote areas and they self-medicate before going to a health center when the disease worsens. However, all health centers are equipped with rapid diagnostic test and medications to treat this disease immediately,\" said Alain Marcel Rahetilahy, head of epidemic and neglected diseases within the Ministry of Health. In contrast, the Regional Director of Public Health for Tsiroanomandidy refused to disclose the circumstances of this deadly epidemic in its domain, without the written permission of the Secretary General of the Ministry of Health.\n\nHowever, Alain Marcel Rahetilahy does not want to dramatize the situation. \"These cases have yet to be confirmed by the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar. And every year, only 30-40 percent of reported cases are confirmed, even if the initial result is positive by a rapid diagnosis test. So the situation is it not very disturbing,\" he reassured.\n\nYet other doctors remain cautious. \"The heat, the rain, and the bushfires that devastated several regions in recent months, forced the rats, propagation vectors of the plague, to flee to the villages. This is why people must remain vigilant,\" warned a doctor who does not wish to reveal his name. And according to the Secretary General of the Ministry of Health, Philemon Tafangy, the number of suspected cases of plague is between 300 and 500 annually.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. [The following paragraph of this posting is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4: \"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had \"virtually disappeared\" on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health-management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form especially in the port of Mahajanga each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.\"\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the \"Black Plague\" and also spread to the lung causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid.

But\n2 confirmed cases of rabies in bats rolled in this week to take its\nplace.\n\nOn 3 Jun 2011, Boulder County Public Health (BCPH) announced that a\ndomestic cat and a dead squirrel tested positive for plague. The cat\nlived in the 2500 block of 6th Street, and the squirrel was found at\n8th Street and Maxwell Avenue. Health officials posted signs around\nthe neighborhood advising residents of the danger and listing\nprecautionary measures to take.\n\nJoe Malinowski, manager of the BCPH Environmental Health Division,\nsaid this week that a 2nd dead squirrel tested positive for plague,\nbut the cat was successfully treated for the disease. There have been\nno other confirmed cases, he said, adding that he knows of no humans\nwho have reported contracting symptoms of the plague, which include\nhigh fever, extreme fatigue and painful, swollen lymph nodes. His\noffice has, however, received a few calls from area residents\nreporting additional dead squirrels. But Malinowski said officials\nwon't test another squirrel unless 2 or more are found in the same\nlocation.\n\nThe same area got hit with a similar plague infestation in 2005, he\nsaid, but usually the disease targets prairie dogs, not squirrels.\nMalinowski added that the plague typically runs its course within a\nfew days. \"It goes through the population pretty quickly,\" he said.\nUsually, prairie dogs return to the empty burrows of a colony that has\nbeen wiped out, and the squirrel population on Mapleton Hill is\nexpected to bounce back as well, he explained.\n\nThis is the 1st confirmed case of plague identified this season\n[2011], but Malinowski said it is common to have outbreaks each year.\n\nResidents were advised to keep cats indoors, since they seem to be\nmore susceptible to plague than dogs.\n\nOfficials suggest protecting pets with flea powder and keeping them\non a leash and out of wild rodent habitats. People entering wild\nrodent habitats should wear insect repellent and tuck their pants into\nsocks to prevent flea bites. Long-handed shovels should be used to\nremove dead rodents, and they should be sealed in garbage bags and\nplaced in garbage cans. Asked what symptoms sick animals exhibit\noutwardly, Malinowski said plague is not like distemper, which can\nleave animals like raccoons acting lethargic and wobbly. \"Typically,\"\nhe said, \"the plague acts so quickly that death comes fast.\"\n\n[Byline: Jefferson Dodge]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[With the widespread hot weather we are getting through the western\nstates, we can confidently expect more of these peri-domestic plague\ncases. - Mod.MHJ]\nSee Also\nPlague, animal - USA (02): (OR) feline 20110610.1773\nPlague, animal - USA: (NM) canine, feline 20110421.1240\n2010\n----\nPlague - USA (02): (CA) rodent 20100819.2878\nPlague, feline - USA: (MT) 20100807.2693\nPlague - USA: (CA) ground squirrel 20100708.2275\nPlague, canine - USA: (NM) 20100418.1259\nPlague, cougar - USA (WY) 20100208.0429\n2009\n----\nPlague, feline - USA (CA) 20091205.4150\nPlague, tularemia, prairie dogs - USA (SD) 20090712.2494\nPlague, rabbit - USA (NM) 20090415.1435\n2008\n----\nPlague, human, prairie dogs - USA: (AZ) 20081012.3229\nPlague, wildlife - USA: (CO) rabbit 20080727.2289\nPlague, prairie dogs, ferrets - USA: (SD)(02) 20080722.2213\nPlague, prairie dog, ferrets - USA: (SD) 20080708.2082\nPlague, feline - USA (WY): mountain lion 20080522.1694\nPlague, prairie dogs - USA: (CO), susp., RFI 20080506.1552\nPlague, human, feline - USA (NM): early season cases 20080127.0340\n2007\n----\nPlague, prairie dogs - USA (SD) 20070927.3205\nPlague, feline - USA (NM) 20070914.3055\nPlague, wildlife - USA (AZ) 20070812.2625\nPlague, ground squirrels - USA (CA) 20070811.2613\nPlague, prairie dogs - USA (CO)(02) 20070729.2434\nPlague, prairie dogs - USA (CO) 20070725.2386\nPlague, squirrel - USA (CA) 20070720.2322\nPlague, feline - USA (CO) 20070527.1693\nPlague, squirrel, flea, cat - USA (CO,CA) 20070518.1577\nPlague, squirrels, rabbit - USA (CO) 20070505.1455\nPlague, squirrel - USA (CO)(02) 20070503.1444\nPlague, squirrel - USA (CO) 20070427.1381\n2006\n----\nPlague, cougar - USA (WY) 20061215.3523\nPlague, cats - USA (AZ) 20060630.1806\nPlague, animals - USA (Colorado) (02): prairie dogs 20060627.1785\nPlague, squirrel - USA (CA) 20060528.1499\n.................................................mhj/msp/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague", "rabies", "tularemia"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2011-06-03 00:00:00", "2005-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Mapleton Hill", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Boulder", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Boulder County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Boulder \n County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WY", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1153277", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague - USA: (NM)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1153277", "date": "2011-06-12 19:53:36", "main_text": "PLAGUE, ANIMAL - USA (03): (COLORADO)\n*************************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\nDate: 3 Jun 2011\nSource: Boulder County [edited]\nhttp://www.bouldercounty.org/apps/newsroom/templates/bc.aspx?articleid=2659&zoneid=1\n\n\nA domestic cat living in the 2500 block of Sixth Street has tested\npositive for plague.

But\n2 confirmed cases of rabies in bats rolled in this week to take its\nplace.\n\nOn 3 Jun 2011, Boulder County Public Health (BCPH) announced that a\ndomestic cat and a dead squirrel tested positive for plague.

There have been\nno other confirmed cases, he said, adding that he knows of no humans\nwho have reported contracting symptoms of the plague, which include\nhigh fever, extreme fatigue and painful, swollen lymph nodes. His\noffice has, however, received a few calls from area residents\nreporting additional dead squirrels.

But\n2 confirmed cases of rabies in bats rolled in this week to take its\nplace.\n\nOn 3 Jun 2011, Boulder County Public Health (BCPH) announced that a\ndomestic cat and a dead squirrel tested positive for plague. The cat\nlived in the 2500 block of 6th Street, and the squirrel was found at\n8th Street and Maxwell Avenue. Health officials posted signs around\nthe neighborhood advising residents of the danger and listing\nprecautionary measures to take.\n\nJoe Malinowski, manager of the BCPH Environmental Health Division,\nsaid this week that a 2nd dead squirrel tested positive for plague,\nbut the cat was successfully treated for the disease. There have been\nno other confirmed cases, he said, adding that he knows of no humans\nwho have reported contracting symptoms of the plague, which include\nhigh fever, extreme fatigue and painful, swollen lymph nodes. His\noffice has, however, received a few calls from area residents\nreporting additional dead squirrels. But Malinowski said officials\nwon't test another squirrel unless 2 or more are found in the same\nlocation.\n\nThe same area got hit with a similar plague infestation in 2005, he\nsaid, but usually the disease targets prairie dogs, not squirrels.\nMalinowski added that the plague typically runs its course within a\nfew days. \"It goes through the population pretty quickly,\" he said.\nUsually, prairie dogs return to the empty burrows of a colony that has\nbeen wiped out, and the squirrel population on Mapleton Hill is\nexpected to bounce back as well, he explained.\n\nThis is the 1st confirmed case of plague identified this season\n[2011], but Malinowski said it is common to have outbreaks each year.\n\nResidents were advised to keep cats indoors, since they seem to be\nmore susceptible to plague than dogs.\n\nOfficials suggest protecting pets with flea powder and keeping them\non a leash and out of wild rodent habitats. People entering wild\nrodent habitats should wear insect repellent and tuck their pants into\nsocks to prevent flea bites. Long-handed shovels should be used to\nremove dead rodents, and they should be sealed in garbage bags and\nplaced in garbage cans. Asked what symptoms sick animals exhibit\noutwardly, Malinowski said plague is not like distemper, which can\nleave animals like raccoons acting lethargic and wobbly. \"Typically,\"\nhe said, \"the plague acts so quickly that death comes fast.\"\n\n[Byline: Jefferson Dodge]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[With the widespread hot weather we are getting through the western\nstates, we can confidently expect more of these peri-domestic plague\ncases. - Mod.MHJ]\nSee Also\nPlague, animal - USA (02): (OR) feline 20110610.1773\nPlague, animal - USA: (NM) canine, feline 20110421.1240\n2010\n----\nPlague - USA (02): (CA) rodent 20100819.2878\nPlague, feline - USA: (MT) 20100807.2693\nPlague - USA: (CA) ground squirrel 20100708.2275\nPlague, canine - USA: (NM) 20100418.1259\nPlague, cougar - USA (WY) 20100208.0429\n2009\n----\nPlague, feline - USA (CA) 20091205.4150\nPlague, tularemia, prairie dogs - USA (SD) 20090712.2494\nPlague, rabbit - USA (NM) 20090415.1435\n2008\n----\nPlague, human, prairie dogs - USA: (AZ) 20081012.3229\nPlague, wildlife - USA: (CO) rabbit 20080727.2289\nPlague, prairie dogs, ferrets - USA: (SD)(02) 20080722.2213\nPlague, prairie dog, ferrets - USA: (SD) 20080708.2082\nPlague, feline - USA (WY): mountain lion 20080522.1694\nPlague, prairie dogs - USA: (CO), susp., RFI 20080506.1552\nPlague, human, feline - USA (NM): early season cases 20080127.0340\n2007\n----\nPlague, prairie dogs - USA (SD) 20070927.3205\nPlague, feline - USA (NM) 20070914.3055\nPlague, wildlife - USA (AZ) 20070812.2625\nPlague, ground squirrels - USA (CA) 20070811.2613\nPlague, prairie dogs - USA (CO)(02) 20070729.2434\nPlague, prairie dogs - USA (CO) 20070725.2386\nPlague, squirrel - USA (CA) 20070720.2322\nPlague, feline - USA (CO) 20070527.1693\nPlague, squirrel, flea, cat - USA (CO,CA) 20070518.1577\nPlague, squirrels, rabbit - USA (CO) 20070505.1455\nPlague, squirrel - USA (CO)(02) 20070503.1444\nPlague, squirrel - USA (CO) 20070427.1381\n2006\n----\nPlague, cougar - USA (WY) 20061215.3523\nPlague, cats - USA (AZ) 20060630.1806\nPlague, animals - USA (Colorado) (02): prairie dogs 20060627.1785\nPlague, squirrel - USA (CA) 20060528.1499\n.................................................mhj/msp/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague", "rabies", "tularemia"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2011-06-03 00:00:00", "2005-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Mapleton Hill", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Boulder", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Boulder County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Boulder \n County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WY", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "750921", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague, animal - USA (02): (OR) feline", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=750921", "date": "2011-02-24 20:00:04", "main_text": "PLAGUE - USA: (OREGON), 2010, BUBONIC, CDC\n*******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Thu 24 Feb 2011\nSource: Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report 2011;60:214 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6007a4.htm?s_cid=mm6007a4_e&source=govdelivery>\n\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the\nwestern USA. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected\nflea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals, 2) direct contact\nwith contaminated tissues, or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of\nrespiratory secretions from infected persons or animals. In September\n2010, the Oregon Health Authority reported the 1st 2 cases of human\nplague in Oregon since 1995 and the only 2 USA cases in 2010.\n\nBoth illnesses began on 21 Aug 2010. The patients, aged 17 and 42\nyears, lived in the same household and might have been exposed to\nplague by infected fleas from a dog; that dog was found to be\nseropositive for _Y. pestis_ by the passive\nhemagglutination-inhibition assay (dilution of 1:64). One patient\nacknowledged sleeping in the same bed with the dog during the 2 weeks\nbefore illness onset. Both patients had high fever and multiple\nbilateral inguinal buboes; one patient had hypotension, tachycardia,\nand acute renal failure and was hospitalized. A gram-negative rod with\nbipolar staining was isolated from a specimen of that patient's\nblood.\n\nFour different clinical laboratories attempted to identify the\nisolate. Three different commercial automated systems identified the\norganism as _Acinetobacter lwoffii_, _Pseudomonas luteola_, and\n_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_, respectively. However, 25 days after\nspecimen collection, the isolate was identified as _Y. pestis_ by\ndirect fluorescent antibody to F1 antigen, polymerase chain reaction,\nand bacteriophage lysis at the Spokane (Washington) Regional Health\nDistrict Laboratory, prompting notification of the Oregon Health\nAuthority. The 2nd patient was identified retrospectively on the basis\nof a single positive serology (passive hemagglutination-inhibition\n[dilution of 1:32]). Plague was not suspected initially. Both patients\nrecovered uneventfully after empiric therapy with doxycycline and\namoxicillin clavulanate potassium, respectively, although the latter\nis not considered effective in treating plague.\n\nAutomated bacterial identification systems can misidentify _Y.\npestis_ (1,2). Automated identification of _Yersinia_ spp. in blood\nshould prompt further clinical evaluation of the patient to determine\nwhether symptoms are compatible with plague. When plague is suspected,\ntreatment should be started immediately, and both the state public\nhealth laboratory and public health authorities should be notified\npromptly.\n\nPlague is a Category A potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections\nare rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate\ndepends on the clinical presentation (i.e., bubonic, septicemic, or\npneumonic) and timing of antibiotic therapy initiation; if untreated,\nthe case-fatality rate is over 50 percent for bubonic plague and\napproaches 100 percent for pneumonic plague (3). Rapid laboratory\nidentification can help guide therapy.\n\nSleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in\nenzootic areas (4). Plague patients with no history of exposure to\nrodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected\nrodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea\ncontrol to dog and cat owners.\n\nReferences\n--------\n1.

Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected\nflea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals, 2) direct contact\nwith contaminated tissues, or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of\nrespiratory secretions from infected persons or animals. In September\n2010, the Oregon Health Authority reported the 1st 2 cases of human\nplague in Oregon since 1995 and the only 2 USA cases in 2010.\n\nBoth illnesses began on 21 Aug 2010. The patients, aged 17 and 42\nyears, lived in the same household and might have been exposed to\nplague by infected fleas from a dog; that dog was found to be\nseropositive for _Y. pestis_ by the passive\nhemagglutination-inhibition assay (dilution of 1:64). One patient\nacknowledged sleeping in the same bed with the dog during the 2 weeks\nbefore illness onset. Both patients had high fever and multiple\nbilateral inguinal buboes; one patient had hypotension, tachycardia,\nand acute renal failure and was hospitalized. A gram-negative rod with\nbipolar staining was isolated from a specimen of that patient's\nblood.\n\nFour different clinical laboratories attempted to identify the\nisolate. Three different commercial automated systems identified the\norganism as _Acinetobacter lwoffii_, _Pseudomonas luteola_, and\n_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_, respectively. However, 25 days after\nspecimen collection, the isolate was identified as _Y. pestis_ by\ndirect fluorescent antibody to F1 antigen, polymerase chain reaction,\nand bacteriophage lysis at the Spokane (Washington) Regional Health\nDistrict Laboratory, prompting notification of the Oregon Health\nAuthority. The 2nd patient was identified retrospectively on the basis\nof a single positive serology (passive hemagglutination-inhibition\n[dilution of 1:32]). Plague was not suspected initially. Both patients\nrecovered uneventfully after empiric therapy with doxycycline and\namoxicillin clavulanate potassium, respectively, although the latter\nis not considered effective in treating plague.\n\nAutomated bacterial identification systems can misidentify _Y.\npestis_ (1,2). Automated identification of _Yersinia_ spp. in blood\nshould prompt further clinical evaluation of the patient to determine\nwhether symptoms are compatible with plague. When plague is suspected,\ntreatment should be started immediately, and both the state public\nhealth laboratory and public health authorities should be notified\npromptly.\n\nPlague is a Category A potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections\nare rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate\ndepends on the clinical presentation (i.e., bubonic, septicemic, or\npneumonic) and timing of antibiotic therapy initiation; if untreated,\nthe case-fatality rate is over 50 percent for bubonic plague and\napproaches 100 percent for pneumonic plague (3). Rapid laboratory\nidentification can help guide therapy.\n\nSleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in\nenzootic areas (4). Plague patients with no history of exposure to\nrodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected\nrodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea\ncontrol to dog and cat owners.\n\nReferences\n--------\n1.

Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected\nflea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals, 2) direct contact\nwith contaminated tissues, or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of\nrespiratory secretions from infected persons or animals. In September\n2010, the Oregon Health Authority reported the 1st 2 cases of human\nplague in Oregon since 1995 and the only 2 USA cases in 2010.\n\nBoth illnesses began on 21 Aug 2010. The patients, aged 17 and 42\nyears, lived in the same household and might have been exposed to\nplague by infected fleas from a dog; that dog was found to be\nseropositive for _Y. pestis_ by the passive\nhemagglutination-inhibition assay (dilution of 1:64). One patient\nacknowledged sleeping in the same bed with the dog during the 2 weeks\nbefore illness onset. Both patients had high fever and multiple\nbilateral inguinal buboes; one patient had hypotension, tachycardia,\nand acute renal failure and was hospitalized. A gram-negative rod with\nbipolar staining was isolated from a specimen of that patient's\nblood.\n\nFour different clinical laboratories attempted to identify the\nisolate. Three different commercial automated systems identified the\norganism as _Acinetobacter lwoffii_, _Pseudomonas luteola_, and\n_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_, respectively. However, 25 days after\nspecimen collection, the isolate was identified as _Y. pestis_ by\ndirect fluorescent antibody to F1 antigen, polymerase chain reaction,\nand bacteriophage lysis at the Spokane (Washington) Regional Health\nDistrict Laboratory, prompting notification of the Oregon Health\nAuthority.

Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected\nflea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals, 2) direct contact\nwith contaminated tissues, or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of\nrespiratory secretions from infected persons or animals. In September\n2010, the Oregon Health Authority reported the 1st 2 cases of human\nplague in Oregon since 1995 and the only 2 USA cases in 2010.\n\nBoth illnesses began on 21 Aug 2010. The patients, aged 17 and 42\nyears, lived in the same household and might have been exposed to\nplague by infected fleas from a dog; that dog was found to be\nseropositive for _Y. pestis_ by the passive\nhemagglutination-inhibition assay (dilution of 1:64). One patient\nacknowledged sleeping in the same bed with the dog during the 2 weeks\nbefore illness onset. Both patients had high fever and multiple\nbilateral inguinal buboes; one patient had hypotension, tachycardia,\nand acute renal failure and was hospitalized. A gram-negative rod with\nbipolar staining was isolated from a specimen of that patient's\nblood.\n\nFour different clinical laboratories attempted to identify the\nisolate. Three different commercial automated systems identified the\norganism as _Acinetobacter lwoffii_, _Pseudomonas luteola_, and\n_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_, respectively. However, 25 days after\nspecimen collection, the isolate was identified as _Y. pestis_ by\ndirect fluorescent antibody to F1 antigen, polymerase chain reaction,\nand bacteriophage lysis at the Spokane (Washington) Regional Health\nDistrict Laboratory, prompting notification of the Oregon Health\nAuthority. The 2nd patient was identified retrospectively on the basis\nof a single positive serology (passive hemagglutination-inhibition\n[dilution of 1:32]). Plague was not suspected initially. Both patients\nrecovered uneventfully after empiric therapy with doxycycline and\namoxicillin clavulanate potassium, respectively, although the latter\nis not considered effective in treating plague.\n\nAutomated bacterial identification systems can misidentify _Y.\npestis_ (1,2). Automated identification of _Yersinia_ spp. in blood\nshould prompt further clinical evaluation of the patient to determine\nwhether symptoms are compatible with plague. When plague is suspected,\ntreatment should be started immediately, and both the state public\nhealth laboratory and public health authorities should be notified\npromptly.\n\nPlague is a Category A potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections\nare rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate\ndepends on the clinical presentation (i.e., bubonic, septicemic, or\npneumonic) and timing of antibiotic therapy initiation; if untreated,\nthe case-fatality rate is over 50 percent for bubonic plague and\napproaches 100 percent for pneumonic plague (3). Rapid laboratory\nidentification can help guide therapy.\n\nSleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in\nenzootic areas (4). Plague patients with no history of exposure to\nrodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected\nrodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea\ncontrol to dog and cat owners.\n\nReferences\n--------\n1.

This is\npredominantly due to the crayfish plague, a fungus-like disease which is\nharmless to people and most animals but lethal to white-clawed crayfish.\nThe crayfish plague is spread by the invasive American signal crayfish, a\nnon-native species which is taking over UK waterways and wiping out our\nsmaller native species.\n\nThe South West Crayfish Project is currently running the largest strategic\ntranslocation in the UK to date, re-homing at-risk populations of\nwhite-clawed crayfish to new safe sites.

Experts warn\nthe species could become extinct from the UK within the next 30 years; it\nis currently a protected species.\n\nToday, white-clawed crayfish have been upgraded from \"vulnerable\" to\n\"endangered\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)\nRed List of Threatened Species, following a Sampled Red List Index (SRLI)\nassessment by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). The ranking gives an\nindication of how likely a species is to become extinct.\n\nEve Leegwater, technical biodiversity officer at the Environment Agency,\nsaid: \"It is important to base conservation efforts on scientific research,\nand the IUCN Red List has become an increasingly important tool to guide\ngovernment and scientific institutes towards the conservation and\nlegislation of species and habitats at risk of extinction.\" She added: \"The\nchange in status of white-clawed crayfish will help stress the need for\nconservation strategies to be implemented to aid this valuable species.\"\n\nUp to 70 per cent of white-clawed crayfish have been lost from the south\nwest, and some parts of the UK have lost their entire populations. This is\npredominantly due to the crayfish plague, a fungus-like disease which is\nharmless to people and most animals but lethal to white-clawed crayfish.\nThe crayfish plague is spread by the invasive American signal crayfish, a\nnon-native species which is taking over UK waterways and wiping out our\nsmaller native species.\n\nThe South West Crayfish Project is currently running the largest strategic\ntranslocation in the UK to date, re-homing at-risk populations of\nwhite-clawed crayfish to new safe sites. In addition, a breeding programme\nfor the crayfish is being developed at Bristol Zoo Gardens, the sister\norganisation to the Bristol Conservation and Science Foundation (BCSF).\n\nMaddy Rees, UK conservation officer for the Bristol Conservation and\nScience Foundation, said: \"The plague can be carried on anything that gets\nwet in infected water, so we are urging people to wash, dry and, if\npossible, disinfect footwear, fishing tackle, nets and other equipment that\ngets damp in our rivers and lakes. Never trap for any species of crayfish\nwithout a trapping licence, as it is illegal, and finally, never move wild\nfish between waterways; always use a reputable stockist.\"\n\nThe survival of white-clawed crayfish will be the focus of a conference\nheld at Bristol Zoo Gardens later this year [2010]. The event, called\n\"Species survival: Securing white-clawed crayfish in a changing\nenvironment\" will take place on 16 and 17 Nov 2010. It will include a range\nof lectures from speakers from across Europe and presentations from experts\nin the field of UK crayfish conservation.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The aetiological agent of crayfish plague is _Aphanomyces astaci_, a\nmember of a group of organisms commonly known as the water moulds. Although\nlong regarded to be fungi, this group, the Oomycetida, are now considered\nprotists and are classified with diatoms and brown algae in a group called\nthe Stramenopiles or Chromista.\n\nThere is evidence that established older _A. astaci_ strains that have been\npresent in Europe for many years are less aggressive than newer strains\nintroduced with crayfish imports from North America since the 1960s. Some\nisolates from warmer waters in Spain have temperature/growth curves with\nhigher optimum temperatures compared with those from northern Europe.\n\nAlthough _A. astaci_ is not an obligate parasite and will grow well under\nlaboratory conditions on artificial media, in the natural environment it\ndoes not survive well for long periods in the absence of a suitable host.\nIt has been shown that _A. astaci_ cysts survive for 2 weeks in distilled\nwater, and that zoospores remained motile for up to 3 days. As _A. astaci_\ncan go through 3 cycles of zoospore emergence, the maximum life span\noutside of a host could be several weeks.\n\n_A. astaci_, both in culture and in infected crayfish, is killed by a short\nexposure to temperatures of 60 C (140 F) or to temperatures of -20 C (-4 F)\nor less for 48 hours or more. Sodium hypochlorite and iodophores are\neffective for disinfection of contaminated equipment. Thorough drying of\nequipment (more than 24 hours) is also effective, as _Aphanomyces_ is not\nresistant to desiccation.\n\nThere is good field and experimental evidence that movements of fish from\nareas in which crayfish plague is active can transmit infection from one\nwatershed to another. _A. astaci_ can also be spread by contaminated\nequipment (nets, boots, clothing, etc).\n\nThe information above is derived from chapter 2.3.7. \"Crayfish Plague\n(_Aphanomyces astaci_)\" in OIE's (World Organisation for Animal Health)\nManual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic animals.

The city [officials] said the girl was likely exposed to the\nplague in the East Mountains, and investigators are gathering more\ninformation on how she was exposed.\n\nOfficials also believe the girl's great-grandfather was also infected\nwith plague, but they're still awaiting final test results.\n\nFamily pets are also prone to the plague and could carry infected\nfleas home to their owners. Dogs may not show symptoms, the city said,\nbut cats may develop swollen lymph nodes in the neck, become\nlethargic, suffer a fever or lose their appetite.

All 3\ncases were most likely exposed via fleabite due to their clinical\npresentations of bubonic plague. Though we will never know the exact\nexposure, one of the risk factors in the 1st 2 cases was that the\nfamily dog was allowed to roam and hunt and then sleep in bed with\nthe children. No flea control products were used on the dog.\n\nThis type of risk has been seen in other human cases in past years\nand serves as a reminder to emphasize flea control product use on\npets, even in dry areas. These are not the typical dog and cat fleas,\nbut plague-infected rodent fleas from various animal species (prairie\ndogs, rock squirrels, wood rats, etc) that may be involved in a\nplague outbreak. The rodent fleas will transiently move to other\nanimals (dogs, cats, etc) from their preferred rodent host when it\ndies, and can be brought into the home by pets that are allowed to\nroam and hunt.\n\nNorth-central New Mexico is having a cooler and wetter late spring\nwhich allows infected fleas to survive longer and to move to the\nburrow entrances after their host rodent has died from plague without\nbeing prone to desiccation in the usual hot and dry environment. This\nincreases the risk that people and pets walking near the burrow\nentrances may have infected fleas jump onto them to try and take a blood meal.\n\n--\nPaul Ettestad DVM, MS\nState Public Health Veterinarian\nEpidemiology and Response Division\nNew Mexico Department of Health\nUSA\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Ettestad for his first-hand information and\nthe inclusion of the news release from the State Department of\nHealth, dated 10 Jun 2009:\n\nState confirms 3rd human plague case from Santa Fe County\nAnimal cases also confirmed in Taos and Santa Fe Counties\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe New Mexico Department of Health confirmed today [10 Jun 2009] a\n3rd case of bubonic plague in Santa Fe County so far in 2009. A\n56-year-old man was hospitalized and is back home recovering. The\nDepartment of Health is conducting an environmental investigation at\nthe man's residence to determine if there is any ongoing risk to people.\n\nThe Department also confirmed a plague case in a dog from north of\nthe city of Taos and a cat case from the Arroyo Hondo area southeast\nof the city of Santa Fe. Earlier this month [June 2009] the\nDepartment reported a fatal case in an 8-year-old Santa Fe County boy\nand a case in his 10-year-old sister who recovered. There have been a\ntotal of 3 human cases in New Mexico, all in Santa Fe County, so far in 2009.\n\nTo prevent cases of plague, the Department of Health recommends\n- Avoid sick or dead rodents.\n- Teach children not to play near rodent nests or burrows.\n- Treat pets regularly with an effective flea control product.\n- Clean up areas near the house where rodents could live.\n- Keep pets from roaming and hunting.\n- Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian.\n\nSymptoms in cats and dogs are similar to humans. Fever, lethargy, not\neating, and swollen lymph nodes (usually in the neck area) are the\nmost common signs.\n\nThere was one human case of plague in 2008 in an Eddy County man.\nThere were 5 human cases of plague in Bernalillo, San Juan, Santa Fe,\nand Torrance counties in 2007 with a fatality. 8 human plague cases\noccurred in New Mexico in 2006 with 3 fatalities.\"\n\nThe southwestern state of New Mexico can be located on the\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the US at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/00bF>.\nA map of the state of New Mexico showing the location of Santa Fe and\nthe other counties mentioned in the posting can be found at\n<http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/maps/new_mexico_map.html>. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nPlague, fatal - USA: (NM) bubonic 20090605.2080\nPlague, rabbit - USA (NM) 20090415.1435\n2008\n----\nPlague, human, feline - USA (NM): early season cases 20080127.0340\n2007\n----\nPlague, bubonic, human - USA (NM) 20070929.3218\nPlague, feline - USA (NM) 20070914.3055\nPlague, human, septicemic - USA (NM) 20070612.1914\nPlague, human, fatal - USA (NM) 20070608.1875\nPlague, human, secondary pneumonic - USA (NM) 20070607.1846\nPlague, septicemic - USA (NM) 20070504.1447\n2006\n----\nPlague, bubonic, human - USA (NM)(02) 20060724.2034\nPlague, bubonic, human - USA (NM) 20060717.1960\nPlague, human - USA (NM) 20060601.1526\nPlague, human, fatal - USA (NM) 20060528.1500\n2005\n----\nPlague, human - USA (NM)(02) 20050726.2163\nPlague, human - USA (NM) 20050725.2157\n2004\n----\nPlague, cats - USA (NM) 20040502.1213\n...................................ll/mj/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Fever, lethargy, not\neating, and swollen lymph nodes (usually in the neck area) are the\nmost common signs.\n\nThere was one human case of plague in 2008 in an Eddy County man.\nThere were 5 human cases of plague in Bernalillo, San Juan, Santa Fe,\nand Torrance counties in 2007 with a fatality. 8 human plague cases\noccurred in New Mexico in 2006 with 3 fatalities.\"\n\nThe southwestern state of New Mexico can be located on the\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the US at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/00bF>.\nA map of the state of New Mexico showing the location of Santa Fe and\nthe other counties mentioned in the posting can be found at\n<http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/maps/new_mexico_map.html>. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nPlague, fatal - USA: (NM) bubonic 20090605.2080\nPlague, rabbit - USA (NM) 20090415.1435\n2008\n----\nPlague, human, feline - USA (NM): early season cases 20080127.0340\n2007\n----\nPlague, bubonic, human - USA (NM) 20070929.3218\nPlague, feline - USA (NM) 20070914.3055\nPlague, human, septicemic - USA (NM) 20070612.1914\nPlague, human, fatal - USA (NM) 20070608.1875\nPlague, human, secondary pneumonic - USA (NM) 20070607.1846\nPlague, septicemic - USA (NM) 20070504.1447\n2006\n----\nPlague, bubonic, human - USA (NM)(02) 20060724.2034\nPlague, bubonic, human - USA (NM) 20060717.1960\nPlague, human - USA (NM) 20060601.1526\nPlague, human, fatal - USA (NM) 20060528.1500\n2005\n----\nPlague, human - USA (NM)(02) 20050726.2163\nPlague, human - USA (NM) 20050725.2157\n2004\n----\nPlague, cats - USA (NM) 20040502.1213\n...................................ll/mj/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Pueblo\nCity-County Health Department crews on Friday [25 Jul 2008] dusted\nprairie dog holes in north Pueblo West to kill fleas that can carry plague.\n\nPlague was confirmed following tests on a dead rabbit found by a\nresident recently in the area of Paradise Drive and Platteville\nBoulevard, according to health department spokeswoman Mary Davis.\n\"All residents in the area have been alerted to that and employees\nare dusting prairie dog holes in that area right now,\" Davis said Friday.\n\nPlague is relatively common in rabbits and rodents. It can infect\nhumans and domestic animals if they are bitten by a flea that has had\ncontact with an infected mouse, rabbit, prairie dog or other wild animal.\n\nThat's why \"everyone should be aware of the risk, no matter where\nthey live,\" Davis said. \"Everyone should always be aware of the\nguidelines for protecting themselves and their pets.\" Pets that spend\ntime outdoors, especially in rural areas, should be treated regularly\nfor fleas and should be kept on a leash in areas where rodents and\nother potential plague carriers are known to live.\n\nHomeowners should clear their properties of plant materials, lumber\nor debris that provide attractive cover for rabbits, mice and rats.\nKnown rodent habitats should be treated with flea powder or other\ninsecticides. When spending time in rural areas likely to harbor\nrabbits, prairie dogs and rodents, wearing insect repellent and long\npants, tucked into socks, can prevent flea bites. Humans should avoid\nall contact with wild animals and rodents that are known to be\npotential carriers of plague, and should never handle a sick or dead animal.\n\nSigns of plague infection include a sudden fever, fatigue and general\nmalaise. The disease is treatable in humans and animals but is more\neasily treated if caught early. For more information, or to report a\ndead or sick animal, call the Environmental Health Division of the\nPueblo City-County Health Department at 583-4323.\n\n[Byline: Loretta Sword]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The causative bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, is transmitted to people\nthrough fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each\nrodent species is host to one or more species of flea, which, when\ninfected, is a carrier. These fleas generally do not infest other\nanimals unless their natural hosts are unavailable.\n\nRock squirrels (_Spermophilus variegatus_) are closely related to\nCalifornia ground squirrels and are the most significant plague host\nin Colorado. Their principal flea (_Diamanus montanus_) is an\naggressive parasite and will readily bite other animals and people.\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague by infective fleas.\nThey may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially\nwith cats, serve as a direct source of infection.\n\nOften prairie dogs are considered sentinel animals. Cats are also\nvery sensitive. Owners should be alert to any swelling on their\nanimals and if found the pet should be examined by a veterinarian. - Mod.TG\n\nProMED has only ever reported one other rabbit with plague, which was\nlast year, also in Colorado -- see ProMED 2007 archive below. - Mod.JW\n\n[A map of Colorado is available at:\n<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/colorado_90.jpg> - CopyEd.EJP]\nSee Also\nPlague, prairie dogs, ferrets - USA: (SD)(02) 20080722.2213\nPlague, prairie dog, ferrets - USA: (SD) 20080708.2082\nPlague, feline - USA (WY): mountain lion 20080522.1694\nPlague, prairie dogs - USA: (CO), susp., RFI 20080506.1552\n2007\n----\nPlague, prairie dogs - USA (SD) 20070927.3205\nPlague, wildlife - USA (AZ) 20070812.2625\nPlague, ground squirrels - USA (CA) 20070811.2613\nPlague, prairie dogs - USA (CO)(02) 20070729.2434\nPlague, squirrel - USA (CA) 20070720.2322\nPlague, squirrel, flea, cat - USA (CO,CA) 20070518.1577\nPlague, squirrels, rabbit - USA (CO) 20070505.1455\nPlague, squirrel - USA (CO)(02) 20070503.1444\n....................tg/ejp/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

With the last information communicated by the service of the\ntransmissible disease, the disease has killed, up to now, 3 people.\nIn addition to a 38-year-old man, an inhabitant of Manankasikely and\ndead on 5 Jan 2008, a 12-year-old is also dead in Ambohitseheno. The 3rd\nvictim lived in the rural district of Ambatolaona, and his death\noccurred in December 2007.\nMoreover, as of 10 Jan 2008, 4 men and a woman are under treatment in\nthe hospital complex of the district.\n\"The rats haven't been beaten down. We have rushed a medical team to\nManjakandriana to address the situation,\" said Dr. Rolland Robinson,\nchief of the service of the Emergenies and Transmissible Diseases within\nthe Ministry of Health, Family Planning and Social Protection.\nIn all the cases, the killing of rats are not done, because \"that\nsupports the profusion of the fleas and, so the recrudescence of the\nmalady,\" said Dr. Robinson. He encourages the cleansing of the places\nand the insecticide use.\n[Byline: Fanja Saholiarisoa]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Dan Silver\n[3 deaths are reported in this press posting but 18 deaths are noted in\nthe web posting below. ProMED would appreciate learning more\ninformation regarding this outbreak.\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial\nresistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al:\nMultidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable\nplasmid. N Engl J Med 1997;337: 677-81). The strain was resistant to\nchloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline but sensitive to\nfluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This\nwas an ominous observation, however, it is not clear if this naturally\noccurring strain has persisted or spread.\nManjakandriana is an administrative region in the central Madagascar\nprovince of Antananarivo. The area can be found on a map of the island\nat:\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antananarivo_Province>. - Mod.LL]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 9 Jan 2008\nSource: Les dessous d'information mondiale [edited]\n<http://eldib.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/2175/>\n\nAt least 18 people have died of bubonic plague on the East African\nisland of Madagascar in the past 10 days, and at least 5 patients are\nstill in hospital. Bubonic plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_\nbacillus carried by rat fleas.\nAt the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of\nMadagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages.\n[The following paragraph of this posting is from 1998 (Chanteau S,\nRatsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease\nin Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998;4: 101-104:\n\"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had \"virtually disappeared\" on\nthe island due to efficient pest-control and good health-management.\nHowever since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic\nplague takes on epidemic form especially in the port of Mahajanga each\nyear. In the capital city of Antananarivo more cases are also being\nnotified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has\naccounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.\"\n- Mod.LL]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nSee Also\n2007\n----\nPlague, fatal - Uganda: (Arua, Nebbi), RFI 20071206.3932\nUndiagnosed deaths - Zambia (02): pneumonic plague susp. 20071130.3862\nPlague - Uganda (Masindi) (03): pneumonic 20070309.0835\nPlague - Uganda (Masindi): pneumonic 20070301.0725\nUndiagnosed deaths - Uganda (Masindi): RFI 20070227.0698\n2006\n----\nPlague, pneumonic - Congo DR (Orientale) (03): WHO 20061108.3208\nPlague, pneumonic - Uganda (Arua) 20061020.3022\nPlague, pneumonic - Congo DR (Orientale): susp., RFI 20061004.2837\nPlague, pneumonic - Congo DR (Ituri) (05): susp., RFI 20060929.2786\nPlague, pneumonic - Congo DR (Ituri) 20060614.1650\n2005\n----\nUndiagnosed deaths - Congo DR (Maniema) (08): pneumonic plague susp\n20050905.2625\nUndiagnosed deaths - Congo DR (Maniema): hem fever susp, RFI\n20050805.2274\nPlague, pneumonic - Congo DR (07): (North East) 20050315.0754\nPlague, pneumonic - Congo DR (Ituri) 20050218.0537\n2004\n----\nPlague - Congo DR (Ituri): susp. 20040730.2083\nPlague - Uganda (Arua, Nebbi) 20040112.0128\n2003\n----\nPlague - Uganda (Arua, Nebbi) (02): background 20031013.2584\nPlague - Uganda (Arua, Nebbi) 20031012.2566\nPlague - Uganda (Arua) 20030331.0794\n2002\n----\nPlague - Uganda (Nebbi District): RFI 20021218.6090\nPlague - Uganda (Arua, Nebbi) 20021130.5938\nPlague, bubonic - Malawi (Nsanje) 20020601.4378\nPlague, bubonic - Malawi, Mozambique 20020510.4160\n1997\n----\nYersinia pestis, antibiotic resistance - Madagascar 19970905.1911\n1996\n----\nPlague - Madagascar 19961023.1790\n1995\n----\nPlague - Madagascar (3) 19951011.0935\nPlague - Madagascar (press report) 19950922.0873\n......................ll/lm/ejp/lm\nThe information transmitted in this electronic communication is intended only\nfor the person or entity to whom it is addressed and may contain confidential\nand/or privileged material.

Suspected cases of bubonic plague have also been\nreported, but the total number is not known at this time. Preliminary\nresults from rapid diagnostic tests in the area confirm pneumonic\nplague. Additional laboratory analysis, including tests by culture,\nis ongoing on 18 samples.\nIturi is known to be the most active focus of human plague worldwide,\nreporting around 1000 cases a year. The 1st cases in this outbreak\noccurred in a rural area, in the Zone de Sante of Linga, in mid-May 2006.\nA team from Medecins sans Frontieres (Switzerland), WHO and Ministry\nof Health has been in the area to assess the situation and provide\nsupport to the local health authorities. Isolation wards have been\nestablished to treat patients; close contacts are being traced and\nreceiving chemoprophylaxis. However, control measures have been\ndifficult to implement because of security concerns in the area.\nFor more information, see the fact sheet on plague at\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs267/en/>.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Primary pneumonic plague (one percent of natural plague\npresentations) arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in\ninfectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are\nsecondary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.\nPrimary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days,\nafter which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including\nfever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness and chest\ndiscomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be\nbloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the\ndisease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood)\nand hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is\ninvariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24\nhours of exposure.\nPatients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of\ninfectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.\nCDC guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters as being at greatest\nrisk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through\nair ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic\nplague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or\ntissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive\nantimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for\nprophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol.\nA map of Congo DR showing Oriental province, where Ituri is located,\ncan be found at:\n<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/congo_demrep_pol98.jpg>. - Mod.LL]\n[Of note, this is the same general area where there was a major\noutbreak of pneumonic and bubonic plague in 2005 (see prior\nProMED-mail postings listed below. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\n2005\n----\nUndiagnosed deaths - Congo DR (Maniema) (08): pneumonic plague susp\n20050905.2625\nUndiagnosed deaths - Congo DR (Maniema): hem fever susp, RFI 20050805.2274\nPlague, pneumonic - Congo DR (07): (North East) 20050315.0754\nPlague, pneumonic - Congo DR (Ituri) 20050218.0537\n2004\n----\nPlague, fatal - China (Qinghai) 20041101.2948\nPlague - Congo DR (Ituri): susp. 20040730.2083\nPlague, fatal - Ecuador (Chimborazo) (02) 20040513.1288\nPlague, fatal - Ecuador: RFI 20040510.1264\nPlague - Uganda (Arua, Nebbi) 20040112.0128\n2003\n----\nPlague - Uganda (Arua, Nebbi) (02): background 20031013.2584\nPlague - Uganda (Arua, Nebbi) 20031012.2566\nPlague - Algeria (Oran) (04) 20030704.1643\nPlague, bubonic - Algeria (Oran) 20030622.1537\nPlague - Uganda (Arua) 20030331.0794\n2002\n----\nPlague - Uganda (Nebbi District): RFI 20021218.6090\nPlague - Uganda (Arua, Nebbi) 20021130.5938\nPlague, bubonic - Malawi (Nsanje) 20020601.4378\nPlague, bubonic - Malawi, Mozambique 20020510.4160\nPlague - India (Chandigarh) (04): WHO confirmation 20020220.3592\nPlague, suspected - India (Chandigarh) 20020215.3567\n2001\n----\nPlague - Uganda (Arua, Nebbi) 20011031.2689\nPlague - Uganda (Okoro County) (02) 20011016.2543\nPlague, suspected - Congo DR 20011011.2484\nPlague - Uganda (Okoro County) 20011009.2459\n........................ll/msp/mpp\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

In 1999, a\nwoman died from the plague in the same area that this year's human case\noccurred.\nAnn Watson, public information specialist with the health and environment\ndepartment, said it is rare to find humans infected with the plague and\nsaid those people that are infected come from contact with their pets.\n\"Most of our human cases come from cats. We have had so few cases it is\nhard to make generalizations,\" Watson said.\nCats and other animals can be infected with the plague when they kill and\neat infected rodents that are riddled with infected fleas. From that point,\npets can transmit the disease to humans through bites, scratches or\ndroplets from their coughs. The bacteria can also be transmitted via the\ninfected fleas themselves, which pets can also bring into domesticated areas.\nBubonic plague, the more common form of the plague, occurs when extreme\npain and swelling of the lymph nodes strikes a victim.

The bubonic\nplague is not transmitted person-to-person, but it can spread to the lungs\nto form pneumonic plague, and the victim's close contacts can be infected.\nThough the plague may be rare in humans, rodent populations carry it often,\nsuch as in mice or rats, Kempton said.\nRecently, another bacterium, [_Francisella tularensis, the cause of ]\ntularemia, has been traced in Larimer County in a dead beaver and mouse.

Tularemia is a\nbacterial disease that can affect humans or animals from insects that have\nthe disease.\nHealth officials say to take precautions to prevent infections from these\ndiseases. Using insect repellents, avoiding sick or dead rodents, keeping\npets leashed while camping or hiking, and keeping close attention to a\npet's health are all preventative measures.\nAdrienne LeBaily, the county's heath department director, said, \"Although\nthese bacteria are potential bioterror agents, we are convinced that these\nhuman cases were naturally occurring.\"\n[Byline: James Baetke]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org\n[Prairie dogs are often considered the most sensitive sentinel to plague.\nGenerally monitoring prairie dog activity can give one a clue as to when\nthe rodent cycle of plague may be spilling over into other\npopulations.

In 1999, a\nwoman died from the plague in the same area that this year's human case\noccurred.\nAnn Watson, public information specialist with the health and environment\ndepartment, said it is rare to find humans infected with the plague and\nsaid those people that are infected come from contact with their pets.\n\"Most of our human cases come from cats. We have had so few cases it is\nhard to make generalizations,\" Watson said.\nCats and other animals can be infected with the plague when they kill and\neat infected rodents that are riddled with infected fleas. From that point,\npets can transmit the disease to humans through bites, scratches or\ndroplets from their coughs. The bacteria can also be transmitted via the\ninfected fleas themselves, which pets can also bring into domesticated areas.\nBubonic plague, the more common form of the plague, occurs when extreme\npain and swelling of the lymph nodes strikes a victim.

The bubonic\nplague is not transmitted person-to-person, but it can spread to the lungs\nto form pneumonic plague, and the victim's close contacts can be infected.\nThough the plague may be rare in humans, rodent populations carry it often,\nsuch as in mice or rats, Kempton said.\nRecently, another bacterium, [_Francisella tularensis, the cause of ]\ntularemia, has been traced in Larimer County in a dead beaver and mouse.

Tularemia is a\nbacterial disease that can affect humans or animals from insects that have\nthe disease.\nHealth officials say to take precautions to prevent infections from these\ndiseases. Using insect repellents, avoiding sick or dead rodents, keeping\npets leashed while camping or hiking, and keeping close attention to a\npet's health are all preventative measures.\nAdrienne LeBaily, the county's heath department director, said, \"Although\nthese bacteria are potential bioterror agents, we are convinced that these\nhuman cases were naturally occurring.\"\n[Byline: James Baetke]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org\n[Prairie dogs are often considered the most sensitive sentinel to plague.\nGenerally monitoring prairie dog activity can give one a clue as to when\nthe rodent cycle of plague may be spilling over into other\npopulations.

There have already been more\nthan 20 deaths in Turkmenistan. News about the plague was delivered\nby a German humanitarian aid company that works at the Uzbek-Turkmen\nborder in the north Karakums in the Tashhovuz region. According to a\nspecialist, this is the most serious outbreak in the last 20-30 years.\nAccording to radio \"German wave\" (Nemezkaya volna), during a recent\nweek, 7 people died, in the Turkmen city Mari, from plague. There\nhave been fatal cases in Ashgabad (capital of Turkmenistan) as well.\nUnfortunately, there is no reliable information from Turkmenistan,\nfrom the Russia epidemiological surveillance center, or from WHO.\nAccording to the chief sanitary physician of Russia, Gennadiy\nOnishenko, everything associated with acute diseases in Turkmenistan\nis kept secret.\nTurkmenistan officials have made some efforts to prevent the spread\nof the epidemic. Quarantine was introduced in several of the\nhospitals of Ashgabad, and public pools are closed.\nAccording to Gennadiy Onishenko, carriers of plague in Central Asia\nare camels. If a camel dies, people usually eat the meat. However,\npeople will not be infected with plague if they cook the meat\nthoroughly [and avoid contamination with the uncooked meat - Mod. LL].\nUzbekistan has taken serious measures to prevent the spread of this\ndangerous infection. Transportation of domestic animals across the\nborder, including camels, is prohibited, and people living near the\nborders have been assessed. So far, according to official data, there\nhave been no human cases of plague registered in Uzbekistan.\nThere are no quarantine measures established in Russia. According to\nOnishenko, all elements of the transportation system of Central Asia,\nincluding airports and trains, have been notified.\nThe last case of plague in Turkmenistan was reported 25 years ago.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 6 Jul 2004\nFrom: Wendy Orent <orentw@mindspring.com> [edited]\n\nAccording to the moderator (LL), Kazakhstan is the only former Soviet\nrepublic reporting plague.

Quarantine was introduced in several of the\nhospitals of Ashgabad, and public pools are closed.\nAccording to Gennadiy Onishenko, carriers of plague in Central Asia\nare camels. If a camel dies, people usually eat the meat. However,\npeople will not be infected with plague if they cook the meat\nthoroughly [and avoid contamination with the uncooked meat - Mod.

Transportation of domestic animals across the\nborder, including camels, is prohibited, and people living near the\nborders have been assessed. So far, according to official data, there\nhave been no human cases of plague registered in Uzbekistan.\nThere are no quarantine measures established in Russia.

There have already been more\nthan 20 deaths in Turkmenistan. News about the plague was delivered\nby a German humanitarian aid company that works at the Uzbek-Turkmen\nborder in the north Karakums in the Tashhovuz region. According to a\nspecialist, this is the most serious outbreak in the last 20-30 years.\nAccording to radio \"German wave\" (Nemezkaya volna), during a recent\nweek, 7 people died, in the Turkmen city Mari, from plague. There\nhave been fatal cases in Ashgabad (capital of Turkmenistan) as well.\nUnfortunately, there is no reliable information from Turkmenistan,\nfrom the Russia epidemiological surveillance center, or from WHO.\nAccording to the chief sanitary physician of Russia, Gennadiy\nOnishenko, everything associated with acute diseases in Turkmenistan\nis kept secret.\nTurkmenistan officials have made some efforts to prevent the spread\nof the epidemic. Quarantine was introduced in several of the\nhospitals of Ashgabad, and public pools are closed.\nAccording to Gennadiy Onishenko, carriers of plague in Central Asia\nare camels. If a camel dies, people usually eat the meat. However,\npeople will not be infected with plague if they cook the meat\nthoroughly [and avoid contamination with the uncooked meat - Mod. LL].\nUzbekistan has taken serious measures to prevent the spread of this\ndangerous infection. Transportation of domestic animals across the\nborder, including camels, is prohibited, and people living near the\nborders have been assessed. So far, according to official data, there\nhave been no human cases of plague registered in Uzbekistan.\nThere are no quarantine measures established in Russia. According to\nOnishenko, all elements of the transportation system of Central Asia,\nincluding airports and trains, have been notified.\nThe last case of plague in Turkmenistan was reported 25 years ago.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 6 Jul 2004\nFrom: Wendy Orent <orentw@mindspring.com> [edited]\n\nAccording to the moderator (LL), Kazakhstan is the only former Soviet\nrepublic reporting plague.

In fact, in\n1949-50, there was a sizeable outbreak of pneumonic plague, which may\nhave killed upwards of 100 people, according to Dr. Lev A. Melnikov,\nwho was an eyewitness. Melnikov attributed the outbreak to the\ndangerous plague reservoir _Rhombomys optimus_ (the great gerbil.).

Outbreaks of bubonic plague have occurred in\nNsanje district at the southern tip of the country since 1994, with the\nnumber of cases peaking at 304 in 1999. There were no reported cases for\nthe 2 years before April 2002.\nThe plague, which has a case fatality ratio of up to 60 per cent if left\nuntreated, has also been reported in Mozambique, leading to cross-border\ncollaboration between Mozambican and Malawian health teams. \"WHO is\nconcerned due to the fact that the current epidemic is combined with\nmalnutrition because of the food shortage in the country. It is a\nwell-known fact that prevalence and severity of all infectious diseases\nincrease where malnutrition is rampant,\" a statement said.\nA World Food Program (WFP) assessment released this week estimated that 3.2\nmillion Malawians face food shortages due to anticipated food shortages\nthis year. The country is only just recovering from a cholera epidemic that\nkilled over 900 people. Malawi's overstretched health services now share\nthe added burden of acquiring adequate medical staff and finding chemicals\nto spray against fleas and rodents.

The first victim this year was a 9 year\nold girl from Zavedo village. Outbreaks of bubonic plague have occurred in\nNsanje district at the southern tip of the country since 1994, with the\nnumber of cases peaking at 304 in 1999. There were no reported cases for\nthe 2 years before April 2002.\nThe plague, which has a case fatality ratio of up to 60 per cent if left\nuntreated, has also been reported in Mozambique, leading to cross-border\ncollaboration between Mozambican and Malawian health teams. \"WHO is\nconcerned due to the fact that the current epidemic is combined with\nmalnutrition because of the food shortage in the country. It is a\nwell-known fact that prevalence and severity of all infectious diseases\nincrease where malnutrition is rampant,\" a statement said.\nA World Food Program (WFP) assessment released this week estimated that 3.2\nmillion Malawians face food shortages due to anticipated food shortages\nthis year. The country is only just recovering from a cholera epidemic that\nkilled over 900 people. Malawi's overstretched health services now share\nthe added burden of acquiring adequate medical staff and finding chemicals\nto spray against fleas and rodents.

The first victim this year was a 9 year\nold girl from Zavedo village. Outbreaks of bubonic plague have occurred in\nNsanje district at the southern tip of the country since 1994, with the\nnumber of cases peaking at 304 in 1999. There were no reported cases for\nthe 2 years before April 2002.\nThe plague, which has a case fatality ratio of up to 60 per cent if left\nuntreated, has also been reported in Mozambique, leading to cross-border\ncollaboration between Mozambican and Malawian health teams. \"WHO is\nconcerned due to the fact that the current epidemic is combined with\nmalnutrition because of the food shortage in the country. It is a\nwell-known fact that prevalence and severity of all infectious diseases\nincrease where malnutrition is rampant,\" a statement said.\nA World Food Program (WFP) assessment released this week estimated that 3.2\nmillion Malawians face food shortages due to anticipated food shortages\nthis year. The country is only just recovering from a cholera epidemic that\nkilled over 900 people. Malawi's overstretched health services now share\nthe added burden of acquiring adequate medical staff and finding chemicals\nto spray against fleas and rodents. The UN children's agency, UNICEF, and\nWHO response includes providing cash to districts to buy insecticides for\nhousehold spraying and sending a consultant to give front-line health\nworkers refresher training.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The Nsanje district of Malawi has been the subject of ProMED-mail postings\nin the past (see below).

Her death was the first case of plague pneumonia reported in\nthe country since 1924, a California Department of Health Services report\nsaid.\nJim Hogan, supervisor for the Nevada Environmental Health Division, said\nwith today's modern medicine, the disease is not a death sentence. \"It\ncan be fatal, yes, but its very curable if treated early,\" Hogan said.\nHogan said the disease can take two pathways through the body. The most\ncommon way is infecting the lymph nodes, called bubonic plague. If left\nuntreated, the bacteria can travel through the blood stream to the\nlungs, progressing to the deadly pneumonic plague.\nEarly symptoms include high fever, chills, nausea, weakness and swollen\nglands.

County workers will set up 40 to 50 dust stations to kill\nfleas, which carry the plague among animals, and will exterminate 90% of\nthe ground squirrels, which officials say are the most common carriers of\nthe plague in the Los Angeles area. Fielding said the measures were\nnecessary because the park is heavily used by picnickers and hikers. It\ncontains the Eaton Canyon Nature Center, which draws hundreds of children\nand adults on weekends and is home to dozens of nature organizations.\nAt Table Mountain, the discovery of the infected squirrel required no\nextraordinary measures because it coincided with the camping area's normal\nannual closure, county officials said.\nThe Lancaster cat, however, has prompted additional concern because there\nhave been no such cases among domesticated animals since the late 1980s,\nsaid Frank Hall, chief of the Department of Health Services' vector\nmanagement program. Vectors are animals or insects that can transmit\ndisease to humans.\n\"We're concerned about where this cat came from,\" Hall said. \"Did it have a\nprevious owner?\"\nCounty health officials said they are investigating areas near the\nLancaster trailer park to determine the extent of the plague infestation.\nThe woman who fed the cat showed no signs of bubonic plague, Hall said.\nTracy Bryant, Rancho Mirage trailer park's resident manager, said the\ncounty only informed her Wednesday afternoon about the infected tabby. \"The\ncounty is suppose to be coming out tomorrow. We'll be informing all our\nresidents about the cat.\"\nThe latest sylvatic plague cases were discovered during a routine sampling\nof animals in shelters and wilderness areas by county health officers.\nBubonic plague, once known as the \"Black Death,\" is believed to have wiped\nout as much as a third of Europe's population during the 14th century. But\nwith advances in preventive methods, only about 10 or 15 cases are now\nreported annually in the United States. Still, county health officials are\nurging the public to take precautions.\nPeople should stay away from wild or stray animals and use insect repellent\nagainst fleas, Hall said.

Fielding said the measures were\nnecessary because the park is heavily used by picnickers and hikers. It\ncontains the Eaton Canyon Nature Center, which draws hundreds of children\nand adults on weekends and is home to dozens of nature organizations.\nAt Table Mountain, the discovery of the infected squirrel required no\nextraordinary measures because it coincided with the camping area's normal\nannual closure, county officials said.\nThe Lancaster cat, however, has prompted additional concern because there\nhave been no such cases among domesticated animals since the late 1980s,\nsaid Frank Hall, chief of the Department of Health Services' vector\nmanagement program. Vectors are animals or insects that can transmit\ndisease to humans.\n\"We're concerned about where this cat came from,\" Hall said. \"Did it have a\nprevious owner?\"\nCounty health officials said they are investigating areas near the\nLancaster trailer park to determine the extent of the plague infestation.\nThe woman who fed the cat showed no signs of bubonic plague, Hall said.\nTracy Bryant, Rancho Mirage trailer park's resident manager, said the\ncounty only informed her Wednesday afternoon about the infected tabby. \"The\ncounty is suppose to be coming out tomorrow. We'll be informing all our\nresidents about the cat.\"\nThe latest sylvatic plague cases were discovered during a routine sampling\nof animals in shelters and wilderness areas by county health officers.\nBubonic plague, once known as the \"Black Death,\" is believed to have wiped\nout as much as a third of Europe's population during the 14th century. But\nwith advances in preventive methods, only about 10 or 15 cases are now\nreported annually in the United States. Still, county health officials are\nurging the public to take precautions.\nPeople should stay away from wild or stray animals and use insect repellent\nagainst fleas, Hall said. Even healthy-looking animals can harbor the\ndisease, and pet owners should try to keep their animals flea-free and\nindoors.\n--\nProMED\ne-mail: promed@promedmail.org\n......................................tg/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Specialists of the local anti-plague center\nestablished the herdsman's family contracted the disease while cutting up\nthe carcass of a camel: only these animals can fall ill with this disease.\nA quarantine was put in placed at that locality. As many as 89 people\ncontacted the patients. Seven of them were hospitalized and are under\nmedical observation. They are mostly medics who inspected the patients for\nthe first time.\nEpidemiologists from the republican epidemiological center now work in the\nlocality. The regional administration appropriated 200,000 tenges (about\n1,500 U.S. dollars) for medicines. Measures were taken to localize the\nplague seat.\nThe Mangistauskaya Region is regarded as a higher risk zone for contracting\nplague, although the last case of plague was registered in the region 24\nyears ago. This is the third case of contracting plague in Kazakhstan this\nyear.\nThe Aktyubinsk and Kyzylorda regions registered one man each who fell ill\nwith plague in June.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[Plague is caused by _Yersinia (formerly _Pasteurella_) pestis_ and affects\nprimarily the lymphatics and lungs. Plague is a historic scourge of man,\nwild rodents, and rabbits and cases associated with cats, dogs and camels\nare now recognized as hazards to man.\nThe primary means of spreading _Yersinia pestis_ is the flea. Contact with\ninfected carcasses has been a significant source of infection for man.\nEndemic foci of sylvatic plague exists in the western USA and in many areas\nworldwide.

This is the third case of contracting plague in Kazakhstan this\nyear.\nThe Aktyubinsk and Kyzylorda regions registered one man each who fell ill\nwith plague in June.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[Plague is caused by _Yersinia (formerly _Pasteurella_) pestis_ and affects\nprimarily the lymphatics and lungs. Plague is a historic scourge of man,\nwild rodents, and rabbits and cases associated with cats, dogs and camels\nare now recognized as hazards to man.\nThe primary means of spreading _Yersinia pestis_ is the flea. Contact with\ninfected carcasses has been a significant source of infection for man.\nEndemic foci of sylvatic plague exists in the western USA and in many areas\nworldwide. Throughout history, outbreaks of human plague involving rats in\ndensely populated agricultural or urban areas have occurred when rats\ncommingled with infected sylvatic rodents. - Mod.TG\n.................................tg/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Early last week, Dr Hamata and his team took blood\nsample from patients and sent them to the South African Institute for\nMedical Research which found six of the 11 samples to be positive.\nYesterday Hamata said a team of health inspectors from Oshakati\nHospital went out last Sunday and yesterday to villages such as\nOshatotwa and Onandova to put up traps to catch rats. It is hoped that\nthe fleas that are carrying the disease can be extracted and sent to South\nAfrica for further testing.\nBubonic plague is caused by a bacterium which can be transmitted to\nhumans by flea bites. The fleas often live on rodents such as rats.\n[Byline: Oswald Shivute At Oshakati\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@usa.healthnet.org>\n[To those readers who picked up the error in the original article of\nconfirmation from The Namibian, where _Yersinia pestis_ was referred\nto as a virus, rather than a bacterium, thank you - MPP\n................................................jw\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Obviously such\nnotification can only be conducted with the full cooperation of local\nhealth departments.\nDr. Rosenberg asks what advice on plague Health Canada provides to\ntravellers to the Rockies. Our response to this question is that in\nmany\ninstances we do not provide specific advice regarding endemic pathogens,\nunless there is some change to indicate that the level of risk for the\ntraveller has increased. Thus, we would not routinely advise travellers\nto\nthe Rockies regarding their risk for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever unless\nthere was some change in risk, e.g., a change from endemic to epidemic.\nBased on the evidence to date, we do not feel it is necessary to provide\nsuch travellers with specific information on plague in the Rockies at\nthe\npresent time. However, should the situation change, say in a way\ncomparable to the William Heise County Park situation [see below,\nthen we would respond accordingly.\nOur approach would be to identify the risk, assess\nit, and then provide travellers with the appropriate advice. In a\nnutshell, the identification of the risk and the assessment of that risk\nwould be the cornerstone of our response.\nAs Dr. Rosenberg rightly points out, sporadic cases of a specific\ndisease\nmay be expected to occur from time to time in known endemic areas. But\nI\nthink he will agree that a change in the endemic pattern of disease\nmight\nwarrant a timely public health response.

Obviously such\nnotification can only be conducted with the full cooperation of local\nhealth departments.\nDr. Rosenberg asks what advice on plague Health Canada provides to\ntravellers to the Rockies. Our response to this question is that in\nmany\ninstances we do not provide specific advice regarding endemic pathogens,\nunless there is some change to indicate that the level of risk for the\ntraveller has increased. Thus, we would not routinely advise travellers\nto\nthe Rockies regarding their risk for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever unless\nthere was some change in risk, e.g., a change from endemic to epidemic.\nBased on the evidence to date, we do not feel it is necessary to provide\nsuch travellers with specific information on plague in the Rockies at\nthe\npresent time. However, should the situation change, say in a way\ncomparable to the William Heise County Park situation [see below,\nthen we would respond accordingly.\nOur approach would be to identify the risk, assess\nit, and then provide travellers with the appropriate advice. In a\nnutshell, the identification of the risk and the assessment of that risk\nwould be the cornerstone of our response.\nAs Dr. Rosenberg rightly points out, sporadic cases of a specific\ndisease\nmay be expected to occur from time to time in known endemic areas. But\nI\nthink he will agree that a change in the endemic pattern of disease\nmight\nwarrant a timely public health response.

Obviously such\nnotification can only be conducted with the full cooperation of local\nhealth departments.\nDr. Rosenberg asks what advice on plague Health Canada provides to\ntravellers to the Rockies. Our response to this question is that in\nmany\ninstances we do not provide specific advice regarding endemic pathogens,\nunless there is some change to indicate that the level of risk for the\ntraveller has increased. Thus, we would not routinely advise travellers\nto\nthe Rockies regarding their risk for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever unless\nthere was some change in risk, e.g., a change from endemic to epidemic.\nBased on the evidence to date, we do not feel it is necessary to provide\nsuch travellers with specific information on plague in the Rockies at\nthe\npresent time. However, should the situation change, say in a way\ncomparable to the William Heise County Park situation [see below,\nthen we would respond accordingly.\nOur approach would be to identify the risk, assess\nit, and then provide travellers with the appropriate advice. In a\nnutshell, the identification of the risk and the assessment of that risk\nwould be the cornerstone of our response.\nAs Dr. Rosenberg rightly points out, sporadic cases of a specific\ndisease\nmay be expected to occur from time to time in known endemic areas. But\nI\nthink he will agree that a change in the endemic pattern of disease\nmight\nwarrant a timely public health response. In fact, this is how we\ninterpreted the actions of the public health officials in the County of\nSan\nDiego, Department of Health Services, San Diego, California, when in\nJune\n1998 they thought it necessary to warn campers and visitors to the\nWilliam\nHeise County Park that routine monitoring suggested that chipmunks,\nground\nsquirrels or other wild rodents in this area might be infected with\nplague.\nThey identified a potential public health risk, assessed it and\nimplemented\nthe necessary measures, including warning signs in the Park.\n[Plague, wild rodents, warning - USA (California) 980705231736\n>From our\nperspective these actions justified an appropriate advisory notice to\nCanadian travellers who might be visiting the above area, especially\nsince\nCanadians travelling and camping in the US are not aware of, nor do they\nexpect to encounter, serious infectious diseases. I can assure Dr.\nRosenberg that if a similar situation developed in Canada, then our\nresponse would be similar.\nAlthough human plague is still sporadic in North America, I do not\nbelieve\nthat we can ignore changing trends and patterns in the wild rodent\nreservoir.

Dr. Taylor and I never took a position against reporting of\nplague cases; we only took exception to criticism for failing to rapidly\nreport cases.\nLocal health departments should be afforded some professional\njudgement to distinguish between cases of little immediate public health\nimport beyond the locality, e.g., a sporadic case of plague in an area\nwell\nknown to be endemic for plague, and an outbreak of a mosquito-borne\nvirus.\nAll reportable diseases should not have to be immediately broadcast\nglobally\nover ProMED-mail.\nIn California, with a population of over 33 million people, we\nhave reported annually at least 6000 cases of hepatitis A with numerous\nfoodborne and community-wide outbreaks, 4000 cases of tuberculosis, 1000\ncases of foodborne illness associated with 100 outbreaks, 1000-3000\ncases of\nviral meningitis, 500 cases of pertussis, 300 cases of invasive\nmeningococcal infections, 200 cases of malaria, 50 cases of\nlegionellosis,\n30 cases of brucellosis, 30-40 cases of infant botulism, 10-20 cases of\nwound botulism, 3-5 cases of foodborne botulism, 3-5 cases of relapsing\nfever, and 1-2 cases of human plague, human rabies, hantavirus pulmonary\nsyndrome, and tularemia, just to highlight some of the 71 categories of\nreportable diseases that might be of some interest to ProMED\nsubscribers.\nWe would have to dedicate a position to reporting to ProMED just to keep\nup\nwith these. We and our 56 local health jurisdictions try to be\nresponsible\nin our reporting, so forgive us if we are sensitive to criticism that\nsome\nweeks might elapse before we report a case of sporadic human plague to\nCDC\nor ProMED-mail.\n--\nJon Rosenberg, M.D.\nCalifornia Department of Health Services\nDivision of Communicable Disease Control\nInfection Control and Healthcare Epidemiology\n2151 Berkeley Way\nBerkeley CA 84704\nPhone (510) 540-3233 Fax (510) 540-2570\n<jrosenbe@dhs.ca.gov>\n[The comments *were* read carefully. We certainly agree that \"All\nreportable diseases should not have to be immediately broadcast globally\nover ProMED-mail.\" As for \"We would have to dedicate a position to\nreporting to ProMED[-mail just to keep up with these,\" if California\ncould just report those reportable diseases rapidly to CDC, that would\nbe good enough for us. We are mainly interested in outbreaks of emerging\ninfectious diseases and toxins, and therefore the majority of the\nimpressive list of diseases reported above are not of interest to this\nlist.\nThe issue is why individual states do not help the USA fulfil its\nobligation under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to report\nsporadic cases of plague to WHO within 24 hours.\nA subsidiary issue is whether delayed reporting might result in delayed\nrecognition of a terrorist trial run with plague (the sarin attack in\nTokyo was preceded by at least one trial, and the typhoid incident in\nOregon years ago appeared to be a trial run).\nIf there is a strong feeling in the USA that there is no hurry to report\nsuch cases, in spite of concerns such as Health Canada\u00b4s (above) and\nabout bioterrorism, then the US authorities concerned should lobby WHO\nto drop the requirement for immediate notification, rather than letting\nindividual states decide for themselves when they are ready to report.\nThe proposed revision of the IHR will apparently leave it up to\ncountries -- but not to their component states or provinces -- to decide\nwhether or not to report such cases if they unilaterally deem they are\nof no international importance. Whether that is a good idea will be\ndebated at WHO during the coming months - Mod.JW\n.............................jw\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The culprits are most likely to be rock squirrels,\nground squirrels, prairie dogs or pack rats living roughly in the western\nhalf of the United States. Most of the human cases occur in the Southwest\n-- New Mexico accounts for more than half--and along the Sierra Nevada in\nCalifornia. There have been human cases reported in at least 13 Western\nstates.\nA roaming cat can bring plague to a suburban living room. Although flea\npowder and other precautions can reduce the risk, and prompt treatment with\nantibiotics can cure it, plague kills about 16% of its human victims,\naccording to the CDC.\nThere were 394 human plague cases in the nation from 1949 through 1997, 63\nof them fatal. New Mexico logged 218 of those, including 30 fatalities,\nsaid Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian with the state Department of\nHealth. \"It's a disease that can be fatal if not recognized and treated\nearly enough,\" Ettestad said.\nBubonic plague, which accounts for 80% of cases, is marked by swollen lymph\nglands, called buboes. It's harder to diagnose septicemic plague, which\ncirculates in the bloodstream, and pneumonic plague, which infects the\nlungs and is particularly dangerous because it can be transmitted through\ncoughing. Generally, those in contact with a pneumonic plague victim are\nalso treated with antibiotics.\n\"In the United States, we actually haven't had person-to-person\ntransmission since the 1920s--not that it couldn't occur,\" said the CDC's\nKen Gage.\nMost people become sick two to seven days after infection. Other symptoms\nare fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.\nThe incidence of plague appears to be cyclical, apparently linked to the\nhigh-moisture, milder winters typical of El Nino years that cause rodents\nto thrive, Ettestad said. This is a big year, with the rodent population in\nNew Mexico estimated at 10 to 20 times higher than last year -- when no one\nin the state caught plague.\nBelieved to have evolved in central Asia, plague is new to the United\nStates. It arrived about 1900 in San Francisco aboard trading ships from\nChina and spread from urban rats into the wild rodent population of the\n[American West. There were outbreaks in ports along the Gulf of Mexico,\nbut it never got established in the native rodents there, according to the\nCDC.\nCats are more susceptible to plague than dogs, and get sicker.\nListlessness and not eating are clues that a cat is ill. \"If you become\nsick and there's a sick cat in the house, go see your doctor,\" [a\nveterinarian advised.\nPlague also can be contracted by handling infected animals.

That is, to view an American\nor Canadian programme taped directly to videotape, I think one will need a TV\nmade for that market. I don't remember if that is also true of the videotape\nmachine. I believe that it is possible to convert between formats, but that\nthis in essence requires making a new tape. Subscribers outside the US or\nCanada may wish to verify this before purchasing videotapes intended for sale\nhere. Perhaps someone with more technical expertise can clarify, as my\nexperience is somewhat dated.\n---\nJohn Gawoski, M.D.\nDepartment of Laboratory Medicine\nLahey Hitchcock Clinic\n41 Mall Road\nBurlington, MA 01805 USA\n617.273.8935\ne-mail: <jgawoski@warren.med.harvard.edu>\n[Absolutely correct. -- Mod CHC]\n................................\n[4]\nDate: Wed, 23 Apr 1997 02:35:25 +1000\nFrom: Ken and Meryl dorey <van@mypostbox.com>\nGood idea!
