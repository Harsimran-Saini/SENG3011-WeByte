Public health officials say there have been 23 confirmed cases of the disease [pertussis], also known as whooping cough, since 1 Jun [2019]. People who caught the disease range in age from 5 months to 15 years.\n\nOfficials say older children, adults, people who've been vaccinated, and those who've had whooping cough before may experience a milder illness but can still spread it to others.\n\nWhooping cough is spread by coughing or sneezing, or coming in direct contact with respiratory secretions of people who are infected, health officials say. The most common symptom is uncontrollable coughing spells often followed by a characteristic \"whoop\" sound. An infected person can spread the disease starting when symptoms begin to 3 weeks after the coughing begins. Coughing frequently lasts for several weeks. County Public Health Director Ginger Hall says pertussis is highly communicable and can be prevented by the vaccine known as Tdap, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Jefferson County, with a population of 116 229 residents in 2010, is on the northeastern border of the U.S. state of New York, adjacent to Lake Ontario and the St. Laurence River; its county seat is Watertown (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_New_York).

The latest CDC data show that from 2017 to 2018, the number of Tdap vaccinations decreased by 1.4%. The number of cases of whooping cough increased to more than 10 cases per 100 000 people.\n\nKnight [a nurse at the Purchase District Health Department] said the lack of vaccines for adults and a false sense of security [are] contributing to this increase. \"If your child was the one that couldn't have the immunization, you would want everyone else around them to have it,\" Knight said. \"And to keep them in mind that you're doing it for your child, because you don't want them to get this disease.\"\n\n[Byline: Abisola Adeyemo]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Kentucky is a state (actually a commonwealth) located in the east south-central region of the United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky).

Children with symptoms should see a doctor. If a doctor diagnoses whooping cough in a school-aged child, parents should let their school know and keep their child at home until they have taken 5 days of antimicrobials.\n\n\"Keep coughing children away from babies. Whooping cough vaccines give good protection against infection, but immunity fades. If your school-aged child has younger siblings, it's a good idea to check they are up-to-date with their vaccines,\" said Greg Bell, acting director, North Coast Public Health Unit. Public health units can provide advice to schools managing whooping cough outbreaks.\n\nSymptoms can start like a cold, followed by a worsening cough that occurs in bouts; this may be followed by vomiting or \"whooping\" breaths.

A spokesperson with Nunavut's Department of Health could not specify the number of cases, but said it was low. The infection is currently confined to Arviat only.\n\nHealth officials are asking Nunavummiut -- especially the parents of babies and young children -- to take note, given that the infection can spread easily.\n\nAdults or children with those symptoms should visit their local health centre right away, health officials said; early diagnosis and treatment of whooping cough are important to making a full recovery.\n\nIf you've ever considered getting vaccinated against pertussis, now's the time: the GN encourages all Nunavummiut to ask community health care staff about getting a free vaccination. Anyone showing signs of the infections should also stay home from school or the workplace, to prevent the spread of the illness.\n\nNunavut's latest outbreak began in May 2016 in Pond Inlet, when 4 cases of whooping cough were first confirmed. Gradually the infection spread to other community members and other communities in the Baffin region. By the fall of 2016, Nunavut's health department had tracked more than 100 cases of pertussis in 11 communities throughout the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.\n\nIt wasn't until April 2017 that the health department declared the outbreak over.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Rogers]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nunavut, with a population of almost 36 000 residents, is the northernmost territory of Canada and is Canada's largest in area and the second least populous of its provinces and territories (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut).

A Tdap booster is suggested for adolescents and adults to protect against whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria. It is recommended that infants receive the DTap immunization at 2, 4 and 6 month. Boosters are recommended at ages 15-18 months and at 4-6 years. Health officials say children should get a single dose of Tdap at 11 to 12 years of age.

A spokesperson with Nunavut's Department of Health could not specify the number of cases, but said it was low. The infection is currently confined to Arviat only.\n\nHealth officials are asking Nunavummiut -- especially the parents of babies and young children -- to take note, given that the infection can spread easily.\n\nAdults or children with those symptoms should visit their local health centre right away, health officials said; early diagnosis and treatment of whooping cough are important to making a full recovery.\n\nIf you've ever considered getting vaccinated against pertussis, now's the time: the GN encourages all Nunavummiut to ask community health care staff about getting a free vaccination. Anyone showing signs of the infections should also stay home from school or the workplace, to prevent the spread of the illness.\n\nNunavut's latest outbreak began in May 2016 in Pond Inlet, when 4 cases of whooping cough were first confirmed. Gradually the infection spread to other community members and other communities in the Baffin region. By the fall of 2016, Nunavut's health department had tracked more than 100 cases of pertussis in 11 communities throughout the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.\n\nIt wasn't until April 2017 that the health department declared the outbreak over.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Rogers]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nunavut, with a population of almost 36 000 residents, is the northernmost territory of Canada and is Canada's largest in area and the second least populous of its provinces and territories (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut).

Bakos advised that parents read the letter carefully and that students continue to keep themselves clean. \"Hand washing, of course, is always so important in schools,\" she said.\n\nDr Kathryn Koliaska, a north zone medical officer with Alberta Health Services, said the levels of whooping cough in Alberta fluctuate year to year and that outbreaks in schools are not uncommon. \"There's obviously large groups of kids together in schools,\" Koliaska said.\n\nThe group most vulnerable to whooping cough is babies, especially during their 1st year of life. Koliaska encouraged parents to immunize their infants and for pregnant women or anyone who spends extended time around newborns to immunize themselves.\n\nWhooping cough symptoms include persistent coughing, gagging and vomiting following coughing and spasms of coughing followed by a \"whoop\" sound.\n\nHowever, Koliaska said going to the doctor is the surest way to diagnose whooping cough. \"It's very hard to tell the difference symptom-wise from a common cold,\" Koliaska said. \"Of course, the test takes a couple of days, so it will also be the conversation at your doctor's office.\"\n\nAs of [28 Sep 2017], the north zone has 83 confirmed cases with Alberta having 744 overall.

A spokesperson with Nunavut's Department of Health could not specify the number of cases, but said it was low. The infection is currently confined to Arviat only.\n\nHealth officials are asking Nunavummiut -- especially the parents of babies and young children -- to take note, given that the infection can spread easily.\n\nAdults or children with those symptoms should visit their local health centre right away, health officials said; early diagnosis and treatment of whooping cough are important to making a full recovery.\n\nIf you've ever considered getting vaccinated against pertussis, now's the time: the GN encourages all Nunavummiut to ask community health care staff about getting a free vaccination. Anyone showing signs of the infections should also stay home from school or the workplace, to prevent the spread of the illness.\n\nNunavut's latest outbreak began in May 2016 in Pond Inlet, when 4 cases of whooping cough were first confirmed. Gradually the infection spread to other community members and other communities in the Baffin region. By the fall of 2016, Nunavut's health department had tracked more than 100 cases of pertussis in 11 communities throughout the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.\n\nIt wasn't until April 2017 that the health department declared the outbreak over.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Rogers]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nunavut, with a population of almost 36 000 residents, is the northernmost territory of Canada and is Canada's largest in area and the second least populous of its provinces and territories (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut).

A Tdap booster is suggested for adolescents and adults to protect against whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria. It is recommended that infants receive the DTap immunization at 2, 4 and 6 month. Boosters are recommended at ages 15-18 months and at 4-6 years. Health officials say children should get a single dose of Tdap at 11 to 12 years of age.

Bakos advised that parents read the letter carefully and that students continue to keep themselves clean. \"Hand washing, of course, is always so important in schools,\" she said.\n\nDr Kathryn Koliaska, a north zone medical officer with Alberta Health Services, said the levels of whooping cough in Alberta fluctuate year to year and that outbreaks in schools are not uncommon. \"There's obviously large groups of kids together in schools,\" Koliaska said.\n\nThe group most vulnerable to whooping cough is babies, especially during their 1st year of life. Koliaska encouraged parents to immunize their infants and for pregnant women or anyone who spends extended time around newborns to immunize themselves.\n\nWhooping cough symptoms include persistent coughing, gagging and vomiting following coughing and spasms of coughing followed by a \"whoop\" sound.\n\nHowever, Koliaska said going to the doctor is the surest way to diagnose whooping cough. \"It's very hard to tell the difference symptom-wise from a common cold,\" Koliaska said. \"Of course, the test takes a couple of days, so it will also be the conversation at your doctor's office.\"\n\nAs of [28 Sep 2017], the north zone has 83 confirmed cases with Alberta having 744 overall.

Anyone showing signs of the infections should also stay home from school or the workplace, to prevent the spread of the illness.\n\nNunavut's latest outbreak began in May 2016 in Pond Inlet, when 4 cases of whooping cough were first confirmed. Gradually the infection spread to other community members and other communities in the Baffin region.

But with the potential for 8 cases in students, KDHE decided this week [week of Sun 22 Apr 2017] to declare an outbreak. Baugher said health department personnel are tracking the cases to find connections among patients and try to find the source.\n\nThe disease was 1st found in a high school student, but most of the recent victims are from middle-school age students at Meadow View Grade School. Baugher said a 4 month old infant [had been] admitted to Labette Health with pertussis. A family member who attends Labette County High School and had been exposed to the disease was in the presence of the infant. The infant was born with respiratory issues and was too young to be fully vaccinated.\n\nTesting continues for suspected cases, but results have been slow to come back. Baugher said her department worked with KDHE, where cultures are tested, and arranged to reduce that delay for those who get the pertussis test at the hospital's lab. Baugher said the tests had been returning in 5 to 6 days. \"If they take a 5-day treatment they're already done with the treatment before we know what caused it,\" Baugher said.

This year [2017] 79 cases of whooping cough were confirmed during the month of April in the Northern NSW Local Health District, according to statistics from the NSW Department of Health. In 2016 this number was 77, in 2015 it was 8, just 3 in 2014 and 4 cases in 2013.\n\nFrom the figures the current spike was no surprise to the North Coast Public Health Unit, which anticipated a threat of the infection, acting director of public health, Greg Bell, said: \"Months April-May hold a real threat but last year [2016] cases dropped off as quickly as they rose,\" Mr Bell said.\n\nThe North Coast Public Health Unit is asking parents to immunize their children against preventable diseases after a spike in cases of the potentially deadly whooping cough disease. Bell said there had been 37 whooping cough notifications on the North Coast in the past week [week of Sun 23 Apr 2017], more than double that in the previous week [week of Sun 16 Apr 2017].\n\nMr Bell said the North Coast experienced a similar spike in whooping cough cases leading into winter last year [2016]. He said persistent low vaccination levels in some parts of Northern NSW was worrying, given that free vaccination is available to all parents. Whooping cough vaccination is valuable in preventing severe infection in infants and toddlers, and if unvaccinated children are infected they are at high risk of severe disease. \"It must be remembered that prior to the NSW Government introducing free antenatal whooping cough vaccinations in 2015, 4 infants had died in the preceding 6 years,\" Mr Bell said. \"All pregnant women are urged to have the free whooping cough vaccine during their 3rd trimester, preferably at 28 weeks, to provide optimal protection to their infants.\"\n\nPositive health interventions, such as vaccination, in the 1st 5 years of a child's life are vitally important in laying the foundation for a healthy and fulfilling life.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Northern Rivers is one of 14 regions of the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW); it is located in the northern portion of NSW, on the border with the state of Queensland to the north and the Pacific Coast to the east; at its most northern point, Northern Rivers is 102 km (63 mi) south east of Brisbane, the Queensland capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers).

This year [2017] 79 cases of whooping cough were confirmed during the month of April in the Northern NSW Local Health District, according to statistics from the NSW Department of Health. In 2016 this number was 77, in 2015 it was 8, just 3 in 2014 and 4 cases in 2013.\n\nFrom the figures the current spike was no surprise to the North Coast Public Health Unit, which anticipated a threat of the infection, acting director of public health, Greg Bell, said: \"Months April-May hold a real threat but last year [2016] cases dropped off as quickly as they rose,\" Mr Bell said.\n\nThe North Coast Public Health Unit is asking parents to immunize their children against preventable diseases after a spike in cases of the potentially deadly whooping cough disease. Bell said there had been 37 whooping cough notifications on the North Coast in the past week [week of Sun 23 Apr 2017], more than double that in the previous week [week of Sun 16 Apr 2017].\n\nMr Bell said the North Coast experienced a similar spike in whooping cough cases leading into winter last year [2016]. He said persistent low vaccination levels in some parts of Northern NSW was worrying, given that free vaccination is available to all parents. Whooping cough vaccination is valuable in preventing severe infection in infants and toddlers, and if unvaccinated children are infected they are at high risk of severe disease. \"It must be remembered that prior to the NSW Government introducing free antenatal whooping cough vaccinations in 2015, 4 infants had died in the preceding 6 years,\" Mr Bell said. \"All pregnant women are urged to have the free whooping cough vaccine during their 3rd trimester, preferably at 28 weeks, to provide optimal protection to their infants.\"\n\nPositive health interventions, such as vaccination, in the 1st 5 years of a child's life are vitally important in laying the foundation for a healthy and fulfilling life.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Northern Rivers is one of 14 regions of the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW); it is located in the northern portion of NSW, on the border with the state of Queensland to the north and the Pacific Coast to the east; at its most northern point, Northern Rivers is 102 km (63 mi) south east of Brisbane, the Queensland capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers).

But with the potential for 8 cases in students, KDHE decided this week [week of Sun 22 Apr 2017] to declare an outbreak. Baugher said health department personnel are tracking the cases to find connections among patients and try to find the source.\n\nThe disease was 1st found in a high school student, but most of the recent victims are from middle-school age students at Meadow View Grade School. Baugher said a 4 month old infant [had been] admitted to Labette Health with pertussis. A family member who attends Labette County High School and had been exposed to the disease was in the presence of the infant. The infant was born with respiratory issues and was too young to be fully vaccinated.\n\nTesting continues for suspected cases, but results have been slow to come back. Baugher said her department worked with KDHE, where cultures are tested, and arranged to reduce that delay for those who get the pertussis test at the hospital's lab. Baugher said the tests had been returning in 5 to 6 days. \"If they take a 5-day treatment they're already done with the treatment before we know what caused it,\" Baugher said. Because of the outbreak, KDHE has agreed to test cultures immediately when the hospital lab calls ahead. \"As soon as they get it they test it, so we have a much shorter turn-around time. So we cut it about in half.\"\n\nBaugher said as soon as the health department is able to connect the cases, KDHE will quit testing.

As of 7 Oct 2016, 323 suspected cases were reported in the locality. The Health Ministry and the WHO are coordinating the response with partners to ensure that daily reporting, proper case management, and effective community mobilisation campaigns take place. A 3-month action plan has been prepared to deal with this outbreak.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its weekly bulletin that the Health Ministry -with WHO support- sent an investigation team to the locality mid-September. The team collected 13 samples that were sent to the National Public Health laboratory for analysis, 4 of which tested positive for [the pertussis bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_].\n\nDoctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res-Spain (MSF-E) initiated case management and a community awareness-raising exercise has been conducted.

The percent of people in North Sudan who are adequately immunized against pertussis is unclear.\n\nNeonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death.

While the numbers of new cases have waned in the past few weeks, health experts say the recurrence of the disease, in general, is puzzling, and urge vaccination.\n\nAccording to the New York State Department of Health, pertussis is a serious lung infection caused by bacteria.

And now there's Tdap [tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis] vaccine, which is a booster for adolescents and adults, and is particularly recommended for those persons who are going to be around infants younger than 2 months, so that you could almost cocoon them against pertussis because they cannot be vaccinated themselves.\"\n\nDr Feinstein agrees and says the fluctuation in annual cases defies easy explanation. \"I think it's very hard to say why the fluctuation in cases occurs. I know there is certainly an effort, a successful effort, to vaccinate, re-vaccinate adults, to give the Tdap vaccine, and to keep the children on tabs,\" Dr Feinstein says. \"It's something that's never been totally wiped out. I think in the last 10 years, there's been waves of it back and forth.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Squires says her department a few weeks ago sent an advisory to area health care providers to be on alert for screening and treatment of pertussis.

As Dutchess County's Director of Communicable Disease Control Linda Squires says, the number then continued to rise.\n\n\"From between [1 Jan 2016] through the current date, we've had a total of 47 confirmed cases of pertussis but, fortunately, we are seeing a decline in the past 2 weeks, with only 5 cases reported since [15 Mar 2016],\" says Squires. While the numbers of new cases have waned in the past few weeks, health experts say the recurrence of the disease, in general, is puzzling, and urge vaccination.\n\nAccording to the New York State Department of Health, pertussis is a serious lung infection caused by bacteria. It is also very contagious and causes coughing fits. \"Well, pertussis incidents sort of wax and wane over time and we do see clusters that are not really explainable,\" says Squires. \"In 2011 we had 100 cases reported, but between 2012 and 2014 we've probably stayed under 20-30 cases each of those years, so it's variable.\"\n\nDr Stuart Feinstein is an infectious disease specialist at Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie and with Health Quest Medical Practice. \"It's just not something that seems to go away. It seems like every time they get it snuffed out, it's popping up somewhere,\" says Dr Feinstein. \"It's been unusual.\"\n\nSquires underscores the importance of vaccinating against pertussis. \"Vaccinations are extremely important in reducing the risk and the severity of pertussis,\" says Squires. \"The recommendations begin at 2 months of age. And now there's Tdap [tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis] vaccine, which is a booster for adolescents and adults, and is particularly recommended for those persons who are going to be around infants younger than 2 months, so that you could almost cocoon them against pertussis because they cannot be vaccinated themselves.\"\n\nDr Feinstein agrees and says the fluctuation in annual cases defies easy explanation. \"I think it's very hard to say why the fluctuation in cases occurs. I know there is certainly an effort, a successful effort, to vaccinate, re-vaccinate adults, to give the Tdap vaccine, and to keep the children on tabs,\" Dr Feinstein says. \"It's something that's never been totally wiped out. I think in the last 10 years, there's been waves of it back and forth.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Squires says her department a few weeks ago sent an advisory to area health care providers to be on alert for screening and treatment of pertussis. She says the cases in Dutchess County were reported as far south as Beacon and as far north as the Rhinebeck/Red Hook area.

The report Mortality and morbidity of pertussis in children and young people in New Zealand: Special Report 2002-2014, was released today by the Child and Youth Mortality Review Committee (CYMRC). It shows rates of whooping cough (also known as pertussis) in New Zealand using data from 2002-2014, for children and young people under the age of 25.\n\nPertussis is a contagious disease, characterised by long coughing episodes. It can be very serious and in some cases fatal. Nearly 13 000 cases of whooping cough were recorded, an average of 992 cases per year, including 8 deaths. 7 deaths were in infants under 3 months old. There were 1515 hospital admissions and more than 75 percent were for infants under 6 months old.\n\nDr Felicity Dumble, CYMRC chair, says that among the easiest and safest ways to prevent or reduce the severity of the illness is to immunize mothers during pregnancy. \"All pregnant women should receive a booster shot in their 3rd trimester and should be given information by their GP or lead maternity carer about where and how to get one. Many women don't know a booster shot is required,\" says Dr Dumble.\n\nImmunization during pregnancy is safe for mothers and babies and is now funded during the 3rd trimester.\n\n\"GPs and midwives play an important part in education about whooping cough, so it is crucial they take the lead in informing pregnant women about the need for immunization.\"\n\nThe Committee endorses the work the Ministry of Health is doing in this area, including the release of new 'let's talk about immunisation' resources and a focus on whooping cough and influenza immunisation during 2016's National Immunisation Week.\n\nThe report also makes a number of other recommendations to reduce the rates and impact of whooping cough.\n\nRecommendations include:\n- giving pregnant women whooping cough booster shots should be a quality improvement measure or target for DHBs [district health boards]\n- booster shots given to pregnant women should be captured in the National Immunization Register and recorded as part of a baby's immunization record\n- the Ministry of Health should develop education resources for pregnant women, lead maternity carers and other health care providers on the benefits of immunization against whooping cough during pregnancy (work on this is already underway)\n- DHB-funded community antenatal education classes should include information about the need for a whooping cough booster shot in the 3rd trimester\n- when confirming a woman is pregnant, their GP or other provider should put in place a plan to ensure they are recalled for a pertussis booster shot in their 3rd trimester\n- a national system should be developed that enables general practices, lead maternity carers and other immunization providers to communicate with each other on whooping cough booster shots given to pregnant women\n- lead maternity carers and other health care providers should ensure pregnant women are aware that they need a whooping cough booster in their 3rd trimester and they know where to go to get it\n- pregnant women should be offered whooping cough booster shots in a wide range of settings, including general practice, secondary care and outreach community settings, to reduce access barriers for hard-to-reach groups.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The full commission report can be found at http://www.hqsc.govt.nz/assets/CYMRC/Publications/pertussis-special-report-Dec-2015.pdf.\n\nNeonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe, with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea (breathing arrest), with seizures induced by hypoxia (low oxygen) usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis -- particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 -- and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs of mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital, and accounted for most of the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.\n\nA 2014 publication confirms the safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes.

The report Mortality and morbidity of pertussis in children and young people in New Zealand: Special Report 2002-2014, was released today by the Child and Youth Mortality Review Committee (CYMRC). It shows rates of whooping cough (also known as pertussis) in New Zealand using data from 2002-2014, for children and young people under the age of 25.\n\nPertussis is a contagious disease, characterised by long coughing episodes. It can be very serious and in some cases fatal. Nearly 13 000 cases of whooping cough were recorded, an average of 992 cases per year, including 8 deaths. 7 deaths were in infants under 3 months old. There were 1515 hospital admissions and more than 75 percent were for infants under 6 months old.\n\nDr Felicity Dumble, CYMRC chair, says that among the easiest and safest ways to prevent or reduce the severity of the illness is to immunize mothers during pregnancy. \"All pregnant women should receive a booster shot in their 3rd trimester and should be given information by their GP or lead maternity carer about where and how to get one. Many women don't know a booster shot is required,\" says Dr Dumble.\n\nImmunization during pregnancy is safe for mothers and babies and is now funded during the 3rd trimester.\n\n\"GPs and midwives play an important part in education about whooping cough, so it is crucial they take the lead in informing pregnant women about the need for immunization.\"\n\nThe Committee endorses the work the Ministry of Health is doing in this area, including the release of new 'let's talk about immunisation' resources and a focus on whooping cough and influenza immunisation during 2016's National Immunisation Week.\n\nThe report also makes a number of other recommendations to reduce the rates and impact of whooping cough.\n\nRecommendations include:\n- giving pregnant women whooping cough booster shots should be a quality improvement measure or target for DHBs [district health boards]\n- booster shots given to pregnant women should be captured in the National Immunization Register and recorded as part of a baby's immunization record\n- the Ministry of Health should develop education resources for pregnant women, lead maternity carers and other health care providers on the benefits of immunization against whooping cough during pregnancy (work on this is already underway)\n- DHB-funded community antenatal education classes should include information about the need for a whooping cough booster shot in the 3rd trimester\n- when confirming a woman is pregnant, their GP or other provider should put in place a plan to ensure they are recalled for a pertussis booster shot in their 3rd trimester\n- a national system should be developed that enables general practices, lead maternity carers and other immunization providers to communicate with each other on whooping cough booster shots given to pregnant women\n- lead maternity carers and other health care providers should ensure pregnant women are aware that they need a whooping cough booster in their 3rd trimester and they know where to go to get it\n- pregnant women should be offered whooping cough booster shots in a wide range of settings, including general practice, secondary care and outreach community settings, to reduce access barriers for hard-to-reach groups.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The full commission report can be found at http://www.hqsc.govt.nz/assets/CYMRC/Publications/pertussis-special-report-Dec-2015.pdf.\n\nNeonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe, with as much as a 3 percent risk of death.

The report Mortality and morbidity of pertussis in children and young people in New Zealand: Special Report 2002-2014, was released today by the Child and Youth Mortality Review Committee (CYMRC). It shows rates of whooping cough (also known as pertussis) in New Zealand using data from 2002-2014, for children and young people under the age of 25.\n\nPertussis is a contagious disease, characterised by long coughing episodes. It can be very serious and in some cases fatal. Nearly 13 000 cases of whooping cough were recorded, an average of 992 cases per year, including 8 deaths. 7 deaths were in infants under 3 months old. There were 1515 hospital admissions and more than 75 percent were for infants under 6 months old.\n\nDr Felicity Dumble, CYMRC chair, says that among the easiest and safest ways to prevent or reduce the severity of the illness is to immunize mothers during pregnancy. \"All pregnant women should receive a booster shot in their 3rd trimester and should be given information by their GP or lead maternity carer about where and how to get one. Many women don't know a booster shot is required,\" says Dr Dumble.\n\nImmunization during pregnancy is safe for mothers and babies and is now funded during the 3rd trimester.\n\n\"GPs and midwives play an important part in education about whooping cough, so it is crucial they take the lead in informing pregnant women about the need for immunization.\"\n\nThe Committee endorses the work the Ministry of Health is doing in this area, including the release of new 'let's talk about immunisation' resources and a focus on whooping cough and influenza immunisation during 2016's National Immunisation Week.\n\nThe report also makes a number of other recommendations to reduce the rates and impact of whooping cough.\n\nRecommendations include:\n- giving pregnant women whooping cough booster shots should be a quality improvement measure or target for DHBs [district health boards]\n- booster shots given to pregnant women should be captured in the National Immunization Register and recorded as part of a baby's immunization record\n- the Ministry of Health should develop education resources for pregnant women, lead maternity carers and other health care providers on the benefits of immunization against whooping cough during pregnancy (work on this is already underway)\n- DHB-funded community antenatal education classes should include information about the need for a whooping cough booster shot in the 3rd trimester\n- when confirming a woman is pregnant, their GP or other provider should put in place a plan to ensure they are recalled for a pertussis booster shot in their 3rd trimester\n- a national system should be developed that enables general practices, lead maternity carers and other immunization providers to communicate with each other on whooping cough booster shots given to pregnant women\n- lead maternity carers and other health care providers should ensure pregnant women are aware that they need a whooping cough booster in their 3rd trimester and they know where to go to get it\n- pregnant women should be offered whooping cough booster shots in a wide range of settings, including general practice, secondary care and outreach community settings, to reduce access barriers for hard-to-reach groups.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The full commission report can be found at http://www.hqsc.govt.nz/assets/CYMRC/Publications/pertussis-special-report-Dec-2015.pdf.\n\nNeonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe, with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea (breathing arrest), with seizures induced by hypoxia (low oxygen) usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized.

The last new case the agency began investigating was Friday [24 Jul 2015], Baldetti said. An outbreak is not considered contained until 2 full cycles of the disease -- a cycle is 21 days -- pass without a new case. At this point, that would be 4 Sep [2015].\n\n\"I'm not confident to say we won't get any more,\" Baldetti said. \"It seems we get one to 3 new cases a day. It just seems like it builds up. We don't have any for several days, and then we get 3 or 4.\"\n\nWhooping cough is a contagious respiratory disease caused by _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria. Initial symptoms include runny nose, sneezing and a mild cough, which may seem like a typical cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Usually, the cough slowly becomes more severe, and eventually the patient may experience bouts of rapid, violent coughing followed by the \"whooping\" sound that gives the disease its common name when trying to take a breath. The disease can cause serious and sometimes life-threatening complications, permanent disability, and even death, especially in infants and young children.\n\nAs of Friday [24 Jul 2015], the Kansas Department of Health and Environment listed Reno County with 41 confirmed or probable cases of pertussis, accounting for 20 percent of all cases in the state. That was up from 18 on Jun 29 [2015]. The state figures showed additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno -- Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick -- as well as in 2 other counties in the region.\n\nThe Reno County Health Department is actively working with area school districts to be prepared, \"but we can't put the onus on schools to get out in front of it. We hope to have (vaccination) clinics for Buhler, Haven and Nickerson [3 of the 7 Reno County school districts],\" Baldetti said. \"(USD) 308 [Unified School District 308, also called Hutchinson] has committed to not allow anyone to enroll without the vaccination or an acceptance form.\"\n\nWhile the pertussis vaccine offers \"90 percent protection\" from the disease, new research shows antibodies decline in 2-5 years. That has health officials advising anyone who has regular contact with children, particularly infants, or immune compromised adults, to get a Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acelluar pertussis) booster. The health department has at least 450 doses of vaccine and is offering the shots free.\n\n\"It's really important for people to be proactive and be on guard for symptoms,\" Baldetti said. \"Anyone suspected of being sick needs [to be] checked immediately. We cannot let cold symptoms be unchecked. It's too widespread now; it's better to be safe than sorry.\" They are particularly focusing on families with school age children, school staff who work with children, and daycare providers.\n\n\"There's serious concern for a potential exponential spread through our schools,\" Baldetti said. \"When they get back to school, it will be concentrated, so we want to focus on that group.\" Active cases, however, range from infants to high school to adults \"and everywhere in between,\" he said. \"We're not isolating our effort to elementary, middle or high school, but all levels of education, daycare providers, churches and businesses. This is truly a widespread outbreak. And it is truly on us, as a community, to ensure we are protecting those in our community that cannot protect themselves. If your children have been vaccinated, but it has been more years than you can count on one hand, I encourage you to see your local provider and ask for a Tdap booster,\" he said. \"It's not a bad idea for parents or even grandparents to check and see if they're outside that window.\"\n\n[Byline: John Green]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Kansas, with a population of 2 904 021 in 2014, is a state located in the Midwestern United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kansas). A map of Kansas counties is available at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/kansas.shtml.\n\nThe news article above reports increasing numbers of cases of pertussis in Reno County, with a population of 64 511 in 2011, which is located in the south-central part of Kansas, and also reports additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno (Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick Counties) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_County,_Kansas#Education). Last month [June 2015], ProMED-mail also reported cases of pertussis this year (2015) in nearby Barton County, Kansas (Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509).\n\nThe following is extracted from the moderator comments in ProMED post Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509:\n\nIn the U.S., DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case \"d\" and \"p\" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The \"a\" in DTaP and Tdap stands for \"acellular,\" meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\n\nDTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.\n\nPertussis is nationally notifiable to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html). Following the introduction of pertussis vaccines in the 1940s when case counts frequently exceeded 100 000 cases per year, case counts declined dramatically to fewer than 10 000 by 1965. During the 1980s the incidence of pertussis began increasing gradually, and peaked in 2012 at 48 277 cases of pertussis (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/images/incidence-graph.jpg). This was the most reported cases since 1955. Pertussis again declined during 2013 and by 2014, more than 28 000 cases were reported nationwide.\n\nBecause infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination. In 2014, over 10 percent of cases occurred in children under 6 months of age and the incidence rate of pertussis among infants in this age group (about 150 cases per 100 000) exceeded that of all other age groups (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf).

The last new case the agency began investigating was Friday [24 Jul 2015], Baldetti said. An outbreak is not considered contained until 2 full cycles of the disease -- a cycle is 21 days -- pass without a new case. At this point, that would be 4 Sep [2015].\n\n\"I'm not confident to say we won't get any more,\" Baldetti said. \"It seems we get one to 3 new cases a day. It just seems like it builds up. We don't have any for several days, and then we get 3 or 4.\"\n\nWhooping cough is a contagious respiratory disease caused by _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria. Initial symptoms include runny nose, sneezing and a mild cough, which may seem like a typical cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Usually, the cough slowly becomes more severe, and eventually the patient may experience bouts of rapid, violent coughing followed by the \"whooping\" sound that gives the disease its common name when trying to take a breath. The disease can cause serious and sometimes life-threatening complications, permanent disability, and even death, especially in infants and young children.\n\nAs of Friday [24 Jul 2015], the Kansas Department of Health and Environment listed Reno County with 41 confirmed or probable cases of pertussis, accounting for 20 percent of all cases in the state. That was up from 18 on Jun 29 [2015]. The state figures showed additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno -- Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick -- as well as in 2 other counties in the region.\n\nThe Reno County Health Department is actively working with area school districts to be prepared, \"but we can't put the onus on schools to get out in front of it. We hope to have (vaccination) clinics for Buhler, Haven and Nickerson [3 of the 7 Reno County school districts],\" Baldetti said. \"(USD) 308 [Unified School District 308, also called Hutchinson] has committed to not allow anyone to enroll without the vaccination or an acceptance form.\"\n\nWhile the pertussis vaccine offers \"90 percent protection\" from the disease, new research shows antibodies decline in 2-5 years. That has health officials advising anyone who has regular contact with children, particularly infants, or immune compromised adults, to get a Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acelluar pertussis) booster. The health department has at least 450 doses of vaccine and is offering the shots free.\n\n\"It's really important for people to be proactive and be on guard for symptoms,\" Baldetti said. \"Anyone suspected of being sick needs [to be] checked immediately. We cannot let cold symptoms be unchecked. It's too widespread now; it's better to be safe than sorry.\" They are particularly focusing on families with school age children, school staff who work with children, and daycare providers.\n\n\"There's serious concern for a potential exponential spread through our schools,\" Baldetti said. \"When they get back to school, it will be concentrated, so we want to focus on that group.\" Active cases, however, range from infants to high school to adults \"and everywhere in between,\" he said. \"We're not isolating our effort to elementary, middle or high school, but all levels of education, daycare providers, churches and businesses. This is truly a widespread outbreak. And it is truly on us, as a community, to ensure we are protecting those in our community that cannot protect themselves. If your children have been vaccinated, but it has been more years than you can count on one hand, I encourage you to see your local provider and ask for a Tdap booster,\" he said. \"It's not a bad idea for parents or even grandparents to check and see if they're outside that window.\"\n\n[Byline: John Green]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Kansas, with a population of 2 904 021 in 2014, is a state located in the Midwestern United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kansas). A map of Kansas counties is available at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/kansas.shtml.\n\nThe news article above reports increasing numbers of cases of pertussis in Reno County, with a population of 64 511 in 2011, which is located in the south-central part of Kansas, and also reports additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno (Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick Counties) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_County,_Kansas#Education). Last month [June 2015], ProMED-mail also reported cases of pertussis this year (2015) in nearby Barton County, Kansas (Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509).\n\nThe following is extracted from the moderator comments in ProMED post Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509:\n\nIn the U.S., DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case \"d\" and \"p\" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The \"a\" in DTaP and Tdap stands for \"acellular,\" meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\n\nDTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.\n\nPertussis is nationally notifiable to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html). Following the introduction of pertussis vaccines in the 1940s when case counts frequently exceeded 100 000 cases per year, case counts declined dramatically to fewer than 10 000 by 1965.

Most deaths from pertussis occur in infants less than 3 months old. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/219.]\nSee Also\nPertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509\nPertussis - USA (09) 20150425.3320344\nPertussis - USA (08): (NC) 20150418.3305675\nPertussis - USA (07) 20150412.3292930\nPertussis - USA (06): (CA) infant fatality 20150314.3230176\nPertussis - USA (05): (OR) 20150314.3229781\nPertussis - USA (04) 20150205.3141284\nPertussis - USA (03): (MD) health care worker presenteeism, 2014 20150123.3111598\nPertussis - USA (02) 20150116.3094367\nPertussis - USA: (CA) fatal 20150115.3093551\n2014\n----\nPertussis - USA (30) 20141228.3058832\nPertussis - USA (29) 20141222.3044440\nPertussis - USA (27): (MI) undervaccination 20141211.3027769\nPertussis - USA (26) 20141211.3024716\nPertussis - USA (25): (CA) 20141205.3012191\nPertussis - USA (24) 20141121.2979932\nPertussis - USA (23) 20141116.2947034\nPertussis - USA (22) 20141105.2922903\nPertussis - USA (21): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20141015.2864604\nPertussis - USA (20): (CO) increasing incidence 20141005.2833302\nPertussis - USA (19): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140921.2792202\nPertussis - USA (18): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140815.2692228\nPertussis - USA (16): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140809.2675224\nPertussis - USA (14): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140720.2623332\nPertussis - USA (13) 20140713.2603059\nPertussis - USA (12): (CA) 20140629.2572898\n.................................................sb/ml/msp/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "pertussis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2070-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-06-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "1965-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "1955-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the Midwestern United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tdap", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=kansa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kansas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Barton County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Reno County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Reno County 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nickerson", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3632579", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Pertussis - Spain", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3632579", "date": "2015-07-26 20:07:30", "main_text": "PERTUSSIS - USA (11): (KANSAS), UPDATE\n**************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 25 Jul 2015\nSource: The Hutchinson News [edited]\nhttp://www.hutchnews.com/news/local_state_news/whooping-cough-outbreak-won-t-give-up/article_be45552e-7d31-5647-b2e0-1f76fa58365f.html\n\n\nReno County's whooping cough outbreak continues, local health officials said, with the number of suspected pertussis cases now topping 70.\n\nThe persistent nature of the outbreak has health officials concerned that it won't be contained before school starts back up, creating fear of a potential \"micro-outbreak,\" said Health Department Director Nick Baldetti. The last new case the agency began investigating was Friday [24 Jul 2015], Baldetti said. An outbreak is not considered contained until 2 full cycles of the disease -- a cycle is 21 days -- pass without a new case. At this point, that would be 4 Sep [2015].\n\n\"I'm not confident to say we won't get any more,\" Baldetti said. \"It seems we get one to 3 new cases a day. It just seems like it builds up. We don't have any for several days, and then we get 3 or 4.\"\n\nWhooping cough is a contagious respiratory disease caused by _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria. Initial symptoms include runny nose, sneezing and a mild cough, which may seem like a typical cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Usually, the cough slowly becomes more severe, and eventually the patient may experience bouts of rapid, violent coughing followed by the \"whooping\" sound that gives the disease its common name when trying to take a breath. The disease can cause serious and sometimes life-threatening complications, permanent disability, and even death, especially in infants and young children.\n\nAs of Friday [24 Jul 2015], the Kansas Department of Health and Environment listed Reno County with 41 confirmed or probable cases of pertussis, accounting for 20 percent of all cases in the state. That was up from 18 on Jun 29 [2015]. The state figures showed additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno -- Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick -- as well as in 2 other counties in the region.\n\nThe Reno County Health Department is actively working with area school districts to be prepared, \"but we can't put the onus on schools to get out in front of it. We hope to have (vaccination) clinics for Buhler, Haven and Nickerson [3 of the 7 Reno County school districts],\" Baldetti said. \"(USD) 308 [Unified School District 308, also called Hutchinson] has committed to not allow anyone to enroll without the vaccination or an acceptance form.\"\n\nWhile the pertussis vaccine offers \"90 percent protection\" from the disease, new research shows antibodies decline in 2-5 years. That has health officials advising anyone who has regular contact with children, particularly infants, or immune compromised adults, to get a Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acelluar pertussis) booster. The health department has at least 450 doses of vaccine and is offering the shots free.\n\n\"It's really important for people to be proactive and be on guard for symptoms,\" Baldetti said. \"Anyone suspected of being sick needs [to be] checked immediately. We cannot let cold symptoms be unchecked. It's too widespread now; it's better to be safe than sorry.\" They are particularly focusing on families with school age children, school staff who work with children, and daycare providers.\n\n\"There's serious concern for a potential exponential spread through our schools,\" Baldetti said. \"When they get back to school, it will be concentrated, so we want to focus on that group.\" Active cases, however, range from infants to high school to adults \"and everywhere in between,\" he said. \"We're not isolating our effort to elementary, middle or high school, but all levels of education, daycare providers, churches and businesses. This is truly a widespread outbreak. And it is truly on us, as a community, to ensure we are protecting those in our community that cannot protect themselves. If your children have been vaccinated, but it has been more years than you can count on one hand, I encourage you to see your local provider and ask for a Tdap booster,\" he said. \"It's not a bad idea for parents or even grandparents to check and see if they're outside that window.\"\n\n[Byline: John Green]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Kansas, with a population of 2 904 021 in 2014, is a state located in the Midwestern United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kansas). A map of Kansas counties is available at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/kansas.shtml.\n\nThe news article above reports increasing numbers of cases of pertussis in Reno County, with a population of 64 511 in 2011, which is located in the south-central part of Kansas, and also reports additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno (Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick Counties) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_County,_Kansas#Education). Last month [June 2015], ProMED-mail also reported cases of pertussis this year (2015) in nearby Barton County, Kansas (Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509).\n\nThe following is extracted from the moderator comments in ProMED post Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509:\n\nIn the U.S., DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case \"d\" and \"p\" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The \"a\" in DTaP and Tdap stands for \"acellular,\" meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\n\nDTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.\n\nPertussis is nationally notifiable to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html). Following the introduction of pertussis vaccines in the 1940s when case counts frequently exceeded 100 000 cases per year, case counts declined dramatically to fewer than 10 000 by 1965. During the 1980s the incidence of pertussis began increasing gradually, and peaked in 2012 at 48 277 cases of pertussis (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/images/incidence-graph.jpg). This was the most reported cases since 1955.

Most deaths from pertussis occur in infants less than 3 months old. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/219.]\nSee Also\nPertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509\nPertussis - USA (09) 20150425.3320344\nPertussis - USA (08): (NC) 20150418.3305675\nPertussis - USA (07) 20150412.3292930\nPertussis - USA (06): (CA) infant fatality 20150314.3230176\nPertussis - USA (05): (OR) 20150314.3229781\nPertussis - USA (04) 20150205.3141284\nPertussis - USA (03): (MD) health care worker presenteeism, 2014 20150123.3111598\nPertussis - USA (02) 20150116.3094367\nPertussis - USA: (CA) fatal 20150115.3093551\n2014\n----\nPertussis - USA (30) 20141228.3058832\nPertussis - USA (29) 20141222.3044440\nPertussis - USA (27): (MI) undervaccination 20141211.3027769\nPertussis - USA (26) 20141211.3024716\nPertussis - USA (25): (CA) 20141205.3012191\nPertussis - USA (24) 20141121.2979932\nPertussis - USA (23) 20141116.2947034\nPertussis - USA (22) 20141105.2922903\nPertussis - USA (21): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20141015.2864604\nPertussis - USA (20): (CO) increasing incidence 20141005.2833302\nPertussis - USA (19): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140921.2792202\nPertussis - USA (18): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140815.2692228\nPertussis - USA (16): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140809.2675224\nPertussis - USA (14): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140720.2623332\nPertussis - USA (13) 20140713.2603059\nPertussis - USA (12): (CA) 20140629.2572898\n.................................................sb/ml/msp/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "pertussis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2070-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-06-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "1965-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "1955-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the Midwestern United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tdap", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=kansa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kansas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Barton County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Reno County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Reno County 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nickerson", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3617491", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Pertussis - USA (12): (AZ)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3617491", "date": "2015-07-26 20:07:30", "main_text": "PERTUSSIS - USA (11): (KANSAS), UPDATE\n**************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 25 Jul 2015\nSource: The Hutchinson News [edited]\nhttp://www.hutchnews.com/news/local_state_news/whooping-cough-outbreak-won-t-give-up/article_be45552e-7d31-5647-b2e0-1f76fa58365f.html\n\n\nReno County's whooping cough outbreak continues, local health officials said, with the number of suspected pertussis cases now topping 70.\n\nThe persistent nature of the outbreak has health officials concerned that it won't be contained before school starts back up, creating fear of a potential \"micro-outbreak,\" said Health Department Director Nick Baldetti. The last new case the agency began investigating was Friday [24 Jul 2015], Baldetti said. An outbreak is not considered contained until 2 full cycles of the disease -- a cycle is 21 days -- pass without a new case. At this point, that would be 4 Sep [2015].\n\n\"I'm not confident to say we won't get any more,\" Baldetti said. \"It seems we get one to 3 new cases a day. It just seems like it builds up. We don't have any for several days, and then we get 3 or 4.\"\n\nWhooping cough is a contagious respiratory disease caused by _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria. Initial symptoms include runny nose, sneezing and a mild cough, which may seem like a typical cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Usually, the cough slowly becomes more severe, and eventually the patient may experience bouts of rapid, violent coughing followed by the \"whooping\" sound that gives the disease its common name when trying to take a breath. The disease can cause serious and sometimes life-threatening complications, permanent disability, and even death, especially in infants and young children.\n\nAs of Friday [24 Jul 2015], the Kansas Department of Health and Environment listed Reno County with 41 confirmed or probable cases of pertussis, accounting for 20 percent of all cases in the state. That was up from 18 on Jun 29 [2015]. The state figures showed additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno -- Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick -- as well as in 2 other counties in the region.\n\nThe Reno County Health Department is actively working with area school districts to be prepared, \"but we can't put the onus on schools to get out in front of it. We hope to have (vaccination) clinics for Buhler, Haven and Nickerson [3 of the 7 Reno County school districts],\" Baldetti said. \"(USD) 308 [Unified School District 308, also called Hutchinson] has committed to not allow anyone to enroll without the vaccination or an acceptance form.\"\n\nWhile the pertussis vaccine offers \"90 percent protection\" from the disease, new research shows antibodies decline in 2-5 years. That has health officials advising anyone who has regular contact with children, particularly infants, or immune compromised adults, to get a Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acelluar pertussis) booster. The health department has at least 450 doses of vaccine and is offering the shots free.\n\n\"It's really important for people to be proactive and be on guard for symptoms,\" Baldetti said. \"Anyone suspected of being sick needs [to be] checked immediately. We cannot let cold symptoms be unchecked. It's too widespread now; it's better to be safe than sorry.\" They are particularly focusing on families with school age children, school staff who work with children, and daycare providers.\n\n\"There's serious concern for a potential exponential spread through our schools,\" Baldetti said. \"When they get back to school, it will be concentrated, so we want to focus on that group.\" Active cases, however, range from infants to high school to adults \"and everywhere in between,\" he said. \"We're not isolating our effort to elementary, middle or high school, but all levels of education, daycare providers, churches and businesses. This is truly a widespread outbreak. And it is truly on us, as a community, to ensure we are protecting those in our community that cannot protect themselves. If your children have been vaccinated, but it has been more years than you can count on one hand, I encourage you to see your local provider and ask for a Tdap booster,\" he said. \"It's not a bad idea for parents or even grandparents to check and see if they're outside that window.\"\n\n[Byline: John Green]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Kansas, with a population of 2 904 021 in 2014, is a state located in the Midwestern United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kansas). A map of Kansas counties is available at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/kansas.shtml.\n\nThe news article above reports increasing numbers of cases of pertussis in Reno County, with a population of 64 511 in 2011, which is located in the south-central part of Kansas, and also reports additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno (Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick Counties) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_County,_Kansas#Education). Last month [June 2015], ProMED-mail also reported cases of pertussis this year (2015) in nearby Barton County, Kansas (Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509).\n\nThe following is extracted from the moderator comments in ProMED post Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509:\n\nIn the U.S., DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case \"d\" and \"p\" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The \"a\" in DTaP and Tdap stands for \"acellular,\" meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\n\nDTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.\n\nPertussis is nationally notifiable to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html). Following the introduction of pertussis vaccines in the 1940s when case counts frequently exceeded 100 000 cases per year, case counts declined dramatically to fewer than 10 000 by 1965.

Most deaths from pertussis occur in infants less than 3 months old. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/219.]\nSee Also\nPertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509\nPertussis - USA (09) 20150425.3320344\nPertussis - USA (08): (NC) 20150418.3305675\nPertussis - USA (07) 20150412.3292930\nPertussis - USA (06): (CA) infant fatality 20150314.3230176\nPertussis - USA (05): (OR) 20150314.3229781\nPertussis - USA (04) 20150205.3141284\nPertussis - USA (03): (MD) health care worker presenteeism, 2014 20150123.3111598\nPertussis - USA (02) 20150116.3094367\nPertussis - USA: (CA) fatal 20150115.3093551\n2014\n----\nPertussis - USA (30) 20141228.3058832\nPertussis - USA (29) 20141222.3044440\nPertussis - USA (27): (MI) undervaccination 20141211.3027769\nPertussis - USA (26) 20141211.3024716\nPertussis - USA (25): (CA) 20141205.3012191\nPertussis - USA (24) 20141121.2979932\nPertussis - USA (23) 20141116.2947034\nPertussis - USA (22) 20141105.2922903\nPertussis - USA (21): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20141015.2864604\nPertussis - USA (20): (CO) increasing incidence 20141005.2833302\nPertussis - USA (19): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140921.2792202\nPertussis - USA (18): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140815.2692228\nPertussis - USA (16): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140809.2675224\nPertussis - USA (14): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140720.2623332\nPertussis - USA (13) 20140713.2603059\nPertussis - USA (12): (CA) 20140629.2572898\n.................................................sb/ml/msp/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "pertussis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2070-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-06-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "1965-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "1955-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the Midwestern United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tdap", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=kansa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kansas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Barton County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Reno County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Reno County 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nickerson", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3537082", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Pertussis - USA (11): (KS) update", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3537082", "date": "2015-07-26 20:07:30", "main_text": "PERTUSSIS - USA (11): (KANSAS), UPDATE\n**************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 25 Jul 2015\nSource: The Hutchinson News [edited]\nhttp://www.hutchnews.com/news/local_state_news/whooping-cough-outbreak-won-t-give-up/article_be45552e-7d31-5647-b2e0-1f76fa58365f.html\n\n\nReno County's whooping cough outbreak continues, local health officials said, with the number of suspected pertussis cases now topping 70.\n\nThe persistent nature of the outbreak has health officials concerned that it won't be contained before school starts back up, creating fear of a potential \"micro-outbreak,\" said Health Department Director Nick Baldetti. The last new case the agency began investigating was Friday [24 Jul 2015], Baldetti said. An outbreak is not considered contained until 2 full cycles of the disease -- a cycle is 21 days -- pass without a new case. At this point, that would be 4 Sep [2015].\n\n\"I'm not confident to say we won't get any more,\" Baldetti said. \"It seems we get one to 3 new cases a day. It just seems like it builds up. We don't have any for several days, and then we get 3 or 4.\"\n\nWhooping cough is a contagious respiratory disease caused by _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria. Initial symptoms include runny nose, sneezing and a mild cough, which may seem like a typical cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Usually, the cough slowly becomes more severe, and eventually the patient may experience bouts of rapid, violent coughing followed by the \"whooping\" sound that gives the disease its common name when trying to take a breath. The disease can cause serious and sometimes life-threatening complications, permanent disability, and even death, especially in infants and young children.\n\nAs of Friday [24 Jul 2015], the Kansas Department of Health and Environment listed Reno County with 41 confirmed or probable cases of pertussis, accounting for 20 percent of all cases in the state. That was up from 18 on Jun 29 [2015]. The state figures showed additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno -- Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick -- as well as in 2 other counties in the region.\n\nThe Reno County Health Department is actively working with area school districts to be prepared, \"but we can't put the onus on schools to get out in front of it. We hope to have (vaccination) clinics for Buhler, Haven and Nickerson [3 of the 7 Reno County school districts],\" Baldetti said. \"(USD) 308 [Unified School District 308, also called Hutchinson] has committed to not allow anyone to enroll without the vaccination or an acceptance form.\"\n\nWhile the pertussis vaccine offers \"90 percent protection\" from the disease, new research shows antibodies decline in 2-5 years. That has health officials advising anyone who has regular contact with children, particularly infants, or immune compromised adults, to get a Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acelluar pertussis) booster. The health department has at least 450 doses of vaccine and is offering the shots free.\n\n\"It's really important for people to be proactive and be on guard for symptoms,\" Baldetti said. \"Anyone suspected of being sick needs [to be] checked immediately. We cannot let cold symptoms be unchecked. It's too widespread now; it's better to be safe than sorry.\" They are particularly focusing on families with school age children, school staff who work with children, and daycare providers.\n\n\"There's serious concern for a potential exponential spread through our schools,\" Baldetti said. \"When they get back to school, it will be concentrated, so we want to focus on that group.\" Active cases, however, range from infants to high school to adults \"and everywhere in between,\" he said. \"We're not isolating our effort to elementary, middle or high school, but all levels of education, daycare providers, churches and businesses. This is truly a widespread outbreak. And it is truly on us, as a community, to ensure we are protecting those in our community that cannot protect themselves. If your children have been vaccinated, but it has been more years than you can count on one hand, I encourage you to see your local provider and ask for a Tdap booster,\" he said. \"It's not a bad idea for parents or even grandparents to check and see if they're outside that window.\"\n\n[Byline: John Green]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Kansas, with a population of 2 904 021 in 2014, is a state located in the Midwestern United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kansas). A map of Kansas counties is available at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/kansas.shtml.\n\nThe news article above reports increasing numbers of cases of pertussis in Reno County, with a population of 64 511 in 2011, which is located in the south-central part of Kansas, and also reports additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno (Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick Counties) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_County,_Kansas#Education). Last month [June 2015], ProMED-mail also reported cases of pertussis this year (2015) in nearby Barton County, Kansas (Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509).\n\nThe following is extracted from the moderator comments in ProMED post Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509:\n\nIn the U.S., DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case \"d\" and \"p\" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The \"a\" in DTaP and Tdap stands for \"acellular,\" meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\n\nDTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.\n\nPertussis is nationally notifiable to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html). Following the introduction of pertussis vaccines in the 1940s when case counts frequently exceeded 100 000 cases per year, case counts declined dramatically to fewer than 10 000 by 1965. During the 1980s the incidence of pertussis began increasing gradually, and peaked in 2012 at 48 277 cases of pertussis (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/images/incidence-graph.jpg). This was the most reported cases since 1955. Pertussis again declined during 2013 and by 2014, more than 28 000 cases were reported nationwide.\n\nBecause infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination.

Symptoms usually begin with cold- or flu-like symptoms such as a runny nose, mild cough, watery eyes, sneezing, and a low-grade fever. The cough becomes worse and often includes rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched whoop; the cough can be severe enough to break a person's rib or cause vomiting.\n\nTransylvania County Department of Public Health is working to find any links between the cases and identify people who have had contact with the sick individuals in order to control the spread of the disease. In late 2014, the county had 31 confirmed cases of pertussis and followed up with more than 450 individuals who had possibly been exposed to the disease.\n\nAll of the cases in 2015 have been in infants 7 months of age and younger, and 2 of these children have been hospitalized. Infants and young children have a higher risk for serious whooping cough, and are more likely to experience serious illness and complications, such as pneumonia, encephalitis and seizures.\n\nOne of the children diagnosed with pertussis was a 4-week-old [girl]. After she developed a cough, she was tested for both RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] and pertussis at her pediatrician's office. \"She didn't really have a 'whoop' like you hear about,\" [her mother] said, \"But you don't always have that at such a young age.\" The RSV test was positive, so she was taken to Mission Children's Hospital in Asheville [North Carolina] to begin treatment. Then, the pertussis test results also came back positive. \"It was scary,\" [her mother] said. \"She's 4 weeks old. She's little. There's not much you can do.\"\n\nSuction helped to clear the mucus from [girl's] airways. She and the rest of her family were put on a course of antibiotics, which are used to control the symptoms and help prevent infected people from spreading the disease.\n\nBecause pertussis is so contagious, it is very important for infected people to stay away from others and take the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. \"It's miserable and awful, but when they say quarantine, you have to stay home,\" [her mother] said.\n\nThe best way to prevent pertussis is through immunization: the CDC recommends 5 doses of \"DTaP\" [diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus] for young children beginning at 2 months of age. However, the vaccine's protection only lasts 5-10 years, so additional doses of \"Tdap\" should be given at age 11 or 12 and as an adult. Pregnant women should receive a dose during each pregnancy to fully protect their newborns.\n\n\"It's so important to 'cocoon' very young babies by ensuring that all the people around the baby are up-to-date on their pertussis shots,\" said Elaine Russell, health director for Transylvania County. \"This applies not only to mom and dad, but to anyone who spends any significant time with the baby, like grandparents, siblings, and caregivers.\"\n\n\"These immunizations are almost always covered by health insurance, and people who are uninsured can receive the vaccine for no charge here at the health department,\" Russell said.\n\nOlder children and adults who have been fully immunized can still contract and spread pertussis to others, and because they usually have much milder symptoms, they may not even know they are infected. Good hygiene practices -- like hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when sick -- will also help prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n[The 4-month-old girl] still has a slight cough, which is to be expected: pertussis is often called the '100-day cough' because that cough can linger for several months.\n\nWhen it comes to pertussis, [the baby's mother] says that other parents should \"take it very seriously. Heed the warnings, the cautions, and keep them protected,\" she said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the US, DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc).

Symptoms usually begin with cold- or flu-like symptoms such as a runny nose, mild cough, watery eyes, sneezing, and a low-grade fever. The cough becomes worse and often includes rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched whoop; the cough can be severe enough to break a person's rib or cause vomiting.\n\nTransylvania County Department of Public Health is working to find any links between the cases and identify people who have had contact with the sick individuals in order to control the spread of the disease. In late 2014, the county had 31 confirmed cases of pertussis and followed up with more than 450 individuals who had possibly been exposed to the disease.\n\nAll of the cases in 2015 have been in infants 7 months of age and younger, and 2 of these children have been hospitalized. Infants and young children have a higher risk for serious whooping cough, and are more likely to experience serious illness and complications, such as pneumonia, encephalitis and seizures.\n\nOne of the children diagnosed with pertussis was a 4-week-old [girl]. After she developed a cough, she was tested for both RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] and pertussis at her pediatrician's office. \"She didn't really have a 'whoop' like you hear about,\" [her mother] said, \"But you don't always have that at such a young age.\" The RSV test was positive, so she was taken to Mission Children's Hospital in Asheville [North Carolina] to begin treatment. Then, the pertussis test results also came back positive. \"It was scary,\" [her mother] said. \"She's 4 weeks old. She's little. There's not much you can do.\"\n\nSuction helped to clear the mucus from [girl's] airways. She and the rest of her family were put on a course of antibiotics, which are used to control the symptoms and help prevent infected people from spreading the disease.\n\nBecause pertussis is so contagious, it is very important for infected people to stay away from others and take the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. \"It's miserable and awful, but when they say quarantine, you have to stay home,\" [her mother] said.\n\nThe best way to prevent pertussis is through immunization: the CDC recommends 5 doses of \"DTaP\" [diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus] for young children beginning at 2 months of age. However, the vaccine's protection only lasts 5-10 years, so additional doses of \"Tdap\" should be given at age 11 or 12 and as an adult. Pregnant women should receive a dose during each pregnancy to fully protect their newborns.\n\n\"It's so important to 'cocoon' very young babies by ensuring that all the people around the baby are up-to-date on their pertussis shots,\" said Elaine Russell, health director for Transylvania County. \"This applies not only to mom and dad, but to anyone who spends any significant time with the baby, like grandparents, siblings, and caregivers.\"\n\n\"These immunizations are almost always covered by health insurance, and people who are uninsured can receive the vaccine for no charge here at the health department,\" Russell said.\n\nOlder children and adults who have been fully immunized can still contract and spread pertussis to others, and because they usually have much milder symptoms, they may not even know they are infected. Good hygiene practices -- like hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when sick -- will also help prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n[The 4-month-old girl] still has a slight cough, which is to be expected: pertussis is often called the '100-day cough' because that cough can linger for several months.\n\nWhen it comes to pertussis, [the baby's mother] says that other parents should \"take it very seriously. Heed the warnings, the cautions, and keep them protected,\" she said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the US, DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case \"d\" and \"p\" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The \"a\" in DTaP and Tdap stands for \"acellular,\" meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\n\nDTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time.

After she developed a cough, she was tested for both RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] and pertussis at her pediatrician's office. \"She didn't really have a 'whoop' like you hear about,\" [her mother] said, \"But you don't always have that at such a young age.\" The RSV test was positive, so she was taken to Mission Children's Hospital in Asheville [North Carolina] to begin treatment. Then, the pertussis test results also came back positive. \"It was scary,\" [her mother] said. \"She's 4 weeks old. She's little. There's not much you can do.\"\n\nSuction helped to clear the mucus from [girl's] airways. She and the rest of her family were put on a course of antibiotics, which are used to control the symptoms and help prevent infected people from spreading the disease.\n\nBecause pertussis is so contagious, it is very important for infected people to stay away from others and take the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. \"It's miserable and awful, but when they say quarantine, you have to stay home,\" [her mother] said.\n\nThe best way to prevent pertussis is through immunization: the CDC recommends 5 doses of \"DTaP\" [diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus] for young children beginning at 2 months of age. However, the vaccine's protection only lasts 5-10 years, so additional doses of \"Tdap\" should be given at age 11 or 12 and as an adult. Pregnant women should receive a dose during each pregnancy to fully protect their newborns.\n\n\"It's so important to 'cocoon' very young babies by ensuring that all the people around the baby are up-to-date on their pertussis shots,\" said Elaine Russell, health director for Transylvania County. \"This applies not only to mom and dad, but to anyone who spends any significant time with the baby, like grandparents, siblings, and caregivers.\"\n\n\"These immunizations are almost always covered by health insurance, and people who are uninsured can receive the vaccine for no charge here at the health department,\" Russell said.\n\nOlder children and adults who have been fully immunized can still contract and spread pertussis to others, and because they usually have much milder symptoms, they may not even know they are infected. Good hygiene practices -- like hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when sick -- will also help prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n[The 4-month-old girl] still has a slight cough, which is to be expected: pertussis is often called the '100-day cough' because that cough can linger for several months.\n\nWhen it comes to pertussis, [the baby's mother] says that other parents should \"take it very seriously.

Symptoms usually begin with cold- or flu-like symptoms such as a runny nose, mild cough, watery eyes, sneezing, and a low-grade fever. The cough becomes worse and often includes rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched whoop; the cough can be severe enough to break a person's rib or cause vomiting.\n\nTransylvania County Department of Public Health is working to find any links between the cases and identify people who have had contact with the sick individuals in order to control the spread of the disease.

Symptoms usually begin with cold- or flu-like symptoms such as a runny nose, mild cough, watery eyes, sneezing, and a low-grade fever. The cough becomes worse and often includes rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched whoop; the cough can be severe enough to break a person's rib or cause vomiting.\n\nTransylvania County Department of Public Health is working to find any links between the cases and identify people who have had contact with the sick individuals in order to control the spread of the disease. In late 2014, the county had 31 confirmed cases of pertussis and followed up with more than 450 individuals who had possibly been exposed to the disease.\n\nAll of the cases in 2015 have been in infants 7 months of age and younger, and 2 of these children have been hospitalized. Infants and young children have a higher risk for serious whooping cough, and are more likely to experience serious illness and complications, such as pneumonia, encephalitis and seizures.\n\nOne of the children diagnosed with pertussis was a 4-week-old [girl]. After she developed a cough, she was tested for both RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] and pertussis at her pediatrician's office. \"She didn't really have a 'whoop' like you hear about,\" [her mother] said, \"But you don't always have that at such a young age.\" The RSV test was positive, so she was taken to Mission Children's Hospital in Asheville [North Carolina] to begin treatment. Then, the pertussis test results also came back positive. \"It was scary,\" [her mother] said. \"She's 4 weeks old. She's little. There's not much you can do.\"\n\nSuction helped to clear the mucus from [girl's] airways. She and the rest of her family were put on a course of antibiotics, which are used to control the symptoms and help prevent infected people from spreading the disease.\n\nBecause pertussis is so contagious, it is very important for infected people to stay away from others and take the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. \"It's miserable and awful, but when they say quarantine, you have to stay home,\" [her mother] said.\n\nThe best way to prevent pertussis is through immunization: the CDC recommends 5 doses of \"DTaP\" [diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus] for young children beginning at 2 months of age. However, the vaccine's protection only lasts 5-10 years, so additional doses of \"Tdap\" should be given at age 11 or 12 and as an adult. Pregnant women should receive a dose during each pregnancy to fully protect their newborns.\n\n\"It's so important to 'cocoon' very young babies by ensuring that all the people around the baby are up-to-date on their pertussis shots,\" said Elaine Russell, health director for Transylvania County. \"This applies not only to mom and dad, but to anyone who spends any significant time with the baby, like grandparents, siblings, and caregivers.\"\n\n\"These immunizations are almost always covered by health insurance, and people who are uninsured can receive the vaccine for no charge here at the health department,\" Russell said.\n\nOlder children and adults who have been fully immunized can still contract and spread pertussis to others, and because they usually have much milder symptoms, they may not even know they are infected. Good hygiene practices -- like hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when sick -- will also help prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n[The 4-month-old girl] still has a slight cough, which is to be expected: pertussis is often called the '100-day cough' because that cough can linger for several months.\n\nWhen it comes to pertussis, [the baby's mother] says that other parents should \"take it very seriously. Heed the warnings, the cautions, and keep them protected,\" she said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the US, DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case \"d\" and \"p\" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The \"a\" in DTaP and Tdap stands for \"acellular,\" meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\n\nDTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.\n\nBecause infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination.

Doctors emphasize that the inoculation has led to fewer deaths than in the past and in instances where people do get sick, their illnesses aren't as severe. But California officials say the limited protection of the vaccine introduced in the 1990s has led to the rise in cases. Research has shown it doesn't last as long as the one it replaced, and a new study suggests the vaccine may not prevent the spread of the disease. Whooping cough peaks every 3 to 5 years, and California's last epidemic was in 2010. But despite an aggressive public health campaign in response, the current outbreak is worse.\n\nA total of 9935 cases were reported to the California Department of Public Health from 1 Jan 2014 to 26 Nov 2014, the highest number in 70 years. The cases included an infant who died. Elementary, middle and high school outbreaks have occurred across the state. San Diego County is among the hardest hit areas with 1819 cases reported so far in 2014.\n\n\"We'd have to go way back to the 1940s to find more cases,\" said Dr Eric McDonald, medical director of the epidemiology and immunization branch for public health services in San Diego County. That's when whooping cough was common, causing hundreds of thousands of illnesses annually and thousands of deaths. But after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, cases dropped to fewer than 5000 a year. That vaccine was replaced in the 1990s because of side effects, which included pain and swelling from the shot and fever. The newer vaccine is part of routine childhood vaccinations as well as adult booster shots. [the older killed whole cell vaccine was thought to be too reactogenic in adults. - Mod.LL]\n\n2013 was the nation's worst year for whooping cough in 6 decades; health officials received reports of more than 48 000 cases, including 18 deaths. In 2014, the number of reported cases nationwide dropped to about 20 000.\n\nDr Gil Chavez, epidemiologist with the California Department of Public Health, does not believe low inoculation rates are the primary cause of the current epidemic: Of this year's [2014] pediatric cases that had information on the child's vaccination history, only 10 per cent of those infected in 2014 had not been vaccinated against pertussis. Chavez says the new vaccine's limitations and better tests have led to the increase in cases.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5] Ohio (Holmes County)\nDate: Thu 18 Dec 2014\nSource: Fox 8 Cleveland [edited]\nhttp://fox8.com/2014/12/18/whooping-cough-concerns-force-78-holmes-county-students-to-stay-home-from-school/\n\n\nThe East Holmes School District [Holmes County, Ohio] is telling 78 students from 2 elementary schools to stay at home after they might have been exposed to whooping cough, and have either not been vaccinated or their vaccinations are not complete. Holmes County Health Department director Dr DJ McFadden said 3 cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, have been confirmed in the county.\n\n\"It does happen, but it doesn't happen as regularly as it is happening now. I mean, we are back to higher, as high of rates as we had before vaccinations in some parts of the country,\" McFadden said.\n\nMcFadden made the recommendation to the school district to keep the kids home to try and limit the spread of the disease. \"They are well at this time and I certainly hope they are excluded for no good reason. There's about a week-long process to display symptoms so these children could be ill and we just don't know it yet so they are excluded as that precaution because if they are sick those symptoms will show up soon and they could be exposing other people at the same time,\" said East Holmes superintendent Joe Edinger.\n\nEdinger said parents make decisions regarding the immunizations based on a number of good reasons. \"Maybe history with other children having reactions to the immunizations or for religious and cultural reasons and with that decision they accept the fact that when an outbreak occurs they will be asked to stay home,\" Edinger said. Although the county has a large Amish population, Edinger said most of the kids who are being told to stay home are not Amish.\n\nThe timing means students will miss only about a week of classes before Christmas break. They will also miss their school's Christmas activities, but the school and the health district are not stopping them from attending family functions or other community events.\n\n[byline: Dave Nethers]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Texas\nDate: Fri 19 Dec 2014\nSource: KTRE [edited]\nhttp://www.ktre.com/story/27669239/whooping-cough-moves-through-etx\n\n\nIt's a startling sound, especially if you're the parent of a small child. A deep cough with a \"whoop\" sound is the sign of pertussis, also called whooping cough. It starts like a cold with a low fever and even a runny nose, but if left untreated, a lingering cough with the recognizable sound could lead to some serious health problems.\n\nThe number of pertussis cases is rising around the country, and has claimed 2 lives in Texas this year [2014]. More than 25 per cent of pertussis cases in children result in a hospital stay, according to health reports. Pediatrician Melanie Wick said adults or teenagers can be the culprits when it comes to spreading pertussis. \"We can get a cough that lasts for several weeks and we are the ones that expose those little children to pertussis,\" wick said.\n\nWick said it's common to see more respiratory illnesses during the winter months when more people are indoors for longer times of the day. Some of the more serious complications of pertussis include pneumonia and apnea -- where one stops breathing for brief periods.\n\nWhile pertussis has been elevated to an epidemic status by health agencies in California, Wick said the number of patients she has seen with the illness here in East Texas in 2014 is about average. NetHealth, which surveyed 6 counties, said 94 cases of pertussis have been reported: Smith County accounted for 74 of those cases.\n\nIn Texas, just under 2200 cases have occurred in 2014 including 2 deaths. Nearly 50 percent of cases have been in children under the age of 7.\n\n[byline: Alex Osiadacz]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[7] New Mexico (Valencia County)\nDate: Wed 17 Dec 2014\nSource: KRQE [edited]\nhttp://krqe.com/2014/12/17/school-district-warns-parents-of-whopping-cough/\n\n\nA New Mexico school district is warning parents about whooping cough.

There is also some evidence that recent clonal strains have toxins that are less antigenic similar to the vaccine strain. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]\nSee Also\nPertussis - USA (28) 20141214.3030234\nPertussis - USA (27): (MI) undervaccination 20141211.3027769\nPertussis - USA (26) 20141211.3024716\nPertussis - USA (25): (CA) 20141205.3012191\nPertussis - USA (24) 20141121.2979932\nPertussis - USA (23) 20141116.2947034\nPertussis - USA (22) 20141105.2922903\nPertussis - USA (21): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20141015.2864604\nPertussis - USA (20): (CO) increasing incidence 20141005.2833302\nPertussis - USA (19): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140921.2792202\nPertussis - USA (18): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140815.2692228\nPertussis - USA (16): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140809.2675224\nPertussis - USA (14): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140720.2623332\nPertussis - USA (13) 20140713.2603059\nPertussis - USA (12): (CA) 20140629.2572898\nUniversal childhood immunization - USA: (NY) 20140628.2567288\nPertussis - USA (11) 20140625.2559418\nPertussis - USA (10) 20140617.2544391\nPertussis - USA (09): (CA) 20140604.2513925\nPertussis - USA (08): (SD,CA) 20140527.2499851\nPertussis - USA (07) 20140514.2469830\nPertussis - USA (06) 20140503.2445291\nPertussis - USA (05): (CA) increased incidence 20140426.2431379\nPertussis - USA (04): (MT, CA) increased incidence 20140424.2426383\nPertussis - North America 20140411.2395621\nPertussis - USA (03) 20140331.2368032\n.................................................sb/ll/je/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "pertussis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-12-18 00:00:00", "2014-11-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-01-01 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Texas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ohio", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Michigan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gallatin City - County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Montana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gallatin City - County Health Department", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Holmes County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Diego County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Fremont", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gallatin County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Valencia County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "The Republic ,", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Belgrade", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Los Lunas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nebraska", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Smith County", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3094367", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Pertussis - USA (02)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3094367", "date": "2014-12-22 16:29:28", "main_text": "PERTUSSIS - USA (29)\n********************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Michigan (Grand Traverse County)\n[2] Montana (Gallatin County)\n[3] Nebraska (Dodge, Saunders and Washington counties)\n[4] California\n[5] Ohio (Holmes County)\n[6] Texas\n[7] New Mexico (Valencia County)\n\n******\n[1] Michigan (Grand Traverse County)\nDate: Thu 18 Dec 2014\nSource: MLive [edited]\nhttp://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/12/whooping_cough_outbreak_in_gra.html\n\n\nThe pertussis outbreak in Grand Traverse County [Michigan] has reached 70 confirmed cases, plus 14 cases of a similar disease, called parapertussis, according to the health department.

Doctors emphasize that the inoculation has led to fewer deaths than in the past and in instances where people do get sick, their illnesses aren't as severe. But California officials say the limited protection of the vaccine introduced in the 1990s has led to the rise in cases. Research has shown it doesn't last as long as the one it replaced, and a new study suggests the vaccine may not prevent the spread of the disease. Whooping cough peaks every 3 to 5 years, and California's last epidemic was in 2010. But despite an aggressive public health campaign in response, the current outbreak is worse.\n\nA total of 9935 cases were reported to the California Department of Public Health from 1 Jan 2014 to 26 Nov 2014, the highest number in 70 years. The cases included an infant who died. Elementary, middle and high school outbreaks have occurred across the state. San Diego County is among the hardest hit areas with 1819 cases reported so far in 2014.\n\n\"We'd have to go way back to the 1940s to find more cases,\" said Dr Eric McDonald, medical director of the epidemiology and immunization branch for public health services in San Diego County. That's when whooping cough was common, causing hundreds of thousands of illnesses annually and thousands of deaths. But after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, cases dropped to fewer than 5000 a year. That vaccine was replaced in the 1990s because of side effects, which included pain and swelling from the shot and fever. The newer vaccine is part of routine childhood vaccinations as well as adult booster shots.

The Fremont Tribune reports that Three Rivers Health Department in Fremont says at least 2 cases of whooping cough have been confirmed in the district, which includes Dodge, Saunders and Washington counties.\n\nWhooping cough, or pertussis, is spread when infected people cough or sneeze. It starts like the common cold and can progress into violent coughing spells.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] California\nDate: Mon 15 Dec 2014\nSource: Oregon Live, Associated Press report [edited]\nhttp://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/12/whooping_cough_epidemic_hits_c.html\n\n\nCalifornia officials are battling the worst whooping cough epidemic to hit the state in 7 decades as a recent rebound in cases raises questions about the effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine. Doctors emphasize that the inoculation has led to fewer deaths than in the past and in instances where people do get sick, their illnesses aren't as severe. But California officials say the limited protection of the vaccine introduced in the 1990s has led to the rise in cases. Research has shown it doesn't last as long as the one it replaced, and a new study suggests the vaccine may not prevent the spread of the disease. Whooping cough peaks every 3 to 5 years, and California's last epidemic was in 2010. But despite an aggressive public health campaign in response, the current outbreak is worse.\n\nA total of 9935 cases were reported to the California Department of Public Health from 1 Jan 2014 to 26 Nov 2014, the highest number in 70 years. The cases included an infant who died. Elementary, middle and high school outbreaks have occurred across the state. San Diego County is among the hardest hit areas with 1819 cases reported so far in 2014.\n\n\"We'd have to go way back to the 1940s to find more cases,\" said Dr Eric McDonald, medical director of the epidemiology and immunization branch for public health services in San Diego County. That's when whooping cough was common, causing hundreds of thousands of illnesses annually and thousands of deaths. But after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, cases dropped to fewer than 5000 a year. That vaccine was replaced in the 1990s because of side effects, which included pain and swelling from the shot and fever. The newer vaccine is part of routine childhood vaccinations as well as adult booster shots. [the older killed whole cell vaccine was thought to be too reactogenic in adults. - Mod.LL]\n\n2013 was the nation's worst year for whooping cough in 6 decades; health officials received reports of more than 48 000 cases, including 18 deaths. In 2014, the number of reported cases nationwide dropped to about 20 000.\n\nDr Gil Chavez, epidemiologist with the California Department of Public Health, does not believe low inoculation rates are the primary cause of the current epidemic: Of this year's [2014] pediatric cases that had information on the child's vaccination history, only 10 per cent of those infected in 2014 had not been vaccinated against pertussis. Chavez says the new vaccine's limitations and better tests have led to the increase in cases.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5] Ohio (Holmes County)\nDate: Thu 18 Dec 2014\nSource: Fox 8 Cleveland [edited]\nhttp://fox8.com/2014/12/18/whooping-cough-concerns-force-78-holmes-county-students-to-stay-home-from-school/\n\n\nThe East Holmes School District [Holmes County, Ohio] is telling 78 students from 2 elementary schools to stay at home after they might have been exposed to whooping cough, and have either not been vaccinated or their vaccinations are not complete. Holmes County Health Department director Dr DJ McFadden said 3 cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, have been confirmed in the county.\n\n\"It does happen, but it doesn't happen as regularly as it is happening now. I mean, we are back to higher, as high of rates as we had before vaccinations in some parts of the country,\" McFadden said.\n\nMcFadden made the recommendation to the school district to keep the kids home to try and limit the spread of the disease. \"They are well at this time and I certainly hope they are excluded for no good reason. There's about a week-long process to display symptoms so these children could be ill and we just don't know it yet so they are excluded as that precaution because if they are sick those symptoms will show up soon and they could be exposing other people at the same time,\" said East Holmes superintendent Joe Edinger.\n\nEdinger said parents make decisions regarding the immunizations based on a number of good reasons. \"Maybe history with other children having reactions to the immunizations or for religious and cultural reasons and with that decision they accept the fact that when an outbreak occurs they will be asked to stay home,\" Edinger said. Although the county has a large Amish population, Edinger said most of the kids who are being told to stay home are not Amish.\n\nThe timing means students will miss only about a week of classes before Christmas break. They will also miss their school's Christmas activities, but the school and the health district are not stopping them from attending family functions or other community events.\n\n[byline: Dave Nethers]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Texas\nDate: Fri 19 Dec 2014\nSource: KTRE [edited]\nhttp://www.ktre.com/story/27669239/whooping-cough-moves-through-etx\n\n\nIt's a startling sound, especially if you're the parent of a small child. A deep cough with a \"whoop\" sound is the sign of pertussis, also called whooping cough. It starts like a cold with a low fever and even a runny nose, but if left untreated, a lingering cough with the recognizable sound could lead to some serious health problems.\n\nThe number of pertussis cases is rising around the country, and has claimed 2 lives in Texas this year [2014]. More than 25 per cent of pertussis cases in children result in a hospital stay, according to health reports. Pediatrician Melanie Wick said adults or teenagers can be the culprits when it comes to spreading pertussis. \"We can get a cough that lasts for several weeks and we are the ones that expose those little children to pertussis,\" wick said.\n\nWick said it's common to see more respiratory illnesses during the winter months when more people are indoors for longer times of the day. Some of the more serious complications of pertussis include pneumonia and apnea -- where one stops breathing for brief periods.\n\nWhile pertussis has been elevated to an epidemic status by health agencies in California, Wick said the number of patients she has seen with the illness here in East Texas in 2014 is about average. NetHealth, which surveyed 6 counties, said 94 cases of pertussis have been reported: Smith County accounted for 74 of those cases.\n\nIn Texas, just under 2200 cases have occurred in 2014 including 2 deaths. Nearly 50 percent of cases have been in children under the age of 7.\n\n[byline: Alex Osiadacz]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[7] New Mexico (Valencia County)\nDate: Wed 17 Dec 2014\nSource: KRQE [edited]\nhttp://krqe.com/2014/12/17/school-district-warns-parents-of-whopping-cough/\n\n\nA New Mexico school district is warning parents about whooping cough.

Doctors emphasize that the inoculation has led to fewer deaths than in the past and in instances where people do get sick, their illnesses aren't as severe. But California officials say the limited protection of the vaccine introduced in the 1990s has led to the rise in cases. Research has shown it doesn't last as long as the one it replaced, and a new study suggests the vaccine may not prevent the spread of the disease. Whooping cough peaks every 3 to 5 years, and California's last epidemic was in 2010. But despite an aggressive public health campaign in response, the current outbreak is worse.\n\nA total of 9935 cases were reported to the California Department of Public Health from 1 Jan 2014 to 26 Nov 2014, the highest number in 70 years. The cases included an infant who died. Elementary, middle and high school outbreaks have occurred across the state. San Diego County is among the hardest hit areas with 1819 cases reported so far in 2014.\n\n\"We'd have to go way back to the 1940s to find more cases,\" said Dr Eric McDonald, medical director of the epidemiology and immunization branch for public health services in San Diego County. That's when whooping cough was common, causing hundreds of thousands of illnesses annually and thousands of deaths. But after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, cases dropped to fewer than 5000 a year. That vaccine was replaced in the 1990s because of side effects, which included pain and swelling from the shot and fever. The newer vaccine is part of routine childhood vaccinations as well as adult booster shots. [the older killed whole cell vaccine was thought to be too reactogenic in adults. - Mod.LL]\n\n2013 was the nation's worst year for whooping cough in 6 decades; health officials received reports of more than 48 000 cases, including 18 deaths. In 2014, the number of reported cases nationwide dropped to about 20 000.\n\nDr Gil Chavez, epidemiologist with the California Department of Public Health, does not believe low inoculation rates are the primary cause of the current epidemic: Of this year's [2014] pediatric cases that had information on the child's vaccination history, only 10 per cent of those infected in 2014 had not been vaccinated against pertussis.

There's about a week-long process to display symptoms so these children could be ill and we just don't know it yet so they are excluded as that precaution because if they are sick those symptoms will show up soon and they could be exposing other people at the same time,\" said East Holmes superintendent Joe Edinger.\n\nEdinger said parents make decisions regarding the immunizations based on a number of good reasons. \"Maybe history with other children having reactions to the immunizations or for religious and cultural reasons and with that decision they accept the fact that when an outbreak occurs they will be asked to stay home,\" Edinger said.

The Fremont Tribune reports that Three Rivers Health Department in Fremont says at least 2 cases of whooping cough have been confirmed in the district, which includes Dodge, Saunders and Washington counties.\n\nWhooping cough, or pertussis, is spread when infected people cough or sneeze. It starts like the common cold and can progress into violent coughing spells.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] California\nDate: Mon 15 Dec 2014\nSource: Oregon Live, Associated Press report [edited]\nhttp://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/12/whooping_cough_epidemic_hits_c.html\n\n\nCalifornia officials are battling the worst whooping cough epidemic to hit the state in 7 decades as a recent rebound in cases raises questions about the effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine. Doctors emphasize that the inoculation has led to fewer deaths than in the past and in instances where people do get sick, their illnesses aren't as severe. But California officials say the limited protection of the vaccine introduced in the 1990s has led to the rise in cases. Research has shown it doesn't last as long as the one it replaced, and a new study suggests the vaccine may not prevent the spread of the disease. Whooping cough peaks every 3 to 5 years, and California's last epidemic was in 2010. But despite an aggressive public health campaign in response, the current outbreak is worse.\n\nA total of 9935 cases were reported to the California Department of Public Health from 1 Jan 2014 to 26 Nov 2014, the highest number in 70 years. The cases included an infant who died. Elementary, middle and high school outbreaks have occurred across the state. San Diego County is among the hardest hit areas with 1819 cases reported so far in 2014.\n\n\"We'd have to go way back to the 1940s to find more cases,\" said Dr Eric McDonald, medical director of the epidemiology and immunization branch for public health services in San Diego County. That's when whooping cough was common, causing hundreds of thousands of illnesses annually and thousands of deaths. But after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, cases dropped to fewer than 5000 a year. That vaccine was replaced in the 1990s because of side effects, which included pain and swelling from the shot and fever. The newer vaccine is part of routine childhood vaccinations as well as adult booster shots. [the older killed whole cell vaccine was thought to be too reactogenic in adults. - Mod.LL]\n\n2013 was the nation's worst year for whooping cough in 6 decades; health officials received reports of more than 48 000 cases, including 18 deaths. In 2014, the number of reported cases nationwide dropped to about 20 000.\n\nDr Gil Chavez, epidemiologist with the California Department of Public Health, does not believe low inoculation rates are the primary cause of the current epidemic: Of this year's [2014] pediatric cases that had information on the child's vaccination history, only 10 per cent of those infected in 2014 had not been vaccinated against pertussis. Chavez says the new vaccine's limitations and better tests have led to the increase in cases.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5] Ohio (Holmes County)\nDate: Thu 18 Dec 2014\nSource: Fox 8 Cleveland [edited]\nhttp://fox8.com/2014/12/18/whooping-cough-concerns-force-78-holmes-county-students-to-stay-home-from-school/\n\n\nThe East Holmes School District [Holmes County, Ohio] is telling 78 students from 2 elementary schools to stay at home after they might have been exposed to whooping cough, and have either not been vaccinated or their vaccinations are not complete. Holmes County Health Department director Dr DJ McFadden said 3 cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, have been confirmed in the county.\n\n\"It does happen, but it doesn't happen as regularly as it is happening now. I mean, we are back to higher, as high of rates as we had before vaccinations in some parts of the country,\" McFadden said.\n\nMcFadden made the recommendation to the school district to keep the kids home to try and limit the spread of the disease. \"They are well at this time and I certainly hope they are excluded for no good reason. There's about a week-long process to display symptoms so these children could be ill and we just don't know it yet so they are excluded as that precaution because if they are sick those symptoms will show up soon and they could be exposing other people at the same time,\" said East Holmes superintendent Joe Edinger.\n\nEdinger said parents make decisions regarding the immunizations based on a number of good reasons. \"Maybe history with other children having reactions to the immunizations or for religious and cultural reasons and with that decision they accept the fact that when an outbreak occurs they will be asked to stay home,\" Edinger said. Although the county has a large Amish population, Edinger said most of the kids who are being told to stay home are not Amish.\n\nThe timing means students will miss only about a week of classes before Christmas break. They will also miss their school's Christmas activities, but the school and the health district are not stopping them from attending family functions or other community events.\n\n[byline: Dave Nethers]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Texas\nDate: Fri 19 Dec 2014\nSource: KTRE [edited]\nhttp://www.ktre.com/story/27669239/whooping-cough-moves-through-etx\n\n\nIt's a startling sound, especially if you're the parent of a small child. A deep cough with a \"whoop\" sound is the sign of pertussis, also called whooping cough. It starts like a cold with a low fever and even a runny nose, but if left untreated, a lingering cough with the recognizable sound could lead to some serious health problems.\n\nThe number of pertussis cases is rising around the country, and has claimed 2 lives in Texas this year [2014]. More than 25 per cent of pertussis cases in children result in a hospital stay, according to health reports. Pediatrician Melanie Wick said adults or teenagers can be the culprits when it comes to spreading pertussis. \"We can get a cough that lasts for several weeks and we are the ones that expose those little children to pertussis,\" wick said.\n\nWick said it's common to see more respiratory illnesses during the winter months when more people are indoors for longer times of the day. Some of the more serious complications of pertussis include pneumonia and apnea -- where one stops breathing for brief periods.\n\nWhile pertussis has been elevated to an epidemic status by health agencies in California, Wick said the number of patients she has seen with the illness here in East Texas in 2014 is about average. NetHealth, which surveyed 6 counties, said 94 cases of pertussis have been reported: Smith County accounted for 74 of those cases.\n\nIn Texas, just under 2200 cases have occurred in 2014 including 2 deaths. Nearly 50 percent of cases have been in children under the age of 7.\n\n[byline: Alex Osiadacz]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[7] New Mexico (Valencia County)\nDate: Wed 17 Dec 2014\nSource: KRQE [edited]\nhttp://krqe.com/2014/12/17/school-district-warns-parents-of-whopping-cough/\n\n\nA New Mexico school district is warning parents about whooping cough.

The Fremont Tribune reports that Three Rivers Health Department in Fremont says at least 2 cases of whooping cough have been confirmed in the district, which includes Dodge, Saunders and Washington counties.\n\nWhooping cough, or pertussis, is spread when infected people cough or sneeze. It starts like the common cold and can progress into violent coughing spells.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] California\nDate: Mon 15 Dec 2014\nSource: Oregon Live, Associated Press report [edited]\nhttp://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/12/whooping_cough_epidemic_hits_c.html\n\n\nCalifornia officials are battling the worst whooping cough epidemic to hit the state in 7 decades as a recent rebound in cases raises questions about the effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine. Doctors emphasize that the inoculation has led to fewer deaths than in the past and in instances where people do get sick, their illnesses aren't as severe. But California officials say the limited protection of the vaccine introduced in the 1990s has led to the rise in cases. Research has shown it doesn't last as long as the one it replaced, and a new study suggests the vaccine may not prevent the spread of the disease. Whooping cough peaks every 3 to 5 years, and California's last epidemic was in 2010. But despite an aggressive public health campaign in response, the current outbreak is worse.\n\nA total of 9935 cases were reported to the California Department of Public Health from 1 Jan 2014 to 26 Nov 2014, the highest number in 70 years. The cases included an infant who died. Elementary, middle and high school outbreaks have occurred across the state. San Diego County is among the hardest hit areas with 1819 cases reported so far in 2014.\n\n\"We'd have to go way back to the 1940s to find more cases,\" said Dr Eric McDonald, medical director of the epidemiology and immunization branch for public health services in San Diego County. That's when whooping cough was common, causing hundreds of thousands of illnesses annually and thousands of deaths. But after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, cases dropped to fewer than 5000 a year. That vaccine was replaced in the 1990s because of side effects, which included pain and swelling from the shot and fever. The newer vaccine is part of routine childhood vaccinations as well as adult booster shots. [the older killed whole cell vaccine was thought to be too reactogenic in adults. - Mod.LL]\n\n2013 was the nation's worst year for whooping cough in 6 decades; health officials received reports of more than 48 000 cases, including 18 deaths. In 2014, the number of reported cases nationwide dropped to about 20 000.\n\nDr Gil Chavez, epidemiologist with the California Department of Public Health, does not believe low inoculation rates are the primary cause of the current epidemic: Of this year's [2014] pediatric cases that had information on the child's vaccination history, only 10 per cent of those infected in 2014 had not been vaccinated against pertussis. Chavez says the new vaccine's limitations and better tests have led to the increase in cases.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5] Ohio (Holmes County)\nDate: Thu 18 Dec 2014\nSource: Fox 8 Cleveland [edited]\nhttp://fox8.com/2014/12/18/whooping-cough-concerns-force-78-holmes-county-students-to-stay-home-from-school/\n\n\nThe East Holmes School District [Holmes County, Ohio] is telling 78 students from 2 elementary schools to stay at home after they might have been exposed to whooping cough, and have either not been vaccinated or their vaccinations are not complete. Holmes County Health Department director Dr DJ McFadden said 3 cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, have been confirmed in the county.\n\n\"It does happen, but it doesn't happen as regularly as it is happening now. I mean, we are back to higher, as high of rates as we had before vaccinations in some parts of the country,\" McFadden said.\n\nMcFadden made the recommendation to the school district to keep the kids home to try and limit the spread of the disease. \"They are well at this time and I certainly hope they are excluded for no good reason. There's about a week-long process to display symptoms so these children could be ill and we just don't know it yet so they are excluded as that precaution because if they are sick those symptoms will show up soon and they could be exposing other people at the same time,\" said East Holmes superintendent Joe Edinger.\n\nEdinger said parents make decisions regarding the immunizations based on a number of good reasons. \"Maybe history with other children having reactions to the immunizations or for religious and cultural reasons and with that decision they accept the fact that when an outbreak occurs they will be asked to stay home,\" Edinger said. Although the county has a large Amish population, Edinger said most of the kids who are being told to stay home are not Amish.\n\nThe timing means students will miss only about a week of classes before Christmas break. They will also miss their school's Christmas activities, but the school and the health district are not stopping them from attending family functions or other community events.\n\n[byline: Dave Nethers]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Texas\nDate: Fri 19 Dec 2014\nSource: KTRE [edited]\nhttp://www.ktre.com/story/27669239/whooping-cough-moves-through-etx\n\n\nIt's a startling sound, especially if you're the parent of a small child. A deep cough with a \"whoop\" sound is the sign of pertussis, also called whooping cough. It starts like a cold with a low fever and even a runny nose, but if left untreated, a lingering cough with the recognizable sound could lead to some serious health problems.\n\nThe number of pertussis cases is rising around the country, and has claimed 2 lives in Texas this year [2014]. More than 25 per cent of pertussis cases in children result in a hospital stay, according to health reports. Pediatrician Melanie Wick said adults or teenagers can be the culprits when it comes to spreading pertussis. \"We can get a cough that lasts for several weeks and we are the ones that expose those little children to pertussis,\" wick said.\n\nWick said it's common to see more respiratory illnesses during the winter months when more people are indoors for longer times of the day. Some of the more serious complications of pertussis include pneumonia and apnea -- where one stops breathing for brief periods.\n\nWhile pertussis has been elevated to an epidemic status by health agencies in California, Wick said the number of patients she has seen with the illness here in East Texas in 2014 is about average. NetHealth, which surveyed 6 counties, said 94 cases of pertussis have been reported: Smith County accounted for 74 of those cases.\n\nIn Texas, just under 2200 cases have occurred in 2014 including 2 deaths. Nearly 50 percent of cases have been in children under the age of 7.\n\n[byline: Alex Osiadacz]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[7] New Mexico (Valencia County)\nDate: Wed 17 Dec 2014\nSource: KRQE [edited]\nhttp://krqe.com/2014/12/17/school-district-warns-parents-of-whopping-cough/\n\n\nA New Mexico school district is warning parents about whooping cough.

Overall, however, waning immunity in those previously vaccinated with the acellular pertussis vaccine seems to be, in most states, the explanation for a rise of cases. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]\nSee Also\nPertussis - USA (23) 20141116.2947034\nPertussis - USA (22) 20141105.2922903\nPertussis - USA (21): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20141015.2864604\nPertussis - USA (20): (CO) increasing incidence 20141005.2833302\nPertussis - USA (19): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140921.2792202\nPertussis - USA (18): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140815.2692228\nPertussis - USA (16): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140809.2675224\nPertussis - USA (14): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140720.2623332\nPertussis - USA (13) 20140713.2603059\nPertussis - USA (12): (CA) 20140629.2572898\nUniversal childhood immunization - USA: (NY) 20140628.2567288\nPertussis - USA (11) 20140625.2559418\nPertussis - USA (10) 20140617.2544391\nPertussis - USA (09): (CA) 20140604.2513925\nPertussis - USA (08): (SD,CA) 20140527.2499851\nPertussis - USA (07) 20140514.2469830\nPertussis - USA (06) 20140503.2445291\nPertussis - USA (05): (CA) increased incidence 20140426.2431379\nPertussis - USA (04): (MT, CA) increased incidence 20140424.2426383\nPertussis - North America 20140411.2395621\nPertussis - USA (03) 20140331.2368032\nPertussis - USA 20140301.2301877\n.................................................sb/ll/je/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "pertussis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-08-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Idaho", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Traverse City Area Public Schools", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Zumbrota", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Massachusetts", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Minnesota", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Boise", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Goodhue County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Barnstable County", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2922903", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Pertussis - USA (22)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2922903", "date": "2014-08-13 18:38:46", "main_text": "PERTUSSIS - USA (17): (IDAHO), INCREASED INCIDENCE\n**************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 13 Aug 2014\nSource: The Spokesman-Review [edited]\nhttp://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/aug/13/in-brief-whooping-cough-nearly-doubles-in-idaho/\n\n\nNearly twice as many cases of whooping cough have been reported in Idaho so far this year [2014].

Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting the susceptible cohort.\n\nA recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\nAn additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurred associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\n1.

Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting the susceptible cohort.\n\nA recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\nAn additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurred associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\n1.

We urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated and urge parents to vaccinate infants and children if they are not up to date.\" More cases related to this location are likely.\n\nIn an effort to control the spread of the disease, the Grant County Health Officer has recommended antibiotics for a defined number of individuals who have come into close contact, been housed with, or transported together with the ill individuals. Antibiotics are not recommended to the general public. The highest priority is given to those who come in contact with children under 12 months of age, to pregnant women and those with certain lung conditions. A pertussis (Tdap) shot is recommended for all who are not up to date, especially those who work, live, or have recently visited Mattawa or Quincy.\n\nBetween 3 and 7 Jul 2014, 210 patients received antibiotics. Also, a pertussis (Tdap) shot will be offered to all the workers.

We urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated and urge parents to vaccinate infants and children if they are not up to date.\" More cases related to this location are likely.\n\nIn an effort to control the spread of the disease, the Grant County Health Officer has recommended antibiotics for a defined number of individuals who have come into close contact, been housed with, or transported together with the ill individuals. Antibiotics are not recommended to the general public. The highest priority is given to those who come in contact with children under 12 months of age, to pregnant women and those with certain lung conditions. A pertussis (Tdap) shot is recommended for all who are not up to date, especially those who work, live, or have recently visited Mattawa or Quincy.\n\nBetween 3 and 7 Jul 2014, 210 patients received antibiotics. Also, a pertussis (Tdap) shot will be offered to all the workers. The vaccine reduces a chance that a person will become sick with pertussis.\n\nIn Grant County, there were 56 cases of pertussis in 2013 and 11 cases so far in 2014.\n\n[Byline: Dan Thesman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a map of Washington state showing counties, see http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/washington.shtml. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[2] Virginia (Peninsula Health District)\nDate: Tue 8 Jul 2014\nSource: The Virginia Gazette [edited]\nhttp://www.vagazette.com/news/va-vg-pertussis-reports-0709-20140708,0,6545519.story\n\n\nOfficials with Virginia's Peninsula Health District received no reports of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, during the 1st 4 months this year [2014], but received 5 reports of the illness in the last 2 months, a state health official said Tue 8 Jul 2014.\n\nAccording to Dr. Nzinga Teule-Hekima, health director for the Virginia Department of Health's Peninsula Health District, those 5 cases are still under investigation and have not been categorized as confirmed.

Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting the susceptible cohort.\n\nA recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\nAn additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurred associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\n1.

Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting the susceptible cohort.\n\nA recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\nAn additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurred associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\n1.

Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting the susceptible cohort.\n\nA recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\nAn additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurred associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\n1.

Because of a large number of exposed and ill individuals in a very well-defined area, we are considering this a local outbreak,\" states Dr. Alexander Brzezny, Grant County Health Officer. He adds, \"Preventing severe disease and death in infants is our highest priority. We urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated and urge parents to vaccinate infants and children if they are not up to date.\" More cases related to this location are likely.\n\nIn an effort to control the spread of the disease, the Grant County Health Officer has recommended antibiotics for a defined number of individuals who have come into close contact, been housed with, or transported together with the ill individuals. Antibiotics are not recommended to the general public. The highest priority is given to those who come in contact with children under 12 months of age, to pregnant women and those with certain lung conditions. A pertussis (Tdap) shot is recommended for all who are not up to date, especially those who work, live, or have recently visited Mattawa or Quincy.\n\nBetween 3 and 7 Jul 2014, 210 patients received antibiotics. Also, a pertussis (Tdap) shot will be offered to all the workers. The vaccine reduces a chance that a person will become sick with pertussis.\n\nIn Grant County, there were 56 cases of pertussis in 2013 and 11 cases so far in 2014.\n\n[Byline: Dan Thesman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a map of Washington state showing counties, see http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/washington.shtml. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[2] Virginia (Peninsula Health District)\nDate: Tue 8 Jul 2014\nSource: The Virginia Gazette [edited]\nhttp://www.vagazette.com/news/va-vg-pertussis-reports-0709-20140708,0,6545519.story\n\n\nOfficials with Virginia's Peninsula Health District received no reports of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, during the 1st 4 months this year [2014], but received 5 reports of the illness in the last 2 months, a state health official said Tue 8 Jul 2014.\n\nAccording to Dr. Nzinga Teule-Hekima, health director for the Virginia Department of Health's Peninsula Health District, those 5 cases are still under investigation and have not been categorized as confirmed.

The majority of the cases are school-age children. Among the vaccine-preventable diseases, pertussis is the most common, according to health department.\n\nPertussis is a highly contagious disease that is spread by the coughing of an infected person. Unimmunized or incompletely immunized young infants are particularly vulnerable and at increased risk for severe complications. In these cases, parents, older siblings and others in the household are often the source of their infection. A typical case of pertussis in a child or adult starts with a cough and runny nose lasting up to 2 weeks, followed by weeks to months of rapid coughing fits. Infants, not yet fully vaccinated are at highest risk of complications.\n\nTo ensure all family members are protected from pertussis, everyone in the home should be vaccinated. Young children need 5 doses by kindergarten (ages 4 to 6). All students entering, advancing or transferring into 7th grade need proof of an adolescent whooping cough booster immunization (called \"Tdap\"). Pregnant women are recommended to receive a Tdap booster during their 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, even if they got it before pregnancy. Adults should receive Tdap in place of their routine 10-year tetanus (Td) booster, especially if they are in contact with infants or are healthcare workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3] Montana (Lewis and Clark County)\nDate: Fri 2 May 2014\nSource: KXLH [edited]\nhttp://www.kxlh.com/news/nurses-warn-about-whooping-cough-outbreak-among-helena-students/\n\n\nLast week the Lewis and Clark County City-County Health Department was alerting the public to a rash of pertussis, or whooping cough, cases reported in the area. Now they're reporting 25 cases since the start of April 2014, and most of those cases are from students at Capital High School.\n\nThe school has been working in connection with the Lewis and Clark City-County Health Department to identify those infected and figure out who may have come into contact. In most cases, students have been vaccinated already, according to Capital High nurse, Kathy Boutilier, RN. \"This is a vaccine that has a waning effectiveness. So, a number of variables that come into play as to why someone would get pertussis and why someone sitting next to them does not,\" said Boutilier.\n\nMike Henderson, a public health nurse at the Lewis and Clark City-County Health Department, said that despite that, now is a perfect time for everyone to check their immunization status. Henderson said infants are the most vulnerable to pertussis, because the condition can be serious and even fatal, and they haven't been fully immunized for it yet [see vaccination schedules in the comment below]. In addition to high school-age kids, there is a pre-school-age child, and several adults who have been diagnosed with pertussis [in this outbreak].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] Maine (York County)\nDate: Wed 30 Apr 2014\nSource: WMTW [edited]\nhttp://m.wmtw.com/health/whooping-cough-cases-on-the-rise/25740834\n\n\nWhooping cough cases are on the rise in Kennebunk [York County, Maine] and parents are on alert. A total of 6 cases have been reported this week [week of 28 Apr 2014]. The superintendent sent an email to parents letting them know what's being done to keep kids at school, but it also talks about how prevention starts at home. \"We don't want to raise concern about issues that aren't significant. We don't want to create hysteria, but it is important to share when there are situations where there is a contagious disease that we want folks to be aware of,\" said Superintendent Andrew Dolloff.\n\nThis week, a student at the Middle School of the Kennebunks contracted the disease, making it the 6th case district-wide and the 4th at the school.

As many as 63 per cent of infants younger than 6 months of age with pertussis require hospitalization. In this CDC report from infants with pertussis in 1997-2000, there were 11.8 per cent with pneumonia, 1.4 per cent with seizures, 0.2 per cent with encephalopathy, and 0.8 per cent died [56/7203]. This compared with parallel numbers of 28 per cent, 8.6 per cent, 0.7 per cent, 0.1 per cent, and less than 0.1 per cent in infants 6-11 months of age (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5104a1.htm).\n\nNeonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental O2 in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]\nSee Also\nPertussis - USA (05): USA (CA) increased incidence 20140426.2431379\nPertussis - USA (04): (MT, CA) increased incidence 20140424.2426383\nPertussis - North America: USA (GA, CA) Canada (AB) 20140411.2395621\nPertussis - USA (03) 20140331.2368032\nPertussis - USA (02) 20140306.2315829\nPertussis - USA 20140301.2301877\n2013\n----\nPertussis - USA (04) 20131229.2140560\nPertussis - USA (03) 20131225.2135158\nPertussis - USA (02) 20130905.1923593\nPertussis - USA: waning immunity 20130316.1590032\n2012\n----\nPertussis - USA (12) 20120718.1204697\nPertussis - USA (11): (WA) hospital exposure 20120706.1190876\nPertussis - USA (10) 20120611.1161299\nPertussis - USA (09) 20120522.1137174\nPertussis - USA (08) 20120513.1122809\nPertussis - USA (07) 20120423.1111130\nPertussis - USA (06) 20120418.1105680\nPertussis - USA (05) 20120410.1096152\nPertussis - USA (04) 20120325.1080223\nPertussis - USA (03) 20120322.1076102\nPertussis - USA (02) 20120310.1066817\nPertussis - USA 20120229.1055492\n.................................................sb/ll/je/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "pertussis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-04-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Clark County City - County Health Department", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Clark County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tdap", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Clark City - County Health Department", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Henderson", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "York County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Los Angeles County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Diego County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maine", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Long Beach", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kennebunk [ York County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2526398", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Pertussis - Brazil: (SP) fatalities", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2526398", "date": "2014-05-03 17:44:46", "main_text": "PERTUSSIS - USA (06)\n********************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] California (San Diego County)\n[2] California (Los Angeles County)\n[3] Montana (Lewis and Clark County)\n[4] Maine (York County)\n\n******\n[1] California (San Diego County)\nDate: Wed 30 Apr 2014\nSource: KUSI News [edited]\nhttp://www.kusi.com/story/25389578/county-pertussis-cases-up-nearly-600-percent-over-last-year\n\n\nThere have been 298 pertussis cases reported in San Diego County [California] in 2014, nearly 6 times the 53 reported this time in 2013, the county Health and Human Services Agency reported this week [week of 28 Apr 2014].

The majority of the cases are school-age children. Among the vaccine-preventable diseases, pertussis is the most common, according to health department.\n\nPertussis is a highly contagious disease that is spread by the coughing of an infected person. Unimmunized or incompletely immunized young infants are particularly vulnerable and at increased risk for severe complications. In these cases, parents, older siblings and others in the household are often the source of their infection. A typical case of pertussis in a child or adult starts with a cough and runny nose lasting up to 2 weeks, followed by weeks to months of rapid coughing fits. Infants, not yet fully vaccinated are at highest risk of complications.\n\nTo ensure all family members are protected from pertussis, everyone in the home should be vaccinated. Young children need 5 doses by kindergarten (ages 4 to 6). All students entering, advancing or transferring into 7th grade need proof of an adolescent whooping cough booster immunization (called \"Tdap\"). Pregnant women are recommended to receive a Tdap booster during their 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, even if they got it before pregnancy. Adults should receive Tdap in place of their routine 10-year tetanus (Td) booster, especially if they are in contact with infants or are healthcare workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3] Montana (Lewis and Clark County)\nDate: Fri 2 May 2014\nSource: KXLH [edited]\nhttp://www.kxlh.com/news/nurses-warn-about-whooping-cough-outbreak-among-helena-students/\n\n\nLast week the Lewis and Clark County City-County Health Department was alerting the public to a rash of pertussis, or whooping cough, cases reported in the area.

Henderson said infants are the most vulnerable to pertussis, because the condition can be serious and even fatal, and they haven't been fully immunized for it yet [see vaccination schedules in the comment below].

The majority of the cases are school-age children. Among the vaccine-preventable diseases, pertussis is the most common, according to health department.\n\nPertussis is a highly contagious disease that is spread by the coughing of an infected person. Unimmunized or incompletely immunized young infants are particularly vulnerable and at increased risk for severe complications. In these cases, parents, older siblings and others in the household are often the source of their infection. A typical case of pertussis in a child or adult starts with a cough and runny nose lasting up to 2 weeks, followed by weeks to months of rapid coughing fits. Infants, not yet fully vaccinated are at highest risk of complications.\n\nTo ensure all family members are protected from pertussis, everyone in the home should be vaccinated. Young children need 5 doses by kindergarten (ages 4 to 6). All students entering, advancing or transferring into 7th grade need proof of an adolescent whooping cough booster immunization (called \"Tdap\"). Pregnant women are recommended to receive a Tdap booster during their 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, even if they got it before pregnancy. Adults should receive Tdap in place of their routine 10-year tetanus (Td) booster, especially if they are in contact with infants or are healthcare workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3] Montana (Lewis and Clark County)\nDate: Fri 2 May 2014\nSource: KXLH [edited]\nhttp://www.kxlh.com/news/nurses-warn-about-whooping-cough-outbreak-among-helena-students/\n\n\nLast week the Lewis and Clark County City-County Health Department was alerting the public to a rash of pertussis, or whooping cough, cases reported in the area.

Henderson said infants are the most vulnerable to pertussis, because the condition can be serious and even fatal, and they haven't been fully immunized for it yet [see vaccination schedules in the comment below].

The majority of the cases are school-age children. Among the vaccine-preventable diseases, pertussis is the most common, according to health department.\n\nPertussis is a highly contagious disease that is spread by the coughing of an infected person. Unimmunized or incompletely immunized young infants are particularly vulnerable and at increased risk for severe complications. In these cases, parents, older siblings and others in the household are often the source of their infection. A typical case of pertussis in a child or adult starts with a cough and runny nose lasting up to 2 weeks, followed by weeks to months of rapid coughing fits. Infants, not yet fully vaccinated are at highest risk of complications.\n\nTo ensure all family members are protected from pertussis, everyone in the home should be vaccinated. Young children need 5 doses by kindergarten (ages 4 to 6). All students entering, advancing or transferring into 7th grade need proof of an adolescent whooping cough booster immunization (called \"Tdap\"). Pregnant women are recommended to receive a Tdap booster during their 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, even if they got it before pregnancy. Adults should receive Tdap in place of their routine 10-year tetanus (Td) booster, especially if they are in contact with infants or are healthcare workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3] Montana (Lewis and Clark County)\nDate: Fri 2 May 2014\nSource: KXLH [edited]\nhttp://www.kxlh.com/news/nurses-warn-about-whooping-cough-outbreak-among-helena-students/\n\n\nLast week the Lewis and Clark County City-County Health Department was alerting the public to a rash of pertussis, or whooping cough, cases reported in the area.

Henderson said infants are the most vulnerable to pertussis, because the condition can be serious and even fatal, and they haven't been fully immunized for it yet [see vaccination schedules in the comment below].

In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental O2 in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]\nSee Also\nPertussis - USA (05): USA (CA) increased incidence 20140426.2431379\nPertussis - USA (04): (MT, CA) increased incidence 20140424.2426383\nPertussis - North America: USA (GA, CA) Canada (AB) 20140411.2395621\nPertussis - USA (03) 20140331.2368032\nPertussis - USA (02) 20140306.2315829\nPertussis - USA 20140301.2301877\n2013\n----\nPertussis - USA (04) 20131229.2140560\nPertussis - USA (03) 20131225.2135158\nPertussis - USA (02) 20130905.1923593\nPertussis - USA: waning immunity 20130316.1590032\n2012\n----\nPertussis - USA (12) 20120718.1204697\nPertussis - USA (11): (WA) hospital exposure 20120706.1190876\nPertussis - USA (10) 20120611.1161299\nPertussis - USA (09) 20120522.1137174\nPertussis - USA (08) 20120513.1122809\nPertussis - USA (07) 20120423.1111130\nPertussis - USA (06) 20120418.1105680\nPertussis - USA (05) 20120410.1096152\nPertussis - USA (04) 20120325.1080223\nPertussis - USA (03) 20120322.1076102\nPertussis - USA (02) 20120310.1066817\nPertussis - USA 20120229.1055492\n.................................................sb/ll/je/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "pertussis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-04-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Clark County City - County Health Department", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Clark County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tdap", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Clark City - County Health Department", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Henderson", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "York County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Los Angeles County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Diego County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maine", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Long Beach", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kennebunk [ York County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2426383", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Pertussis - USA (04): (MT, CA) increased incidence", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2426383", "date": "2013-12-25 19:21:29", "main_text": "PERTUSSIS - USA (03)\n********************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Texas (Nueces County): fatality\n[2] Texas (statewide)\n[3] Wisconsin (Wood County)\n[4] Ohio (Clark County)\n[5] Colorado (Phillips County)\n[6] Pathogen evolution\n\n******\n[1] Texas (Nueces County): fatality\nDate: Thu 19 Dec 2013\nSource: Alice (TX) Echo-News Journal [edited]\nhttp://www.alicetx.com/recordstar/news/article_2cc1463c-a15f-5b73-b353-b5d9ffed96a6.html\n\n\nThe 1st death from pertussis in Nueces County [Texas] was reported by authorities on Wed 18 Dec 2013, just after a press conference held by the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Health District focused on the increase of pertussis cases in the Coastal Bend, and the urgent need of vaccination to prevent the illness.

So we are seeing an increase.\"\n\nRodd says many of the people being infected are students who are nearly out of date with their shots. \"Because of that, the protection they got in kindergarten is starting to wane, and so they're a little more susceptible.\" The early symptoms are much like catching a cold, but the mild cough progressively worsens to severe coughing spells. These coughing spells can include whooping and vomiting. Health officials say the illness can last nearly 6 weeks, and is contagious if left untreated. A course of antibiotics is available to help lessen the length of the disease, and Rodd says they need to do their job. \"We want to make sure people go through the entire cycle of antibiotics before going out into the public.\"\n\n[Byline: Raymond Neupert]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMx.

Health officials are urging individuals that have a cough, or have a family member that has a cough, that has lasted more than 14 days to see their healthcare provider, and to make sure family member vaccinations are up to date.\n\n\"Pertussis has been circulating at epidemic levels in Colorado for the past couple of years so it's not surprising we're seeing increased cases in our area,\" said Dr Tony Cappello, NCHD's public health director, in the release. \"While this infection can just be a nagging cough for some people, it can be very severe and even deadly for infants and others with compromised immune systems. This is not an illness you want to pass on to an infant that doesn't have the immunity to fight it off; whether it be your own grandchild, a neighbor's new baby, or your own newborn.\n\n\"It can also be very hard to get rid of once it gets in a community,\" continued Dr Cappello. \"Over the course of our case investigations in Phillips County we've had to touch base with several other school districts alerting them to probable exposures at school events. The best thing that people can do if they think they have pertussis is to visit their healthcare provider, stay home if they're ill, cover their cough, stay away from infants, wash their hands, and make sure they're up to date on vaccinations.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Colorado can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMz.

Over the last few years, this once-common childhood illness, also known as whooping cough, has evolved in response to its own vaccine, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe mutated pertussis is not more dangerous than the original, and vaccines against the illness are still effective. So the findings don't change researchers' and doctors' understanding of whooping cough as a public health problem. Instead, they're a glimpse into a fascinating natural phenomenon, and one that's happening as we speak. (Though this isn't the 1st time this has happened. Populations of pneumococcal illnesses changed after the introduction of its vaccine, prompting changes to the vaccine to deal with newly popular strains.) The whooping cough findings have kicked off research to determine whether this is related to the recent increase in whooping cough cases in the US.\n\nPaul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was not involved in the CDC study, but took part in a conference call about the study in which CDC researchers presented their results. He talked with Popular Science over the phone immediately after the call.\n\n\"We discussed the data and what the data allow us to say and what they don't allow us to say,\" he says. \"The data don't support the notion that the mutants are more virulent.\" Babies who fall ill from un-mutated pertussis have the same symptoms as babies who fall ill from mutated pertussis, he says.\n\nThere's also no evidence yet that pertussis vaccines are less effective against the new strains, say all of the researchers Popular Science talked with, both in and outside of the CDC. Everyone recommended Americans continue to get vaccinated right on schedule. \"Currently, we know it's the best form of protection we have,\" says Lucia Pawloski, the CDC scientist who led the new research. Kids who don't get vaccinated against pertussis are still 8 times as likely as vaccinated kids to get the disease, she adds.\n\nNevertheless, it's plausible whooping cough's changes do affect the vaccine's ability to protect. \"Yes, theoretically, there could be an issue, but we don't have any data to say that yet,\" Pawloski says. The CDC is interested in answering this question and hopefully will have data to do so in 6 or 8 months, Offit says.\n\nSo what exactly is different about pertussis nowadays? Since 2010, Pawloski and her colleagues have recorded a sharp rise in the US in strains of the illness that don't make a protein called pertactin. Before 2010, researchers saw only one US pertussis infection, from 1994, in which the bacteria didn't make pertactin. By 2012, the majority of pertussis infections researchers studied were caused by non-pertactin-making pertussis. Pawloski and her team examined 1300 samples taken from whooping cough outbreaks between 1935 and 2012.\n\nPertussis bacteria make thousands of proteins, but pertactin happens to be one of the few included in many forms of the vaccine used in developed countries, including the US. \"We've created this selective pressure,\" Offit says, by widely using vaccines with pertactin in them.\n\nWhen the proteins and other molecules in a vaccine enter your body through a shot, your immune system finds them, learns to recognize them, and develops defenses against them. Now, if you ever truly encounter that illness, your body will respond quickly to quash it. If the vaccine contains pertactin and the actual illness doesn't, that means your body is learning to recognize something that's useless to it when it encounters whooping cough.\n\nAll pertussis vaccines used in developed countries have one, 2, or 3 other pertussis molecules besides pertactin, so there's still stuff in there for your body to train on, even if pertactin is now useless. How much of a blow -- if any at all -- losing pertactin deals to vaccines that have other active molecules is still unclear. \"I think at this point it's hard to say exactly what it means for the vaccines' effectiveness,\" says Nicola Klein, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in California. Klein was not involved in the CDC study.\n\nMeanwhile, pertussis vaccines often used in developing countries contain entire killed _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria, so they actually contain perhaps thousands of things the body is able to use to learn to recognize whooping cough. Those vaccines, which are cheaper to make, were discontinued in developed countries because they cause severe, if non-permanent, side effects, such as seizures in babies.\n\nCDC researchers now are looking into whether losing pertactin is related to another phenomenon associated with the increasing popularity of the newer whooping cough vaccines. Recent studies have found that even those kids who get all their recommended pertussis shots -- in the US administered as the DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis] shot -- are vulnerable again to whooping cough at about age 8 or 10. Researchers think the new vaccine is why the US saw more cases of whooping cough in 2012 than it has in any year since 1955. The older shot, with the killed bacteria, protected people for longer. Scientists are unsure what exactly made the tougher stuff longer-lasting, however.\n\nIs pertussis' evolution the answer? That's not certain yet. \"We couldn't say yes or no at this point whether pertactin had a role in the waning of immunity,\" Pawloski says.\n\n[Byline: Francie Diep]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Palowski's paper, \"Prevalence and molecular characterization of pertactin-deficient _Bordetella pertussis_ in the US. Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2013 Nov 20. [Epub ahead of print] can be found at http://www.asm.org/images/Communications/tips/2013/1213pertussis.pdf.\n\nThe number of cases of pertussis over time tends to have upswing cycles every 3-5 years but the case increases have been greater and more prolonged in the past several years. Utah is just one of a number of USA states including Washington and Wisconsin that have had substantial increase in the disease with, in addition, infant deaths related to cases transmitted by family members. Most up-to-date ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations continue to increase vaccination recommendations to order to \"cocoon\" the susceptible infant cohort. The most recent recommendations include re-vaccination for pregnant women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester for each pregnancy (1).\n\nIn addition to the Tartlof paper (2), an additional recent publication, currently in press in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilizes a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and clearly shows that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Over the last few years, this once-common childhood illness, also known as whooping cough, has evolved in response to its own vaccine, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe mutated pertussis is not more dangerous than the original, and vaccines against the illness are still effective. So the findings don't change researchers' and doctors' understanding of whooping cough as a public health problem. Instead, they're a glimpse into a fascinating natural phenomenon, and one that's happening as we speak. (Though this isn't the 1st time this has happened. Populations of pneumococcal illnesses changed after the introduction of its vaccine, prompting changes to the vaccine to deal with newly popular strains.) The whooping cough findings have kicked off research to determine whether this is related to the recent increase in whooping cough cases in the US.\n\nPaul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was not involved in the CDC study, but took part in a conference call about the study in which CDC researchers presented their results. He talked with Popular Science over the phone immediately after the call.\n\n\"We discussed the data and what the data allow us to say and what they don't allow us to say,\" he says. \"The data don't support the notion that the mutants are more virulent.\" Babies who fall ill from un-mutated pertussis have the same symptoms as babies who fall ill from mutated pertussis, he says.\n\nThere's also no evidence yet that pertussis vaccines are less effective against the new strains, say all of the researchers Popular Science talked with, both in and outside of the CDC. Everyone recommended Americans continue to get vaccinated right on schedule. \"Currently, we know it's the best form of protection we have,\" says Lucia Pawloski, the CDC scientist who led the new research. Kids who don't get vaccinated against pertussis are still 8 times as likely as vaccinated kids to get the disease, she adds.\n\nNevertheless, it's plausible whooping cough's changes do affect the vaccine's ability to protect. \"Yes, theoretically, there could be an issue, but we don't have any data to say that yet,\" Pawloski says. The CDC is interested in answering this question and hopefully will have data to do so in 6 or 8 months, Offit says.\n\nSo what exactly is different about pertussis nowadays? Since 2010, Pawloski and her colleagues have recorded a sharp rise in the US in strains of the illness that don't make a protein called pertactin. Before 2010, researchers saw only one US pertussis infection, from 1994, in which the bacteria didn't make pertactin. By 2012, the majority of pertussis infections researchers studied were caused by non-pertactin-making pertussis. Pawloski and her team examined 1300 samples taken from whooping cough outbreaks between 1935 and 2012.\n\nPertussis bacteria make thousands of proteins, but pertactin happens to be one of the few included in many forms of the vaccine used in developed countries, including the US. \"We've created this selective pressure,\" Offit says, by widely using vaccines with pertactin in them.\n\nWhen the proteins and other molecules in a vaccine enter your body through a shot, your immune system finds them, learns to recognize them, and develops defenses against them. Now, if you ever truly encounter that illness, your body will respond quickly to quash it. If the vaccine contains pertactin and the actual illness doesn't, that means your body is learning to recognize something that's useless to it when it encounters whooping cough.\n\nAll pertussis vaccines used in developed countries have one, 2, or 3 other pertussis molecules besides pertactin, so there's still stuff in there for your body to train on, even if pertactin is now useless. How much of a blow -- if any at all -- losing pertactin deals to vaccines that have other active molecules is still unclear. \"I think at this point it's hard to say exactly what it means for the vaccines' effectiveness,\" says Nicola Klein, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in California. Klein was not involved in the CDC study.\n\nMeanwhile, pertussis vaccines often used in developing countries contain entire killed _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria, so they actually contain perhaps thousands of things the body is able to use to learn to recognize whooping cough. Those vaccines, which are cheaper to make, were discontinued in developed countries because they cause severe, if non-permanent, side effects, such as seizures in babies.\n\nCDC researchers now are looking into whether losing pertactin is related to another phenomenon associated with the increasing popularity of the newer whooping cough vaccines. Recent studies have found that even those kids who get all their recommended pertussis shots -- in the US administered as the DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis] shot -- are vulnerable again to whooping cough at about age 8 or 10. Researchers think the new vaccine is why the US saw more cases of whooping cough in 2012 than it has in any year since 1955. The older shot, with the killed bacteria, protected people for longer. Scientists are unsure what exactly made the tougher stuff longer-lasting, however.\n\nIs pertussis' evolution the answer? That's not certain yet. \"We couldn't say yes or no at this point whether pertactin had a role in the waning of immunity,\" Pawloski says.\n\n[Byline: Francie Diep]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Palowski's paper, \"Prevalence and molecular characterization of pertactin-deficient _Bordetella pertussis_ in the US. Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2013 Nov 20. [Epub ahead of print] can be found at http://www.asm.org/images/Communications/tips/2013/1213pertussis.pdf.\n\nThe number of cases of pertussis over time tends to have upswing cycles every 3-5 years but the case increases have been greater and more prolonged in the past several years. Utah is just one of a number of USA states including Washington and Wisconsin that have had substantial increase in the disease with, in addition, infant deaths related to cases transmitted by family members. Most up-to-date ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations continue to increase vaccination recommendations to order to \"cocoon\" the susceptible infant cohort. The most recent recommendations include re-vaccination for pregnant women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester for each pregnancy (1).\n\nIn addition to the Tartlof paper (2), an additional recent publication, currently in press in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilizes a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and clearly shows that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Over the last few years, this once-common childhood illness, also known as whooping cough, has evolved in response to its own vaccine, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe mutated pertussis is not more dangerous than the original, and vaccines against the illness are still effective. So the findings don't change researchers' and doctors' understanding of whooping cough as a public health problem. Instead, they're a glimpse into a fascinating natural phenomenon, and one that's happening as we speak. (Though this isn't the 1st time this has happened. Populations of pneumococcal illnesses changed after the introduction of its vaccine, prompting changes to the vaccine to deal with newly popular strains.) The whooping cough findings have kicked off research to determine whether this is related to the recent increase in whooping cough cases in the US.\n\nPaul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was not involved in the CDC study, but took part in a conference call about the study in which CDC researchers presented their results. He talked with Popular Science over the phone immediately after the call.\n\n\"We discussed the data and what the data allow us to say and what they don't allow us to say,\" he says. \"The data don't support the notion that the mutants are more virulent.\" Babies who fall ill from un-mutated pertussis have the same symptoms as babies who fall ill from mutated pertussis, he says.\n\nThere's also no evidence yet that pertussis vaccines are less effective against the new strains, say all of the researchers Popular Science talked with, both in and outside of the CDC. Everyone recommended Americans continue to get vaccinated right on schedule. \"Currently, we know it's the best form of protection we have,\" says Lucia Pawloski, the CDC scientist who led the new research. Kids who don't get vaccinated against pertussis are still 8 times as likely as vaccinated kids to get the disease, she adds.\n\nNevertheless, it's plausible whooping cough's changes do affect the vaccine's ability to protect. \"Yes, theoretically, there could be an issue, but we don't have any data to say that yet,\" Pawloski says. The CDC is interested in answering this question and hopefully will have data to do so in 6 or 8 months, Offit says.\n\nSo what exactly is different about pertussis nowadays? Since 2010, Pawloski and her colleagues have recorded a sharp rise in the US in strains of the illness that don't make a protein called pertactin. Before 2010, researchers saw only one US pertussis infection, from 1994, in which the bacteria didn't make pertactin. By 2012, the majority of pertussis infections researchers studied were caused by non-pertactin-making pertussis. Pawloski and her team examined 1300 samples taken from whooping cough outbreaks between 1935 and 2012.\n\nPertussis bacteria make thousands of proteins, but pertactin happens to be one of the few included in many forms of the vaccine used in developed countries, including the US. \"We've created this selective pressure,\" Offit says, by widely using vaccines with pertactin in them.\n\nWhen the proteins and other molecules in a vaccine enter your body through a shot, your immune system finds them, learns to recognize them, and develops defenses against them. Now, if you ever truly encounter that illness, your body will respond quickly to quash it. If the vaccine contains pertactin and the actual illness doesn't, that means your body is learning to recognize something that's useless to it when it encounters whooping cough.\n\nAll pertussis vaccines used in developed countries have one, 2, or 3 other pertussis molecules besides pertactin, so there's still stuff in there for your body to train on, even if pertactin is now useless. How much of a blow -- if any at all -- losing pertactin deals to vaccines that have other active molecules is still unclear. \"I think at this point it's hard to say exactly what it means for the vaccines' effectiveness,\" says Nicola Klein, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in California. Klein was not involved in the CDC study.\n\nMeanwhile, pertussis vaccines often used in developing countries contain entire killed _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria, so they actually contain perhaps thousands of things the body is able to use to learn to recognize whooping cough. Those vaccines, which are cheaper to make, were discontinued in developed countries because they cause severe, if non-permanent, side effects, such as seizures in babies.\n\nCDC researchers now are looking into whether losing pertactin is related to another phenomenon associated with the increasing popularity of the newer whooping cough vaccines. Recent studies have found that even those kids who get all their recommended pertussis shots -- in the US administered as the DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis] shot -- are vulnerable again to whooping cough at about age 8 or 10. Researchers think the new vaccine is why the US saw more cases of whooping cough in 2012 than it has in any year since 1955. The older shot, with the killed bacteria, protected people for longer. Scientists are unsure what exactly made the tougher stuff longer-lasting, however.\n\nIs pertussis' evolution the answer? That's not certain yet. \"We couldn't say yes or no at this point whether pertactin had a role in the waning of immunity,\" Pawloski says.\n\n[Byline: Francie Diep]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Palowski's paper, \"Prevalence and molecular characterization of pertactin-deficient _Bordetella pertussis_ in the US. Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2013 Nov 20. [Epub ahead of print] can be found at http://www.asm.org/images/Communications/tips/2013/1213pertussis.pdf.\n\nThe number of cases of pertussis over time tends to have upswing cycles every 3-5 years but the case increases have been greater and more prolonged in the past several years. Utah is just one of a number of USA states including Washington and Wisconsin that have had substantial increase in the disease with, in addition, infant deaths related to cases transmitted by family members. Most up-to-date ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations continue to increase vaccination recommendations to order to \"cocoon\" the susceptible infant cohort. The most recent recommendations include re-vaccination for pregnant women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester for each pregnancy (1).\n\nIn addition to the Tartlof paper (2), an additional recent publication, currently in press in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilizes a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and clearly shows that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

A Corpus Christi baby of 6 months succumbed to the illness after a lengthy battle, having been hospitalized since 28 Aug 2013. Looking back on their records, the Health District states that the baby's death was the 1st in Corpus Christi for 2013, and may have been the 1st area death in over a decade from pertussis, otherwise known as whooping cough.\n\nA report from the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District states that the level of pertussis cases in Nueces County has been on a recent rise, with 16 cases reported in the area in 2013; 11 of those cases requiring hospitalization. With all of that being said, the fact remains, pertussis is preventable. \"Pertussis is preventable through vaccine and it is of vital importance that anyone who is around a pregnant female receives their pertussis vaccine,\" said Annette Rodriguez, MPH, Director of Public Health.\n\nDr Jaime Fergie, Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Driscoll Children's Hospital, further stressed this point, stating that the most important thing to prevent pertussis is for pregnant females to receive the vaccination in their 3rd trimester, and for all other relatives who will come into close proximity with the newborn to receive the vaccination [at least] 2 weeks before the baby is due.\n\nAccording to the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District, pertussis is an extremely serious respiratory infection, with the pertussis bacteria attacking the lungs and breathing tubes. It causes uncontrollable coughing.\n\nDr Fergie states that the whooping cough infects adults, and can cause many problems, but when a child under 2 (such as an infant who has not built up a tolerance or acquired the antibodies to fight against the infection) contracts the illness, it can be extremely harmful, or even deadly.\n\nThe death reported on Wed 18 Dec 2013 may be the 1st in 2013, but once again, there is a rising trend in cases. Remember to vaccinate early, in order to prevent more severe cases of pertussis.\n\n[Byline: Jimmy Willden]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/2Jna.

So we are seeing an increase.\"\n\nRodd says many of the people being infected are students who are nearly out of date with their shots. \"Because of that, the protection they got in kindergarten is starting to wane, and so they're a little more susceptible.\" The early symptoms are much like catching a cold, but the mild cough progressively worsens to severe coughing spells. These coughing spells can include whooping and vomiting. Health officials say the illness can last nearly 6 weeks, and is contagious if left untreated. A course of antibiotics is available to help lessen the length of the disease, and Rodd says they need to do their job. \"We want to make sure people go through the entire cycle of antibiotics before going out into the public.\"\n\n[Byline: Raymond Neupert]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMx.

A Corpus Christi baby of 6 months succumbed to the illness after a lengthy battle, having been hospitalized since 28 Aug 2013. Looking back on their records, the Health District states that the baby's death was the 1st in Corpus Christi for 2013, and may have been the 1st area death in over a decade from pertussis, otherwise known as whooping cough.\n\nA report from the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District states that the level of pertussis cases in Nueces County has been on a recent rise, with 16 cases reported in the area in 2013; 11 of those cases requiring hospitalization. With all of that being said, the fact remains, pertussis is preventable. \"Pertussis is preventable through vaccine and it is of vital importance that anyone who is around a pregnant female receives their pertussis vaccine,\" said Annette Rodriguez, MPH, Director of Public Health.\n\nDr Jaime Fergie, Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Driscoll Children's Hospital, further stressed this point, stating that the most important thing to prevent pertussis is for pregnant females to receive the vaccination in their 3rd trimester, and for all other relatives who will come into close proximity with the newborn to receive the vaccination [at least] 2 weeks before the baby is due.\n\nAccording to the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District, pertussis is an extremely serious respiratory infection, with the pertussis bacteria attacking the lungs and breathing tubes. It causes uncontrollable coughing.\n\nDr Fergie states that the whooping cough infects adults, and can cause many problems, but when a child under 2 (such as an infant who has not built up a tolerance or acquired the antibodies to fight against the infection) contracts the illness, it can be extremely harmful, or even deadly.\n\nThe death reported on Wed 18 Dec 2013 may be the 1st in 2013, but once again, there is a rising trend in cases. Remember to vaccinate early, in order to prevent more severe cases of pertussis.\n\n[Byline: Jimmy Willden]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/2Jna.

As of 16 Dec 2013, Texas has reported 3482 pertussis cases to the CDC for 2013 and has reported 3 deaths due to pertussis. Texas has not seen case numbers this high since 1959. Over the previous 3 weeks, there have been 3 cases of pertussis reported to the Brownwood/Brown County Health Department. The Brownwood/Brown County Health Department encourages the citizens of Brownwood and Brown County to check vaccination records and get vaccinated for this disease.\n\nPertussis is most harmful to young babies and can be deadly.

The Wood County Health Department is still seeing infections. Public health nurse Diane Rodd says they've had 31 cases of pertussis so far in 2013. \"Approximately 24 out of those 31 have occurred since 1 Nov 2013. So we are seeing an increase.\"\n\nRodd says many of the people being infected are students who are nearly out of date with their shots. \"Because of that, the protection they got in kindergarten is starting to wane, and so they're a little more susceptible.\" The early symptoms are much like catching a cold, but the mild cough progressively worsens to severe coughing spells. These coughing spells can include whooping and vomiting. Health officials say the illness can last nearly 6 weeks, and is contagious if left untreated. A course of antibiotics is available to help lessen the length of the disease, and Rodd says they need to do their job. \"We want to make sure people go through the entire cycle of antibiotics before going out into the public.\"\n\n[Byline: Raymond Neupert]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMx.

Health officials are urging individuals that have a cough, or have a family member that has a cough, that has lasted more than 14 days to see their healthcare provider, and to make sure family member vaccinations are up to date.\n\n\"Pertussis has been circulating at epidemic levels in Colorado for the past couple of years so it's not surprising we're seeing increased cases in our area,\" said Dr Tony Cappello, NCHD's public health director, in the release. \"While this infection can just be a nagging cough for some people, it can be very severe and even deadly for infants and others with compromised immune systems. This is not an illness you want to pass on to an infant that doesn't have the immunity to fight it off; whether it be your own grandchild, a neighbor's new baby, or your own newborn.\n\n\"It can also be very hard to get rid of once it gets in a community,\" continued Dr Cappello. \"Over the course of our case investigations in Phillips County we've had to touch base with several other school districts alerting them to probable exposures at school events. The best thing that people can do if they think they have pertussis is to visit their healthcare provider, stay home if they're ill, cover their cough, stay away from infants, wash their hands, and make sure they're up to date on vaccinations.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Colorado can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMz.

Over the last few years, this once-common childhood illness, also known as whooping cough, has evolved in response to its own vaccine, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe mutated pertussis is not more dangerous than the original, and vaccines against the illness are still effective. So the findings don't change researchers' and doctors' understanding of whooping cough as a public health problem. Instead, they're a glimpse into a fascinating natural phenomenon, and one that's happening as we speak. (Though this isn't the 1st time this has happened. Populations of pneumococcal illnesses changed after the introduction of its vaccine, prompting changes to the vaccine to deal with newly popular strains.) The whooping cough findings have kicked off research to determine whether this is related to the recent increase in whooping cough cases in the US.\n\nPaul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was not involved in the CDC study, but took part in a conference call about the study in which CDC researchers presented their results. He talked with Popular Science over the phone immediately after the call.\n\n\"We discussed the data and what the data allow us to say and what they don't allow us to say,\" he says. \"The data don't support the notion that the mutants are more virulent.\" Babies who fall ill from un-mutated pertussis have the same symptoms as babies who fall ill from mutated pertussis, he says.\n\nThere's also no evidence yet that pertussis vaccines are less effective against the new strains, say all of the researchers Popular Science talked with, both in and outside of the CDC. Everyone recommended Americans continue to get vaccinated right on schedule. \"Currently, we know it's the best form of protection we have,\" says Lucia Pawloski, the CDC scientist who led the new research. Kids who don't get vaccinated against pertussis are still 8 times as likely as vaccinated kids to get the disease, she adds.\n\nNevertheless, it's plausible whooping cough's changes do affect the vaccine's ability to protect. \"Yes, theoretically, there could be an issue, but we don't have any data to say that yet,\" Pawloski says. The CDC is interested in answering this question and hopefully will have data to do so in 6 or 8 months, Offit says.\n\nSo what exactly is different about pertussis nowadays? Since 2010, Pawloski and her colleagues have recorded a sharp rise in the US in strains of the illness that don't make a protein called pertactin. Before 2010, researchers saw only one US pertussis infection, from 1994, in which the bacteria didn't make pertactin. By 2012, the majority of pertussis infections researchers studied were caused by non-pertactin-making pertussis. Pawloski and her team examined 1300 samples taken from whooping cough outbreaks between 1935 and 2012.\n\nPertussis bacteria make thousands of proteins, but pertactin happens to be one of the few included in many forms of the vaccine used in developed countries, including the US. \"We've created this selective pressure,\" Offit says, by widely using vaccines with pertactin in them.\n\nWhen the proteins and other molecules in a vaccine enter your body through a shot, your immune system finds them, learns to recognize them, and develops defenses against them. Now, if you ever truly encounter that illness, your body will respond quickly to quash it. If the vaccine contains pertactin and the actual illness doesn't, that means your body is learning to recognize something that's useless to it when it encounters whooping cough.\n\nAll pertussis vaccines used in developed countries have one, 2, or 3 other pertussis molecules besides pertactin, so there's still stuff in there for your body to train on, even if pertactin is now useless. How much of a blow -- if any at all -- losing pertactin deals to vaccines that have other active molecules is still unclear. \"I think at this point it's hard to say exactly what it means for the vaccines' effectiveness,\" says Nicola Klein, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in California. Klein was not involved in the CDC study.\n\nMeanwhile, pertussis vaccines often used in developing countries contain entire killed _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria, so they actually contain perhaps thousands of things the body is able to use to learn to recognize whooping cough. Those vaccines, which are cheaper to make, were discontinued in developed countries because they cause severe, if non-permanent, side effects, such as seizures in babies.\n\nCDC researchers now are looking into whether losing pertactin is related to another phenomenon associated with the increasing popularity of the newer whooping cough vaccines. Recent studies have found that even those kids who get all their recommended pertussis shots -- in the US administered as the DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis] shot -- are vulnerable again to whooping cough at about age 8 or 10. Researchers think the new vaccine is why the US saw more cases of whooping cough in 2012 than it has in any year since 1955. The older shot, with the killed bacteria, protected people for longer. Scientists are unsure what exactly made the tougher stuff longer-lasting, however.\n\nIs pertussis' evolution the answer? That's not certain yet. \"We couldn't say yes or no at this point whether pertactin had a role in the waning of immunity,\" Pawloski says.\n\n[Byline: Francie Diep]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Palowski's paper, \"Prevalence and molecular characterization of pertactin-deficient _Bordetella pertussis_ in the US.

A Corpus Christi baby of 6 months succumbed to the illness after a lengthy battle, having been hospitalized since 28 Aug 2013. Looking back on their records, the Health District states that the baby's death was the 1st in Corpus Christi for 2013, and may have been the 1st area death in over a decade from pertussis, otherwise known as whooping cough.\n\nA report from the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District states that the level of pertussis cases in Nueces County has been on a recent rise, with 16 cases reported in the area in 2013; 11 of those cases requiring hospitalization. With all of that being said, the fact remains, pertussis is preventable. \"Pertussis is preventable through vaccine and it is of vital importance that anyone who is around a pregnant female receives their pertussis vaccine,\" said Annette Rodriguez, MPH, Director of Public Health.\n\nDr Jaime Fergie, Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Driscoll Children's Hospital, further stressed this point, stating that the most important thing to prevent pertussis is for pregnant females to receive the vaccination in their 3rd trimester, and for all other relatives who will come into close proximity with the newborn to receive the vaccination [at least] 2 weeks before the baby is due.\n\nAccording to the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District, pertussis is an extremely serious respiratory infection, with the pertussis bacteria attacking the lungs and breathing tubes. It causes uncontrollable coughing.\n\nDr Fergie states that the whooping cough infects adults, and can cause many problems, but when a child under 2 (such as an infant who has not built up a tolerance or acquired the antibodies to fight against the infection) contracts the illness, it can be extremely harmful, or even deadly.\n\nThe death reported on Wed 18 Dec 2013 may be the 1st in 2013, but once again, there is a rising trend in cases. Remember to vaccinate early, in order to prevent more severe cases of pertussis.\n\n[Byline: Jimmy Willden]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/2Jna.

As of 16 Dec 2013, Texas has reported 3482 pertussis cases to the CDC for 2013 and has reported 3 deaths due to pertussis. Texas has not seen case numbers this high since 1959. Over the previous 3 weeks, there have been 3 cases of pertussis reported to the Brownwood/Brown County Health Department. The Brownwood/Brown County Health Department encourages the citizens of Brownwood and Brown County to check vaccination records and get vaccinated for this disease.\n\nPertussis is most harmful to young babies and can be deadly.

The Wood County Health Department is still seeing infections. Public health nurse Diane Rodd says they've had 31 cases of pertussis so far in 2013. \"Approximately 24 out of those 31 have occurred since 1 Nov 2013. So we are seeing an increase.\"\n\nRodd says many of the people being infected are students who are nearly out of date with their shots. \"Because of that, the protection they got in kindergarten is starting to wane, and so they're a little more susceptible.\" The early symptoms are much like catching a cold, but the mild cough progressively worsens to severe coughing spells. These coughing spells can include whooping and vomiting. Health officials say the illness can last nearly 6 weeks, and is contagious if left untreated. A course of antibiotics is available to help lessen the length of the disease, and Rodd says they need to do their job. \"We want to make sure people go through the entire cycle of antibiotics before going out into the public.\"\n\n[Byline: Raymond Neupert]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMx.

Health officials are urging individuals that have a cough, or have a family member that has a cough, that has lasted more than 14 days to see their healthcare provider, and to make sure family member vaccinations are up to date.\n\n\"Pertussis has been circulating at epidemic levels in Colorado for the past couple of years so it's not surprising we're seeing increased cases in our area,\" said Dr Tony Cappello, NCHD's public health director, in the release. \"While this infection can just be a nagging cough for some people, it can be very severe and even deadly for infants and others with compromised immune systems. This is not an illness you want to pass on to an infant that doesn't have the immunity to fight it off; whether it be your own grandchild, a neighbor's new baby, or your own newborn.\n\n\"It can also be very hard to get rid of once it gets in a community,\" continued Dr Cappello. \"Over the course of our case investigations in Phillips County we've had to touch base with several other school districts alerting them to probable exposures at school events. The best thing that people can do if they think they have pertussis is to visit their healthcare provider, stay home if they're ill, cover their cough, stay away from infants, wash their hands, and make sure they're up to date on vaccinations.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Colorado can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMz.

Over the last few years, this once-common childhood illness, also known as whooping cough, has evolved in response to its own vaccine, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe mutated pertussis is not more dangerous than the original, and vaccines against the illness are still effective. So the findings don't change researchers' and doctors' understanding of whooping cough as a public health problem. Instead, they're a glimpse into a fascinating natural phenomenon, and one that's happening as we speak. (Though this isn't the 1st time this has happened. Populations of pneumococcal illnesses changed after the introduction of its vaccine, prompting changes to the vaccine to deal with newly popular strains.) The whooping cough findings have kicked off research to determine whether this is related to the recent increase in whooping cough cases in the US.\n\nPaul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was not involved in the CDC study, but took part in a conference call about the study in which CDC researchers presented their results. He talked with Popular Science over the phone immediately after the call.\n\n\"We discussed the data and what the data allow us to say and what they don't allow us to say,\" he says. \"The data don't support the notion that the mutants are more virulent.\" Babies who fall ill from un-mutated pertussis have the same symptoms as babies who fall ill from mutated pertussis, he says.\n\nThere's also no evidence yet that pertussis vaccines are less effective against the new strains, say all of the researchers Popular Science talked with, both in and outside of the CDC. Everyone recommended Americans continue to get vaccinated right on schedule. \"Currently, we know it's the best form of protection we have,\" says Lucia Pawloski, the CDC scientist who led the new research. Kids who don't get vaccinated against pertussis are still 8 times as likely as vaccinated kids to get the disease, she adds.\n\nNevertheless, it's plausible whooping cough's changes do affect the vaccine's ability to protect. \"Yes, theoretically, there could be an issue, but we don't have any data to say that yet,\" Pawloski says. The CDC is interested in answering this question and hopefully will have data to do so in 6 or 8 months, Offit says.\n\nSo what exactly is different about pertussis nowadays? Since 2010, Pawloski and her colleagues have recorded a sharp rise in the US in strains of the illness that don't make a protein called pertactin. Before 2010, researchers saw only one US pertussis infection, from 1994, in which the bacteria didn't make pertactin. By 2012, the majority of pertussis infections researchers studied were caused by non-pertactin-making pertussis. Pawloski and her team examined 1300 samples taken from whooping cough outbreaks between 1935 and 2012.\n\nPertussis bacteria make thousands of proteins, but pertactin happens to be one of the few included in many forms of the vaccine used in developed countries, including the US. \"We've created this selective pressure,\" Offit says, by widely using vaccines with pertactin in them.\n\nWhen the proteins and other molecules in a vaccine enter your body through a shot, your immune system finds them, learns to recognize them, and develops defenses against them. Now, if you ever truly encounter that illness, your body will respond quickly to quash it. If the vaccine contains pertactin and the actual illness doesn't, that means your body is learning to recognize something that's useless to it when it encounters whooping cough.\n\nAll pertussis vaccines used in developed countries have one, 2, or 3 other pertussis molecules besides pertactin, so there's still stuff in there for your body to train on, even if pertactin is now useless. How much of a blow -- if any at all -- losing pertactin deals to vaccines that have other active molecules is still unclear. \"I think at this point it's hard to say exactly what it means for the vaccines' effectiveness,\" says Nicola Klein, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in California. Klein was not involved in the CDC study.\n\nMeanwhile, pertussis vaccines often used in developing countries contain entire killed _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria, so they actually contain perhaps thousands of things the body is able to use to learn to recognize whooping cough. Those vaccines, which are cheaper to make, were discontinued in developed countries because they cause severe, if non-permanent, side effects, such as seizures in babies.\n\nCDC researchers now are looking into whether losing pertactin is related to another phenomenon associated with the increasing popularity of the newer whooping cough vaccines. Recent studies have found that even those kids who get all their recommended pertussis shots -- in the US administered as the DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis] shot -- are vulnerable again to whooping cough at about age 8 or 10. Researchers think the new vaccine is why the US saw more cases of whooping cough in 2012 than it has in any year since 1955. The older shot, with the killed bacteria, protected people for longer. Scientists are unsure what exactly made the tougher stuff longer-lasting, however.\n\nIs pertussis' evolution the answer? That's not certain yet. \"We couldn't say yes or no at this point whether pertactin had a role in the waning of immunity,\" Pawloski says.\n\n[Byline: Francie Diep]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Palowski's paper, \"Prevalence and molecular characterization of pertactin-deficient _Bordetella pertussis_ in the US. Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2013 Nov 20. [Epub ahead of print] can be found at http://www.asm.org/images/Communications/tips/2013/1213pertussis.pdf.\n\nThe number of cases of pertussis over time tends to have upswing cycles every 3-5 years but the case increases have been greater and more prolonged in the past several years. Utah is just one of a number of USA states including Washington and Wisconsin that have had substantial increase in the disease with, in addition, infant deaths related to cases transmitted by family members. Most up-to-date ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations continue to increase vaccination recommendations to order to \"cocoon\" the susceptible infant cohort. The most recent recommendations include re-vaccination for pregnant women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester for each pregnancy (1).\n\nIn addition to the Tartlof paper (2), an additional recent publication, currently in press in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilizes a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and clearly shows that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Looking back on their records, the Health District states that the baby's death was the 1st in Corpus Christi for 2013, and may have been the 1st area death in over a decade from pertussis, otherwise known as whooping cough.\n\nA report from the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District states that the level of pertussis cases in Nueces County has been on a recent rise, with 16 cases reported in the area in 2013; 11 of those cases requiring hospitalization. With all of that being said, the fact remains, pertussis is preventable. \"Pertussis is preventable through vaccine and it is of vital importance that anyone who is around a pregnant female receives their pertussis vaccine,\" said Annette Rodriguez, MPH, Director of Public Health.\n\nDr Jaime Fergie, Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Driscoll Children's Hospital, further stressed this point, stating that the most important thing to prevent pertussis is for pregnant females to receive the vaccination in their 3rd trimester, and for all other relatives who will come into close proximity with the newborn to receive the vaccination [at least] 2 weeks before the baby is due.\n\nAccording to the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District, pertussis is an extremely serious respiratory infection, with the pertussis bacteria attacking the lungs and breathing tubes. It causes uncontrollable coughing.\n\nDr Fergie states that the whooping cough infects adults, and can cause many problems, but when a child under 2 (such as an infant who has not built up a tolerance or acquired the antibodies to fight against the infection) contracts the illness, it can be extremely harmful, or even deadly.\n\nThe death reported on Wed 18 Dec 2013 may be the 1st in 2013, but once again, there is a rising trend in cases.

The Wood County Health Department is still seeing infections. Public health nurse Diane Rodd says they've had 31 cases of pertussis so far in 2013. \"Approximately 24 out of those 31 have occurred since 1 Nov 2013. So we are seeing an increase.\"\n\nRodd says many of the people being infected are students who are nearly out of date with their shots. \"Because of that, the protection they got in kindergarten is starting to wane, and so they're a little more susceptible.\" The early symptoms are much like catching a cold, but the mild cough progressively worsens to severe coughing spells. These coughing spells can include whooping and vomiting. Health officials say the illness can last nearly 6 weeks, and is contagious if left untreated. A course of antibiotics is available to help lessen the length of the disease, and Rodd says they need to do their job. \"We want to make sure people go through the entire cycle of antibiotics before going out into the public.\"\n\n[Byline: Raymond Neupert]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMx.

Health officials are urging individuals that have a cough, or have a family member that has a cough, that has lasted more than 14 days to see their healthcare provider, and to make sure family member vaccinations are up to date.\n\n\"Pertussis has been circulating at epidemic levels in Colorado for the past couple of years so it's not surprising we're seeing increased cases in our area,\" said Dr Tony Cappello, NCHD's public health director, in the release. \"While this infection can just be a nagging cough for some people, it can be very severe and even deadly for infants and others with compromised immune systems. This is not an illness you want to pass on to an infant that doesn't have the immunity to fight it off; whether it be your own grandchild, a neighbor's new baby, or your own newborn.\n\n\"It can also be very hard to get rid of once it gets in a community,\" continued Dr Cappello. \"Over the course of our case investigations in Phillips County we've had to touch base with several other school districts alerting them to probable exposures at school events. The best thing that people can do if they think they have pertussis is to visit their healthcare provider, stay home if they're ill, cover their cough, stay away from infants, wash their hands, and make sure they're up to date on vaccinations.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Colorado can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMz.

Over the last few years, this once-common childhood illness, also known as whooping cough, has evolved in response to its own vaccine, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe mutated pertussis is not more dangerous than the original, and vaccines against the illness are still effective. So the findings don't change researchers' and doctors' understanding of whooping cough as a public health problem. Instead, they're a glimpse into a fascinating natural phenomenon, and one that's happening as we speak. (Though this isn't the 1st time this has happened. Populations of pneumococcal illnesses changed after the introduction of its vaccine, prompting changes to the vaccine to deal with newly popular strains.) The whooping cough findings have kicked off research to determine whether this is related to the recent increase in whooping cough cases in the US.\n\nPaul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was not involved in the CDC study, but took part in a conference call about the study in which CDC researchers presented their results. He talked with Popular Science over the phone immediately after the call.\n\n\"We discussed the data and what the data allow us to say and what they don't allow us to say,\" he says. \"The data don't support the notion that the mutants are more virulent.\" Babies who fall ill from un-mutated pertussis have the same symptoms as babies who fall ill from mutated pertussis, he says.\n\nThere's also no evidence yet that pertussis vaccines are less effective against the new strains, say all of the researchers Popular Science talked with, both in and outside of the CDC. Everyone recommended Americans continue to get vaccinated right on schedule. \"Currently, we know it's the best form of protection we have,\" says Lucia Pawloski, the CDC scientist who led the new research. Kids who don't get vaccinated against pertussis are still 8 times as likely as vaccinated kids to get the disease, she adds.\n\nNevertheless, it's plausible whooping cough's changes do affect the vaccine's ability to protect. \"Yes, theoretically, there could be an issue, but we don't have any data to say that yet,\" Pawloski says. The CDC is interested in answering this question and hopefully will have data to do so in 6 or 8 months, Offit says.\n\nSo what exactly is different about pertussis nowadays? Since 2010, Pawloski and her colleagues have recorded a sharp rise in the US in strains of the illness that don't make a protein called pertactin. Before 2010, researchers saw only one US pertussis infection, from 1994, in which the bacteria didn't make pertactin. By 2012, the majority of pertussis infections researchers studied were caused by non-pertactin-making pertussis. Pawloski and her team examined 1300 samples taken from whooping cough outbreaks between 1935 and 2012.\n\nPertussis bacteria make thousands of proteins, but pertactin happens to be one of the few included in many forms of the vaccine used in developed countries, including the US. \"We've created this selective pressure,\" Offit says, by widely using vaccines with pertactin in them.\n\nWhen the proteins and other molecules in a vaccine enter your body through a shot, your immune system finds them, learns to recognize them, and develops defenses against them. Now, if you ever truly encounter that illness, your body will respond quickly to quash it. If the vaccine contains pertactin and the actual illness doesn't, that means your body is learning to recognize something that's useless to it when it encounters whooping cough.\n\nAll pertussis vaccines used in developed countries have one, 2, or 3 other pertussis molecules besides pertactin, so there's still stuff in there for your body to train on, even if pertactin is now useless. How much of a blow -- if any at all -- losing pertactin deals to vaccines that have other active molecules is still unclear. \"I think at this point it's hard to say exactly what it means for the vaccines' effectiveness,\" says Nicola Klein, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in California. Klein was not involved in the CDC study.\n\nMeanwhile, pertussis vaccines often used in developing countries contain entire killed _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria, so they actually contain perhaps thousands of things the body is able to use to learn to recognize whooping cough. Those vaccines, which are cheaper to make, were discontinued in developed countries because they cause severe, if non-permanent, side effects, such as seizures in babies.\n\nCDC researchers now are looking into whether losing pertactin is related to another phenomenon associated with the increasing popularity of the newer whooping cough vaccines. Recent studies have found that even those kids who get all their recommended pertussis shots -- in the US administered as the DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis] shot -- are vulnerable again to whooping cough at about age 8 or 10. Researchers think the new vaccine is why the US saw more cases of whooping cough in 2012 than it has in any year since 1955. The older shot, with the killed bacteria, protected people for longer. Scientists are unsure what exactly made the tougher stuff longer-lasting, however.\n\nIs pertussis' evolution the answer? That's not certain yet. \"We couldn't say yes or no at this point whether pertactin had a role in the waning of immunity,\" Pawloski says.\n\n[Byline: Francie Diep]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Palowski's paper, \"Prevalence and molecular characterization of pertactin-deficient _Bordetella pertussis_ in the US. Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2013 Nov 20. [Epub ahead of print] can be found at http://www.asm.org/images/Communications/tips/2013/1213pertussis.pdf.\n\nThe number of cases of pertussis over time tends to have upswing cycles every 3-5 years but the case increases have been greater and more prolonged in the past several years. Utah is just one of a number of USA states including Washington and Wisconsin that have had substantial increase in the disease with, in addition, infant deaths related to cases transmitted by family members. Most up-to-date ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations continue to increase vaccination recommendations to order to \"cocoon\" the susceptible infant cohort. The most recent recommendations include re-vaccination for pregnant women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester for each pregnancy (1).\n\nIn addition to the Tartlof paper (2), an additional recent publication, currently in press in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilizes a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and clearly shows that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

With all of that being said, the fact remains, pertussis is preventable. \"Pertussis is preventable through vaccine and it is of vital importance that anyone who is around a pregnant female receives their pertussis vaccine,\" said Annette Rodriguez, MPH, Director of Public Health.\n\nDr Jaime Fergie, Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Driscoll Children's Hospital, further stressed this point, stating that the most important thing to prevent pertussis is for pregnant females to receive the vaccination in their 3rd trimester, and for all other relatives who will come into close proximity with the newborn to receive the vaccination [at least] 2 weeks before the baby is due.\n\nAccording to the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District, pertussis is an extremely serious respiratory infection, with the pertussis bacteria attacking the lungs and breathing tubes. It causes uncontrollable coughing.\n\nDr Fergie states that the whooping cough infects adults, and can cause many problems, but when a child under 2 (such as an infant who has not built up a tolerance or acquired the antibodies to fight against the infection) contracts the illness, it can be extremely harmful, or even deadly.\n\nThe death reported on Wed 18 Dec 2013 may be the 1st in 2013, but once again, there is a rising trend in cases. Remember to vaccinate early, in order to prevent more severe cases of pertussis.\n\n[Byline: Jimmy Willden]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/2Jna.

The Wood County Health Department is still seeing infections. Public health nurse Diane Rodd says they've had 31 cases of pertussis so far in 2013. \"Approximately 24 out of those 31 have occurred since 1 Nov 2013. So we are seeing an increase.\"\n\nRodd says many of the people being infected are students who are nearly out of date with their shots. \"Because of that, the protection they got in kindergarten is starting to wane, and so they're a little more susceptible.\" The early symptoms are much like catching a cold, but the mild cough progressively worsens to severe coughing spells. These coughing spells can include whooping and vomiting. Health officials say the illness can last nearly 6 weeks, and is contagious if left untreated. A course of antibiotics is available to help lessen the length of the disease, and Rodd says they need to do their job. \"We want to make sure people go through the entire cycle of antibiotics before going out into the public.\"\n\n[Byline: Raymond Neupert]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMx.

Health officials are urging individuals that have a cough, or have a family member that has a cough, that has lasted more than 14 days to see their healthcare provider, and to make sure family member vaccinations are up to date.\n\n\"Pertussis has been circulating at epidemic levels in Colorado for the past couple of years so it's not surprising we're seeing increased cases in our area,\" said Dr Tony Cappello, NCHD's public health director, in the release. \"While this infection can just be a nagging cough for some people, it can be very severe and even deadly for infants and others with compromised immune systems. This is not an illness you want to pass on to an infant that doesn't have the immunity to fight it off; whether it be your own grandchild, a neighbor's new baby, or your own newborn.\n\n\"It can also be very hard to get rid of once it gets in a community,\" continued Dr Cappello. \"Over the course of our case investigations in Phillips County we've had to touch base with several other school districts alerting them to probable exposures at school events. The best thing that people can do if they think they have pertussis is to visit their healthcare provider, stay home if they're ill, cover their cough, stay away from infants, wash their hands, and make sure they're up to date on vaccinations.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Colorado can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMz.

Over the last few years, this once-common childhood illness, also known as whooping cough, has evolved in response to its own vaccine, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe mutated pertussis is not more dangerous than the original, and vaccines against the illness are still effective. So the findings don't change researchers' and doctors' understanding of whooping cough as a public health problem. Instead, they're a glimpse into a fascinating natural phenomenon, and one that's happening as we speak. (Though this isn't the 1st time this has happened. Populations of pneumococcal illnesses changed after the introduction of its vaccine, prompting changes to the vaccine to deal with newly popular strains.) The whooping cough findings have kicked off research to determine whether this is related to the recent increase in whooping cough cases in the US.\n\nPaul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was not involved in the CDC study, but took part in a conference call about the study in which CDC researchers presented their results. He talked with Popular Science over the phone immediately after the call.\n\n\"We discussed the data and what the data allow us to say and what they don't allow us to say,\" he says. \"The data don't support the notion that the mutants are more virulent.\" Babies who fall ill from un-mutated pertussis have the same symptoms as babies who fall ill from mutated pertussis, he says.\n\nThere's also no evidence yet that pertussis vaccines are less effective against the new strains, say all of the researchers Popular Science talked with, both in and outside of the CDC. Everyone recommended Americans continue to get vaccinated right on schedule. \"Currently, we know it's the best form of protection we have,\" says Lucia Pawloski, the CDC scientist who led the new research. Kids who don't get vaccinated against pertussis are still 8 times as likely as vaccinated kids to get the disease, she adds.\n\nNevertheless, it's plausible whooping cough's changes do affect the vaccine's ability to protect. \"Yes, theoretically, there could be an issue, but we don't have any data to say that yet,\" Pawloski says. The CDC is interested in answering this question and hopefully will have data to do so in 6 or 8 months, Offit says.\n\nSo what exactly is different about pertussis nowadays? Since 2010, Pawloski and her colleagues have recorded a sharp rise in the US in strains of the illness that don't make a protein called pertactin. Before 2010, researchers saw only one US pertussis infection, from 1994, in which the bacteria didn't make pertactin. By 2012, the majority of pertussis infections researchers studied were caused by non-pertactin-making pertussis. Pawloski and her team examined 1300 samples taken from whooping cough outbreaks between 1935 and 2012.\n\nPertussis bacteria make thousands of proteins, but pertactin happens to be one of the few included in many forms of the vaccine used in developed countries, including the US. \"We've created this selective pressure,\" Offit says, by widely using vaccines with pertactin in them.\n\nWhen the proteins and other molecules in a vaccine enter your body through a shot, your immune system finds them, learns to recognize them, and develops defenses against them. Now, if you ever truly encounter that illness, your body will respond quickly to quash it. If the vaccine contains pertactin and the actual illness doesn't, that means your body is learning to recognize something that's useless to it when it encounters whooping cough.\n\nAll pertussis vaccines used in developed countries have one, 2, or 3 other pertussis molecules besides pertactin, so there's still stuff in there for your body to train on, even if pertactin is now useless. How much of a blow -- if any at all -- losing pertactin deals to vaccines that have other active molecules is still unclear. \"I think at this point it's hard to say exactly what it means for the vaccines' effectiveness,\" says Nicola Klein, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in California. Klein was not involved in the CDC study.\n\nMeanwhile, pertussis vaccines often used in developing countries contain entire killed _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria, so they actually contain perhaps thousands of things the body is able to use to learn to recognize whooping cough. Those vaccines, which are cheaper to make, were discontinued in developed countries because they cause severe, if non-permanent, side effects, such as seizures in babies.\n\nCDC researchers now are looking into whether losing pertactin is related to another phenomenon associated with the increasing popularity of the newer whooping cough vaccines. Recent studies have found that even those kids who get all their recommended pertussis shots -- in the US administered as the DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis] shot -- are vulnerable again to whooping cough at about age 8 or 10. Researchers think the new vaccine is why the US saw more cases of whooping cough in 2012 than it has in any year since 1955. The older shot, with the killed bacteria, protected people for longer. Scientists are unsure what exactly made the tougher stuff longer-lasting, however.\n\nIs pertussis' evolution the answer? That's not certain yet. \"We couldn't say yes or no at this point whether pertactin had a role in the waning of immunity,\" Pawloski says.\n\n[Byline: Francie Diep]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Palowski's paper, \"Prevalence and molecular characterization of pertactin-deficient _Bordetella pertussis_ in the US. Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2013 Nov 20. [Epub ahead of print] can be found at http://www.asm.org/images/Communications/tips/2013/1213pertussis.pdf.\n\nThe number of cases of pertussis over time tends to have upswing cycles every 3-5 years but the case increases have been greater and more prolonged in the past several years. Utah is just one of a number of USA states including Washington and Wisconsin that have had substantial increase in the disease with, in addition, infant deaths related to cases transmitted by family members. Most up-to-date ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations continue to increase vaccination recommendations to order to \"cocoon\" the susceptible infant cohort. The most recent recommendations include re-vaccination for pregnant women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester for each pregnancy (1).\n\nIn addition to the Tartlof paper (2), an additional recent publication, currently in press in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilizes a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and clearly shows that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The District Department of Health [SDS by its Spanish initials] confirmed that this number almost doubles the 14 fatal cases recorded in 2011. Most of the victims were younger than one year, according to SDS epidemiologist Patricia Arce.\n\nThe National Institute of Health [INS by its Spanish initials] in turn reported that between January and September 2012, 589 cases of pertussis were confirmed in Bogota, 21 percent of all cases diagnosed in the country. Bogota is 2nd to Antioquia, with the most confirmed cases, mostly in children under 5 years.\n\nThe concern of health authorities is that pertussis is easily transmitted by saliva droplets when you cough or sneeze.\n\nIn Bogota, most sick children were infected by their parents. \"Newborns are most susceptible to infection because their immune system still does not have enough defenses against disease,\" explained Arce.\n\nSome health experts questioned the reemergence of pertussis, since a vaccine has been available for 50 years, and there are teams in the city which supposedly visit households to identify children requiring completion of their vaccination schedule. [But many were in children who were too young to be vaccinated. - Mod.JW].\n\nPertussis is caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_. It is transmitted by the respiratory route, has an incubation period of 6 to 20 days, and can last an average of 7 weeks or more. It begins with a catarrhal phase, and its characteristic symptom is persistent cough or wheezing with noise, which makes breathing difficult. In children, it can lead to breathing difficulties that last [for several] seconds, making them turn blue or purple and requiring urgent care.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[2012 has been a dramatic year for pertussis throughout most of the world. Although there is some evidence for genetic changes in the strains, it is clear that the less reactogenic acellular pertussis vaccine has a shorter length of protection than the older whole cell, killed vaccine.\n\nAs is reported in this posting, much of the morbidity and mortality with this infection is in infants less than one year of age, especially less than 6 months, when they are not yet protected by active immunization. To protect this susceptible cohort, all care givers should have been given a TDap booster, and the pregnant mother should also be immunized in the 2nd or 3rd trimester to transplacentally provide maternal antibody. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1l0z.]\nSee Also\nPertussis - UK (03) 20120710.1196457\nPertussis - New Zealand (03): update 20120706.1190855\nPertussis - Argentina (03): (MZ) 20120703.1188519\nPertussis - UK (02): background 20120608.1161130\nPertussis - UK 20120607.1159983\nPertussis - New Zealand (02): background 20120606.1158351\nPertussis - New Zealand: (Auckland) 20120605.1157147\nPertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115\nPertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103\nPertussis - Australia (02): (QL) 20120316.1071497\nPertussis - Canada: (BC) 20120229.1055490\nPertussis - Australia: (WA) 20120111.1007036\n2011\n----\nPertussis, fatal - Chile: (BI) 20111206.3541\nPertussis - New Zealand 20111030.3227\n2010\n----\nPertussis - Australia: (QL) 20101021.3809\nPertussis - New Zealand: (CA) 20100626.2133\nPertussis - Congo DR: (KO) 20100428.1372\n2009\n----\nPertussis - Australia (02): (SA) 20091108.3876\nPertussis - Australia: (SA) 20091107.3842\nUndiagnosed resp. deaths - Nicaragua: (JI), pertussis, susp., RFI 20090404.1306\n2006\n----\nPertussis - Papua New Guinea (East Sepik) 20060612.1641\n2005\n----\nPertussis, fatal - Afghanistan (Daykundi) 20050125.0274\n2003\n----\nPertussis - Sudan (Equatoria): conf.

There are outbreaks in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph, Perth, Oxford, Elgin-St. Thomas, Haldimand-Norfolk and the Windsor-Essex areas. People in the households of the local kids involved and high-risk contacts have been offered preventative treatment with antibiotics.\n\nThe release was issued to remind people that immunization is the best protection against whooping cough or pertussis, health unit spokesman Drew Ferguson said.\n\nOne to 3 deaths from pertussis occur each year in Canada, usually in infants too young to have begun their immunization and in partially immunized infants. The Ontario outbreaks occurred among people who were not immunized, typically among Mennonites, Ferguson said. Locally though, the health unit has had success bringing immunization clinics to local Mennonites, he said.\n\n[Byline: Scott Dunn]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Unlike most if the outbreaks that have been posted on ProMED, it seems that much of the pertussis burden in Ontario, Canada has been occurring in a religious cohort in the province that had not been immunized. - Mod.LL\n\nOntario, Canada, can be located using the HealthMap/ProMEDmail interactive map at:\nhttp://healthmap.org/r/1*Y3. - CopyEd.EJP]\nSee Also\nPertussis - UK (02): background 20120608.1161130\nPertussis - UK 20120607.1159983\nPertussis - New Zealand (02): background 20120606.1158351\nPertussis - New Zealand: (Auckland) 20120605.1157147\nPertussis - Canada (04): (NB) 20120523.1142647\nPertussis - Canada (03): (YT) 20120502.1120666\nPertussis - Canada (02): (ON) unimmunized group 20120410.1094957\nPertussis - Chile (02): background 20120409.1094968\nPertussis - Chile: increased morbidity & mortality 20120404.1090350\nPertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115\nPertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103\nPertussis - Australia (02): (QL) 20120316.1071497\nPertussis - Canada: (BC) 20120229.1055490\nPertussis - Australia: (WA) 20120111.1007036\n2011\n----\nPertussis, fatal - Chile: (BI) 20111206.3541\nPertussis - New Zealand 20111030.3227\n2010\n----\nPertussis - Australia: (QL) 20101021.3809\nPertussis - New Zealand: (CA) 20100626.2133\nPertussis - Congo DR: (KO) 20100428.1372\n2009\n----\nPertussis - Australia (02): (SA) 20091108.3876\nPertussis - Australia: (SA) 20091107.3842\nUndiagnosed resp. deaths - Nicaragua: (JI), pertussis, susp., RFI 20090404.1306\n2006\n----\nPertussis - Papua New Guinea (East Sepik) 20060612.1641\n2005\n----\nPertussis, fatal - Afghanistan (Daykundi) 20050125.0274\n2003\n----\nPertussis - Sudan (Equatoria): conf.

The use of the vaccine in pregnant women to provide passive immunity is a further expansion of these recommendations. It is likely, given the limited number of contacts small infants have, that the source for the infant is a family member.\n\nThe increasing susceptibility of older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical \"whoop,\" after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported.

The issue was raised this week during a board meeting of Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.\n\nPertussis, commonly referred to as whooping cough, is highly contagious. Its presence was first confirmed in the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph area on 15 Feb 2012, but the outbreak was declared elsewhere in late January 2012. The local health unit is one of 7 dealing with the problem.\n\nDr Nicola Mercer, medical officer of health, told board members that since the Low German Mennonite population generally does not seek medical attention or vaccination, fighting the outbreak is extremely difficult. She said public health officials are confident there are many other cases of whooping cough among the population. Immunization clinics have been set up, but are poorly attended.\n\nSo far 4 children have been hospitalized throughout the 7 health units. The family in the one case in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph was provided access to antibiotic medications to treat the disease. The family refused immunization.\n\nAn outbreak roughly 2 years ago among the same Mennonite population left a number of people very sick. \"They continue to have an under-immunized population, so we likely will continue to have outbreaks,\" Mercer said, adding that whooping cause can cause death. The most vulnerable are the very young. She added that an 85 percent immunization rate is generally what is needed to have a serious impact on a disease.\n\nThe hardest hit area so far is within the Elgin-St Thomas health unit, where there are 64 cases. Of the 82 confirmed cases within the district of the 7 health units, the median age of infection is 7 years.\n\nThe outbreak is occurring among members of the same religious community, who attend the same schools and churches.\n\n[Byline: Rob O'Flanagan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most of the ProMED-mail postings regarding pertussis have been related to outbreaks in immunized populations. When an outbreak occurs in a population that does not access vaccinations for religious reasons, the manifestations of the outbreak can be more severe and these individuals can serve as vehicles for transmission to others outside the religious community. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/29My.]\nSee Also\nPertussis - Chile (02): background 20120409.1094968\nPertussis - Chile: increased morbidity & mortality 20120404.1090350\nPertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115\nPertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103\nPertussis - Australia (02): (QL) 20120316.1071497\nPertussis - Canada: (BC) 20120229.1055490\nPertussis - Australia: (WA) 20120111.1007036\n2011\n----\nPertussis, fatal - Chile: (BI) 20111206.3541\nPertussis - New Zealand 20111030.3227\n2010\n----\nPertussis - Australia: (QL) 20101021.3809\nPertussis - New Zealand: (CA) 20100626.2133\nPertussis - Congo DR: (KO) 20100428.1372\n2009\n----\nPertussis - Australia (02): (SA) 20091108.3876\nPertussis - Australia: (SA) 20091107.3842\nUndiagnosed resp. deaths - Nicaragua: (JI), pertussis, susp., RFI 20090404.1306\n2006\n----\nPertussis - Papua New Guinea (East Sepik) 20060612.1641\n2005\n----\nPertussis, fatal - Afghanistan (Daykundi) 20050125.0274\n2003\n----\nPertussis - Sudan (Equatoria): conf.

The issue was raised this week during a board meeting of Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.\n\nPertussis, commonly referred to as whooping cough, is highly contagious. Its presence was first confirmed in the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph area on 15 Feb 2012, but the outbreak was declared elsewhere in late January 2012. The local health unit is one of 7 dealing with the problem.\n\nDr Nicola Mercer, medical officer of health, told board members that since the Low German Mennonite population generally does not seek medical attention or vaccination, fighting the outbreak is extremely difficult. She said public health officials are confident there are many other cases of whooping cough among the population. Immunization clinics have been set up, but are poorly attended.\n\nSo far 4 children have been hospitalized throughout the 7 health units. The family in the one case in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph was provided access to antibiotic medications to treat the disease. The family refused immunization.\n\nAn outbreak roughly 2 years ago among the same Mennonite population left a number of people very sick. \"They continue to have an under-immunized population, so we likely will continue to have outbreaks,\" Mercer said, adding that whooping cause can cause death. The most vulnerable are the very young. She added that an 85 percent immunization rate is generally what is needed to have a serious impact on a disease.\n\nThe hardest hit area so far is within the Elgin-St Thomas health unit, where there are 64 cases. Of the 82 confirmed cases within the district of the 7 health units, the median age of infection is 7 years.\n\nThe outbreak is occurring among members of the same religious community, who attend the same schools and churches.\n\n[Byline: Rob O'Flanagan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most of the ProMED-mail postings regarding pertussis have been related to outbreaks in immunized populations.

Officials say 18 cases have been recorded throughout the county since January 2012, but there could be quite a few more cases that haven't been reported. The County Public Health Department says at least 5 school districts have confirmed cases of whooping cough. The Health Department recommends vaccinations as one of the best ways to avoid contracting pertussis.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines in the USA continue to expand in efforts of continue to cocoon susceptible neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not been yet adequately immunized. The use of the vaccine in pregnant women further expands these recommendations.\n\nThe increasing susceptibility in older children and adults to pertussis usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical \"whoop\" after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem but other issues may be at work.\n\nFrom the moderator LL's comments in a prior ProMED post Pertussis - USA: (MN) 20100514.1573:\n\n\"Cases of pertussis in previously vaccinated older children and adults are generally attributed to waning immunity without considering potential differences in _Bordetella pertussis_ strains. As pointed out in 2009 by Dr Frits Mooi (ProMED-mail Pertussis - Australia (02): (SA) 20091108.3876): There are now many studies which show that outbreaks of pertussis are often associated with changes in the _B. pertussis_ population. Most recently, we have shown that more virulent (P3) strains have appeared which we believe to be (partly) responsible for the outbreak in the Netherlands. The P3 strains have emerged worldwide. Any discussion on the causes of sudden upsurges in infectious diseases should include changes in the pathogen population.

Even if an infant has started the series of shots\nusually given at 2, 4, and 6 months, if they haven't completed the\nseries, their parents and anyone else who cares for them should get\nimmunized.

Babies are most vulnerable as they are too\nyoung to be [fully] immunized, and rely upon \"herd immunity\", the high\nimmunisation of those around them.\n\nSA Health has received almost 3500 reports in 2009, compared with 859 at\nthe same time in 2008 and 318 in 2007. National statistics show the rate in\nSouth Australia is twice as high as the national average. A 4 week old NSW\nbaby who died in March 2009 was the 1st fatality from the disease in a\ndecade. Since then it is understood 2 other children have died.\n\nSA Health Communicable Disease Control branch director Dr Ann Koehler said\nnationally there had been a \"big wave\" of infections. She said SA had the\nhighest rate, although it was not clear why. Dr Koehler said more cases\nwere being diagnosed as people were tested for swine flu.

Babies are most vulnerable as they are too\nyoung to be [fully] immunized, and rely upon \"herd immunity\", the high\nimmunisation of those around them.\n\nSA Health has received almost 3500 reports in 2009, compared with 859 at\nthe same time in 2008 and 318 in 2007. National statistics show the rate in\nSouth Australia is twice as high as the national average. A 4 week old NSW\nbaby who died in March 2009 was the 1st fatality from the disease in a\ndecade. Since then it is understood 2 other children have died.\n\nSA Health Communicable Disease Control branch director Dr Ann Koehler said\nnationally there had been a \"big wave\" of infections. She said SA had the\nhighest rate, although it was not clear why. Dr Koehler said more cases\nwere being diagnosed as people were tested for swine flu. She said SA had\nrecorded the highest number of notifications since records started being\nkept in 1991, and warned that people needed to be vigilant about\nvaccinations to protect vulnerable children.\n\n\"The highest rates of infection we're seeing are children who are too young\nto be vaccinated,\" Dr Koehler said. \"With children, brain damage can be a\nreally serious complication. While they're trying to cough, they stop\nbreathing. Little children also get hernias and might need surgery to fix\nthat.\"\n\nAbout 95 per cent of SA children are immunized, but Dr Koehler said SA\nHealth was concerned about some people's resistance to or complacency about\nvaccinating children. She warned homeopathic \"vaccines\" did not work.\n\"That's wasting your money ... you're putting yourself, your children and\nother people's children at risk,\" she said.\n\n[byline: Tory Shepard]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail and HealthMap\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In assessing the durability of pertussis vaccination in children, some\nresearchers noted that \"Reported cases and outbreaks in older children and\nyoung adults may reflect a less durable vaccine-induced protection than\nseen in natural disease (Cherry JD, Brunell PA, Golden GA, Karzon, DT.\nReport of the task force on pertussis and pertussis immunization - 1988.\nPediatrics 1988; 81(June Suppl): 955).

In contrast, only 5 _B. holmesii_ isolates were\nidentified during the same period. As such, we think it unlikely that\n_B. holmesii_ is a major contributor to increased local pertussis\nrates.

Indeed, all 5\nisolates initially identified at the Ontario Central Public Health\nLaboratory grew on Regan-Lowe charcoal agar with 20 ug/ml cephalexin,\nand we have been able to grow all 6 isolates (a 6th isolate was\nforwarded to us for reference identification) in the presence of up\nto 40 ug/ml cephalexin.

Nonetheless,\nof 1340 specimens that tested positive for pertussis between January\n2005 and March 2007, 104 (7.8 percent) were culture positive for _B.\npertussis_. In contrast, only 5 _B. holmesii_ isolates were\nidentified during the same period. As such, we think it unlikely that\n_B. holmesii_ is a major contributor to increased local pertussis\nrates. We recently presented a laboratory-based assessment of\npertussis epidemiology in the Greater Toronto Area at the meeting of\nthe Pediatric Academic Societies meeting; the abstract can be accessed at\n<http://www.pas-meeting.org/2007Toronto/Abstracts/LB%20Sessions%2007.pdf>.\n--\nDavid N.

The vaccine will be marketed as Boostrix by\nGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in Philadelphia, PA.\nPertussis is a highly communicable disease of the respiratory tract that\ncan be especially serious for infants under 1 year old, and may even be\nfatal. Pertussis can cause spells of coughing and choking that make\nbreathing difficult. The disease is generally less severe in adolescents,\nbut it is thought that they might transmit the disease to susceptible\ninfants and other family members. In the last 20 years, rates of pertussis\ninfection have been increasing in very young infants who have not received\nall their immunizations and in adolescents and adults.\nBoostrix is a tetanus toxoid (T), reduced diphtheria toxoid (d) and\nacellular pertussis vaccine (ap), adsorbed. Although booster vaccines for\nadolescents containing T and d are currently licensed and marketed for use\nin this age group, none contains a pertussis component. Boostrix has the\nsame components as Infanrix, a DTaP vaccine for infants and young children,\nbut in reduced quantities. Boostrix is indicated for use as a single\nbooster dose to adolescents 10-18 years of age.\nThe efficacy of the vaccine was measured by looking at the immune response\nto the vaccine, as measured by antibody concentrations. The response to the\nT and d components was at least as good as the response to a licensed Td\nvaccine. Boostrix also induced an antibody response to the pertussis\ncomponent of the vaccine. The response to the pertussis component was\ncompared to the response induced by a 3-dose series of Infanrix given to\ninfants in a previous study. The response of adolescents to Boostrix was\nconsidered adequate. It is not known how long immunity to pertussis will\nlast. Adolescents who received Boostrix experienced pain, redness, and\nswelling at the injection site. The frequency of redness and swelling after\nBoostrix was similar to what is expected following the administration of a\nTd vaccine. However, pain reactions at the injection site were more\nfrequent with those who received Boostrix. Other side effects included\nheadaches, fever and fatigue for a short period of time after the injection.\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed, 10 May 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Channel 36 Austin, TX [edited]\n<http://www.kxan.com/Global/story.asp?S=3327321&nav=0s3dZhYd>\n\nWhooping cough cases increasing\n-------------------------------\nThere have been 58 confirmed cases of whooping cough in Travis County\nschools in 2005. 100 more are suspected. \"In 2004, we had 300 cases\nreported in to us in the whole year, and we've already had more than 50\npercent of that number reported to us, just in the last 6 weeks,\" Dr Adolfo\nValadez, of the Travis County Health Department, said.\nWhooping cough looks like a regular cold or influenza in the beginning, but\ngradually gets worse, becoming especially dangerous for children with\nasthma. The coughing can become so severe it can close off [airways],\nespecially tiny ones. But doctors say those shots wear off when kids get a\nlittle older. The greatest danger is when school-age kids catch what looks\nlike a cold and bring it home to their baby brother or sister. \"When you\nsee that adolescent or adult with a cough history, test for pertussis\nbecause we can treat it,\" Valadez said.\nA 6 week old baby died in 2003 from whooping cough.\n******\n[3]\nDate: Fri, 6 May 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource Fort Madison Daily Democrat (IA) [edited]\n<http://www.dailydem.com/articles/2005/05/06/news/news1.txt>\n\nArea whooping cough numbers climb\n----------------------------------\nIt's been determined to be an outbreak, with 17 confirmed cases of whooping\ncough in Lee County since mid-April 2005. Of the 17 cases, 16 are in the\nCentral Lee Community School District.\nCentral Lee superintendent Chuck Reighard said the school has responded to\nthe outbreak by determining who had close contact with the infected student\nand then making contact with the families of those who may have been\nexposed to urge seeking treatment with the family doctor. Reighard said\nthat now that the Lee County Health Department has become involved, the\nschool will determine close contacts, and the health department will take\non the role of contacting families.\nReighard said the majority of the 16 cases at Central Lee are among\nstudents in the middle school, although he said there have been a few at\nthe elementary and high school levels.\nThis isn't the 1st time that whooping cough has hit the area. This past\nwinter, 2004-2005, several confirmed cases were reported among students in\nthe Fort Madison Community School District. Lee County Health Department\nExecutive Director Julie Schilling said the department had 31 confirmed\ncases of whooping cough from Nov 2004 through Jan 2005, with the majority\nof those cases in the Fort Madison Public School system.\nA release of information concerning the outbreak from the Lee County Health\nDepartment did not indicate that there were incidents of whooping cough in\nFort Madison this time. Schilling said whooping cough has been in Iowa\nsince last summer [2004] but usually shows up in the fall. \"But it can\noccur at any time,\" Schilling said.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Although ProMED-mail does not cover pertussis regularly, regular outbreaks\nof the disease have continued to occur in the USA and elsewhere despite\naggressive universal childhood immunization programs. The development of a\npertussis vaccine consisting of pertussis toxoids as opposed to the older\nvaccine -- which was a killed, whole-cell product -- has improved tolerance\nbut not immunogenicity.

The vaccine will be marketed as Boostrix by\nGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in Philadelphia, PA.\nPertussis is a highly communicable disease of the respiratory tract that\ncan be especially serious for infants under 1 year old, and may even be\nfatal. Pertussis can cause spells of coughing and choking that make\nbreathing difficult. The disease is generally less severe in adolescents,\nbut it is thought that they might transmit the disease to susceptible\ninfants and other family members. In the last 20 years, rates of pertussis\ninfection have been increasing in very young infants who have not received\nall their immunizations and in adolescents and adults.\nBoostrix is a tetanus toxoid (T), reduced diphtheria toxoid (d) and\nacellular pertussis vaccine (ap), adsorbed.

Boostrix has the\nsame components as Infanrix, a DTaP vaccine for infants and young children,\nbut in reduced quantities. Boostrix is indicated for use as a single\nbooster dose to adolescents 10-18 years of age.\nThe efficacy of the vaccine was measured by looking at the immune response\nto the vaccine, as measured by antibody concentrations. The response to the\nT and d components was at least as good as the response to a licensed Td\nvaccine. Boostrix also induced an antibody response to the pertussis\ncomponent of the vaccine. The response to the pertussis component was\ncompared to the response induced by a 3-dose series of Infanrix given to\ninfants in a previous study. The response of adolescents to Boostrix was\nconsidered adequate. It is not known how long immunity to pertussis will\nlast. Adolescents who received Boostrix experienced pain, redness, and\nswelling at the injection site. The frequency of redness and swelling after\nBoostrix was similar to what is expected following the administration of a\nTd vaccine.

The vaccine will be marketed as Boostrix by\nGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in Philadelphia, PA.\nPertussis is a highly communicable disease of the respiratory tract that\ncan be especially serious for infants under 1 year old, and may even be\nfatal. Pertussis can cause spells of coughing and choking that make\nbreathing difficult. The disease is generally less severe in adolescents,\nbut it is thought that they might transmit the disease to susceptible\ninfants and other family members.

Boostrix has the\nsame components as Infanrix, a DTaP vaccine for infants and young children,\nbut in reduced quantities. Boostrix is indicated for use as a single\nbooster dose to adolescents 10-18 years of age.\nThe efficacy of the vaccine was measured by looking at the immune response\nto the vaccine, as measured by antibody concentrations. The response to the\nT and d components was at least as good as the response to a licensed Td\nvaccine. Boostrix also induced an antibody response to the pertussis\ncomponent of the vaccine. The response to the pertussis component was\ncompared to the response induced by a 3-dose series of Infanrix given to\ninfants in a previous study. The response of adolescents to Boostrix was\nconsidered adequate. It is not known how long immunity to pertussis will\nlast. Adolescents who received Boostrix experienced pain, redness, and\nswelling at the injection site. The frequency of redness and swelling after\nBoostrix was similar to what is expected following the administration of a\nTd vaccine.

The vaccine will be marketed as Boostrix by\nGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in Philadelphia, PA.\nPertussis is a highly communicable disease of the respiratory tract that\ncan be especially serious for infants under 1 year old, and may even be\nfatal. Pertussis can cause spells of coughing and choking that make\nbreathing difficult. The disease is generally less severe in adolescents,\nbut it is thought that they might transmit the disease to susceptible\ninfants and other family members. In the last 20 years, rates of pertussis\ninfection have been increasing in very young infants who have not received\nall their immunizations and in adolescents and adults.\nBoostrix is a tetanus toxoid (T), reduced diphtheria toxoid (d) and\nacellular pertussis vaccine (ap), adsorbed. Although booster vaccines for\nadolescents containing T and d are currently licensed and marketed for use\nin this age group, none contains a pertussis component. Boostrix has the\nsame components as Infanrix, a DTaP vaccine for infants and young children,\nbut in reduced quantities. Boostrix is indicated for use as a single\nbooster dose to adolescents 10-18 years of age.\nThe efficacy of the vaccine was measured by looking at the immune response\nto the vaccine, as measured by antibody concentrations. The response to the\nT and d components was at least as good as the response to a licensed Td\nvaccine. Boostrix also induced an antibody response to the pertussis\ncomponent of the vaccine. The response to the pertussis component was\ncompared to the response induced by a 3-dose series of Infanrix given to\ninfants in a previous study. The response of adolescents to Boostrix was\nconsidered adequate. It is not known how long immunity to pertussis will\nlast. Adolescents who received Boostrix experienced pain, redness, and\nswelling at the injection site. The frequency of redness and swelling after\nBoostrix was similar to what is expected following the administration of a\nTd vaccine. However, pain reactions at the injection site were more\nfrequent with those who received Boostrix. Other side effects included\nheadaches, fever and fatigue for a short period of time after the injection.\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed, 10 May 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Channel 36 Austin, TX [edited]\n<http://www.kxan.com/Global/story.asp?S=3327321&nav=0s3dZhYd>\n\nWhooping cough cases increasing\n-------------------------------\nThere have been 58 confirmed cases of whooping cough in Travis County\nschools in 2005. 100 more are suspected. \"In 2004, we had 300 cases\nreported in to us in the whole year, and we've already had more than 50\npercent of that number reported to us, just in the last 6 weeks,\" Dr Adolfo\nValadez, of the Travis County Health Department, said.\nWhooping cough looks like a regular cold or influenza in the beginning, but\ngradually gets worse, becoming especially dangerous for children with\nasthma.

Although not all potential surveillance artifacts could\nbe excluded, it is highly probable that the data reflect a true\noutbreak. However, the cause of this increase has not yet been\ndetermined. Further research is directed to the severity of\ndisease and a possible mismatch between the vaccine and the\ncirculating Bordetella strains.\n[Excerpts]\nIn 1996, 2,771 cases of pertussis were reported to the Inspectorate of\nHealth in the Netherlands (population 15 million), compared with 319 cases\nin 1995. With epidemic cycles expected every 3 to 5 years and a recent\noutbreak in 1994, this rise was unexpected (1). After the introduction of\npertussis immunization with a whole-cell vaccine in the National\nImmunization Program (1952), the incidence of pertussis in the Netherlands\ndecreased significantly. Children are immunized at ages 3, 4, 5, and 11\nmonths with a diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and inactivated polio vaccine\n(DTP-IPV), and vaccine coverage for pertussis, for at least three\nimmunizations, is 96% at the age of 12 months. Until the 1980s, the\nincidence of pertussis seemed very low, because only incidental cases were\nreported. However, in the last two decades, pertussis has been endemic, and\nepidemic peaks have appeared......\nAlthough not all potential surveillance artifacts could be excluded, it is\nhighly probable that the surveillance data reflect a true pertussis\noutbreak. The outbreak could have been caused by 1) decrease in vaccination\ncoverage, 2) decrease in vaccine quality, 3) interference with other\nvaccines, 4) changes in circulating strains of B. pertussis that are not\ncovered by vaccine-induced immunity, or 5) a combination of these factors.\nA decrease in vaccination coverage has not been observed in the (accurate)\nreporting system. The whole-cell vaccine used was produced in the National\nInstitute of Public Health and the Environment and meets international\nstandards. There was no sign of a gradual deterioration of vaccine quality\nas determined for product release by the mouse protection test......\nMolecular typing of B. pertussis isolates collected since 1945 indicated a\nshift in population structure, possibly due to the introduction of\nwhole-cell vaccine (5). Further, antigenic variants of B. pertussis\ndistinct from the strains incorporated in the vaccine appear to have\nemerged (6). It might be possible that circulating strains of B. pertussis\nhave become less sensitive to vaccine-induced immunity. The abrupt increase\nin the proportion of vaccinated patients reported in all age groups\nsuggests such a change.\nData from other countries in Europe indicate that the pertussis epidemic is\nrestricted to the Netherlands.

Although not all potential surveillance artifacts could\nbe excluded, it is highly probable that the data reflect a true\noutbreak. However, the cause of this increase has not yet been\ndetermined. Further research is directed to the severity of\ndisease and a possible mismatch between the vaccine and the\ncirculating Bordetella strains.\n[Excerpts]\nIn 1996, 2,771 cases of pertussis were reported to the Inspectorate of\nHealth in the Netherlands (population 15 million), compared with 319 cases\nin 1995. With epidemic cycles expected every 3 to 5 years and a recent\noutbreak in 1994, this rise was unexpected (1). After the introduction of\npertussis immunization with a whole-cell vaccine in the National\nImmunization Program (1952), the incidence of pertussis in the Netherlands\ndecreased significantly. Children are immunized at ages 3, 4, 5, and 11\nmonths with a diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and inactivated polio vaccine\n(DTP-IPV), and vaccine coverage for pertussis, for at least three\nimmunizations, is 96% at the age of 12 months. Until the 1980s, the\nincidence of pertussis seemed very low, because only incidental cases were\nreported. However, in the last two decades, pertussis has been endemic, and\nepidemic peaks have appeared......\nAlthough not all potential surveillance artifacts could be excluded, it is\nhighly probable that the surveillance data reflect a true pertussis\noutbreak. The outbreak could have been caused by 1) decrease in vaccination\ncoverage, 2) decrease in vaccine quality, 3) interference with other\nvaccines, 4) changes in circulating strains of B. pertussis that are not\ncovered by vaccine-induced immunity, or 5) a combination of these factors.\nA decrease in vaccination coverage has not been observed in the (accurate)\nreporting system. The whole-cell vaccine used was produced in the National\nInstitute of Public Health and the Environment and meets international\nstandards. There was no sign of a gradual deterioration of vaccine quality\nas determined for product release by the mouse protection test......\nMolecular typing of B. pertussis isolates collected since 1945 indicated a\nshift in population structure, possibly due to the introduction of\nwhole-cell vaccine (5). Further, antigenic variants of B. pertussis\ndistinct from the strains incorporated in the vaccine appear to have\nemerged (6). It might be possible that circulating strains of B. pertussis\nhave become less sensitive to vaccine-induced immunity. The abrupt increase\nin the proportion of vaccinated patients reported in all age groups\nsuggests such a change.\nData from other countries in Europe indicate that the pertussis epidemic is\nrestricted to the Netherlands. However, a resurgence of pertussis has been\nnoted in the United States since the late 1980s and in Canada since 1991.\nNo single factor has been found to explain this resurgence (7-10).....\nA prospective study is being considered to assess efficacy of the\nwhole-cell vaccine, including differentiation of severity of illness and\nnumber of immunizations received, if the outbreak continues.

Although not all potential surveillance artifacts could\nbe excluded, it is highly probable that the data reflect a true\noutbreak. However, the cause of this increase has not yet been\ndetermined.

With epidemic cycles expected every 3 to 5 years and a recent\noutbreak in 1994, this rise was unexpected (1). After the introduction of\npertussis immunization with a whole-cell vaccine in the National\nImmunization Program (1952), the incidence of pertussis in the Netherlands\ndecreased significantly. Children are immunized at ages 3, 4, 5, and 11\nmonths with a diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and inactivated polio vaccine\n(DTP-IPV), and vaccine coverage for pertussis, for at least three\nimmunizations, is 96% at the age of 12 months. Until the 1980s, the\nincidence of pertussis seemed very low, because only incidental cases were\nreported. However, in the last two decades, pertussis has been endemic, and\nepidemic peaks have appeared......\nAlthough not all potential surveillance artifacts could be excluded, it is\nhighly probable that the surveillance data reflect a true pertussis\noutbreak. The outbreak could have been caused by 1) decrease in vaccination\ncoverage, 2) decrease in vaccine quality, 3) interference with other\nvaccines, 4) changes in circulating strains of B. pertussis that are not\ncovered by vaccine-induced immunity, or 5) a combination of these factors.\nA decrease in vaccination coverage has not been observed in the (accurate)\nreporting system. The whole-cell vaccine used was produced in the National\nInstitute of Public Health and the Environment and meets international\nstandards. There was no sign of a gradual deterioration of vaccine quality\nas determined for product release by the mouse protection test......\nMolecular typing of B. pertussis isolates collected since 1945 indicated a\nshift in population structure, possibly due to the introduction of\nwhole-cell vaccine (5). Further, antigenic variants of B. pertussis\ndistinct from the strains incorporated in the vaccine appear to have\nemerged (6). It might be possible that circulating strains of B. pertussis\nhave become less sensitive to vaccine-induced immunity. The abrupt increase\nin the proportion of vaccinated patients reported in all age groups\nsuggests such a change.\nData from other countries in Europe indicate that the pertussis epidemic is\nrestricted to the Netherlands. However, a resurgence of pertussis has been\nnoted in the United States since the late 1980s and in Canada since 1991.\nNo single factor has been found to explain this resurgence (7-10).....\nA prospective study is being considered to assess efficacy of the\nwhole-cell vaccine, including differentiation of severity of illness and\nnumber of immunizations received, if the outbreak continues. Cooperative\nstudies to determine the distribution of restriction fragment length\npolymorphism types and antigenic variants of B. pertussis in various\ncountries in Europe, Asia, and North America are under way.

A possible mismatch between the vaccine and the\ncirculating Bordetella strains is being investigated.\nH.E. de Melker,* M.A.E. Conyn-van Spaendonck,* H.C. R=FCmke,* J.K. van\nWijngaarden,=86 F.R.
