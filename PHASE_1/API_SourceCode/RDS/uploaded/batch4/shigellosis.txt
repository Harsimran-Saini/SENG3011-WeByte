Officials said Tue 6 Nov 2018 that 22 cases of shigellosis have been confirmed among Wake Robin residents, staff, and visitors, and 44 probable cases have been reported. Shigella is a type of bacteria that causes diarrhea, stomach cramps and sometimes a fever.\n\nThe Health Department says it started its investigation on 18 Oct 2018. It says the CDC is helping to recommend treatment alternatives and prevention for the extensively drug-resistant _Shigella sonnei_ infections. Shigellosis spreads easily from person to person. Officials say the source of the outbreak has not been identified.\n\nHealth Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine says there have been no new onsets of illness since 1 Nov 2018.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is not entirely clear what kind of community this is, but it does not appear to be a nursing home where spread of enteric organisms, like in day care centers, is easier.

For self-limited milder bacterial enteric diseases, antimicrobials offer little to the patient except for selection of increasingly resistant microflora and drug reactions. Unless salmonellosis is associated with bacteremia, there is little reason to treat. In patients with no fever and significant abdominal pain with or without blood in the diarrhea, the institution of antimicrobials, if the patient is infected with an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, could precipitate hemolytic uremic syndrome. Clearly, viral diarrhea requires no intervention with antibacterial agents.\n\nRegarding shigellosis, CDC made new recommendations about increasing fluoroquinolone resistance in 2017 (see below). In its classic form manifesting as bacterial dysentery (\"the bloody flux\") with high fever, bloody and mucous containing diarrhea and tenesmus (spasmotic pain when passing the diarrhea), patients are usually hospitalized and empiric antimicrobials begun prior to the confirmation of shigellosis. Withholding therapy in these cases not only may prolong illness but also prolong the infectivity period in this highly transmissible enteric infection. The CDC recommendations relate more to the milder non-hospitalized cases where withholding antimicrobials can be beneficial, not only for the patient but also for public health. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nVermont, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/367]\nSee Also\n2017\n----\nShigellosis, flexneri - Argentina: (TU) school 20171105.5425098\nShigellosis - USA (02): (PA, CA, FL) 20170626.5127082\nShigellosis - Viet Nam: (LI) 20170606.5086901\nShigellosis - India: (TG) increasing fluoroquinolone resistance 20170425.4994414\nShigellosis - USA: CDC recommendations regarding fluoroquinolones 20170420.4983680\n2016\n----\nShigellosis - USA: (MI) 20161102.4602617\nShigellosis - China 20161020.4572973\nShigellosis, antimicrobial resistant - South Asia: spread 20160904.4464085\nShigellosis - Israel: children 20160721.4360699\n2015\n----\nShigellosis - USA (06): (CA,MO) 20151030.3755457\nShigellosis - USA (05): (CA) restaurant 20151027.3748031\nShigellosis - USA (04): (CA) restaurant 20151022.3735635\nShigellosis - USA (03): travel, MSM, antimicrobial resistance 20151021.3732921\nShigellosis - UK: (England) MSM 20150418.3304271\nShigellosis - USA (02): sonnei, fluoroquinolone resistance 20150409.3278553\nShigellosis - USA: (NY) 20150118.3101234\nShigellosis, flexneri - USA: (American Samoa) children, 2014 20150116.3095250\n.................................................ll/msp/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["salmonellosis", "shigellosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-11-01 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Vermont", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7867256", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Shigellosis - Denmark: fresh mint", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7867256", "date": "2018-11-07 19:30:46", "main_text": "SHIGELLOSIS, SEROTYPE SONNEI - USA: (VERMONT) RETIREMENT COMMUNITY, MULTIDRUG RESISTANT\n***************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 7 Nov 2018\nSource: NECN [edited]\nhttps://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Vermont-Officials-Investigate-Source-of-Illness-Outbreak-at-Retirement-Community-499918461.html\n\n\nThe Vermont Health Department says it is working with a retirement community in Shelburne to battle an illness outbreak.

For comparison, they also sequenced resistant samples from Australia and Ireland.\n\nThe study, results of which were published in the journal PLoS Medicine in August 2016, showed that all of the resistant _S. sonnei_ formed a single clade found in South Asia and that most of the positive results reported outside of Asia could be linked to recent travel to India.\n\n\"We were running a project on some shigella isolates from Bhutan that were fluoroquinolone-resistant,\" corresponding author Stephen Baker, a microbiologist based at the hospital, one of Oxford University's clinical research units, told SciDev.Net. Fluoroquinolones are a family of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is commonly prescribed to treat shigellosis. \"We started working on some resistant strains from Viet Nam also and found they were much more closely related than we thought they would be,\" said Baker.\n\nBaker and colleagues sequenced 12 resistant samples from Bhutan, 11 samples from Viet Nam, and a sample each from Thailand and Cambodia. They also worked with partners to sequence 19 samples in Australia and 16 in Ireland. \"Once we had found the relationship between the Bhutanese isolates and the Vietnamese [samples], I contacted some of my collaborators and asked what strains/data they had; they all had a common ancestor,\" Baker said.\n\nOf the 45 samples obtained from outside South Asia, 27 were from people who had travelled to the region, and 80 per cent had visited India. Baker said the resistant _S. sonnei_ strain is most likely \"very common in India, but infrequently reported.\"\n\nBased on the data, Baker and his colleagues were able to pinpoint South Asia as the primary source of antibiotic-resistant _S. sonnei_ that is spreading throughout Asia, Australia, the US, and Europe. \"The genetics show these organisms have arisen and are spreading from South Asia,\" he said. Baker attributed the outbreak to increased prosperity in South Asia and the overuse of fluoroquinolones, creating \"huge selective pressure\" on _S. sonnei_.\n\nJason Andrews, assistant professor of infectious diseases at Stanford Medicine, University of California, said that the results of the study were both \"compelling and alarming\" and \"underscore the urgent need to address drug-resistant pathogens through vaccination or other measures.\"\n\nIn particular, Andrews noted, the antimicrobial resistance problem in Asia has quickly become a global problem, \"requiring a global response in terms of resources and strategies for containing resistant enteric bacteria.\"\n\n[byline: Sanjit Das]\n\n[1.

Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue in the _Shigellae_, particularly as a specific multidrug-resistant (MDR) lineage of _Shigella sonnei_ (lineage III) is becoming globally dominant. Ciprofloxacin is a recommended treatment for _Shigella_ infections. However, ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ are being increasingly isolated in Asia and sporadically reported on other continents. We hypothesized that Asia is a primary hub for the recent international spread of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_.\n\n\"Methods and Findings. We performed whole-genome sequencing on a collection of 60 contemporaneous ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ isolated in four countries within Asia (Viet Nam, n = 11; Bhutan, n = 12; Thailand, n = 1; Cambodia, n = 1) and 2 outside of Asia (Australia, n = 19; Ireland, n = 16). We reconstructed the recent evolutionary history of these organisms and combined these data with their geographical location of isolation. Placing these sequences into a global phylogeny, we found that all ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ formed a single clade within a Central Asian expansion of lineage III. Furthermore, our data show that resistance to ciprofloxacin within _S. sonnei_ may be globally attributed to a single clonal emergence event, encompassing sequential gyrA-S83L, parC-S80I, and gyrA-D87G mutations. Geographical data predict that South Asia is the likely primary source of these organisms, which are being regularly exported across Asia and intercontinentally into Australia, the United States and Europe. Our analysis was limited by the number of _S. sonnei_ sequences available from diverse geographical areas and time periods, and we cannot discount the potential existence of other unsampled reservoir populations of antimicrobial-resistant _S. sonnei_.\n\n\"Conclusions. This study suggests that a single clone, which is widespread in South Asia, is likely driving the current intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ and is capable of establishing endemic transmission in new locations. Despite being limited in geographical scope, our work has major implications for understanding the international transfer of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, with _S. sonnei_ acting as a tractable model for studying how antimicrobial-resistant Gram negative bacteria spread globally.\"\n\nShigella causes about 500 000 cases of diarrhea in the United States annually (https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/resources.html). Of the 4 species (_Shigella sonnei_, _Shigella flexneri_, _Shigella boydii_, and _Shigella dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the commonest species in the United States, as well as becoming the predominant species worldwide according the authors of the journal article. Humans are the only reservoir for shigella, which is easily transmitted person-to-person, because shigella are relatively resistant to gastric acidity and only a few organisms if swallowed are sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract. The organism is spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that has come into contact with stool of a person infected with shigella.\n\nSince shigellosis usually resolves in 5-7 days without antibiotic treatment, antimicrobial treatment is used for more severe disease. Antibiotics have also been often used to lessen transmission by limiting the duration of fecal shedding that may otherwise last up to several weeks. However, resistance to antimicrobials has restricted treatment options. Resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is common, and resistance to ciprofloxacin and azithromycin, as well as 3rd-generation cephalosporins, is increasing in the US and worldwide (http://www.cdc.gov/narms/pdf/2012-annual-report-narms-508c.pdf). Outbreaks of infections caused by multidrug-resistant shigella, including isolates resistant to azithromycin or ciprofloxacin -- the 2 antibiotics most commonly used to treat shigellosis -- have been reported in Australia, Europe, and North America among men who have sex with men (MSM).

Fluoroquinolones are a family of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is commonly prescribed to treat shigellosis. \"We started working on some resistant strains from Viet Nam also and found they were much more closely related than we thought they would be,\" said Baker.\n\nBaker and colleagues sequenced 12 resistant samples from Bhutan, 11 samples from Viet Nam, and a sample each from Thailand and Cambodia. They also worked with partners to sequence 19 samples in Australia and 16 in Ireland. \"Once we had found the relationship between the Bhutanese isolates and the Vietnamese [samples], I contacted some of my collaborators and asked what strains/data they had; they all had a common ancestor,\" Baker said.\n\nOf the 45 samples obtained from outside South Asia, 27 were from people who had travelled to the region, and 80 per cent had visited India. Baker said the resistant _S. sonnei_ strain is most likely \"very common in India, but infrequently reported.\"\n\nBased on the data, Baker and his colleagues were able to pinpoint South Asia as the primary source of antibiotic-resistant _S. sonnei_ that is spreading throughout Asia, Australia, the US, and Europe. \"The genetics show these organisms have arisen and are spreading from South Asia,\" he said. Baker attributed the outbreak to increased prosperity in South Asia and the overuse of fluoroquinolones, creating \"huge selective pressure\" on _S. sonnei_.\n\nJason Andrews, assistant professor of infectious diseases at Stanford Medicine, University of California, said that the results of the study were both \"compelling and alarming\" and \"underscore the urgent need to address drug-resistant pathogens through vaccination or other measures.\"\n\nIn particular, Andrews noted, the antimicrobial resistance problem in Asia has quickly become a global problem, \"requiring a global response in terms of resources and strategies for containing resistant enteric bacteria.\"\n\n[byline: Sanjit Das]\n\n[1.

Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue in the _Shigellae_, particularly as a specific multidrug-resistant (MDR) lineage of _Shigella sonnei_ (lineage III) is becoming globally dominant. Ciprofloxacin is a recommended treatment for _Shigella_ infections. However, ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ are being increasingly isolated in Asia and sporadically reported on other continents. We hypothesized that Asia is a primary hub for the recent international spread of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_.\n\n\"Methods and Findings. We performed whole-genome sequencing on a collection of 60 contemporaneous ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ isolated in four countries within Asia (Viet Nam, n = 11; Bhutan, n = 12; Thailand, n = 1; Cambodia, n = 1) and 2 outside of Asia (Australia, n = 19; Ireland, n = 16). We reconstructed the recent evolutionary history of these organisms and combined these data with their geographical location of isolation. Placing these sequences into a global phylogeny, we found that all ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ formed a single clade within a Central Asian expansion of lineage III. Furthermore, our data show that resistance to ciprofloxacin within _S. sonnei_ may be globally attributed to a single clonal emergence event, encompassing sequential gyrA-S83L, parC-S80I, and gyrA-D87G mutations. Geographical data predict that South Asia is the likely primary source of these organisms, which are being regularly exported across Asia and intercontinentally into Australia, the United States and Europe. Our analysis was limited by the number of _S. sonnei_ sequences available from diverse geographical areas and time periods, and we cannot discount the potential existence of other unsampled reservoir populations of antimicrobial-resistant _S. sonnei_.\n\n\"Conclusions. This study suggests that a single clone, which is widespread in South Asia, is likely driving the current intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ and is capable of establishing endemic transmission in new locations. Despite being limited in geographical scope, our work has major implications for understanding the international transfer of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, with _S. sonnei_ acting as a tractable model for studying how antimicrobial-resistant Gram negative bacteria spread globally.\"\n\nShigella causes about 500 000 cases of diarrhea in the United States annually (https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/resources.html). Of the 4 species (_Shigella sonnei_, _Shigella flexneri_, _Shigella boydii_, and _Shigella dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the commonest species in the United States, as well as becoming the predominant species worldwide according the authors of the journal article.

Fluoroquinolones are a family of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is commonly prescribed to treat shigellosis. \"We started working on some resistant strains from Viet Nam also and found they were much more closely related than we thought they would be,\" said Baker.\n\nBaker and colleagues sequenced 12 resistant samples from Bhutan, 11 samples from Viet Nam, and a sample each from Thailand and Cambodia.

Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue in the _Shigellae_, particularly as a specific multidrug-resistant (MDR) lineage of _Shigella sonnei_ (lineage III) is becoming globally dominant. Ciprofloxacin is a recommended treatment for _Shigella_ infections. However, ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ are being increasingly isolated in Asia and sporadically reported on other continents. We hypothesized that Asia is a primary hub for the recent international spread of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_.\n\n\"Methods and Findings. We performed whole-genome sequencing on a collection of 60 contemporaneous ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ isolated in four countries within Asia (Viet Nam, n = 11; Bhutan, n = 12; Thailand, n = 1; Cambodia, n = 1) and 2 outside of Asia (Australia, n = 19; Ireland, n = 16). We reconstructed the recent evolutionary history of these organisms and combined these data with their geographical location of isolation. Placing these sequences into a global phylogeny, we found that all ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ formed a single clade within a Central Asian expansion of lineage III. Furthermore, our data show that resistance to ciprofloxacin within _S. sonnei_ may be globally attributed to a single clonal emergence event, encompassing sequential gyrA-S83L, parC-S80I, and gyrA-D87G mutations. Geographical data predict that South Asia is the likely primary source of these organisms, which are being regularly exported across Asia and intercontinentally into Australia, the United States and Europe. Our analysis was limited by the number of _S. sonnei_ sequences available from diverse geographical areas and time periods, and we cannot discount the potential existence of other unsampled reservoir populations of antimicrobial-resistant _S. sonnei_.\n\n\"Conclusions. This study suggests that a single clone, which is widespread in South Asia, is likely driving the current intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ and is capable of establishing endemic transmission in new locations. Despite being limited in geographical scope, our work has major implications for understanding the international transfer of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, with _S. sonnei_ acting as a tractable model for studying how antimicrobial-resistant Gram negative bacteria spread globally.\"\n\nShigella causes about 500 000 cases of diarrhea in the United States annually (https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/resources.html). Of the 4 species (_Shigella sonnei_, _Shigella flexneri_, _Shigella boydii_, and _Shigella dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the commonest species in the United States, as well as becoming the predominant species worldwide according the authors of the journal article. Humans are the only reservoir for shigella, which is easily transmitted person-to-person, because shigella are relatively resistant to gastric acidity and only a few organisms if swallowed are sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract. The organism is spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that has come into contact with stool of a person infected with shigella.\n\nSince shigellosis usually resolves in 5-7 days without antibiotic treatment, antimicrobial treatment is used for more severe disease. Antibiotics have also been often used to lessen transmission by limiting the duration of fecal shedding that may otherwise last up to several weeks.

For comparison, they also sequenced resistant samples from Australia and Ireland.\n\nThe study, results of which were published in the journal PLoS Medicine in August 2016, showed that all of the resistant _S. sonnei_ formed a single clade found in South Asia and that most of the positive results reported outside of Asia could be linked to recent travel to India.\n\n\"We were running a project on some shigella isolates from Bhutan that were fluoroquinolone-resistant,\" corresponding author Stephen Baker, a microbiologist based at the hospital, one of Oxford University's clinical research units, told SciDev.Net. Fluoroquinolones are a family of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is commonly prescribed to treat shigellosis. \"We started working on some resistant strains from Viet Nam also and found they were much more closely related than we thought they would be,\" said Baker.\n\nBaker and colleagues sequenced 12 resistant samples from Bhutan, 11 samples from Viet Nam, and a sample each from Thailand and Cambodia. They also worked with partners to sequence 19 samples in Australia and 16 in Ireland. \"Once we had found the relationship between the Bhutanese isolates and the Vietnamese [samples], I contacted some of my collaborators and asked what strains/data they had; they all had a common ancestor,\" Baker said.\n\nOf the 45 samples obtained from outside South Asia, 27 were from people who had travelled to the region, and 80 per cent had visited India. Baker said the resistant _S. sonnei_ strain is most likely \"very common in India, but infrequently reported.\"\n\nBased on the data, Baker and his colleagues were able to pinpoint South Asia as the primary source of antibiotic-resistant _S. sonnei_ that is spreading throughout Asia, Australia, the US, and Europe. \"The genetics show these organisms have arisen and are spreading from South Asia,\" he said. Baker attributed the outbreak to increased prosperity in South Asia and the overuse of fluoroquinolones, creating \"huge selective pressure\" on _S. sonnei_.\n\nJason Andrews, assistant professor of infectious diseases at Stanford Medicine, University of California, said that the results of the study were both \"compelling and alarming\" and \"underscore the urgent need to address drug-resistant pathogens through vaccination or other measures.\"\n\nIn particular, Andrews noted, the antimicrobial resistance problem in Asia has quickly become a global problem, \"requiring a global response in terms of resources and strategies for containing resistant enteric bacteria.\"\n\n[byline: Sanjit Das]\n\n[1.

Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue in the _Shigellae_, particularly as a specific multidrug-resistant (MDR) lineage of _Shigella sonnei_ (lineage III) is becoming globally dominant. Ciprofloxacin is a recommended treatment for _Shigella_ infections. However, ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ are being increasingly isolated in Asia and sporadically reported on other continents. We hypothesized that Asia is a primary hub for the recent international spread of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_.\n\n\"Methods and Findings. We performed whole-genome sequencing on a collection of 60 contemporaneous ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ isolated in four countries within Asia (Viet Nam, n = 11; Bhutan, n = 12; Thailand, n = 1; Cambodia, n = 1) and 2 outside of Asia (Australia, n = 19; Ireland, n = 16). We reconstructed the recent evolutionary history of these organisms and combined these data with their geographical location of isolation. Placing these sequences into a global phylogeny, we found that all ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ formed a single clade within a Central Asian expansion of lineage III. Furthermore, our data show that resistance to ciprofloxacin within _S. sonnei_ may be globally attributed to a single clonal emergence event, encompassing sequential gyrA-S83L, parC-S80I, and gyrA-D87G mutations. Geographical data predict that South Asia is the likely primary source of these organisms, which are being regularly exported across Asia and intercontinentally into Australia, the United States and Europe. Our analysis was limited by the number of _S. sonnei_ sequences available from diverse geographical areas and time periods, and we cannot discount the potential existence of other unsampled reservoir populations of antimicrobial-resistant _S. sonnei_.\n\n\"Conclusions. This study suggests that a single clone, which is widespread in South Asia, is likely driving the current intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ and is capable of establishing endemic transmission in new locations. Despite being limited in geographical scope, our work has major implications for understanding the international transfer of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, with _S. sonnei_ acting as a tractable model for studying how antimicrobial-resistant Gram negative bacteria spread globally.\"\n\nShigella causes about 500 000 cases of diarrhea in the United States annually (https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/resources.html). Of the 4 species (_Shigella sonnei_, _Shigella flexneri_, _Shigella boydii_, and _Shigella dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the commonest species in the United States, as well as becoming the predominant species worldwide according the authors of the journal article. Humans are the only reservoir for shigella, which is easily transmitted person-to-person, because shigella are relatively resistant to gastric acidity and only a few organisms if swallowed are sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract. The organism is spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that has come into contact with stool of a person infected with shigella.\n\nSince shigellosis usually resolves in 5-7 days without antibiotic treatment, antimicrobial treatment is used for more severe disease. Antibiotics have also been often used to lessen transmission by limiting the duration of fecal shedding that may otherwise last up to several weeks. However, resistance to antimicrobials has restricted treatment options. Resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is common, and resistance to ciprofloxacin and azithromycin, as well as 3rd-generation cephalosporins, is increasing in the US and worldwide (http://www.cdc.gov/narms/pdf/2012-annual-report-narms-508c.pdf). Outbreaks of infections caused by multidrug-resistant shigella, including isolates resistant to azithromycin or ciprofloxacin -- the 2 antibiotics most commonly used to treat shigellosis -- have been reported in Australia, Europe, and North America among men who have sex with men (MSM).

CBS2 was the first to break the story earlier this week of shigellosis in Williamsburg and Borough Park sections of Brooklyn. As CBS2's Weijia Jiang reported exclusively, a new outbreak has stricken residents miles away in Rockland County.\n\n\"We began to see it spreading in other counties, not only Rockland, as well,\" said Dr. Oscar Alleyne, director of public health planning for the Rockland County Health Department.\n\nAlleyne has been tracking shigella infections - or shigellosis - a highly contagious disease that can cause severe intestinal distress. So far in January 2015, there have been 17 confirmed cases in Rockland County, and from November through December 2014, there were 49.\nAlleyne believes patients may have contracted the shigellosis cases from Brooklyn, where 80 cases have been reported since November 2014.\n\n\"A lot of the times, there's a direct pipeline with families,\" Alleyne said. \"To be honest, our boundaries are never really boundaries.

Symptoms include severe diarrhea, stomach cramps and fever, and the most severe cases involve convulsions and kidney failure. Children between the ages of 2 and 4 are at the highest risk.\n\nIn Brooklyn, Dr. Olitsa Roth told CBS2's Ilana Gold she has treated several cases in recent weeks. She said most cases are very mild and might just involve a bellyache, but some may be more severe. \"The message is for parents -- if the child isn't feeling good, be on high alert and check their bowel movement,\" Roth said.\n\nAlleyne said it is nearly impossible to identify the original source of an outbreak, but he said once shigella is in a community, it spreads quickly.\n\nDoctors said the best tip for prevention is washing hands often.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n*****\n[2] New York (Kings County)\nDate: Thu 15 Jan 2015\nSource: DNA Info [edited]\nhttp://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150115/williamsburg/shigella-bacterial-outbreak-strikes-williamsburg-borough-park\n\nChildren in parts of Williamsburg and Borough Park have experienced a spike in cases of shigellosis, a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea, fever and nausea, the Health Department said. 87 cases were reported between 14 Nov 2014 and 13 Jan 2015, city health officials said. About 74 percent of the cases have occurred in children ages 5 and younger.\n\nThe infection, which most commonly impacts young children, is contracted by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, or by direct contact with someone with the infection, according to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n\nThe city has monitored cyclical outbreaks of shigellosis in the traditional Jewish community since the last outbreak between September 2011 and February 2012, where 206 cases were reported, the Health Department said.

CBS2 was the first to break the story earlier this week of shigellosis in Williamsburg and Borough Park sections of Brooklyn. As CBS2's Weijia Jiang reported exclusively, a new outbreak has stricken residents miles away in Rockland County.\n\n\"We began to see it spreading in other counties, not only Rockland, as well,\" said Dr. Oscar Alleyne, director of public health planning for the Rockland County Health Department.\n\nAlleyne has been tracking shigella infections - or shigellosis - a highly contagious disease that can cause severe intestinal distress. So far in January 2015, there have been 17 confirmed cases in Rockland County, and from November through December 2014, there were 49.\nAlleyne believes patients may have contracted the shigellosis cases from Brooklyn, where 80 cases have been reported since November 2014.\n\n\"A lot of the times, there's a direct pipeline with families,\" Alleyne said. \"To be honest, our boundaries are never really boundaries. People travel back and forth all the time.\" And just like in Borough Park and Williamsburg, most of the shigella patients in Monsey and Spring Valley are young children.\n\nShigella spreads through person-to-person contact, and direct contact with feces, or contaminated food or water. Symptoms include severe diarrhea, stomach cramps and fever, and the most severe cases involve convulsions and kidney failure. Children between the ages of 2 and 4 are at the highest risk.\n\nIn Brooklyn, Dr. Olitsa Roth told CBS2's Ilana Gold she has treated several cases in recent weeks. She said most cases are very mild and might just involve a bellyache, but some may be more severe. \"The message is for parents -- if the child isn't feeling good, be on high alert and check their bowel movement,\" Roth said.\n\nAlleyne said it is nearly impossible to identify the original source of an outbreak, but he said once shigella is in a community, it spreads quickly.\n\nDoctors said the best tip for prevention is washing hands often.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n*****\n[2] New York (Kings County)\nDate: Thu 15 Jan 2015\nSource: DNA Info [edited]\nhttp://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150115/williamsburg/shigella-bacterial-outbreak-strikes-williamsburg-borough-park\n\nChildren in parts of Williamsburg and Borough Park have experienced a spike in cases of shigellosis, a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea, fever and nausea, the Health Department said. 87 cases were reported between 14 Nov 2014 and 13 Jan 2015, city health officials said. About 74 percent of the cases have occurred in children ages 5 and younger.\n\nThe infection, which most commonly impacts young children, is contracted by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, or by direct contact with someone with the infection, according to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n\nThe city has monitored cyclical outbreaks of shigellosis in the traditional Jewish community since the last outbreak between September 2011 and February 2012, where 206 cases were reported, the Health Department said. The Health Department previously warned officials of a potential outbreak, first reported by CBS2, and expected to see an increase in the number of reported cases as doctors became aware of the issue.\n\nGary Schlesinger, CEO of ParCare Community Health Network in Bed-Stuy, said his office has been \"swamped with calls\" about shigellosis over the last 2 weeks, though he declined to provide a specific number.

This investigation documented the 1st known transmission of _Shigella sonnei_ with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin in the USA.\n\nCases were defined as an illness clinically compatible with shigellosis in a patient or _S. sonnei_ isolated from stool of a person with an epidemiologic link to the bridge club during 22-26 May 2012. Investigators attempted to interview all bridge club workers and members who had visited the bridge club during the week of 22 May 2012; they collected stool specimens from workers who handled food and from workers and members with diarrhea who had not already submitted a stool specimen for culture at a health facility. 39 cases were identified among club members with diarrhea and 4 among club workers; of the 4 workers, 2, including one who handled food, reported no symptoms. The average age of affected persons was 75.3 years (range: 54-98 years); 55 per cent were female. Among those with symptoms, the duration of illness averaged 5.9 days (range: 1-14 days). Common symptoms included diarrhea in 95 per cent of patients, abdominal cramps in 70 per cent, and fever in 56 per cent. 31 (72 per cent) persons sought medical care, and 10 (23 per cent) were hospitalized. No specific exposures implicated a source for the outbreak.\n\nAmong the 43 cases, 14 were culture-confirmed; 10 isolates underwent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), yielding indistinguishable patterns. 4 isolates submitted to CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) displayed resistance to streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Unlike most isolates tested by NARMS, these isolates also showed elevated azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of greater than 16 microg/mL (1) and harbored a plasmid-encoded macrolide resistance gene, mphA (2).\n\nCDC's PulseNet identified 2 additional isolates indistinguishable from the outbreak PFGE pattern. One was from a man in Pennsylvania aged 23 years who had visited Los Angeles in April 2012, and the other from a man in Hawaii aged 53 years who visited Los Angeles during April and May 2012; both men were hospitalized with diarrhea. Neither case was epidemiologically linked to the bridge club or to each other.\n\nAlthough sporadic cases of shigellosis caused by _Shigella_ strains with increased azithromycin MICs have occurred, this is the first outbreak documented in the USA and might indicate increasing circulation of such strains (1). Illnesses in this outbreak tended to be severe; however, the affected population was much older than the general USA population. Clinical management of such illnesses is likely to be complex; although azithromycin currently is recommended for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant _Shigella_, options for alternative treatment among children with such infections primarily include parenteral antimicrobial medications (3,4).\n\nGuidelines for azithromycin susceptibility testing and criteria for interpretation of MICs for _Shigella_ species have not been published. Clinicians are urged to report azithromycin treatment failure among shigellosis patients to public health authorities and to retain _Shigella_ isolates from such cases for further analysis.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread. Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease.\n\nDysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces, with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/27gI.]\nSee Also\n2012\n---\nShigellosis, flexneri serotype 3a - UK: MSM 20120330.1085814\n2011\n---\nShigellosis - USA: (GA) schools 20111107.3313\nShigellosis - Norway: imported basil 20111104.3285\n2010\n---\nShigellosis, travelers - worldwide: background 20100915.3344\nShigellosis - USA: (PA) 20100626.2134\nShigellosis, changing epidemiology - Canada: (ON) RFI 20100216.0548\n2009\n---\nShigellosis, imported sugar peas - Norway, Denmark (02) 20090629.2356\nShigellosis, imported sugar peas - Norway, Denmark: (ex Kenya) susp.\n20090626.2328\n2008\n---\nShigellosis - Sweden: intentional exposure susp. 20080927.3059\n2007\n---\nShigellosis, baby corn - Denmark, Australia ex Thailand 20071004.3290\nShigellosis, Thai baby corn - Australia (QLD, VIC) 20070913.3035\nShigellosis, Thai baby corn - Denmark 20070904.2913\nShigellosis, Mexican baby carrots - Canada: alert, recall\n20070822.2741\n2005\n---\nShigellosis, unpasteurized milk curds, 2004 - Lithuania (Vilnius)\n20051203.3494\nShigellosis, retreat center - USA (OR) (02) 20050813.2374\nShigellosis, retreat center - USA (OR) 20050812.2364\n.................................................mpp/ll/mj/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "cholera", "shigellosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-05-16 00:00:00", "2012-05-16 00:00:00", "2012-05-16 00:00:00", "2012-04-16 00:00:00", "2021-04-16 00:00:00", "2012-05-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2005-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2007-03-16 00:00:00", "2004-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kenya", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Denmark", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Norway", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Geneva", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hawaii", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Switzerland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Los Angeles", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "CALIFORNIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Thailand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3054774", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Shigellosis - USA (02): (NY,IN)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3054774", "date": "2013-03-11 14:33:06", "main_text": "SHIGELLOSIS, SEROTYPE SONNEI - USA: (CALIFORNIA) 2012, RESISTANCE\n*****************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 7 Mar 2013\nSource: CDC.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2013; 62(171): 171 [edited]\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6209a4.htm?s_cid=mm6209a4_e\n\n\nIn May 2012, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health's Acute Communicable Disease Control Unit and Environmental Health, Food, and Milk Program investigated an outbreak of shigellosis associated with a private bridge club. This investigation documented the 1st known transmission of _Shigella sonnei_ with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin in the USA.\n\nCases were defined as an illness clinically compatible with shigellosis in a patient or _S. sonnei_ isolated from stool of a person with an epidemiologic link to the bridge club during 22-26 May 2012. Investigators attempted to interview all bridge club workers and members who had visited the bridge club during the week of 22 May 2012; they collected stool specimens from workers who handled food and from workers and members with diarrhea who had not already submitted a stool specimen for culture at a health facility. 39 cases were identified among club members with diarrhea and 4 among club workers; of the 4 workers, 2, including one who handled food, reported no symptoms. The average age of affected persons was 75.3 years (range: 54-98 years); 55 per cent were female. Among those with symptoms, the duration of illness averaged 5.9 days (range: 1-14 days). Common symptoms included diarrhea in 95 per cent of patients, abdominal cramps in 70 per cent, and fever in 56 per cent. 31 (72 per cent) persons sought medical care, and 10 (23 per cent) were hospitalized. No specific exposures implicated a source for the outbreak.\n\nAmong the 43 cases, 14 were culture-confirmed; 10 isolates underwent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), yielding indistinguishable patterns. 4 isolates submitted to CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) displayed resistance to streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Unlike most isolates tested by NARMS, these isolates also showed elevated azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of greater than 16 microg/mL (1) and harbored a plasmid-encoded macrolide resistance gene, mphA (2).\n\nCDC's PulseNet identified 2 additional isolates indistinguishable from the outbreak PFGE pattern. One was from a man in Pennsylvania aged 23 years who had visited Los Angeles in April 2012, and the other from a man in Hawaii aged 53 years who visited Los Angeles during April and May 2012; both men were hospitalized with diarrhea. Neither case was epidemiologically linked to the bridge club or to each other.\n\nAlthough sporadic cases of shigellosis caused by _Shigella_ strains with increased azithromycin MICs have occurred, this is the first outbreak documented in the USA and might indicate increasing circulation of such strains (1). Illnesses in this outbreak tended to be severe; however, the affected population was much older than the general USA population. Clinical management of such illnesses is likely to be complex; although azithromycin currently is recommended for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant _Shigella_, options for alternative treatment among children with such infections primarily include parenteral antimicrobial medications (3,4).\n\nGuidelines for azithromycin susceptibility testing and criteria for interpretation of MICs for _Shigella_ species have not been published. Clinicians are urged to report azithromycin treatment failure among shigellosis patients to public health authorities and to retain _Shigella_ isolates from such cases for further analysis.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Unlike most isolates tested by NARMS, these isolates also showed elevated azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of greater than 16 microg/mL (1) and harbored a plasmid-encoded macrolide resistance gene, mphA (2).\n\nCDC's PulseNet identified 2 additional isolates indistinguishable from the outbreak PFGE pattern. One was from a man in Pennsylvania aged 23 years who had visited Los Angeles in April 2012, and the other from a man in Hawaii aged 53 years who visited Los Angeles during April and May 2012; both men were hospitalized with diarrhea. Neither case was epidemiologically linked to the bridge club or to each other.\n\nAlthough sporadic cases of shigellosis caused by _Shigella_ strains with increased azithromycin MICs have occurred, this is the first outbreak documented in the USA and might indicate increasing circulation of such strains (1). Illnesses in this outbreak tended to be severe; however, the affected population was much older than the general USA population. Clinical management of such illnesses is likely to be complex; although azithromycin currently is recommended for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant _Shigella_, options for alternative treatment among children with such infections primarily include parenteral antimicrobial medications (3,4).\n\nGuidelines for azithromycin susceptibility testing and criteria for interpretation of MICs for _Shigella_ species have not been published. Clinicians are urged to report azithromycin treatment failure among shigellosis patients to public health authorities and to retain _Shigella_ isolates from such cases for further analysis.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

This investigation documented the 1st known transmission of _Shigella sonnei_ with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin in the USA.\n\nCases were defined as an illness clinically compatible with shigellosis in a patient or _S. sonnei_ isolated from stool of a person with an epidemiologic link to the bridge club during 22-26 May 2012. Investigators attempted to interview all bridge club workers and members who had visited the bridge club during the week of 22 May 2012; they collected stool specimens from workers who handled food and from workers and members with diarrhea who had not already submitted a stool specimen for culture at a health facility. 39 cases were identified among club members with diarrhea and 4 among club workers; of the 4 workers, 2, including one who handled food, reported no symptoms. The average age of affected persons was 75.3 years (range: 54-98 years); 55 per cent were female. Among those with symptoms, the duration of illness averaged 5.9 days (range: 1-14 days). Common symptoms included diarrhea in 95 per cent of patients, abdominal cramps in 70 per cent, and fever in 56 per cent. 31 (72 per cent) persons sought medical care, and 10 (23 per cent) were hospitalized.

Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease.\n\nDysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces, with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/27gI.]\nSee Also\n2012\n---\nShigellosis, flexneri serotype 3a - UK: MSM 20120330.1085814\n2011\n---\nShigellosis - USA: (GA) schools 20111107.3313\nShigellosis - Norway: imported basil 20111104.3285\n2010\n---\nShigellosis, travelers - worldwide: background 20100915.3344\nShigellosis - USA: (PA) 20100626.2134\nShigellosis, changing epidemiology - Canada: (ON) RFI 20100216.0548\n2009\n---\nShigellosis, imported sugar peas - Norway, Denmark (02) 20090629.2356\nShigellosis, imported sugar peas - Norway, Denmark: (ex Kenya) susp.\n20090626.2328\n2008\n---\nShigellosis - Sweden: intentional exposure susp. 20080927.3059\n2007\n---\nShigellosis, baby corn - Denmark, Australia ex Thailand 20071004.3290\nShigellosis, Thai baby corn - Australia (QLD, VIC) 20070913.3035\nShigellosis, Thai baby corn - Denmark 20070904.2913\nShigellosis, Mexican baby carrots - Canada: alert, recall\n20070822.2741\n2005\n---\nShigellosis, unpasteurized milk curds, 2004 - Lithuania (Vilnius)\n20051203.3494\nShigellosis, retreat center - USA (OR) (02) 20050813.2374\nShigellosis, retreat center - USA (OR) 20050812.2364\n.................................................mpp/ll/mj/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "cholera", "shigellosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-05-16 00:00:00", "2012-05-16 00:00:00", "2012-05-16 00:00:00", "2012-04-16 00:00:00", "2021-04-16 00:00:00", "2012-05-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2005-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2007-03-16 00:00:00", "2004-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kenya", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Denmark", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Norway", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Geneva", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hawaii", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Switzerland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Los Angeles", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "CALIFORNIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Thailand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1085814", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Shigellosis, flexneri serotype 3a - UK: MSM", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1085814", "date": "2009-06-26 18:00:08", "main_text": "SHIGELLOSIS, IMPORTED SUGAR PEAS - NORWAY, DENMARK: (ex KENYA) SUSPECTED\n************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\n[1] Norway\n[2] Denmark\n\n******\n[1] Norway\nDate: Thu 18 Jun 2009\nSource: Eurosurveillance edition 2009; 14(24) [edited]\n<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19243>\n\n\n_Shigella sonnei_ infections in Norway associated with sugar peas,\nMay-June 2009\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Authors: T Heier1, K Nygard1, G Kapperud1, BA Lindstedt1, GS\nJohannessen2, H Blekkan3\n1. Nasjonalt Folkehelseinstitutt (Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth), Oslo, Norway\n2. Veterinaerinstituttet (National Veterinary Institute), Oslo, Norway\n3. Mattilsynet (Norwegian Food Safety Authority), Oslo, Norway]\n\nIn Norway, shigellosis is a mandatorily notifiable disease, and all\nisolates are submitted to the NIPH [Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth] for verification and typing. Around 150 cases of shigellosis\nare confirmed per year, the majority caused by _Shigella sonnei_. Only\naround 10 to 20 of the shigellosis cases reported each year are\nacquired in Norway, usually as secondary cases caused by fecal-oral\ntransmission in households.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, the National Reference Laboratory at the NIPH alerted\nabout a suspected outbreak involving 4 cases of _Shigella sonnei_\ninfection. The infected persons were living in 2 different counties in\nNorway, and they had no foreign travel history during the week before\nonset of illness. On the same day, a municipal medical doctor reported\nto the NIPH 5 suspected cases of shigellosis in 2 separate households.\n\nEpidemiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAn outbreak investigation was initiated on 27 May 2009 by interviewing\nthe 4 confirmed cases using a trawling questionnaire. On the same day\nthe NFSA [Norwegian Food Safety Authority] inspectors visited the 2\nhouseholds where suspected cases were reported and found an unopened\npackage of sugar peas imported from Kenya in one household, and the\npacking of the same brand of sugar peas in the other. The sugar peas\nwere bought in the same shop. Based on this suspicion, it was decided\nto focus the interviews on consumption of fresh vegetables and lettuce.\n\nMicrobiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAll suspected human _Shigella_ isolates received at NIPH are routinely\nverified, speciated, and typed with multilocus variable-number\ntandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) using a protocol developed by BA\nLindstedt et al (manuscript in preparation). Isolates of _Shigella\nsonnei_ showing a distinct MLVA-profile were defined as the outbreak\nstrain. Food samples were analyzed at the National Veterinary\nInstitute first by using NMKL no. 174 (_Shigella_ spp. PCR method for\ndetection in food), followed by immuno-magnetic separation (IMS) and\nplating on selective agar. Positive PCR results were confirmed by\nusing a modified version of an octaplex PCR developed for\nidentification of human diarrheagenic _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella\nspp._ (1). Any isolates obtained from food samples would be MLVA-typed\nat NIPH to compare with the patient isolates.\n\nResults\n-------\nBy 16 Jun 2009, the reference laboratory has registered a total of 20\ncases with the outbreak strain of _Shigella sonnei_, who had not\ntraveled abroad prior to illness onset. The cases live in different\nmunicipalities, but mainly in the central and western parts of Norway.\nThe date of onset for the 1st case was 10 May 2009 (Figure [for\nfigures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). All cases were adults except for\none teenager, and 16 of them were women. All 20 cases reported to have\neaten sugar peas, and there were no other obvious common exposures\nidentified. The majority of the patients had bought the sugar peas in\none of the large supermarket chains and only a few in another chain.\nThe NFSA traced the suspected food product and found that all the\nimplicated sugar peas were produced in Kenya. One sample from the\nunopened package of sugar peas collected in a patient household was\npositive for _Shigella sonnei_ by both PCR methods, but could not be\nculture-confirmed.\n\nInternational alerts\n--------------------\nOn 27 May 2009 the NIPH sent an urgent inquiry through the European\nFood and Waterborne Diseases Network at the European Centre for\nDisease Prevention and Control (ECDC) asking whether an increase in\nthe number of _Shigella sonnei_ cases had been registered in other\ncountries. On the same day, the NFSA sent an information notice\nthrough the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).\nBased on information from the interviews, the main importer\nvoluntarily recalled the product on 29 May 2009. Further results from\ntracing of the food product and preliminary results from the\nmicrobiological investigation led the NFSA to prohibit all sales of\nsugar peas imported from Kenya later the same day.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nAs a response to our urgent inquiry Denmark reported an increase in\nthe number of domestic _Shigella sonnei_ infections in April and May\n2009. They initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the\nDanish cases were related to the outbreak in Norway. The investigation\nin Denmark also pointed at sugar peas as the source of the outbreak,\nand microbiological investigations (including MLVA typing) to compare\nthe outbreak strains are ongoing.\n\nThe trace-back investigation of the food product appeared to be very\ncomplicated, and the NFSA is still investigating together with the\nindustry. Several wholesalers are supplying sugar peas to Norway, and\nthe product comes from several producers in Kenya. The 2 supermarket\nchains usually do not share the distribution system, but on some\noccasions they are supplied by the same whole-saler.\n\nOnly one previous outbreak in Norway has been associated with fresh\nvegetables. An increase in the number of domestic cases of _Shigella\nsonnei_ infection was detected in several European countries in 1994,\nincluding Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (2). In Norway 110\nculture-confirmed cases of infection were recorded at the time. In all\n3 countries epidemiological evidence incriminated imported iceberg\nlettuce of Spanish origin as the vehicle of transmission. The pathogen\nwas not isolated from the suspected food product.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Department of Epidemiology, Statens Serum Institut (Danish National\nInstitute of Health, SSI), Copenhagen, Denmark\n2. Fodevarestyrelsen (Danish Veterinary and Food Administration),\nCopenhagen, Denmark\n3. Department of Bacteriology, Mycology and Parasitology, Statens\nSerum Institut (Danish National Institute of Health, SSI), Copenhagen,\nDenmark]\n\nOn 27 May 2009 Norway sent an urgent inquiry through the European Food\nand Waterborne Diseases Network at the European Centre for Disease\nPrevention and Control (ECDC) reporting an increase in the number of\n_Shigella sonnei_ cases. By 1 Jun 2009 Norway informed that they\nsuspected the source to be sugar peas. As an increase in the number of\n_Shigella sonnei_ cases was also observed in Denmark in April and May\n2009, we initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the Danish\ncases were related to the Norwegian outbreak.\n\nMethods\n-------\nAll laboratory-confirmed _Shigella sonnei_ cases since 1 Apr 2009\n(Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]) were interviewed\nby telephone about date of onset, symptoms, travel history,\nconsumption of sugar peas and a small set of other exposure variables.\nPrevious data on sugar peas consumption in the background population\nwas reviewed. Isolates were subjected to typing by pulsed field gel\nelectrophoresis (PFGE) using the enzyme XbaI. Sugar peas sold in 3\nmajor groups of supermarket chains were traced back.\n\nResults\n-------\nIn all, 17 cases of _Shigella sonnei_ were reported from 1 Apr to 1\nJun 2009. 6 cases were travel-related and one was linked to another\nknown outbreak caused by fresh large shrimps from Bangladesh. Of the\nremaining 10 cases, 8 reported having eaten sugar peas prior to onset\nof symptoms. Of these 8 cases all were female and their median age was\n31 years (range 11-46 years). None had travelled abroad, except for\nshort trips to Sweden before getting ill. The dates of onset of\nillness ranged from 7 Apr to 8 May 2009. The 2 additional cases could\nbe related to the outbreak as likely secondary cases as they were\nchildren of one of the cases who had eaten sugar peas. The children\nfell ill 3 weeks after their mother.\n\nA case-control study was not performed; instead, previous food-borne\noutbreak investigations were reviewed. Consumption of sugar peas is\namong the questions included in several of the commonly used trawling\nquestionnaires in Denmark. We looked into 3 different rounds of\ntrawling questionnaire studies performed among cases of a large\noutbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium U292 (1). They were done in\nApril, May, and August 2008. In these studies 3/10, 2/17, and 0/15\ncases reported consumption of sugar peas in a period of 7 days prior\nto illness. This crude comparison indicated to us a significant\nassociation between _Shigella sonnei_ infections and consumption of\nsugar peas (using the persons interviewed in April and May 2009 as\ncommunity controls, comparing 8/8 exposed cases to 5/27 exposed\ncontrols, gives a Fisher p-value of less than 0.0001).\n\nPreliminary PFGE typing results of isolates from 5 of the 10 cases\nassociated with sugar pea consumption suggest highly similar patterns.\nThe PFGE patterns of the isolates from Danish patients resemble those\nobtained from the Norwegian patients but it is still too early to say\nif they are identical. Further typing results (which will include\nmultilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis - MLVA typing) and\ncomparisons between isolates from Denmark and Norway are pending.\n\nThe cases were generally able to recall in detail the type of product\nthey had consumed and in which shop they had bought it; 6 of the 10\ncases associated with the outbreak reported buying sugar peas in\nsupermarkets sharing in part the same distribution systems. Trace-back\ninvestigation of the sugar peas showed that they had been bought from\na single wholesaler in the Netherlands and that they were of 3\ndifferent varieties, which can be distinguished by their shapes,\nnamely sugar snaps, sugar peas (snow peas), and mange touts. They\noriginated predominantly from Kenya (from 4 different farms), but\nother batches sold in the same period came from Ethiopia and from\nGuatemala. The Dutch whole-seller was different from the one that\nsupplied sugar peas to Norway. The 2 remaining cases may have bought\ntheir sugar peas in another group of supermarket chains, which in part\nshares distribution systems with the supermarkets that sold the\nincriminated sugar peas in Norway. Further investigation into the\norigin of the sugar peas sold in this chain during April 2009 is still\nongoing. There were no remains of the batch of sugar peas under\nsuspicion and therefore microbiological analysis was not performed.\nLaboratory results from samples taken from later batches in 2 of the\nsupermarket chains did not reveal contamination by either _Shigella_\nspp. or _Escherichia coli_ (as indicator for fecal contamination).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe investigation points at sugar peas as the source of this outbreak.\nThe Danish and the Norwegian outbreaks do not appear to have been\ncaused by the same type of peas, the batch of sugar snaps that was\nlikely contaminated in Denmark was different from the one imported\ninto Norway and also the Danish outbreak occurred one month earlier\nthat the Norwegian outbreak. It is possible, though, that both\noutbreaks may have been a result of the same contamination event in\nKenya; further investigations may cast light on this.\n\nOutbreaks with a high ratio of females among cases may often point to\nfresh produce as the source. Only one previous outbreak in Denmark has\nbeen associated with sugar peas, an outbreak of _Shigella flexneri_ in\n2002 in which the epidemiological evidence pointed towards fresh\nimported sugar snaps of African origin (unpublished). Other fresh\ntropical vegetables which were eaten raw, have also caused outbreaks\nof shigellosis in Denmark, most notable were 2 _Shigella sonnei_\noutbreaks in 2007 (2,3) and one in 1998 (4) both caused by baby corn\nimported from Thailand.\n\nThis outbreak underlines that some fresh vegetables imported into\nEurope from tropic destinations may pose a food safety hazard. In\nDenmark fresh imported sugar snaps are sold as a ready-to-eat product.\nConsumers should be aware that these types of products may pose a risk\nof microbiological contamination. The sugar snaps will remain crispy\nafter being blanched or boiled briefly and it may be advisable for\nconsumers to heat-treat fresh vegetables of this type before\nconsumption.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The sugar peas\nwere bought in the same shop. Based on this suspicion, it was decided\nto focus the interviews on consumption of fresh vegetables and lettuce.\n\nMicrobiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAll suspected human _Shigella_ isolates received at NIPH are routinely\nverified, speciated, and typed with multilocus variable-number\ntandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) using a protocol developed by BA\nLindstedt et al (manuscript in preparation). Isolates of _Shigella\nsonnei_ showing a distinct MLVA-profile were defined as the outbreak\nstrain. Food samples were analyzed at the National Veterinary\nInstitute first by using NMKL no. 174 (_Shigella_ spp. PCR method for\ndetection in food), followed by immuno-magnetic separation (IMS) and\nplating on selective agar. Positive PCR results were confirmed by\nusing a modified version of an octaplex PCR developed for\nidentification of human diarrheagenic _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella\nspp._ (1). Any isolates obtained from food samples would be MLVA-typed\nat NIPH to compare with the patient isolates.\n\nResults\n-------\nBy 16 Jun 2009, the reference laboratory has registered a total of 20\ncases with the outbreak strain of _Shigella sonnei_, who had not\ntraveled abroad prior to illness onset. The cases live in different\nmunicipalities, but mainly in the central and western parts of Norway.\nThe date of onset for the 1st case was 10 May 2009 (Figure [for\nfigures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). All cases were adults except for\none teenager, and 16 of them were women. All 20 cases reported to have\neaten sugar peas, and there were no other obvious common exposures\nidentified. The majority of the patients had bought the sugar peas in\none of the large supermarket chains and only a few in another chain.\nThe NFSA traced the suspected food product and found that all the\nimplicated sugar peas were produced in Kenya. One sample from the\nunopened package of sugar peas collected in a patient household was\npositive for _Shigella sonnei_ by both PCR methods, but could not be\nculture-confirmed.\n\nInternational alerts\n--------------------\nOn 27 May 2009 the NIPH sent an urgent inquiry through the European\nFood and Waterborne Diseases Network at the European Centre for\nDisease Prevention and Control (ECDC) asking whether an increase in\nthe number of _Shigella sonnei_ cases had been registered in other\ncountries. On the same day, the NFSA sent an information notice\nthrough the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).\nBased on information from the interviews, the main importer\nvoluntarily recalled the product on 29 May 2009. Further results from\ntracing of the food product and preliminary results from the\nmicrobiological investigation led the NFSA to prohibit all sales of\nsugar peas imported from Kenya later the same day.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nAs a response to our urgent inquiry Denmark reported an increase in\nthe number of domestic _Shigella sonnei_ infections in April and May\n2009. They initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the\nDanish cases were related to the outbreak in Norway. The investigation\nin Denmark also pointed at sugar peas as the source of the outbreak,\nand microbiological investigations (including MLVA typing) to compare\nthe outbreak strains are ongoing.\n\nThe trace-back investigation of the food product appeared to be very\ncomplicated, and the NFSA is still investigating together with the\nindustry. Several wholesalers are supplying sugar peas to Norway, and\nthe product comes from several producers in Kenya. The 2 supermarket\nchains usually do not share the distribution system, but on some\noccasions they are supplied by the same whole-saler.\n\nOnly one previous outbreak in Norway has been associated with fresh\nvegetables. An increase in the number of domestic cases of _Shigella\nsonnei_ infection was detected in several European countries in 1994,\nincluding Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (2). In Norway 110\nculture-confirmed cases of infection were recorded at the time. In all\n3 countries epidemiological evidence incriminated imported iceberg\nlettuce of Spanish origin as the vehicle of transmission.

By 1 Jun 2009 Norway informed that they\nsuspected the source to be sugar peas. As an increase in the number of\n_Shigella sonnei_ cases was also observed in Denmark in April and May\n2009, we initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the Danish\ncases were related to the Norwegian outbreak.\n\nMethods\n-------\nAll laboratory-confirmed _Shigella sonnei_ cases since 1 Apr 2009\n(Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]) were interviewed\nby telephone about date of onset, symptoms, travel history,\nconsumption of sugar peas and a small set of other exposure variables.\nPrevious data on sugar peas consumption in the background population\nwas reviewed. Isolates were subjected to typing by pulsed field gel\nelectrophoresis (PFGE) using the enzyme XbaI. Sugar peas sold in 3\nmajor groups of supermarket chains were traced back.\n\nResults\n-------\nIn all, 17 cases of _Shigella sonnei_ were reported from 1 Apr to 1\nJun 2009. 6 cases were travel-related and one was linked to another\nknown outbreak caused by fresh large shrimps from Bangladesh. Of the\nremaining 10 cases, 8 reported having eaten sugar peas prior to onset\nof symptoms. Of these 8 cases all were female and their median age was\n31 years (range 11-46 years). None had travelled abroad, except for\nshort trips to Sweden before getting ill. The dates of onset of\nillness ranged from 7 Apr to 8 May 2009. The 2 additional cases could\nbe related to the outbreak as likely secondary cases as they were\nchildren of one of the cases who had eaten sugar peas. The children\nfell ill 3 weeks after their mother.\n\nA case-control study was not performed; instead, previous food-borne\noutbreak investigations were reviewed. Consumption of sugar peas is\namong the questions included in several of the commonly used trawling\nquestionnaires in Denmark. We looked into 3 different rounds of\ntrawling questionnaire studies performed among cases of a large\noutbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium U292 (1). They were done in\nApril, May, and August 2008. In these studies 3/10, 2/17, and 0/15\ncases reported consumption of sugar peas in a period of 7 days prior\nto illness. This crude comparison indicated to us a significant\nassociation between _Shigella sonnei_ infections and consumption of\nsugar peas (using the persons interviewed in April and May 2009 as\ncommunity controls, comparing 8/8 exposed cases to 5/27 exposed\ncontrols, gives a Fisher p-value of less than 0.0001).\n\nPreliminary PFGE typing results of isolates from 5 of the 10 cases\nassociated with sugar pea consumption suggest highly similar patterns.\nThe PFGE patterns of the isolates from Danish patients resemble those\nobtained from the Norwegian patients but it is still too early to say\nif they are identical. Further typing results (which will include\nmultilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis - MLVA typing) and\ncomparisons between isolates from Denmark and Norway are pending.\n\nThe cases were generally able to recall in detail the type of product\nthey had consumed and in which shop they had bought it; 6 of the 10\ncases associated with the outbreak reported buying sugar peas in\nsupermarkets sharing in part the same distribution systems. Trace-back\ninvestigation of the sugar peas showed that they had been bought from\na single wholesaler in the Netherlands and that they were of 3\ndifferent varieties, which can be distinguished by their shapes,\nnamely sugar snaps, sugar peas (snow peas), and mange touts. They\noriginated predominantly from Kenya (from 4 different farms), but\nother batches sold in the same period came from Ethiopia and from\nGuatemala. The Dutch whole-seller was different from the one that\nsupplied sugar peas to Norway. The 2 remaining cases may have bought\ntheir sugar peas in another group of supermarket chains, which in part\nshares distribution systems with the supermarkets that sold the\nincriminated sugar peas in Norway. Further investigation into the\norigin of the sugar peas sold in this chain during April 2009 is still\nongoing. There were no remains of the batch of sugar peas under\nsuspicion and therefore microbiological analysis was not performed.\nLaboratory results from samples taken from later batches in 2 of the\nsupermarket chains did not reveal contamination by either _Shigella_\nspp. or _Escherichia coli_ (as indicator for fecal contamination).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe investigation points at sugar peas as the source of this outbreak.\nThe Danish and the Norwegian outbreaks do not appear to have been\ncaused by the same type of peas, the batch of sugar snaps that was\nlikely contaminated in Denmark was different from the one imported\ninto Norway and also the Danish outbreak occurred one month earlier\nthat the Norwegian outbreak. It is possible, though, that both\noutbreaks may have been a result of the same contamination event in\nKenya; further investigations may cast light on this.\n\nOutbreaks with a high ratio of females among cases may often point to\nfresh produce as the source. Only one previous outbreak in Denmark has\nbeen associated with sugar peas, an outbreak of _Shigella flexneri_ in\n2002 in which the epidemiological evidence pointed towards fresh\nimported sugar snaps of African origin (unpublished). Other fresh\ntropical vegetables which were eaten raw, have also caused outbreaks\nof shigellosis in Denmark, most notable were 2 _Shigella sonnei_\noutbreaks in 2007 (2,3) and one in 1998 (4) both caused by baby corn\nimported from Thailand.\n\nThis outbreak underlines that some fresh vegetables imported into\nEurope from tropic destinations may pose a food safety hazard. In\nDenmark fresh imported sugar snaps are sold as a ready-to-eat product.\nConsumers should be aware that these types of products may pose a risk\nof microbiological contamination. The sugar snaps will remain crispy\nafter being blanched or boiled briefly and it may be advisable for\nconsumers to heat-treat fresh vegetables of this type before\nconsumption.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Around 150 cases of shigellosis\nare confirmed per year, the majority caused by _Shigella sonnei_. Only\naround 10 to 20 of the shigellosis cases reported each year are\nacquired in Norway, usually as secondary cases caused by fecal-oral\ntransmission in households.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, the National Reference Laboratory at the NIPH alerted\nabout a suspected outbreak involving 4 cases of _Shigella sonnei_\ninfection. The infected persons were living in 2 different counties in\nNorway, and they had no foreign travel history during the week before\nonset of illness. On the same day, a municipal medical doctor reported\nto the NIPH 5 suspected cases of shigellosis in 2 separate households.\n\nEpidemiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAn outbreak investigation was initiated on 27 May 2009 by interviewing\nthe 4 confirmed cases using a trawling questionnaire.

Sugar peas sold in 3\nmajor groups of supermarket chains were traced back.\n\nResults\n-------\nIn all, 17 cases of _Shigella sonnei_ were reported from 1 Apr to 1\nJun 2009. 6 cases were travel-related and one was linked to another\nknown outbreak caused by fresh large shrimps from Bangladesh. Of the\nremaining 10 cases, 8 reported having eaten sugar peas prior to onset\nof symptoms. Of these 8 cases all were female and their median age was\n31 years (range 11-46 years). None had travelled abroad, except for\nshort trips to Sweden before getting ill. The dates of onset of\nillness ranged from 7 Apr to 8 May 2009. The 2 additional cases could\nbe related to the outbreak as likely secondary cases as they were\nchildren of one of the cases who had eaten sugar peas. The children\nfell ill 3 weeks after their mother.\n\nA case-control study was not performed; instead, previous food-borne\noutbreak investigations were reviewed. Consumption of sugar peas is\namong the questions included in several of the commonly used trawling\nquestionnaires in Denmark. We looked into 3 different rounds of\ntrawling questionnaire studies performed among cases of a large\noutbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium U292 (1). They were done in\nApril, May, and August 2008. In these studies 3/10, 2/17, and 0/15\ncases reported consumption of sugar peas in a period of 7 days prior\nto illness. This crude comparison indicated to us a significant\nassociation between _Shigella sonnei_ infections and consumption of\nsugar peas (using the persons interviewed in April and May 2009 as\ncommunity controls, comparing 8/8 exposed cases to 5/27 exposed\ncontrols, gives a Fisher p-value of less than 0.0001).\n\nPreliminary PFGE typing results of isolates from 5 of the 10 cases\nassociated with sugar pea consumption suggest highly similar patterns.\nThe PFGE patterns of the isolates from Danish patients resemble those\nobtained from the Norwegian patients but it is still too early to say\nif they are identical. Further typing results (which will include\nmultilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis - MLVA typing) and\ncomparisons between isolates from Denmark and Norway are pending.\n\nThe cases were generally able to recall in detail the type of product\nthey had consumed and in which shop they had bought it; 6 of the 10\ncases associated with the outbreak reported buying sugar peas in\nsupermarkets sharing in part the same distribution systems. Trace-back\ninvestigation of the sugar peas showed that they had been bought from\na single wholesaler in the Netherlands and that they were of 3\ndifferent varieties, which can be distinguished by their shapes,\nnamely sugar snaps, sugar peas (snow peas), and mange touts. They\noriginated predominantly from Kenya (from 4 different farms), but\nother batches sold in the same period came from Ethiopia and from\nGuatemala. The Dutch whole-seller was different from the one that\nsupplied sugar peas to Norway. The 2 remaining cases may have bought\ntheir sugar peas in another group of supermarket chains, which in part\nshares distribution systems with the supermarkets that sold the\nincriminated sugar peas in Norway. Further investigation into the\norigin of the sugar peas sold in this chain during April 2009 is still\nongoing. There were no remains of the batch of sugar peas under\nsuspicion and therefore microbiological analysis was not performed.\nLaboratory results from samples taken from later batches in 2 of the\nsupermarket chains did not reveal contamination by either _Shigella_\nspp. or _Escherichia coli_ (as indicator for fecal contamination).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe investigation points at sugar peas as the source of this outbreak.\nThe Danish and the Norwegian outbreaks do not appear to have been\ncaused by the same type of peas, the batch of sugar snaps that was\nlikely contaminated in Denmark was different from the one imported\ninto Norway and also the Danish outbreak occurred one month earlier\nthat the Norwegian outbreak. It is possible, though, that both\noutbreaks may have been a result of the same contamination event in\nKenya; further investigations may cast light on this.\n\nOutbreaks with a high ratio of females among cases may often point to\nfresh produce as the source. Only one previous outbreak in Denmark has\nbeen associated with sugar peas, an outbreak of _Shigella flexneri_ in\n2002 in which the epidemiological evidence pointed towards fresh\nimported sugar snaps of African origin (unpublished). Other fresh\ntropical vegetables which were eaten raw, have also caused outbreaks\nof shigellosis in Denmark, most notable were 2 _Shigella sonnei_\noutbreaks in 2007 (2,3) and one in 1998 (4) both caused by baby corn\nimported from Thailand.\n\nThis outbreak underlines that some fresh vegetables imported into\nEurope from tropic destinations may pose a food safety hazard. In\nDenmark fresh imported sugar snaps are sold as a ready-to-eat product.\nConsumers should be aware that these types of products may pose a risk\nof microbiological contamination. The sugar snaps will remain crispy\nafter being blanched or boiled briefly and it may be advisable for\nconsumers to heat-treat fresh vegetables of this type before\nconsumption.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Nasjonalt Folkehelseinstitutt (Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth), Oslo, Norway\n2. Veterinaerinstituttet (National Veterinary Institute), Oslo, Norway\n3. Mattilsynet (Norwegian Food Safety Authority), Oslo, Norway]\n\nIn Norway, shigellosis is a mandatorily notifiable disease, and all\nisolates are submitted to the NIPH [Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth] for verification and typing. Around 150 cases of shigellosis\nare confirmed per year, the majority caused by _Shigella sonnei_. Only\naround 10 to 20 of the shigellosis cases reported each year are\nacquired in Norway, usually as secondary cases caused by fecal-oral\ntransmission in households.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, the National Reference Laboratory at the NIPH alerted\nabout a suspected outbreak involving 4 cases of _Shigella sonnei_\ninfection. The infected persons were living in 2 different counties in\nNorway, and they had no foreign travel history during the week before\nonset of illness. On the same day, a municipal medical doctor reported\nto the NIPH 5 suspected cases of shigellosis in 2 separate households.\n\nEpidemiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAn outbreak investigation was initiated on 27 May 2009 by interviewing\nthe 4 confirmed cases using a trawling questionnaire. On the same day\nthe NFSA [Norwegian Food Safety Authority] inspectors visited the 2\nhouseholds where suspected cases were reported and found an unopened\npackage of sugar peas imported from Kenya in one household, and the\npacking of the same brand of sugar peas in the other. The sugar peas\nwere bought in the same shop. Based on this suspicion, it was decided\nto focus the interviews on consumption of fresh vegetables and lettuce.\n\nMicrobiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAll suspected human _Shigella_ isolates received at NIPH are routinely\nverified, speciated, and typed with multilocus variable-number\ntandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) using a protocol developed by BA\nLindstedt et al (manuscript in preparation). Isolates of _Shigella\nsonnei_ showing a distinct MLVA-profile were defined as the outbreak\nstrain. Food samples were analyzed at the National Veterinary\nInstitute first by using NMKL no. 174 (_Shigella_ spp. PCR method for\ndetection in food), followed by immuno-magnetic separation (IMS) and\nplating on selective agar. Positive PCR results were confirmed by\nusing a modified version of an octaplex PCR developed for\nidentification of human diarrheagenic _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella\nspp._ (1). Any isolates obtained from food samples would be MLVA-typed\nat NIPH to compare with the patient isolates.\n\nResults\n-------\nBy 16 Jun 2009, the reference laboratory has registered a total of 20\ncases with the outbreak strain of _Shigella sonnei_, who had not\ntraveled abroad prior to illness onset. The cases live in different\nmunicipalities, but mainly in the central and western parts of Norway.\nThe date of onset for the 1st case was 10 May 2009 (Figure [for\nfigures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). All cases were adults except for\none teenager, and 16 of them were women. All 20 cases reported to have\neaten sugar peas, and there were no other obvious common exposures\nidentified. The majority of the patients had bought the sugar peas in\none of the large supermarket chains and only a few in another chain.\nThe NFSA traced the suspected food product and found that all the\nimplicated sugar peas were produced in Kenya. One sample from the\nunopened package of sugar peas collected in a patient household was\npositive for _Shigella sonnei_ by both PCR methods, but could not be\nculture-confirmed.\n\nInternational alerts\n--------------------\nOn 27 May 2009 the NIPH sent an urgent inquiry through the European\nFood and Waterborne Diseases Network at the European Centre for\nDisease Prevention and Control (ECDC) asking whether an increase in\nthe number of _Shigella sonnei_ cases had been registered in other\ncountries. On the same day, the NFSA sent an information notice\nthrough the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).\nBased on information from the interviews, the main importer\nvoluntarily recalled the product on 29 May 2009. Further results from\ntracing of the food product and preliminary results from the\nmicrobiological investigation led the NFSA to prohibit all sales of\nsugar peas imported from Kenya later the same day.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nAs a response to our urgent inquiry Denmark reported an increase in\nthe number of domestic _Shigella sonnei_ infections in April and May\n2009. They initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the\nDanish cases were related to the outbreak in Norway. The investigation\nin Denmark also pointed at sugar peas as the source of the outbreak,\nand microbiological investigations (including MLVA typing) to compare\nthe outbreak strains are ongoing.\n\nThe trace-back investigation of the food product appeared to be very\ncomplicated, and the NFSA is still investigating together with the\nindustry. Several wholesalers are supplying sugar peas to Norway, and\nthe product comes from several producers in Kenya. The 2 supermarket\nchains usually do not share the distribution system, but on some\noccasions they are supplied by the same whole-saler.\n\nOnly one previous outbreak in Norway has been associated with fresh\nvegetables. An increase in the number of domestic cases of _Shigella\nsonnei_ infection was detected in several European countries in 1994,\nincluding Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (2). In Norway 110\nculture-confirmed cases of infection were recorded at the time. In all\n3 countries epidemiological evidence incriminated imported iceberg\nlettuce of Spanish origin as the vehicle of transmission. The pathogen\nwas not isolated from the suspected food product.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Nasjonalt Folkehelseinstitutt (Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth), Oslo, Norway\n2. Veterinaerinstituttet (National Veterinary Institute), Oslo, Norway\n3. Mattilsynet (Norwegian Food Safety Authority), Oslo, Norway]\n\nIn Norway, shigellosis is a mandatorily notifiable disease, and all\nisolates are submitted to the NIPH [Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth] for verification and typing. Around 150 cases of shigellosis\nare confirmed per year, the majority caused by _Shigella sonnei_. Only\naround 10 to 20 of the shigellosis cases reported each year are\nacquired in Norway, usually as secondary cases caused by fecal-oral\ntransmission in households.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, the National Reference Laboratory at the NIPH alerted\nabout a suspected outbreak involving 4 cases of _Shigella sonnei_\ninfection. The infected persons were living in 2 different counties in\nNorway, and they had no foreign travel history during the week before\nonset of illness. On the same day, a municipal medical doctor reported\nto the NIPH 5 suspected cases of shigellosis in 2 separate households.\n\nEpidemiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAn outbreak investigation was initiated on 27 May 2009 by interviewing\nthe 4 confirmed cases using a trawling questionnaire. On the same day\nthe NFSA [Norwegian Food Safety Authority] inspectors visited the 2\nhouseholds where suspected cases were reported and found an unopened\npackage of sugar peas imported from Kenya in one household, and the\npacking of the same brand of sugar peas in the other. The sugar peas\nwere bought in the same shop. Based on this suspicion, it was decided\nto focus the interviews on consumption of fresh vegetables and lettuce.\n\nMicrobiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAll suspected human _Shigella_ isolates received at NIPH are routinely\nverified, speciated, and typed with multilocus variable-number\ntandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) using a protocol developed by BA\nLindstedt et al (manuscript in preparation). Isolates of _Shigella\nsonnei_ showing a distinct MLVA-profile were defined as the outbreak\nstrain. Food samples were analyzed at the National Veterinary\nInstitute first by using NMKL no. 174 (_Shigella_ spp. PCR method for\ndetection in food), followed by immuno-magnetic separation (IMS) and\nplating on selective agar. Positive PCR results were confirmed by\nusing a modified version of an octaplex PCR developed for\nidentification of human diarrheagenic _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella\nspp._ (1). Any isolates obtained from food samples would be MLVA-typed\nat NIPH to compare with the patient isolates.\n\nResults\n-------\nBy 16 Jun 2009, the reference laboratory has registered a total of 20\ncases with the outbreak strain of _Shigella sonnei_, who had not\ntraveled abroad prior to illness onset. The cases live in different\nmunicipalities, but mainly in the central and western parts of Norway.\nThe date of onset for the 1st case was 10 May 2009 (Figure [for\nfigures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). All cases were adults except for\none teenager, and 16 of them were women. All 20 cases reported to have\neaten sugar peas, and there were no other obvious common exposures\nidentified. The majority of the patients had bought the sugar peas in\none of the large supermarket chains and only a few in another chain.\nThe NFSA traced the suspected food product and found that all the\nimplicated sugar peas were produced in Kenya. One sample from the\nunopened package of sugar peas collected in a patient household was\npositive for _Shigella sonnei_ by both PCR methods, but could not be\nculture-confirmed.\n\nInternational alerts\n--------------------\nOn 27 May 2009 the NIPH sent an urgent inquiry through the European\nFood and Waterborne Diseases Network at the European Centre for\nDisease Prevention and Control (ECDC) asking whether an increase in\nthe number of _Shigella sonnei_ cases had been registered in other\ncountries. On the same day, the NFSA sent an information notice\nthrough the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).\nBased on information from the interviews, the main importer\nvoluntarily recalled the product on 29 May 2009. Further results from\ntracing of the food product and preliminary results from the\nmicrobiological investigation led the NFSA to prohibit all sales of\nsugar peas imported from Kenya later the same day.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nAs a response to our urgent inquiry Denmark reported an increase in\nthe number of domestic _Shigella sonnei_ infections in April and May\n2009. They initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the\nDanish cases were related to the outbreak in Norway. The investigation\nin Denmark also pointed at sugar peas as the source of the outbreak,\nand microbiological investigations (including MLVA typing) to compare\nthe outbreak strains are ongoing.\n\nThe trace-back investigation of the food product appeared to be very\ncomplicated, and the NFSA is still investigating together with the\nindustry. Several wholesalers are supplying sugar peas to Norway, and\nthe product comes from several producers in Kenya. The 2 supermarket\nchains usually do not share the distribution system, but on some\noccasions they are supplied by the same whole-saler.\n\nOnly one previous outbreak in Norway has been associated with fresh\nvegetables. An increase in the number of domestic cases of _Shigella\nsonnei_ infection was detected in several European countries in 1994,\nincluding Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (2). In Norway 110\nculture-confirmed cases of infection were recorded at the time. In all\n3 countries epidemiological evidence incriminated imported iceberg\nlettuce of Spanish origin as the vehicle of transmission. The pathogen\nwas not isolated from the suspected food product.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Fodevarestyrelsen (Danish Veterinary and Food Administration),\nCopenhagen, Denmark\n3. Department of Bacteriology, Mycology and Parasitology, Statens\nSerum Institut (Danish National Institute of Health, SSI), Copenhagen,\nDenmark]\n\nOn 27 May 2009 Norway sent an urgent inquiry through the European Food\nand Waterborne Diseases Network at the European Centre for Disease\nPrevention and Control (ECDC) reporting an increase in the number of\n_Shigella sonnei_ cases. By 1 Jun 2009 Norway informed that they\nsuspected the source to be sugar peas. As an increase in the number of\n_Shigella sonnei_ cases was also observed in Denmark in April and May\n2009, we initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the Danish\ncases were related to the Norwegian outbreak.\n\nMethods\n-------\nAll laboratory-confirmed _Shigella sonnei_ cases since 1 Apr 2009\n(Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]) were interviewed\nby telephone about date of onset, symptoms, travel history,\nconsumption of sugar peas and a small set of other exposure variables.\nPrevious data on sugar peas consumption in the background population\nwas reviewed. Isolates were subjected to typing by pulsed field gel\nelectrophoresis (PFGE) using the enzyme XbaI. Sugar peas sold in 3\nmajor groups of supermarket chains were traced back.\n\nResults\n-------\nIn all, 17 cases of _Shigella sonnei_ were reported from 1 Apr to 1\nJun 2009. 6 cases were travel-related and one was linked to another\nknown outbreak caused by fresh large shrimps from Bangladesh. Of the\nremaining 10 cases, 8 reported having eaten sugar peas prior to onset\nof symptoms. Of these 8 cases all were female and their median age was\n31 years (range 11-46 years). None had travelled abroad, except for\nshort trips to Sweden before getting ill. The dates of onset of\nillness ranged from 7 Apr to 8 May 2009. The 2 additional cases could\nbe related to the outbreak as likely secondary cases as they were\nchildren of one of the cases who had eaten sugar peas. The children\nfell ill 3 weeks after their mother.\n\nA case-control study was not performed; instead, previous food-borne\noutbreak investigations were reviewed. Consumption of sugar peas is\namong the questions included in several of the commonly used trawling\nquestionnaires in Denmark. We looked into 3 different rounds of\ntrawling questionnaire studies performed among cases of a large\noutbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium U292 (1). They were done in\nApril, May, and August 2008. In these studies 3/10, 2/17, and 0/15\ncases reported consumption of sugar peas in a period of 7 days prior\nto illness. This crude comparison indicated to us a significant\nassociation between _Shigella sonnei_ infections and consumption of\nsugar peas (using the persons interviewed in April and May 2009 as\ncommunity controls, comparing 8/8 exposed cases to 5/27 exposed\ncontrols, gives a Fisher p-value of less than 0.0001).\n\nPreliminary PFGE typing results of isolates from 5 of the 10 cases\nassociated with sugar pea consumption suggest highly similar patterns.\nThe PFGE patterns of the isolates from Danish patients resemble those\nobtained from the Norwegian patients but it is still too early to say\nif they are identical. Further typing results (which will include\nmultilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis - MLVA typing) and\ncomparisons between isolates from Denmark and Norway are pending.\n\nThe cases were generally able to recall in detail the type of product\nthey had consumed and in which shop they had bought it; 6 of the 10\ncases associated with the outbreak reported buying sugar peas in\nsupermarkets sharing in part the same distribution systems. Trace-back\ninvestigation of the sugar peas showed that they had been bought from\na single wholesaler in the Netherlands and that they were of 3\ndifferent varieties, which can be distinguished by their shapes,\nnamely sugar snaps, sugar peas (snow peas), and mange touts. They\noriginated predominantly from Kenya (from 4 different farms), but\nother batches sold in the same period came from Ethiopia and from\nGuatemala. The Dutch whole-seller was different from the one that\nsupplied sugar peas to Norway. The 2 remaining cases may have bought\ntheir sugar peas in another group of supermarket chains, which in part\nshares distribution systems with the supermarkets that sold the\nincriminated sugar peas in Norway. Further investigation into the\norigin of the sugar peas sold in this chain during April 2009 is still\nongoing. There were no remains of the batch of sugar peas under\nsuspicion and therefore microbiological analysis was not performed.\nLaboratory results from samples taken from later batches in 2 of the\nsupermarket chains did not reveal contamination by either _Shigella_\nspp. or _Escherichia coli_ (as indicator for fecal contamination).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe investigation points at sugar peas as the source of this outbreak.\nThe Danish and the Norwegian outbreaks do not appear to have been\ncaused by the same type of peas, the batch of sugar snaps that was\nlikely contaminated in Denmark was different from the one imported\ninto Norway and also the Danish outbreak occurred one month earlier\nthat the Norwegian outbreak. It is possible, though, that both\noutbreaks may have been a result of the same contamination event in\nKenya; further investigations may cast light on this.\n\nOutbreaks with a high ratio of females among cases may often point to\nfresh produce as the source. Only one previous outbreak in Denmark has\nbeen associated with sugar peas, an outbreak of _Shigella flexneri_ in\n2002 in which the epidemiological evidence pointed towards fresh\nimported sugar snaps of African origin (unpublished). Other fresh\ntropical vegetables which were eaten raw, have also caused outbreaks\nof shigellosis in Denmark, most notable were 2 _Shigella sonnei_\noutbreaks in 2007 (2,3) and one in 1998 (4) both caused by baby corn\nimported from Thailand.\n\nThis outbreak underlines that some fresh vegetables imported into\nEurope from tropic destinations may pose a food safety hazard. In\nDenmark fresh imported sugar snaps are sold as a ready-to-eat product.\nConsumers should be aware that these types of products may pose a risk\nof microbiological contamination. The sugar snaps will remain crispy\nafter being blanched or boiled briefly and it may be advisable for\nconsumers to heat-treat fresh vegetables of this type before\nconsumption.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Nasjonalt Folkehelseinstitutt (Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth), Oslo, Norway\n2. Veterinaerinstituttet (National Veterinary Institute), Oslo, Norway\n3. Mattilsynet (Norwegian Food Safety Authority), Oslo, Norway]\n\nIn Norway, shigellosis is a mandatorily notifiable disease, and all\nisolates are submitted to the NIPH [Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth] for verification and typing. Around 150 cases of shigellosis\nare confirmed per year, the majority caused by _Shigella sonnei_. Only\naround 10 to 20 of the shigellosis cases reported each year are\nacquired in Norway, usually as secondary cases caused by fecal-oral\ntransmission in households.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, the National Reference Laboratory at the NIPH alerted\nabout a suspected outbreak involving 4 cases of _Shigella sonnei_\ninfection. The infected persons were living in 2 different counties in\nNorway, and they had no foreign travel history during the week before\nonset of illness. On the same day, a municipal medical doctor reported\nto the NIPH 5 suspected cases of shigellosis in 2 separate households.\n\nEpidemiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAn outbreak investigation was initiated on 27 May 2009 by interviewing\nthe 4 confirmed cases using a trawling questionnaire. On the same day\nthe NFSA [Norwegian Food Safety Authority] inspectors visited the 2\nhouseholds where suspected cases were reported and found an unopened\npackage of sugar peas imported from Kenya in one household, and the\npacking of the same brand of sugar peas in the other. The sugar peas\nwere bought in the same shop. Based on this suspicion, it was decided\nto focus the interviews on consumption of fresh vegetables and lettuce.\n\nMicrobiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAll suspected human _Shigella_ isolates received at NIPH are routinely\nverified, speciated, and typed with multilocus variable-number\ntandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) using a protocol developed by BA\nLindstedt et al (manuscript in preparation). Isolates of _Shigella\nsonnei_ showing a distinct MLVA-profile were defined as the outbreak\nstrain. Food samples were analyzed at the National Veterinary\nInstitute first by using NMKL no. 174 (_Shigella_ spp. PCR method for\ndetection in food), followed by immuno-magnetic separation (IMS) and\nplating on selective agar. Positive PCR results were confirmed by\nusing a modified version of an octaplex PCR developed for\nidentification of human diarrheagenic _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella\nspp._ (1). Any isolates obtained from food samples would be MLVA-typed\nat NIPH to compare with the patient isolates.\n\nResults\n-------\nBy 16 Jun 2009, the reference laboratory has registered a total of 20\ncases with the outbreak strain of _Shigella sonnei_, who had not\ntraveled abroad prior to illness onset. The cases live in different\nmunicipalities, but mainly in the central and western parts of Norway.\nThe date of onset for the 1st case was 10 May 2009 (Figure [for\nfigures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). All cases were adults except for\none teenager, and 16 of them were women. All 20 cases reported to have\neaten sugar peas, and there were no other obvious common exposures\nidentified. The majority of the patients had bought the sugar peas in\none of the large supermarket chains and only a few in another chain.\nThe NFSA traced the suspected food product and found that all the\nimplicated sugar peas were produced in Kenya. One sample from the\nunopened package of sugar peas collected in a patient household was\npositive for _Shigella sonnei_ by both PCR methods, but could not be\nculture-confirmed.\n\nInternational alerts\n--------------------\nOn 27 May 2009 the NIPH sent an urgent inquiry through the European\nFood and Waterborne Diseases Network at the European Centre for\nDisease Prevention and Control (ECDC) asking whether an increase in\nthe number of _Shigella sonnei_ cases had been registered in other\ncountries. On the same day, the NFSA sent an information notice\nthrough the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).\nBased on information from the interviews, the main importer\nvoluntarily recalled the product on 29 May 2009. Further results from\ntracing of the food product and preliminary results from the\nmicrobiological investigation led the NFSA to prohibit all sales of\nsugar peas imported from Kenya later the same day.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nAs a response to our urgent inquiry Denmark reported an increase in\nthe number of domestic _Shigella sonnei_ infections in April and May\n2009. They initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the\nDanish cases were related to the outbreak in Norway. The investigation\nin Denmark also pointed at sugar peas as the source of the outbreak,\nand microbiological investigations (including MLVA typing) to compare\nthe outbreak strains are ongoing.\n\nThe trace-back investigation of the food product appeared to be very\ncomplicated, and the NFSA is still investigating together with the\nindustry. Several wholesalers are supplying sugar peas to Norway, and\nthe product comes from several producers in Kenya. The 2 supermarket\nchains usually do not share the distribution system, but on some\noccasions they are supplied by the same whole-saler.\n\nOnly one previous outbreak in Norway has been associated with fresh\nvegetables. An increase in the number of domestic cases of _Shigella\nsonnei_ infection was detected in several European countries in 1994,\nincluding Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (2). In Norway 110\nculture-confirmed cases of infection were recorded at the time. In all\n3 countries epidemiological evidence incriminated imported iceberg\nlettuce of Spanish origin as the vehicle of transmission. The pathogen\nwas not isolated from the suspected food product.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Fodevarestyrelsen (Danish Veterinary and Food Administration),\nCopenhagen, Denmark\n3. Department of Bacteriology, Mycology and Parasitology, Statens\nSerum Institut (Danish National Institute of Health, SSI), Copenhagen,\nDenmark]\n\nOn 27 May 2009 Norway sent an urgent inquiry through the European Food\nand Waterborne Diseases Network at the European Centre for Disease\nPrevention and Control (ECDC) reporting an increase in the number of\n_Shigella sonnei_ cases. By 1 Jun 2009 Norway informed that they\nsuspected the source to be sugar peas. As an increase in the number of\n_Shigella sonnei_ cases was also observed in Denmark in April and May\n2009, we initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the Danish\ncases were related to the Norwegian outbreak.\n\nMethods\n-------\nAll laboratory-confirmed _Shigella sonnei_ cases since 1 Apr 2009\n(Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]) were interviewed\nby telephone about date of onset, symptoms, travel history,\nconsumption of sugar peas and a small set of other exposure variables.\nPrevious data on sugar peas consumption in the background population\nwas reviewed. Isolates were subjected to typing by pulsed field gel\nelectrophoresis (PFGE) using the enzyme XbaI. Sugar peas sold in 3\nmajor groups of supermarket chains were traced back.\n\nResults\n-------\nIn all, 17 cases of _Shigella sonnei_ were reported from 1 Apr to 1\nJun 2009. 6 cases were travel-related and one was linked to another\nknown outbreak caused by fresh large shrimps from Bangladesh. Of the\nremaining 10 cases, 8 reported having eaten sugar peas prior to onset\nof symptoms. Of these 8 cases all were female and their median age was\n31 years (range 11-46 years). None had travelled abroad, except for\nshort trips to Sweden before getting ill. The dates of onset of\nillness ranged from 7 Apr to 8 May 2009. The 2 additional cases could\nbe related to the outbreak as likely secondary cases as they were\nchildren of one of the cases who had eaten sugar peas. The children\nfell ill 3 weeks after their mother.\n\nA case-control study was not performed; instead, previous food-borne\noutbreak investigations were reviewed. Consumption of sugar peas is\namong the questions included in several of the commonly used trawling\nquestionnaires in Denmark. We looked into 3 different rounds of\ntrawling questionnaire studies performed among cases of a large\noutbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium U292 (1). They were done in\nApril, May, and August 2008. In these studies 3/10, 2/17, and 0/15\ncases reported consumption of sugar peas in a period of 7 days prior\nto illness. This crude comparison indicated to us a significant\nassociation between _Shigella sonnei_ infections and consumption of\nsugar peas (using the persons interviewed in April and May 2009 as\ncommunity controls, comparing 8/8 exposed cases to 5/27 exposed\ncontrols, gives a Fisher p-value of less than 0.0001).\n\nPreliminary PFGE typing results of isolates from 5 of the 10 cases\nassociated with sugar pea consumption suggest highly similar patterns.\nThe PFGE patterns of the isolates from Danish patients resemble those\nobtained from the Norwegian patients but it is still too early to say\nif they are identical. Further typing results (which will include\nmultilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis - MLVA typing) and\ncomparisons between isolates from Denmark and Norway are pending.\n\nThe cases were generally able to recall in detail the type of product\nthey had consumed and in which shop they had bought it; 6 of the 10\ncases associated with the outbreak reported buying sugar peas in\nsupermarkets sharing in part the same distribution systems. Trace-back\ninvestigation of the sugar peas showed that they had been bought from\na single wholesaler in the Netherlands and that they were of 3\ndifferent varieties, which can be distinguished by their shapes,\nnamely sugar snaps, sugar peas (snow peas), and mange touts. They\noriginated predominantly from Kenya (from 4 different farms), but\nother batches sold in the same period came from Ethiopia and from\nGuatemala. The Dutch whole-seller was different from the one that\nsupplied sugar peas to Norway. The 2 remaining cases may have bought\ntheir sugar peas in another group of supermarket chains, which in part\nshares distribution systems with the supermarkets that sold the\nincriminated sugar peas in Norway. Further investigation into the\norigin of the sugar peas sold in this chain during April 2009 is still\nongoing. There were no remains of the batch of sugar peas under\nsuspicion and therefore microbiological analysis was not performed.\nLaboratory results from samples taken from later batches in 2 of the\nsupermarket chains did not reveal contamination by either _Shigella_\nspp. or _Escherichia coli_ (as indicator for fecal contamination).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe investigation points at sugar peas as the source of this outbreak.\nThe Danish and the Norwegian outbreaks do not appear to have been\ncaused by the same type of peas, the batch of sugar snaps that was\nlikely contaminated in Denmark was different from the one imported\ninto Norway and also the Danish outbreak occurred one month earlier\nthat the Norwegian outbreak. It is possible, though, that both\noutbreaks may have been a result of the same contamination event in\nKenya; further investigations may cast light on this.\n\nOutbreaks with a high ratio of females among cases may often point to\nfresh produce as the source. Only one previous outbreak in Denmark has\nbeen associated with sugar peas, an outbreak of _Shigella flexneri_ in\n2002 in which the epidemiological evidence pointed towards fresh\nimported sugar snaps of African origin (unpublished). Other fresh\ntropical vegetables which were eaten raw, have also caused outbreaks\nof shigellosis in Denmark, most notable were 2 _Shigella sonnei_\noutbreaks in 2007 (2,3) and one in 1998 (4) both caused by baby corn\nimported from Thailand.\n\nThis outbreak underlines that some fresh vegetables imported into\nEurope from tropic destinations may pose a food safety hazard. In\nDenmark fresh imported sugar snaps are sold as a ready-to-eat product.\nConsumers should be aware that these types of products may pose a risk\nof microbiological contamination. The sugar snaps will remain crispy\nafter being blanched or boiled briefly and it may be advisable for\nconsumers to heat-treat fresh vegetables of this type before\nconsumption.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Food samples were analyzed at the National Veterinary\nInstitute first by using NMKL no. 174 (_Shigella_ spp. PCR method for\ndetection in food), followed by immuno-magnetic separation (IMS) and\nplating on selective agar. Positive PCR results were confirmed by\nusing a modified version of an octaplex PCR developed for\nidentification of human diarrheagenic _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella\nspp._ (1). Any isolates obtained from food samples would be MLVA-typed\nat NIPH to compare with the patient isolates.\n\nResults\n-------\nBy 16 Jun 2009, the reference laboratory has registered a total of 20\ncases with the outbreak strain of _Shigella sonnei_, who had not\ntraveled abroad prior to illness onset. The cases live in different\nmunicipalities, but mainly in the central and western parts of Norway.\nThe date of onset for the 1st case was 10 May 2009 (Figure [for\nfigures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). All cases were adults except for\none teenager, and 16 of them were women. All 20 cases reported to have\neaten sugar peas, and there were no other obvious common exposures\nidentified. The majority of the patients had bought the sugar peas in\none of the large supermarket chains and only a few in another chain.\nThe NFSA traced the suspected food product and found that all the\nimplicated sugar peas were produced in Kenya. One sample from the\nunopened package of sugar peas collected in a patient household was\npositive for _Shigella sonnei_ by both PCR methods, but could not be\nculture-confirmed.\n\nInternational alerts\n--------------------\nOn 27 May 2009 the NIPH sent an urgent inquiry through the European\nFood and Waterborne Diseases Network at the European Centre for\nDisease Prevention and Control (ECDC) asking whether an increase in\nthe number of _Shigella sonnei_ cases had been registered in other\ncountries. On the same day, the NFSA sent an information notice\nthrough the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).\nBased on information from the interviews, the main importer\nvoluntarily recalled the product on 29 May 2009. Further results from\ntracing of the food product and preliminary results from the\nmicrobiological investigation led the NFSA to prohibit all sales of\nsugar peas imported from Kenya later the same day.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nAs a response to our urgent inquiry Denmark reported an increase in\nthe number of domestic _Shigella sonnei_ infections in April and May\n2009. They initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the\nDanish cases were related to the outbreak in Norway. The investigation\nin Denmark also pointed at sugar peas as the source of the outbreak,\nand microbiological investigations (including MLVA typing) to compare\nthe outbreak strains are ongoing.\n\nThe trace-back investigation of the food product appeared to be very\ncomplicated, and the NFSA is still investigating together with the\nindustry.

An increase in the number of domestic cases of _Shigella\nsonnei_ infection was detected in several European countries in 1994,\nincluding Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (2). In Norway 110\nculture-confirmed cases of infection were recorded at the time.

By 1 Jun 2009 Norway informed that they\nsuspected the source to be sugar peas. As an increase in the number of\n_Shigella sonnei_ cases was also observed in Denmark in April and May\n2009, we initiated an outbreak investigation to find out if the Danish\ncases were related to the Norwegian outbreak.\n\nMethods\n-------\nAll laboratory-confirmed _Shigella sonnei_ cases since 1 Apr 2009\n(Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]) were interviewed\nby telephone about date of onset, symptoms, travel history,\nconsumption of sugar peas and a small set of other exposure variables.\nPrevious data on sugar peas consumption in the background population\nwas reviewed. Isolates were subjected to typing by pulsed field gel\nelectrophoresis (PFGE) using the enzyme XbaI. Sugar peas sold in 3\nmajor groups of supermarket chains were traced back.\n\nResults\n-------\nIn all, 17 cases of _Shigella sonnei_ were reported from 1 Apr to 1\nJun 2009. 6 cases were travel-related and one was linked to another\nknown outbreak caused by fresh large shrimps from Bangladesh. Of the\nremaining 10 cases, 8 reported having eaten sugar peas prior to onset\nof symptoms. Of these 8 cases all were female and their median age was\n31 years (range 11-46 years). None had travelled abroad, except for\nshort trips to Sweden before getting ill. The dates of onset of\nillness ranged from 7 Apr to 8 May 2009. The 2 additional cases could\nbe related to the outbreak as likely secondary cases as they were\nchildren of one of the cases who had eaten sugar peas. The children\nfell ill 3 weeks after their mother.\n\nA case-control study was not performed; instead, previous food-borne\noutbreak investigations were reviewed. Consumption of sugar peas is\namong the questions included in several of the commonly used trawling\nquestionnaires in Denmark. We looked into 3 different rounds of\ntrawling questionnaire studies performed among cases of a large\noutbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium U292 (1). They were done in\nApril, May, and August 2008. In these studies 3/10, 2/17, and 0/15\ncases reported consumption of sugar peas in a period of 7 days prior\nto illness. This crude comparison indicated to us a significant\nassociation between _Shigella sonnei_ infections and consumption of\nsugar peas (using the persons interviewed in April and May 2009 as\ncommunity controls, comparing 8/8 exposed cases to 5/27 exposed\ncontrols, gives a Fisher p-value of less than 0.0001).\n\nPreliminary PFGE typing results of isolates from 5 of the 10 cases\nassociated with sugar pea consumption suggest highly similar patterns.\nThe PFGE patterns of the isolates from Danish patients resemble those\nobtained from the Norwegian patients but it is still too early to say\nif they are identical. Further typing results (which will include\nmultilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis - MLVA typing) and\ncomparisons between isolates from Denmark and Norway are pending.\n\nThe cases were generally able to recall in detail the type of product\nthey had consumed and in which shop they had bought it; 6 of the 10\ncases associated with the outbreak reported buying sugar peas in\nsupermarkets sharing in part the same distribution systems. Trace-back\ninvestigation of the sugar peas showed that they had been bought from\na single wholesaler in the Netherlands and that they were of 3\ndifferent varieties, which can be distinguished by their shapes,\nnamely sugar snaps, sugar peas (snow peas), and mange touts. They\noriginated predominantly from Kenya (from 4 different farms), but\nother batches sold in the same period came from Ethiopia and from\nGuatemala. The Dutch whole-seller was different from the one that\nsupplied sugar peas to Norway. The 2 remaining cases may have bought\ntheir sugar peas in another group of supermarket chains, which in part\nshares distribution systems with the supermarkets that sold the\nincriminated sugar peas in Norway. Further investigation into the\norigin of the sugar peas sold in this chain during April 2009 is still\nongoing. There were no remains of the batch of sugar peas under\nsuspicion and therefore microbiological analysis was not performed.\nLaboratory results from samples taken from later batches in 2 of the\nsupermarket chains did not reveal contamination by either _Shigella_\nspp. or _Escherichia coli_ (as indicator for fecal contamination).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe investigation points at sugar peas as the source of this outbreak.\nThe Danish and the Norwegian outbreaks do not appear to have been\ncaused by the same type of peas, the batch of sugar snaps that was\nlikely contaminated in Denmark was different from the one imported\ninto Norway and also the Danish outbreak occurred one month earlier\nthat the Norwegian outbreak. It is possible, though, that both\noutbreaks may have been a result of the same contamination event in\nKenya; further investigations may cast light on this.\n\nOutbreaks with a high ratio of females among cases may often point to\nfresh produce as the source. Only one previous outbreak in Denmark has\nbeen associated with sugar peas, an outbreak of _Shigella flexneri_ in\n2002 in which the epidemiological evidence pointed towards fresh\nimported sugar snaps of African origin (unpublished). Other fresh\ntropical vegetables which were eaten raw, have also caused outbreaks\nof shigellosis in Denmark, most notable were 2 _Shigella sonnei_\noutbreaks in 2007 (2,3) and one in 1998 (4) both caused by baby corn\nimported from Thailand.\n\nThis outbreak underlines that some fresh vegetables imported into\nEurope from tropic destinations may pose a food safety hazard. In\nDenmark fresh imported sugar snaps are sold as a ready-to-eat product.\nConsumers should be aware that these types of products may pose a risk\nof microbiological contamination. The sugar snaps will remain crispy\nafter being blanched or boiled briefly and it may be advisable for\nconsumers to heat-treat fresh vegetables of this type before\nconsumption.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Mattilsynet (Norwegian Food Safety Authority), Oslo, Norway]\n\nIn Norway, shigellosis is a mandatorily notifiable disease, and all\nisolates are submitted to the NIPH [Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth] for verification and typing. Around 150 cases of shigellosis\nare confirmed per year, the majority caused by _Shigella sonnei_. Only\naround 10 to 20 of the shigellosis cases reported each year are\nacquired in Norway, usually as secondary cases caused by fecal-oral\ntransmission in households.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, the National Reference Laboratory at the NIPH alerted\nabout a suspected outbreak involving 4 cases of _Shigella sonnei_\ninfection. The infected persons were living in 2 different counties in\nNorway, and they had no foreign travel history during the week before\nonset of illness. On the same day, a municipal medical doctor reported\nto the NIPH 5 suspected cases of shigellosis in 2 separate households.\n\nEpidemiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAn outbreak investigation was initiated on 27 May 2009 by interviewing\nthe 4 confirmed cases using a trawling questionnaire. On the same day\nthe NFSA [Norwegian Food Safety Authority] inspectors visited the 2\nhouseholds where suspected cases were reported and found an unopened\npackage of sugar peas imported from Kenya in one household, and the\npacking of the same brand of sugar peas in the other. The sugar peas\nwere bought in the same shop. Based on this suspicion, it was decided\nto focus the interviews on consumption of fresh vegetables and lettuce.\n\nMicrobiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAll suspected human _Shigella_ isolates received at NIPH are routinely\nverified, speciated, and typed with multilocus variable-number\ntandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) using a protocol developed by BA\nLindstedt et al (manuscript in preparation).

The 2 additional cases could\nbe related to the outbreak as likely secondary cases as they were\nchildren of one of the cases who had eaten sugar peas. The children\nfell ill 3 weeks after their mother.\n\nA case-control study was not performed; instead, previous food-borne\noutbreak investigations were reviewed. Consumption of sugar peas is\namong the questions included in several of the commonly used trawling\nquestionnaires in Denmark. We looked into 3 different rounds of\ntrawling questionnaire studies performed among cases of a large\noutbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium U292 (1). They were done in\nApril, May, and August 2008. In these studies 3/10, 2/17, and 0/15\ncases reported consumption of sugar peas in a period of 7 days prior\nto illness. This crude comparison indicated to us a significant\nassociation between _Shigella sonnei_ infections and consumption of\nsugar peas (using the persons interviewed in April and May 2009 as\ncommunity controls, comparing 8/8 exposed cases to 5/27 exposed\ncontrols, gives a Fisher p-value of less than 0.0001).\n\nPreliminary PFGE typing results of isolates from 5 of the 10 cases\nassociated with sugar pea consumption suggest highly similar patterns.\nThe PFGE patterns of the isolates from Danish patients resemble those\nobtained from the Norwegian patients but it is still too early to say\nif they are identical. Further typing results (which will include\nmultilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis - MLVA typing) and\ncomparisons between isolates from Denmark and Norway are pending.\n\nThe cases were generally able to recall in detail the type of product\nthey had consumed and in which shop they had bought it; 6 of the 10\ncases associated with the outbreak reported buying sugar peas in\nsupermarkets sharing in part the same distribution systems. Trace-back\ninvestigation of the sugar peas showed that they had been bought from\na single wholesaler in the Netherlands and that they were of 3\ndifferent varieties, which can be distinguished by their shapes,\nnamely sugar snaps, sugar peas (snow peas), and mange touts. They\noriginated predominantly from Kenya (from 4 different farms), but\nother batches sold in the same period came from Ethiopia and from\nGuatemala. The Dutch whole-seller was different from the one that\nsupplied sugar peas to Norway. The 2 remaining cases may have bought\ntheir sugar peas in another group of supermarket chains, which in part\nshares distribution systems with the supermarkets that sold the\nincriminated sugar peas in Norway. Further investigation into the\norigin of the sugar peas sold in this chain during April 2009 is still\nongoing. There were no remains of the batch of sugar peas under\nsuspicion and therefore microbiological analysis was not performed.\nLaboratory results from samples taken from later batches in 2 of the\nsupermarket chains did not reveal contamination by either _Shigella_\nspp. or _Escherichia coli_ (as indicator for fecal contamination).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe investigation points at sugar peas as the source of this outbreak.\nThe Danish and the Norwegian outbreaks do not appear to have been\ncaused by the same type of peas, the batch of sugar snaps that was\nlikely contaminated in Denmark was different from the one imported\ninto Norway and also the Danish outbreak occurred one month earlier\nthat the Norwegian outbreak. It is possible, though, that both\noutbreaks may have been a result of the same contamination event in\nKenya; further investigations may cast light on this.\n\nOutbreaks with a high ratio of females among cases may often point to\nfresh produce as the source. Only one previous outbreak in Denmark has\nbeen associated with sugar peas, an outbreak of _Shigella flexneri_ in\n2002 in which the epidemiological evidence pointed towards fresh\nimported sugar snaps of African origin (unpublished). Other fresh\ntropical vegetables which were eaten raw, have also caused outbreaks\nof shigellosis in Denmark, most notable were 2 _Shigella sonnei_\noutbreaks in 2007 (2,3) and one in 1998 (4) both caused by baby corn\nimported from Thailand.\n\nThis outbreak underlines that some fresh vegetables imported into\nEurope from tropic destinations may pose a food safety hazard. In\nDenmark fresh imported sugar snaps are sold as a ready-to-eat product.\nConsumers should be aware that these types of products may pose a risk\nof microbiological contamination. The sugar snaps will remain crispy\nafter being blanched or boiled briefly and it may be advisable for\nconsumers to heat-treat fresh vegetables of this type before\nconsumption.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The curd sold at the 2 markets was produced in a small\ncommercial dairy in Alytus, in the south of the country. An\nepidemiological investigation was begun on 7 Oct 2004 to identify\nrisk factors and the route of transmission, and control measures for\ninfection prevention were implemented.\nShigellosis-related morbidity in Lithuania during the past 10 years\nhas decreased from 143 per 100 000 population in 1995 to 23 per 100\n000 in 2004. Shigellosis is the cause of around 5 percent of all\nacute gastrointestinal infections in Lithuania. In 2002, 70 percent\nof all isolated shigella types were _Shigella sonnei_, 79 percent in\n2003 and 89 percent in 2004. Every year about 50 percent of known\nshigellosis cases are reported to be due to foodborne infections, and\nabout 30 percent are infected through person-to-person transmission.\nBetween 9 and 29 shigellosis outbreaks were reported annually between\n1996 and 2004 (an average of 19 outbreaks a year). 70 percent were\nfamily clusters. Some of these outbreaks were linked to the\nconsumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products that did not\nundergo additional thermal processing.\nCase finding\n------------\nBetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004, the Vilnius Public Health Center\nreceived 41 reports about clinical and/or laboratory confirmed\nshigellosis cases in Vilnius city. All these patients were directly\ninterviewed, and 36 cases were selected for analysis. All 36 of the\nselected shigellosis cases were clinically diagnosed and laboratory\nconfirmed as _S. sonnei_, and all were in patients living in Vilnius,\nwho between 23 Sep and 8 Oct had eaten unpasteurized milk curds\nproduced in a small dairy in Alytus and sold in 2 Vilnius markets.\nThe suspected curd product was thought to have been on sale from 23\nSep 2004, and production and sale were suspended on 8 Oct.\nAnalytical study\n----------------\nDirect interviews were carried out with 36 patients confirmed as _S.\nsonnei_ cases, and 83 controls. 2 types of controls were selected:\nthe 1st group lived in the same household as patients confirmed to\nhave _S. sonnei_ infections and did not have any symptoms in the\nmonth before the interview (symptoms were defined as 3 or more\nepisodes of diarrhea in a 24-hour period, nausea, vomiting, abdominal\npain, or fever). The 2nd control group were patients who had been\ntreated in other units of the hospital and who did not have any of\nthe symptoms described above in the month before interview. Controls\nwere selected according to demographic features, age and sex,\nalthough it was not possible to find an appropriate match for each case.\nCases and controls were interviewed with a standard questionnaire,\nrequesting personal information, clinical data, demographic\ninformation and information on food consumed during the week before\nonset of symptoms (for cases) or the week before the interview (for\ncontrols). The food questions focused on purchase, preparation and\nperiod of consumption of unpasteurized milk products. Information\nabout food eaten by children under 12 years was obtained from\nparents. Survey results were analysed using Epi Info version 3.3.2.\nEnvironmental investigation\n---------------------------\nOn 8 Oct 2004, the dairy in Alytus and the 2 markets in Vilnius were\ninspected by officials from local public health centres and the\nnational food and veterinary service, and raw milk, water, and\nenvironmental samples were taken for culture. The environmental\ninvestigation at the dairy examined milk and milk products, and the\ntransport, storage and preparation processes. Staff working at the\ndairy were interviewed about any recent illness. Vilnius food and\nveterinary service evaluated the condition of food in 2 Vilnius\nmarkets, and took environmental samples to assess bacteriological\nenvironmental contamination. Bacteriological samples were also taken\nfrom staff working in milk curds preparation, transport, and trading.\nFurther results\n---------------\nThe Vilnius Public Health Center reported 41 cases of shigellosis\nbetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004. 36 laboratory-confirmed cases of _S.\nsonnei_ infection were found to be associated with the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk curd that was prepared in a dairy. Samples from 8\npeople living or working in the dairy were laboratory-tested. _S.\nsonnei_ was isolated from the dairy owner and 2 of her household\nmembers (who did not work in food production). 4 workers who handled\nunpasteurized milk curds at the 2 markets were also sampled, and the\nsame type of _S. sonnei_ was isolated from one of these workers. The\ncultures were typed at the laboratory of the National Public Health\nInvestigation Center. All pathogen cultures isolated from patients,\nworkers, and inhabitants of the dairy, and the market worker were of\nthe same type and resistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nChildren under 14 years made up 50 percent of the patients (18/36),\nand people aged 65 years and older made up 16 percent of patients\n(6/36). 23 patients (69 percent) were admitted to hospital. 80\npercent of outbreak cases were in women and 20 percent were in men.\nThe earliest recorded date of symptom onset was 25 Sep, and the\nlatest was 11 Oct 2004 (Figure - To see figure, see original URL).\nThe incubation period was reported to be 24 hours for 50 percent of\ncases, 48 hours for 21 percent, and 72 hours for 29 percent. After\nevaluating maximum and minimum incubation period duration and dates\nof onset, the period during which the contaminated curd was on sale\nwas defined as 23 Sep to 8 Oct 2004.\nVariables were examined for association with illness in single\nvariable analysis. Only eating unpasteurized milk curd remained\nsignificantly associated with shigellosis (odds ratio 14.78; 95\npercent confidence interval 3.33-65.5; p less than 0.05) No other\nfood item was positively associated with the disease.\nThe dairy was licensed to produce unpasteurized milk products and\nsold its products at 2 Vilnius markets. During the outbreak\ninvestigation the national food and veterinary service specialists\nidentified many violations of hygiene and food safety regulations.\nThe counter at one of the markets where milk products were sold was\nfound to be contaminated with coliform bacteria.\nBacteriological samples were taken from all persons working in the\ndairy. _S. sonnei_ isolates were obtained from dairy owner and 2\nmembers of her household who did not handle food. No pathogenic\nbacteria were detected in milk products produced in the dairy.\nControl and prevention measures\n----------------------------------\nThe local food and veterinary service in Alytus temporarily closed\nthe dairy as soon as the unpasteurized milk curd was suspected as a\nsource of infection.\nThe national food and veterinary service withdrew the suspect milk\ncurd from sale in Vilnius. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated from\nsamples, the owner of the dairy and her 2 household members were\nadmitted to hospital. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated, the infected\nperson who worked at one of the 2 markets in Vilnius was instructed\nto stay home from work until she had fully recovered. All staff\nhandling food at the dairy and the markets attended compulsory\nhygiene classes. The suspected risk factors were made public through\nthe media, and the public were recommended to cook unpasteurised milk\nproducts thoroughly before consumption.\nDiscussion\n-----------\nThe results of the epidemiological investigation concluded that the\nshigellosis outbreak in Vilnius was linked to unpasteurized curd that\nhad been contaminated in a dairy because (1) cases of the same type\nof _Shigella sonnei_ were reported only in Vilnius; (2) the milk\ncurds from the dairy in Alytus were on sale only in Vilnius, from 23\nSep to 8 Oct 2004; (3) all patients had bought the curd from the same\nstalls at 1 of 2 markets in Vilnius; and (4) _S. sonnei_ isolates\nfrom patients, dairy staff and market staff were of the same type and\nresistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nShigellosis outbreaks in Lithuania tend to occur within households or\nnursery schools, but this outbreak demonstrated that the risk of\nshigellosis spread through unpasteurized milk products still\npersists. Outbreaks that occur due to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk products are reported every year in Lithuania.\nMost of these outbreaks are linked to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk and milk products bought from unlicensed\nvillage-based producers. Unpasteurized milk products are often\nbought by old people in Lithuania. Generally, _Shigella sp._ are not\nisolated from the milk products that cause outbreaks, and the\noutbreak source is detected only by epidemiological investigation methods.\n[Some] of the main outbreak control measures [are] food safety and\nhygiene training for people handling milk products and\ngastrointestinal infectious disease prevention training for the\npublic. This must involve familiarizing the public with the idea that\n[infected persons] must avoid preparing food, and should stay at home\nand not attend work or school until symptoms have ended.\n[Reported by: Zagrebneviene G (<g.zagrebneviene@ulpkc.lt>),\nJasulaitiene V, Morkunas B, et al]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of\npathogens including _Campylobacter_, _Brucella_, _E. coli_ O157 ,\n_Salmonella_ (including multidrug-resistant strains), _Mycobacterium\nbovis_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_ (1, 2). Persons who drink\nunpasteurized milk and milk products might believe that these\nproducts taste better, provide greater nutrition than pasteurized\nproducts, and/or decrease the risk for various medical conditions\n(3). However, the benefits of consuming unpasteurized milk and milk\nproducts have never been validated scientifically (4). The above\npathogens cause zoonoses -- infections spread to humans from animals.\nShigellosis spread by unpasteurized dairy products is not a zoonosis,\nexcept when related to primates. Since pasteurized milk was not\nfound to transmit shigellosis, the contamination must have occurred\nprior to pasteurization.\nIndividuals with symptomatic shigellosis (bacterial dysentery) are\nmuch less likely to transmit shigellosis by contaminating\nunpasteurized milk, as they can be quite ill. The posting does not\ncomment on symptoms in the dairy and food workers, but their\nhospitalization might suggest that they were symptomatic. It is\npossible that only one of the workers at the dairy caused the\ncontamination; or that the others, with the patients and the market\nworker, were infected by the contaminated milk.\n1.

The curd sold at the 2 markets was produced in a small\ncommercial dairy in Alytus, in the south of the country. An\nepidemiological investigation was begun on 7 Oct 2004 to identify\nrisk factors and the route of transmission, and control measures for\ninfection prevention were implemented.\nShigellosis-related morbidity in Lithuania during the past 10 years\nhas decreased from 143 per 100 000 population in 1995 to 23 per 100\n000 in 2004. Shigellosis is the cause of around 5 percent of all\nacute gastrointestinal infections in Lithuania. In 2002, 70 percent\nof all isolated shigella types were _Shigella sonnei_, 79 percent in\n2003 and 89 percent in 2004. Every year about 50 percent of known\nshigellosis cases are reported to be due to foodborne infections, and\nabout 30 percent are infected through person-to-person transmission.\nBetween 9 and 29 shigellosis outbreaks were reported annually between\n1996 and 2004 (an average of 19 outbreaks a year). 70 percent were\nfamily clusters. Some of these outbreaks were linked to the\nconsumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products that did not\nundergo additional thermal processing.\nCase finding\n------------\nBetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004, the Vilnius Public Health Center\nreceived 41 reports about clinical and/or laboratory confirmed\nshigellosis cases in Vilnius city. All these patients were directly\ninterviewed, and 36 cases were selected for analysis. All 36 of the\nselected shigellosis cases were clinically diagnosed and laboratory\nconfirmed as _S. sonnei_, and all were in patients living in Vilnius,\nwho between 23 Sep and 8 Oct had eaten unpasteurized milk curds\nproduced in a small dairy in Alytus and sold in 2 Vilnius markets.\nThe suspected curd product was thought to have been on sale from 23\nSep 2004, and production and sale were suspended on 8 Oct.\nAnalytical study\n----------------\nDirect interviews were carried out with 36 patients confirmed as _S.\nsonnei_ cases, and 83 controls. 2 types of controls were selected:\nthe 1st group lived in the same household as patients confirmed to\nhave _S. sonnei_ infections and did not have any symptoms in the\nmonth before the interview (symptoms were defined as 3 or more\nepisodes of diarrhea in a 24-hour period, nausea, vomiting, abdominal\npain, or fever). The 2nd control group were patients who had been\ntreated in other units of the hospital and who did not have any of\nthe symptoms described above in the month before interview. Controls\nwere selected according to demographic features, age and sex,\nalthough it was not possible to find an appropriate match for each case.\nCases and controls were interviewed with a standard questionnaire,\nrequesting personal information, clinical data, demographic\ninformation and information on food consumed during the week before\nonset of symptoms (for cases) or the week before the interview (for\ncontrols). The food questions focused on purchase, preparation and\nperiod of consumption of unpasteurized milk products. Information\nabout food eaten by children under 12 years was obtained from\nparents. Survey results were analysed using Epi Info version 3.3.2.\nEnvironmental investigation\n---------------------------\nOn 8 Oct 2004, the dairy in Alytus and the 2 markets in Vilnius were\ninspected by officials from local public health centres and the\nnational food and veterinary service, and raw milk, water, and\nenvironmental samples were taken for culture. The environmental\ninvestigation at the dairy examined milk and milk products, and the\ntransport, storage and preparation processes. Staff working at the\ndairy were interviewed about any recent illness. Vilnius food and\nveterinary service evaluated the condition of food in 2 Vilnius\nmarkets, and took environmental samples to assess bacteriological\nenvironmental contamination. Bacteriological samples were also taken\nfrom staff working in milk curds preparation, transport, and trading.\nFurther results\n---------------\nThe Vilnius Public Health Center reported 41 cases of shigellosis\nbetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004. 36 laboratory-confirmed cases of _S.\nsonnei_ infection were found to be associated with the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk curd that was prepared in a dairy. Samples from 8\npeople living or working in the dairy were laboratory-tested. _S.\nsonnei_ was isolated from the dairy owner and 2 of her household\nmembers (who did not work in food production). 4 workers who handled\nunpasteurized milk curds at the 2 markets were also sampled, and the\nsame type of _S. sonnei_ was isolated from one of these workers. The\ncultures were typed at the laboratory of the National Public Health\nInvestigation Center. All pathogen cultures isolated from patients,\nworkers, and inhabitants of the dairy, and the market worker were of\nthe same type and resistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nChildren under 14 years made up 50 percent of the patients (18/36),\nand people aged 65 years and older made up 16 percent of patients\n(6/36). 23 patients (69 percent) were admitted to hospital. 80\npercent of outbreak cases were in women and 20 percent were in men.\nThe earliest recorded date of symptom onset was 25 Sep, and the\nlatest was 11 Oct 2004 (Figure - To see figure, see original URL).\nThe incubation period was reported to be 24 hours for 50 percent of\ncases, 48 hours for 21 percent, and 72 hours for 29 percent. After\nevaluating maximum and minimum incubation period duration and dates\nof onset, the period during which the contaminated curd was on sale\nwas defined as 23 Sep to 8 Oct 2004.\nVariables were examined for association with illness in single\nvariable analysis. Only eating unpasteurized milk curd remained\nsignificantly associated with shigellosis (odds ratio 14.78; 95\npercent confidence interval 3.33-65.5; p less than 0.05) No other\nfood item was positively associated with the disease.\nThe dairy was licensed to produce unpasteurized milk products and\nsold its products at 2 Vilnius markets. During the outbreak\ninvestigation the national food and veterinary service specialists\nidentified many violations of hygiene and food safety regulations.\nThe counter at one of the markets where milk products were sold was\nfound to be contaminated with coliform bacteria.\nBacteriological samples were taken from all persons working in the\ndairy. _S. sonnei_ isolates were obtained from dairy owner and 2\nmembers of her household who did not handle food. No pathogenic\nbacteria were detected in milk products produced in the dairy.\nControl and prevention measures\n----------------------------------\nThe local food and veterinary service in Alytus temporarily closed\nthe dairy as soon as the unpasteurized milk curd was suspected as a\nsource of infection.\nThe national food and veterinary service withdrew the suspect milk\ncurd from sale in Vilnius. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated from\nsamples, the owner of the dairy and her 2 household members were\nadmitted to hospital. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated, the infected\nperson who worked at one of the 2 markets in Vilnius was instructed\nto stay home from work until she had fully recovered. All staff\nhandling food at the dairy and the markets attended compulsory\nhygiene classes. The suspected risk factors were made public through\nthe media, and the public were recommended to cook unpasteurised milk\nproducts thoroughly before consumption.\nDiscussion\n-----------\nThe results of the epidemiological investigation concluded that the\nshigellosis outbreak in Vilnius was linked to unpasteurized curd that\nhad been contaminated in a dairy because (1) cases of the same type\nof _Shigella sonnei_ were reported only in Vilnius; (2) the milk\ncurds from the dairy in Alytus were on sale only in Vilnius, from 23\nSep to 8 Oct 2004; (3) all patients had bought the curd from the same\nstalls at 1 of 2 markets in Vilnius; and (4) _S. sonnei_ isolates\nfrom patients, dairy staff and market staff were of the same type and\nresistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nShigellosis outbreaks in Lithuania tend to occur within households or\nnursery schools, but this outbreak demonstrated that the risk of\nshigellosis spread through unpasteurized milk products still\npersists. Outbreaks that occur due to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk products are reported every year in Lithuania.\nMost of these outbreaks are linked to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk and milk products bought from unlicensed\nvillage-based producers. Unpasteurized milk products are often\nbought by old people in Lithuania. Generally, _Shigella sp._ are not\nisolated from the milk products that cause outbreaks, and the\noutbreak source is detected only by epidemiological investigation methods.\n[Some] of the main outbreak control measures [are] food safety and\nhygiene training for people handling milk products and\ngastrointestinal infectious disease prevention training for the\npublic. This must involve familiarizing the public with the idea that\n[infected persons] must avoid preparing food, and should stay at home\nand not attend work or school until symptoms have ended.\n[Reported by: Zagrebneviene G (<g.zagrebneviene@ulpkc.lt>),\nJasulaitiene V, Morkunas B, et al]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of\npathogens including _Campylobacter_, _Brucella_, _E. coli_ O157 ,\n_Salmonella_ (including multidrug-resistant strains), _Mycobacterium\nbovis_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_ (1, 2). Persons who drink\nunpasteurized milk and milk products might believe that these\nproducts taste better, provide greater nutrition than pasteurized\nproducts, and/or decrease the risk for various medical conditions\n(3). However, the benefits of consuming unpasteurized milk and milk\nproducts have never been validated scientifically (4). The above\npathogens cause zoonoses -- infections spread to humans from animals.\nShigellosis spread by unpasteurized dairy products is not a zoonosis,\nexcept when related to primates. Since pasteurized milk was not\nfound to transmit shigellosis, the contamination must have occurred\nprior to pasteurization.\nIndividuals with symptomatic shigellosis (bacterial dysentery) are\nmuch less likely to transmit shigellosis by contaminating\nunpasteurized milk, as they can be quite ill. The posting does not\ncomment on symptoms in the dairy and food workers, but their\nhospitalization might suggest that they were symptomatic. It is\npossible that only one of the workers at the dairy caused the\ncontamination; or that the others, with the patients and the market\nworker, were infected by the contaminated milk.\n1.

The suspected risk factors were made public through\nthe media, and the public were recommended to cook unpasteurised milk\nproducts thoroughly before consumption.\nDiscussion\n-----------\nThe results of the epidemiological investigation concluded that the\nshigellosis outbreak in Vilnius was linked to unpasteurized curd that\nhad been contaminated in a dairy because (1) cases of the same type\nof _Shigella sonnei_ were reported only in Vilnius; (2) the milk\ncurds from the dairy in Alytus were on sale only in Vilnius, from 23\nSep to 8 Oct 2004; (3) all patients had bought the curd from the same\nstalls at 1 of 2 markets in Vilnius; and (4) _S. sonnei_ isolates\nfrom patients, dairy staff and market staff were of the same type and\nresistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nShigellosis outbreaks in Lithuania tend to occur within households or\nnursery schools, but this outbreak demonstrated that the risk of\nshigellosis spread through unpasteurized milk products still\npersists. Outbreaks that occur due to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk products are reported every year in Lithuania.\nMost of these outbreaks are linked to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk and milk products bought from unlicensed\nvillage-based producers. Unpasteurized milk products are often\nbought by old people in Lithuania. Generally, _Shigella sp._ are not\nisolated from the milk products that cause outbreaks, and the\noutbreak source is detected only by epidemiological investigation methods.\n[Some] of the main outbreak control measures [are] food safety and\nhygiene training for people handling milk products and\ngastrointestinal infectious disease prevention training for the\npublic. This must involve familiarizing the public with the idea that\n[infected persons] must avoid preparing food, and should stay at home\nand not attend work or school until symptoms have ended.\n[Reported by: Zagrebneviene G (<g.zagrebneviene@ulpkc.lt>),\nJasulaitiene V, Morkunas B, et al]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of\npathogens including _Campylobacter_, _Brucella_, _E. coli_ O157 ,\n_Salmonella_ (including multidrug-resistant strains), _Mycobacterium\nbovis_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_ (1, 2). Persons who drink\nunpasteurized milk and milk products might believe that these\nproducts taste better, provide greater nutrition than pasteurized\nproducts, and/or decrease the risk for various medical conditions\n(3).

The curd sold at the 2 markets was produced in a small\ncommercial dairy in Alytus, in the south of the country. An\nepidemiological investigation was begun on 7 Oct 2004 to identify\nrisk factors and the route of transmission, and control measures for\ninfection prevention were implemented.\nShigellosis-related morbidity in Lithuania during the past 10 years\nhas decreased from 143 per 100 000 population in 1995 to 23 per 100\n000 in 2004. Shigellosis is the cause of around 5 percent of all\nacute gastrointestinal infections in Lithuania. In 2002, 70 percent\nof all isolated shigella types were _Shigella sonnei_, 79 percent in\n2003 and 89 percent in 2004. Every year about 50 percent of known\nshigellosis cases are reported to be due to foodborne infections, and\nabout 30 percent are infected through person-to-person transmission.\nBetween 9 and 29 shigellosis outbreaks were reported annually between\n1996 and 2004 (an average of 19 outbreaks a year). 70 percent were\nfamily clusters. Some of these outbreaks were linked to the\nconsumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products that did not\nundergo additional thermal processing.\nCase finding\n------------\nBetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004, the Vilnius Public Health Center\nreceived 41 reports about clinical and/or laboratory confirmed\nshigellosis cases in Vilnius city. All these patients were directly\ninterviewed, and 36 cases were selected for analysis. All 36 of the\nselected shigellosis cases were clinically diagnosed and laboratory\nconfirmed as _S. sonnei_, and all were in patients living in Vilnius,\nwho between 23 Sep and 8 Oct had eaten unpasteurized milk curds\nproduced in a small dairy in Alytus and sold in 2 Vilnius markets.\nThe suspected curd product was thought to have been on sale from 23\nSep 2004, and production and sale were suspended on 8 Oct.\nAnalytical study\n----------------\nDirect interviews were carried out with 36 patients confirmed as _S.\nsonnei_ cases, and 83 controls. 2 types of controls were selected:\nthe 1st group lived in the same household as patients confirmed to\nhave _S. sonnei_ infections and did not have any symptoms in the\nmonth before the interview (symptoms were defined as 3 or more\nepisodes of diarrhea in a 24-hour period, nausea, vomiting, abdominal\npain, or fever). The 2nd control group were patients who had been\ntreated in other units of the hospital and who did not have any of\nthe symptoms described above in the month before interview. Controls\nwere selected according to demographic features, age and sex,\nalthough it was not possible to find an appropriate match for each case.\nCases and controls were interviewed with a standard questionnaire,\nrequesting personal information, clinical data, demographic\ninformation and information on food consumed during the week before\nonset of symptoms (for cases) or the week before the interview (for\ncontrols). The food questions focused on purchase, preparation and\nperiod of consumption of unpasteurized milk products. Information\nabout food eaten by children under 12 years was obtained from\nparents. Survey results were analysed using Epi Info version 3.3.2.\nEnvironmental investigation\n---------------------------\nOn 8 Oct 2004, the dairy in Alytus and the 2 markets in Vilnius were\ninspected by officials from local public health centres and the\nnational food and veterinary service, and raw milk, water, and\nenvironmental samples were taken for culture. The environmental\ninvestigation at the dairy examined milk and milk products, and the\ntransport, storage and preparation processes. Staff working at the\ndairy were interviewed about any recent illness. Vilnius food and\nveterinary service evaluated the condition of food in 2 Vilnius\nmarkets, and took environmental samples to assess bacteriological\nenvironmental contamination. Bacteriological samples were also taken\nfrom staff working in milk curds preparation, transport, and trading.\nFurther results\n---------------\nThe Vilnius Public Health Center reported 41 cases of shigellosis\nbetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004. 36 laboratory-confirmed cases of _S.\nsonnei_ infection were found to be associated with the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk curd that was prepared in a dairy. Samples from 8\npeople living or working in the dairy were laboratory-tested. _S.\nsonnei_ was isolated from the dairy owner and 2 of her household\nmembers (who did not work in food production). 4 workers who handled\nunpasteurized milk curds at the 2 markets were also sampled, and the\nsame type of _S. sonnei_ was isolated from one of these workers. The\ncultures were typed at the laboratory of the National Public Health\nInvestigation Center. All pathogen cultures isolated from patients,\nworkers, and inhabitants of the dairy, and the market worker were of\nthe same type and resistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nChildren under 14 years made up 50 percent of the patients (18/36),\nand people aged 65 years and older made up 16 percent of patients\n(6/36). 23 patients (69 percent) were admitted to hospital. 80\npercent of outbreak cases were in women and 20 percent were in men.\nThe earliest recorded date of symptom onset was 25 Sep, and the\nlatest was 11 Oct 2004 (Figure - To see figure, see original URL).\nThe incubation period was reported to be 24 hours for 50 percent of\ncases, 48 hours for 21 percent, and 72 hours for 29 percent. After\nevaluating maximum and minimum incubation period duration and dates\nof onset, the period during which the contaminated curd was on sale\nwas defined as 23 Sep to 8 Oct 2004.\nVariables were examined for association with illness in single\nvariable analysis. Only eating unpasteurized milk curd remained\nsignificantly associated with shigellosis (odds ratio 14.78; 95\npercent confidence interval 3.33-65.5; p less than 0.05) No other\nfood item was positively associated with the disease.\nThe dairy was licensed to produce unpasteurized milk products and\nsold its products at 2 Vilnius markets. During the outbreak\ninvestigation the national food and veterinary service specialists\nidentified many violations of hygiene and food safety regulations.\nThe counter at one of the markets where milk products were sold was\nfound to be contaminated with coliform bacteria.\nBacteriological samples were taken from all persons working in the\ndairy. _S. sonnei_ isolates were obtained from dairy owner and 2\nmembers of her household who did not handle food. No pathogenic\nbacteria were detected in milk products produced in the dairy.\nControl and prevention measures\n----------------------------------\nThe local food and veterinary service in Alytus temporarily closed\nthe dairy as soon as the unpasteurized milk curd was suspected as a\nsource of infection.\nThe national food and veterinary service withdrew the suspect milk\ncurd from sale in Vilnius. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated from\nsamples, the owner of the dairy and her 2 household members were\nadmitted to hospital. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated, the infected\nperson who worked at one of the 2 markets in Vilnius was instructed\nto stay home from work until she had fully recovered. All staff\nhandling food at the dairy and the markets attended compulsory\nhygiene classes. The suspected risk factors were made public through\nthe media, and the public were recommended to cook unpasteurised milk\nproducts thoroughly before consumption.\nDiscussion\n-----------\nThe results of the epidemiological investigation concluded that the\nshigellosis outbreak in Vilnius was linked to unpasteurized curd that\nhad been contaminated in a dairy because (1) cases of the same type\nof _Shigella sonnei_ were reported only in Vilnius; (2) the milk\ncurds from the dairy in Alytus were on sale only in Vilnius, from 23\nSep to 8 Oct 2004; (3) all patients had bought the curd from the same\nstalls at 1 of 2 markets in Vilnius; and (4) _S. sonnei_ isolates\nfrom patients, dairy staff and market staff were of the same type and\nresistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nShigellosis outbreaks in Lithuania tend to occur within households or\nnursery schools, but this outbreak demonstrated that the risk of\nshigellosis spread through unpasteurized milk products still\npersists.

In 2002, 70 percent\nof all isolated shigella types were _Shigella sonnei_, 79 percent in\n2003 and 89 percent in 2004. Every year about 50 percent of known\nshigellosis cases are reported to be due to foodborne infections, and\nabout 30 percent are infected through person-to-person transmission.\nBetween 9 and 29 shigellosis outbreaks were reported annually between\n1996 and 2004 (an average of 19 outbreaks a year). 70 percent were\nfamily clusters. Some of these outbreaks were linked to the\nconsumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products that did not\nundergo additional thermal processing.\nCase finding\n------------\nBetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004, the Vilnius Public Health Center\nreceived 41 reports about clinical and/or laboratory confirmed\nshigellosis cases in Vilnius city. All these patients were directly\ninterviewed, and 36 cases were selected for analysis. All 36 of the\nselected shigellosis cases were clinically diagnosed and laboratory\nconfirmed as _S. sonnei_, and all were in patients living in Vilnius,\nwho between 23 Sep and 8 Oct had eaten unpasteurized milk curds\nproduced in a small dairy in Alytus and sold in 2 Vilnius markets.\nThe suspected curd product was thought to have been on sale from 23\nSep 2004, and production and sale were suspended on 8 Oct.\nAnalytical study\n----------------\nDirect interviews were carried out with 36 patients confirmed as _S.\nsonnei_ cases, and 83 controls. 2 types of controls were selected:\nthe 1st group lived in the same household as patients confirmed to\nhave _S. sonnei_ infections and did not have any symptoms in the\nmonth before the interview (symptoms were defined as 3 or more\nepisodes of diarrhea in a 24-hour period, nausea, vomiting, abdominal\npain, or fever). The 2nd control group were patients who had been\ntreated in other units of the hospital and who did not have any of\nthe symptoms described above in the month before interview. Controls\nwere selected according to demographic features, age and sex,\nalthough it was not possible to find an appropriate match for each case.\nCases and controls were interviewed with a standard questionnaire,\nrequesting personal information, clinical data, demographic\ninformation and information on food consumed during the week before\nonset of symptoms (for cases) or the week before the interview (for\ncontrols). The food questions focused on purchase, preparation and\nperiod of consumption of unpasteurized milk products. Information\nabout food eaten by children under 12 years was obtained from\nparents. Survey results were analysed using Epi Info version 3.3.2.\nEnvironmental investigation\n---------------------------\nOn 8 Oct 2004, the dairy in Alytus and the 2 markets in Vilnius were\ninspected by officials from local public health centres and the\nnational food and veterinary service, and raw milk, water, and\nenvironmental samples were taken for culture. The environmental\ninvestigation at the dairy examined milk and milk products, and the\ntransport, storage and preparation processes. Staff working at the\ndairy were interviewed about any recent illness. Vilnius food and\nveterinary service evaluated the condition of food in 2 Vilnius\nmarkets, and took environmental samples to assess bacteriological\nenvironmental contamination. Bacteriological samples were also taken\nfrom staff working in milk curds preparation, transport, and trading.\nFurther results\n---------------\nThe Vilnius Public Health Center reported 41 cases of shigellosis\nbetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004. 36 laboratory-confirmed cases of _S.\nsonnei_ infection were found to be associated with the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk curd that was prepared in a dairy. Samples from 8\npeople living or working in the dairy were laboratory-tested. _S.\nsonnei_ was isolated from the dairy owner and 2 of her household\nmembers (who did not work in food production). 4 workers who handled\nunpasteurized milk curds at the 2 markets were also sampled, and the\nsame type of _S. sonnei_ was isolated from one of these workers. The\ncultures were typed at the laboratory of the National Public Health\nInvestigation Center. All pathogen cultures isolated from patients,\nworkers, and inhabitants of the dairy, and the market worker were of\nthe same type and resistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nChildren under 14 years made up 50 percent of the patients (18/36),\nand people aged 65 years and older made up 16 percent of patients\n(6/36). 23 patients (69 percent) were admitted to hospital. 80\npercent of outbreak cases were in women and 20 percent were in men.\nThe earliest recorded date of symptom onset was 25 Sep, and the\nlatest was 11 Oct 2004 (Figure - To see figure, see original URL).\nThe incubation period was reported to be 24 hours for 50 percent of\ncases, 48 hours for 21 percent, and 72 hours for 29 percent. After\nevaluating maximum and minimum incubation period duration and dates\nof onset, the period during which the contaminated curd was on sale\nwas defined as 23 Sep to 8 Oct 2004.\nVariables were examined for association with illness in single\nvariable analysis. Only eating unpasteurized milk curd remained\nsignificantly associated with shigellosis (odds ratio 14.78; 95\npercent confidence interval 3.33-65.5; p less than 0.05) No other\nfood item was positively associated with the disease.\nThe dairy was licensed to produce unpasteurized milk products and\nsold its products at 2 Vilnius markets. During the outbreak\ninvestigation the national food and veterinary service specialists\nidentified many violations of hygiene and food safety regulations.\nThe counter at one of the markets where milk products were sold was\nfound to be contaminated with coliform bacteria.\nBacteriological samples were taken from all persons working in the\ndairy. _S. sonnei_ isolates were obtained from dairy owner and 2\nmembers of her household who did not handle food. No pathogenic\nbacteria were detected in milk products produced in the dairy.\nControl and prevention measures\n----------------------------------\nThe local food and veterinary service in Alytus temporarily closed\nthe dairy as soon as the unpasteurized milk curd was suspected as a\nsource of infection.\nThe national food and veterinary service withdrew the suspect milk\ncurd from sale in Vilnius. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated from\nsamples, the owner of the dairy and her 2 household members were\nadmitted to hospital. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated, the infected\nperson who worked at one of the 2 markets in Vilnius was instructed\nto stay home from work until she had fully recovered. All staff\nhandling food at the dairy and the markets attended compulsory\nhygiene classes. The suspected risk factors were made public through\nthe media, and the public were recommended to cook unpasteurised milk\nproducts thoroughly before consumption.\nDiscussion\n-----------\nThe results of the epidemiological investigation concluded that the\nshigellosis outbreak in Vilnius was linked to unpasteurized curd that\nhad been contaminated in a dairy because (1) cases of the same type\nof _Shigella sonnei_ were reported only in Vilnius; (2) the milk\ncurds from the dairy in Alytus were on sale only in Vilnius, from 23\nSep to 8 Oct 2004; (3) all patients had bought the curd from the same\nstalls at 1 of 2 markets in Vilnius; and (4) _S. sonnei_ isolates\nfrom patients, dairy staff and market staff were of the same type and\nresistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nShigellosis outbreaks in Lithuania tend to occur within households or\nnursery schools, but this outbreak demonstrated that the risk of\nshigellosis spread through unpasteurized milk products still\npersists. Outbreaks that occur due to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk products are reported every year in Lithuania.\nMost of these outbreaks are linked to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk and milk products bought from unlicensed\nvillage-based producers. Unpasteurized milk products are often\nbought by old people in Lithuania. Generally, _Shigella sp._ are not\nisolated from the milk products that cause outbreaks, and the\noutbreak source is detected only by epidemiological investigation methods.\n[Some] of the main outbreak control measures [are] food safety and\nhygiene training for people handling milk products and\ngastrointestinal infectious disease prevention training for the\npublic. This must involve familiarizing the public with the idea that\n[infected persons] must avoid preparing food, and should stay at home\nand not attend work or school until symptoms have ended.\n[Reported by: Zagrebneviene G (<g.zagrebneviene@ulpkc.lt>),\nJasulaitiene V, Morkunas B, et al]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of\npathogens including _Campylobacter_, _Brucella_, _E. coli_ O157 ,\n_Salmonella_ (including multidrug-resistant strains), _Mycobacterium\nbovis_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_ (1, 2). Persons who drink\nunpasteurized milk and milk products might believe that these\nproducts taste better, provide greater nutrition than pasteurized\nproducts, and/or decrease the risk for various medical conditions\n(3). However, the benefits of consuming unpasteurized milk and milk\nproducts have never been validated scientifically (4). The above\npathogens cause zoonoses -- infections spread to humans from animals.\nShigellosis spread by unpasteurized dairy products is not a zoonosis,\nexcept when related to primates. Since pasteurized milk was not\nfound to transmit shigellosis, the contamination must have occurred\nprior to pasteurization.\nIndividuals with symptomatic shigellosis (bacterial dysentery) are\nmuch less likely to transmit shigellosis by contaminating\nunpasteurized milk, as they can be quite ill. The posting does not\ncomment on symptoms in the dairy and food workers, but their\nhospitalization might suggest that they were symptomatic. It is\npossible that only one of the workers at the dairy caused the\ncontamination; or that the others, with the patients and the market\nworker, were infected by the contaminated milk.\n1.

The curd sold at the 2 markets was produced in a small\ncommercial dairy in Alytus, in the south of the country. An\nepidemiological investigation was begun on 7 Oct 2004 to identify\nrisk factors and the route of transmission, and control measures for\ninfection prevention were implemented.\nShigellosis-related morbidity in Lithuania during the past 10 years\nhas decreased from 143 per 100 000 population in 1995 to 23 per 100\n000 in 2004.

The curd sold at the 2 markets was produced in a small\ncommercial dairy in Alytus, in the south of the country. An\nepidemiological investigation was begun on 7 Oct 2004 to identify\nrisk factors and the route of transmission, and control measures for\ninfection prevention were implemented.\nShigellosis-related morbidity in Lithuania during the past 10 years\nhas decreased from 143 per 100 000 population in 1995 to 23 per 100\n000 in 2004. Shigellosis is the cause of around 5 percent of all\nacute gastrointestinal infections in Lithuania. In 2002, 70 percent\nof all isolated shigella types were _Shigella sonnei_, 79 percent in\n2003 and 89 percent in 2004. Every year about 50 percent of known\nshigellosis cases are reported to be due to foodborne infections, and\nabout 30 percent are infected through person-to-person transmission.\nBetween 9 and 29 shigellosis outbreaks were reported annually between\n1996 and 2004 (an average of 19 outbreaks a year). 70 percent were\nfamily clusters. Some of these outbreaks were linked to the\nconsumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products that did not\nundergo additional thermal processing.\nCase finding\n------------\nBetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004, the Vilnius Public Health Center\nreceived 41 reports about clinical and/or laboratory confirmed\nshigellosis cases in Vilnius city. All these patients were directly\ninterviewed, and 36 cases were selected for analysis. All 36 of the\nselected shigellosis cases were clinically diagnosed and laboratory\nconfirmed as _S. sonnei_, and all were in patients living in Vilnius,\nwho between 23 Sep and 8 Oct had eaten unpasteurized milk curds\nproduced in a small dairy in Alytus and sold in 2 Vilnius markets.\nThe suspected curd product was thought to have been on sale from 23\nSep 2004, and production and sale were suspended on 8 Oct.\nAnalytical study\n----------------\nDirect interviews were carried out with 36 patients confirmed as _S.\nsonnei_ cases, and 83 controls. 2 types of controls were selected:\nthe 1st group lived in the same household as patients confirmed to\nhave _S. sonnei_ infections and did not have any symptoms in the\nmonth before the interview (symptoms were defined as 3 or more\nepisodes of diarrhea in a 24-hour period, nausea, vomiting, abdominal\npain, or fever). The 2nd control group were patients who had been\ntreated in other units of the hospital and who did not have any of\nthe symptoms described above in the month before interview. Controls\nwere selected according to demographic features, age and sex,\nalthough it was not possible to find an appropriate match for each case.\nCases and controls were interviewed with a standard questionnaire,\nrequesting personal information, clinical data, demographic\ninformation and information on food consumed during the week before\nonset of symptoms (for cases) or the week before the interview (for\ncontrols). The food questions focused on purchase, preparation and\nperiod of consumption of unpasteurized milk products. Information\nabout food eaten by children under 12 years was obtained from\nparents. Survey results were analysed using Epi Info version 3.3.2.\nEnvironmental investigation\n---------------------------\nOn 8 Oct 2004, the dairy in Alytus and the 2 markets in Vilnius were\ninspected by officials from local public health centres and the\nnational food and veterinary service, and raw milk, water, and\nenvironmental samples were taken for culture. The environmental\ninvestigation at the dairy examined milk and milk products, and the\ntransport, storage and preparation processes. Staff working at the\ndairy were interviewed about any recent illness. Vilnius food and\nveterinary service evaluated the condition of food in 2 Vilnius\nmarkets, and took environmental samples to assess bacteriological\nenvironmental contamination. Bacteriological samples were also taken\nfrom staff working in milk curds preparation, transport, and trading.\nFurther results\n---------------\nThe Vilnius Public Health Center reported 41 cases of shigellosis\nbetween 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004. 36 laboratory-confirmed cases of _S.\nsonnei_ infection were found to be associated with the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk curd that was prepared in a dairy. Samples from 8\npeople living or working in the dairy were laboratory-tested. _S.\nsonnei_ was isolated from the dairy owner and 2 of her household\nmembers (who did not work in food production). 4 workers who handled\nunpasteurized milk curds at the 2 markets were also sampled, and the\nsame type of _S. sonnei_ was isolated from one of these workers. The\ncultures were typed at the laboratory of the National Public Health\nInvestigation Center. All pathogen cultures isolated from patients,\nworkers, and inhabitants of the dairy, and the market worker were of\nthe same type and resistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nChildren under 14 years made up 50 percent of the patients (18/36),\nand people aged 65 years and older made up 16 percent of patients\n(6/36). 23 patients (69 percent) were admitted to hospital. 80\npercent of outbreak cases were in women and 20 percent were in men.\nThe earliest recorded date of symptom onset was 25 Sep, and the\nlatest was 11 Oct 2004 (Figure - To see figure, see original URL).\nThe incubation period was reported to be 24 hours for 50 percent of\ncases, 48 hours for 21 percent, and 72 hours for 29 percent. After\nevaluating maximum and minimum incubation period duration and dates\nof onset, the period during which the contaminated curd was on sale\nwas defined as 23 Sep to 8 Oct 2004.\nVariables were examined for association with illness in single\nvariable analysis. Only eating unpasteurized milk curd remained\nsignificantly associated with shigellosis (odds ratio 14.78; 95\npercent confidence interval 3.33-65.5; p less than 0.05) No other\nfood item was positively associated with the disease.\nThe dairy was licensed to produce unpasteurized milk products and\nsold its products at 2 Vilnius markets. During the outbreak\ninvestigation the national food and veterinary service specialists\nidentified many violations of hygiene and food safety regulations.\nThe counter at one of the markets where milk products were sold was\nfound to be contaminated with coliform bacteria.\nBacteriological samples were taken from all persons working in the\ndairy. _S. sonnei_ isolates were obtained from dairy owner and 2\nmembers of her household who did not handle food. No pathogenic\nbacteria were detected in milk products produced in the dairy.\nControl and prevention measures\n----------------------------------\nThe local food and veterinary service in Alytus temporarily closed\nthe dairy as soon as the unpasteurized milk curd was suspected as a\nsource of infection.\nThe national food and veterinary service withdrew the suspect milk\ncurd from sale in Vilnius. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated from\nsamples, the owner of the dairy and her 2 household members were\nadmitted to hospital. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated, the infected\nperson who worked at one of the 2 markets in Vilnius was instructed\nto stay home from work until she had fully recovered. All staff\nhandling food at the dairy and the markets attended compulsory\nhygiene classes. The suspected risk factors were made public through\nthe media, and the public were recommended to cook unpasteurised milk\nproducts thoroughly before consumption.\nDiscussion\n-----------\nThe results of the epidemiological investigation concluded that the\nshigellosis outbreak in Vilnius was linked to unpasteurized curd that\nhad been contaminated in a dairy because (1) cases of the same type\nof _Shigella sonnei_ were reported only in Vilnius; (2) the milk\ncurds from the dairy in Alytus were on sale only in Vilnius, from 23\nSep to 8 Oct 2004; (3) all patients had bought the curd from the same\nstalls at 1 of 2 markets in Vilnius; and (4) _S. sonnei_ isolates\nfrom patients, dairy staff and market staff were of the same type and\nresistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nShigellosis outbreaks in Lithuania tend to occur within households or\nnursery schools, but this outbreak demonstrated that the risk of\nshigellosis spread through unpasteurized milk products still\npersists. Outbreaks that occur due to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk products are reported every year in Lithuania.\nMost of these outbreaks are linked to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk and milk products bought from unlicensed\nvillage-based producers. Unpasteurized milk products are often\nbought by old people in Lithuania. Generally, _Shigella sp._ are not\nisolated from the milk products that cause outbreaks, and the\noutbreak source is detected only by epidemiological investigation methods.\n[Some] of the main outbreak control measures [are] food safety and\nhygiene training for people handling milk products and\ngastrointestinal infectious disease prevention training for the\npublic. This must involve familiarizing the public with the idea that\n[infected persons] must avoid preparing food, and should stay at home\nand not attend work or school until symptoms have ended.\n[Reported by: Zagrebneviene G (<g.zagrebneviene@ulpkc.lt>),\nJasulaitiene V, Morkunas B, et al]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of\npathogens including _Campylobacter_, _Brucella_, _E. coli_ O157 ,\n_Salmonella_ (including multidrug-resistant strains), _Mycobacterium\nbovis_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_ (1, 2). Persons who drink\nunpasteurized milk and milk products might believe that these\nproducts taste better, provide greater nutrition than pasteurized\nproducts, and/or decrease the risk for various medical conditions\n(3). However, the benefits of consuming unpasteurized milk and milk\nproducts have never been validated scientifically (4). The above\npathogens cause zoonoses -- infections spread to humans from animals.\nShigellosis spread by unpasteurized dairy products is not a zoonosis,\nexcept when related to primates. Since pasteurized milk was not\nfound to transmit shigellosis, the contamination must have occurred\nprior to pasteurization.\nIndividuals with symptomatic shigellosis (bacterial dysentery) are\nmuch less likely to transmit shigellosis by contaminating\nunpasteurized milk, as they can be quite ill. The posting does not\ncomment on symptoms in the dairy and food workers, but their\nhospitalization might suggest that they were symptomatic. It is\npossible that only one of the workers at the dairy caused the\ncontamination; or that the others, with the patients and the market\nworker, were infected by the contaminated milk.\n1.

The\ncultures were typed at the laboratory of the National Public Health\nInvestigation Center. All pathogen cultures isolated from patients,\nworkers, and inhabitants of the dairy, and the market worker were of\nthe same type and resistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nChildren under 14 years made up 50 percent of the patients (18/36),\nand people aged 65 years and older made up 16 percent of patients\n(6/36). 23 patients (69 percent) were admitted to hospital. 80\npercent of outbreak cases were in women and 20 percent were in men.\nThe earliest recorded date of symptom onset was 25 Sep, and the\nlatest was 11 Oct 2004 (Figure - To see figure, see original URL).\nThe incubation period was reported to be 24 hours for 50 percent of\ncases, 48 hours for 21 percent, and 72 hours for 29 percent. After\nevaluating maximum and minimum incubation period duration and dates\nof onset, the period during which the contaminated curd was on sale\nwas defined as 23 Sep to 8 Oct 2004.\nVariables were examined for association with illness in single\nvariable analysis. Only eating unpasteurized milk curd remained\nsignificantly associated with shigellosis (odds ratio 14.78; 95\npercent confidence interval 3.33-65.5; p less than 0.05) No other\nfood item was positively associated with the disease.\nThe dairy was licensed to produce unpasteurized milk products and\nsold its products at 2 Vilnius markets. During the outbreak\ninvestigation the national food and veterinary service specialists\nidentified many violations of hygiene and food safety regulations.\nThe counter at one of the markets where milk products were sold was\nfound to be contaminated with coliform bacteria.\nBacteriological samples were taken from all persons working in the\ndairy. _S. sonnei_ isolates were obtained from dairy owner and 2\nmembers of her household who did not handle food. No pathogenic\nbacteria were detected in milk products produced in the dairy.\nControl and prevention measures\n----------------------------------\nThe local food and veterinary service in Alytus temporarily closed\nthe dairy as soon as the unpasteurized milk curd was suspected as a\nsource of infection.\nThe national food and veterinary service withdrew the suspect milk\ncurd from sale in Vilnius. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated from\nsamples, the owner of the dairy and her 2 household members were\nadmitted to hospital. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated, the infected\nperson who worked at one of the 2 markets in Vilnius was instructed\nto stay home from work until she had fully recovered. All staff\nhandling food at the dairy and the markets attended compulsory\nhygiene classes. The suspected risk factors were made public through\nthe media, and the public were recommended to cook unpasteurised milk\nproducts thoroughly before consumption.\nDiscussion\n-----------\nThe results of the epidemiological investigation concluded that the\nshigellosis outbreak in Vilnius was linked to unpasteurized curd that\nhad been contaminated in a dairy because (1) cases of the same type\nof _Shigella sonnei_ were reported only in Vilnius; (2) the milk\ncurds from the dairy in Alytus were on sale only in Vilnius, from 23\nSep to 8 Oct 2004; (3) all patients had bought the curd from the same\nstalls at 1 of 2 markets in Vilnius; and (4) _S. sonnei_ isolates\nfrom patients, dairy staff and market staff were of the same type and\nresistant to the same antimicrobial agents.\nShigellosis outbreaks in Lithuania tend to occur within households or\nnursery schools, but this outbreak demonstrated that the risk of\nshigellosis spread through unpasteurized milk products still\npersists. Outbreaks that occur due to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk products are reported every year in Lithuania.\nMost of these outbreaks are linked to the consumption of\nunpasteurized milk and milk products bought from unlicensed\nvillage-based producers. Unpasteurized milk products are often\nbought by old people in Lithuania. Generally, _Shigella sp._ are not\nisolated from the milk products that cause outbreaks, and the\noutbreak source is detected only by epidemiological investigation methods.\n[Some] of the main outbreak control measures [are] food safety and\nhygiene training for people handling milk products and\ngastrointestinal infectious disease prevention training for the\npublic. This must involve familiarizing the public with the idea that\n[infected persons] must avoid preparing food, and should stay at home\nand not attend work or school until symptoms have ended.\n[Reported by: Zagrebneviene G (<g.zagrebneviene@ulpkc.lt>),\nJasulaitiene V, Morkunas B, et al]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of\npathogens including _Campylobacter_, _Brucella_, _E. coli_ O157 ,\n_Salmonella_ (including multidrug-resistant strains), _Mycobacterium\nbovis_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_ (1, 2). Persons who drink\nunpasteurized milk and milk products might believe that these\nproducts taste better, provide greater nutrition than pasteurized\nproducts, and/or decrease the risk for various medical conditions\n(3). However, the benefits of consuming unpasteurized milk and milk\nproducts have never been validated scientifically (4). The above\npathogens cause zoonoses -- infections spread to humans from animals.\nShigellosis spread by unpasteurized dairy products is not a zoonosis,\nexcept when related to primates. Since pasteurized milk was not\nfound to transmit shigellosis, the contamination must have occurred\nprior to pasteurization.\nIndividuals with symptomatic shigellosis (bacterial dysentery) are\nmuch less likely to transmit shigellosis by contaminating\nunpasteurized milk, as they can be quite ill. The posting does not\ncomment on symptoms in the dairy and food workers, but their\nhospitalization might suggest that they were symptomatic. It is\npossible that only one of the workers at the dairy caused the\ncontamination; or that the others, with the patients and the market\nworker, were infected by the contaminated milk.\n1.
