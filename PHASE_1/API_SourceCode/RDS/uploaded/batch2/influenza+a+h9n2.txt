Presently, the H9N2 subtype AI virus has been widely spread in China and has established stable lineages in commercial chicken flocks with endemicity. Despite that the mortality caused by H9N2 generally not exceed 20 percent, it usually leads to respiratory and egg-drop symptom, as well as severe secondary infections, affecting poultry productivity. Therefore, at the current stage, vaccination is still one of the principal strategies to control H9N2 AI in China, apart from biosecurity measures (https://veterinaryresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13567-017-0453-2).\n\nIn 2018 there were 7 human cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) reported from China to WHO and 6 cases thus far in 2019. A total of 28 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) in China have been reported since December 2015 [WHO/WPRO].\n\nThe H9N2 viruses have shown sporadic transmission to humans and are donors of internal genes to other potentially pandemic sub-types such as A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 avian influenza viruses.\n\nAccording to the WHO Risk Assessment of human infection with avian influenza A virus (dated 24 Jun 2019; https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_24_06_2019.pdf): The overall public health risk from currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface has not changed, as further human infections with viruses of animal origin are expected, and the likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission of these viruses remains low. - Mod.UBA\n\nH9N2 influenza A viruses have become globally widespread in poultry over the last 2 decades and represent a genuine threat, both to the global poultry industry and also to humans, through their high rates of zoonotic infection and pandemic potential. Since they have an IVPI (intravenous pathogenicity index, in susceptible 6-week-old chickens) below 1.2, and are non-H5 and non-H7, according to OIE criteria they are not defined as 'avian influenza' and are not notifiable.\n\nH9N2 viruses are generally hyperendemic in affected countries and have been found in poultry in many new regions in recent years. Due to the economic damage caused by enzootic H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV), many countries including China, Israel, South Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and UAE have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry.\n\nThe most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines. Unlike human vaccines, H9N2 AIV vaccines are generally not as regularly assessed for their efficacy against antigenically drifted viruses and consequently are less often updated. Therefore, the virus may continue to infect and cause disease in vaccinated poultry with tentative evidence suggesting that suboptimal use of vaccination may be driving antigenic drift and/or clade replacement, and theoretically zoonotic potential and pathogenicity.\n\nA recent review (1), from which some of the above has been extracted, examines the current global spread of H9N2 avian influenza viruses as well as their host range, tropism, transmission routes, and the risk posed by these viruses to human health. The review includes a map presenting the phylogeographic range of poultry-adapted H9N2 lineages, such as BJ94, G1-W, G1-E, Y439, and their mixtures, as well as a table presenting data from the 48 countries in which the virus has been identified so far.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Presently, the H9N2 subtype AI virus has been widely spread in China and has established stable lineages in commercial chicken flocks with endemicity. Despite that the mortality caused by H9N2 generally not exceed 20 percent, it usually leads to respiratory and egg-drop symptom, as well as severe secondary infections, affecting poultry productivity. Therefore, at the current stage, vaccination is still one of the principal strategies to control H9N2 AI in China, apart from biosecurity measures (https://veterinaryresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13567-017-0453-2).\n\nIn 2018 there were 7 human cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) reported from China to WHO and 6 cases thus far in 2019. A total of 28 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) in China have been reported since December 2015 [WHO/WPRO].\n\nThe H9N2 viruses have shown sporadic transmission to humans and are donors of internal genes to other potentially pandemic sub-types such as A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 avian influenza viruses.\n\nAccording to the WHO Risk Assessment of human infection with avian influenza A virus (dated 24 Jun 2019; https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_24_06_2019.pdf): The overall public health risk from currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface has not changed, as further human infections with viruses of animal origin are expected, and the likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission of these viruses remains low. - Mod.UBA\n\nH9N2 influenza A viruses have become globally widespread in poultry over the last 2 decades and represent a genuine threat, both to the global poultry industry and also to humans, through their high rates of zoonotic infection and pandemic potential. Since they have an IVPI (intravenous pathogenicity index, in susceptible 6-week-old chickens) below 1.2, and are non-H5 and non-H7, according to OIE criteria they are not defined as 'avian influenza' and are not notifiable.\n\nH9N2 viruses are generally hyperendemic in affected countries and have been found in poultry in many new regions in recent years. Due to the economic damage caused by enzootic H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV), many countries including China, Israel, South Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and UAE have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry.\n\nThe most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines. Unlike human vaccines, H9N2 AIV vaccines are generally not as regularly assessed for their efficacy against antigenically drifted viruses and consequently are less often updated. Therefore, the virus may continue to infect and cause disease in vaccinated poultry with tentative evidence suggesting that suboptimal use of vaccination may be driving antigenic drift and/or clade replacement, and theoretically zoonotic potential and pathogenicity.\n\nA recent review (1), from which some of the above has been extracted, examines the current global spread of H9N2 avian influenza viruses as well as their host range, tropism, transmission routes, and the risk posed by these viruses to human health. The review includes a map presenting the phylogeographic range of poultry-adapted H9N2 lineages, such as BJ94, G1-W, G1-E, Y439, and their mixtures, as well as a table presenting data from the 48 countries in which the virus has been identified so far.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Since they have an IVPI (intravenous pathogenicity index, in susceptible 6-week-old chickens) below 1.2, and are non-H5 and non-H7, according to OIE criteria they are not defined as 'avian influenza' and are not notifiable.\n\nH9N2 viruses are generally hyperendemic in affected countries and have been found in poultry in many new regions in recent years. Due to the economic damage caused by enzootic H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV), many countries including China, Israel, South Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and UAE have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry.\n\nThe most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines. Unlike human vaccines, H9N2 AIV vaccines are generally not as regularly assessed for their efficacy against antigenically drifted viruses and consequently are less often updated. Therefore, the virus may continue to infect and cause disease in vaccinated poultry with tentative evidence suggesting that suboptimal use of vaccination may be driving antigenic drift and/or clade replacement, and theoretically zoonotic potential and pathogenicity.\n\nA recent review (1), from which some of the above has been extracted, examines the current global spread of H9N2 avian influenza viruses as well as their host range, tropism, transmission routes, and the risk posed by these viruses to human health. The review includes a map presenting the phylogeographic range of poultry-adapted H9N2 lineages, such as BJ94, G1-W, G1-E, Y439, and their mixtures, as well as a table presenting data from the 48 countries in which the virus has been identified so far.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Presently, the H9N2 subtype AI virus has been widely spread in China and has established stable lineages in commercial chicken flocks with endemicity.

Presently, the H9N2 subtype AI virus has been widely spread in China and has established stable lineages in commercial chicken flocks with endemicity. Despite that the mortality caused by H9N2 generally not exceed 20 percent, it usually leads to respiratory and egg-drop symptom, as well as severe secondary infections, affecting poultry productivity. Therefore, at the current stage, vaccination is still one of the principal strategies to control H9N2 AI in China, apart from biosecurity measures (https://veterinaryresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13567-017-0453-2).\n\nIn 2018 there were 7 human cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) reported from China to WHO and 6 cases thus far in 2019. A total of 28 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) in China have been reported since December 2015 [WHO/WPRO].\n\nThe H9N2 viruses have shown sporadic transmission to humans and are donors of internal genes to other potentially pandemic sub-types such as A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 avian influenza viruses.\n\nAccording to the WHO Risk Assessment of human infection with avian influenza A virus (dated 24 Jun 2019; https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_24_06_2019.pdf): The overall public health risk from currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface has not changed, as further human infections with viruses of animal origin are expected, and the likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission of these viruses remains low. - Mod.UBA\n\nH9N2 influenza A viruses have become globally widespread in poultry over the last 2 decades and represent a genuine threat, both to the global poultry industry and also to humans, through their high rates of zoonotic infection and pandemic potential. Since they have an IVPI (intravenous pathogenicity index, in susceptible 6-week-old chickens) below 1.2, and are non-H5 and non-H7, according to OIE criteria they are not defined as 'avian influenza' and are not notifiable.\n\nH9N2 viruses are generally hyperendemic in affected countries and have been found in poultry in many new regions in recent years. Due to the economic damage caused by enzootic H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV), many countries including China, Israel, South Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and UAE have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry.\n\nThe most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines. Unlike human vaccines, H9N2 AIV vaccines are generally not as regularly assessed for their efficacy against antigenically drifted viruses and consequently are less often updated. Therefore, the virus may continue to infect and cause disease in vaccinated poultry with tentative evidence suggesting that suboptimal use of vaccination may be driving antigenic drift and/or clade replacement, and theoretically zoonotic potential and pathogenicity.\n\nA recent review (1), from which some of the above has been extracted, examines the current global spread of H9N2 avian influenza viruses as well as their host range, tropism, transmission routes, and the risk posed by these viruses to human health. The review includes a map presenting the phylogeographic range of poultry-adapted H9N2 lineages, such as BJ94, G1-W, G1-E, Y439, and their mixtures, as well as a table presenting data from the 48 countries in which the virus has been identified so far.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

The case was a 3-year-old male. Avian influenza was suspected on 16 Jan 2015. Samples tested at Aswan subnational laboratory and subsequently the reference laboratory (NAMRU3) were positive for H9N2. Investigations revealed that the case had a history of contact with apparently healthy backyard poultry. H9N2 positive poultry have been detected in Egypt since 2011, yet this is the 1st confirmed human case.\n\nAlthough ubiquitous in Asian poultry, and endemic in Egyptian poultry as well, H9N2 has only rarely been reported in humans. It has been reported a handful of times, including in Hong Kong in 1999 (2 cases), 2003 (1 case), and 2007 (1 case), and most recently in December of 2013 (see http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2013/12/hong-kong-isolation-treatment-of-h9n2.html).\n\nSeveral additional human H9N2 virus infections were reported from China in 1998-99, and all known cases were mild [in children aged 9 months to 5 years]. More recently, in 2011 Bangladesh agreed to share the virus H9N2 with the US (CDC) for vaccine production, after detecting a case there.\n\nSince the virus is most common in areas where testing and surveillance are less than optimal, we really don't know how many people end up infected by it. Most cases are mild, and would be indistinguishable from ordinary flu.\n\nAlthough viewed as having at least some 'pandemic potential', perhaps more importantly H9N2 appears to play a central role in the evolution of other HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] viruses, including H5N1, H7N9, H5N6, and H10N8, all of which share several important features:\n1. They all first appear to emanate from mainland China\n2. They all appear to have come about through viral reassortment in poultry\n3. While their HA and NA genes differ -- they all carry the internal genes from the avian H9N2 virus\n\nThe avian H9N2 virus -- unlike the H5 and H7 avian viruses -- is not considered a 'reportable' disease by the OIE since it is viewed as a relatively stable LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza), not prone to evolving into a more dangerous HPAI form.\n\n[Byline: Mike Coston]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is thought to be the 1st human case of H9N2 in Egypt.\n\nH9N2 influenza viruses of domestic ducks have become established in the domestic poultry of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of the H9N2 viruses isolated from Hong Kong markets suggest 3 distinct sublineages. Among the chicken H9N2 viruses, 6 of the gene segments were apparently derived from an earlier chicken H9N2 virus isolated in China, whereas the PB1 and PB2 genes are closely related to those of the H5N1 viruses and a quail H9N2 virus A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (Qa/HK/G1/97) suggesting that many of the 1997 chicken H9 isolates in the markets were reassortants.\"\n\nThe majority of viruses that have been sequenced belong to the G1, chicken/Beijing (Y280/G9), or Eurasian clades. Since 1998, when the first human infection was detected, the isolation of A(H9N2) viruses from humans and swine has been reported infrequently. In all human cases the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID/NIH), has issued a task order under an existing contract to Chiron Corporation of Emeryville, California, for the production of an investigational vaccine based on an H9N2 strain of avian influenza virus that has infected humans and has the potential to trigger a modern-day pandemic.\"\n\nSources\n-------\nWikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H9N2\nWorld

Authorities report [edited]\nhttp://afludiary.blogspot.com/2015/02/an-h9n2-infection-in-egypt-updated-h5n1.html\n\n\nEgypt (Aswan): avian influenza human H9N2, 1st human case\n---------------------------------------------------------\nOn 10 Feb 2015, a human case of A (H9N2) influenza was detected by the routine national avian influenza surveillance system in Aswan Governorate. The case was a 3-year-old male. Avian influenza was suspected on 16 Jan 2015. Samples tested at Aswan subnational laboratory and subsequently the reference laboratory (NAMRU3) were positive for H9N2. Investigations revealed that the case had a history of contact with apparently healthy backyard poultry. H9N2 positive poultry have been detected in Egypt since 2011, yet this is the 1st confirmed human case.\n\nAlthough ubiquitous in Asian poultry, and endemic in Egyptian poultry as well, H9N2 has only rarely been reported in humans. It has been reported a handful of times, including in Hong Kong in 1999 (2 cases), 2003 (1 case), and 2007 (1 case), and most recently in December of 2013 (see http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2013/12/hong-kong-isolation-treatment-of-h9n2.html).\n\nSeveral additional human H9N2 virus infections were reported from China in 1998-99, and all known cases were mild [in children aged 9 months to 5 years]. More recently, in 2011 Bangladesh agreed to share the virus H9N2 with the US (CDC) for vaccine production, after detecting a case there.\n\nSince the virus is most common in areas where testing and surveillance are less than optimal, we really don't know how many people end up infected by it. Most cases are mild, and would be indistinguishable from ordinary flu.\n\nAlthough viewed as having at least some 'pandemic potential', perhaps more importantly H9N2 appears to play a central role in the evolution of other HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] viruses, including H5N1, H7N9, H5N6, and H10N8, all of which share several important features:\n1. They all first appear to emanate from mainland China\n2. They all appear to have come about through viral reassortment in poultry\n3. While their HA and NA genes differ -- they all carry the internal genes from the avian H9N2 virus\n\nThe avian H9N2 virus -- unlike the H5 and H7 avian viruses -- is not considered a 'reportable' disease by the OIE since it is viewed as a relatively stable LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza), not prone to evolving into a more dangerous HPAI form.\n\n[Byline: Mike Coston]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is thought to be the 1st human case of H9N2 in Egypt.\n\nH9N2 influenza viruses of domestic ducks have become established in the domestic poultry of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of the H9N2 viruses isolated from Hong Kong markets suggest 3 distinct sublineages. Among the chicken H9N2 viruses, 6 of the gene segments were apparently derived from an earlier chicken H9N2 virus isolated in China, whereas the PB1 and PB2 genes are closely related to those of the H5N1 viruses and a quail H9N2 virus A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (Qa/HK/G1/97) suggesting that many of the 1997 chicken H9 isolates in the markets were reassortants.\"\n\nThe majority of viruses that have been sequenced belong to the G1, chicken/Beijing (Y280/G9), or Eurasian clades. Since 1998, when the first human infection was detected, the isolation of A(H9N2) viruses from humans and swine has been reported infrequently. In all human cases the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID/NIH), has issued a task order under an existing contract to Chiron Corporation of Emeryville, California, for the production of an investigational vaccine based on an H9N2 strain of avian influenza virus that has infected humans and has the potential to trigger a modern-day pandemic.\"\n\nSources\n-------\nWikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H9N2\nWorld

case\n---------------------------------------------------------\nOn 10 Feb 2015, a human case of A (H9N2) influenza was detected by the routine national avian influenza surveillance system in Aswan Governorate. The case was a 3-year-old male. Avian influenza was suspected on 16 Jan 2015. Samples tested at Aswan subnational laboratory and subsequently the reference laboratory (NAMRU3) were positive for H9N2. Investigations revealed that the case had a history of contact with apparently healthy backyard poultry. H9N2 positive poultry have been detected in Egypt since 2011, yet this is the 1st confirmed human case.\n\nAlthough ubiquitous in Asian poultry, and endemic in Egyptian poultry as well, H9N2 has only rarely been reported in humans. It has been reported a handful of times, including in Hong Kong in 1999 (2 cases), 2003 (1 case), and 2007 (1 case), and most recently in December of 2013 (see http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2013/12/hong-kong-isolation-treatment-of-h9n2.html).\n\nSeveral additional human H9N2 virus infections were reported from China in 1998-99, and all known cases were mild [in children aged 9 months to 5 years]. More recently, in 2011 Bangladesh agreed to share the virus H9N2 with the US (CDC) for vaccine production, after detecting a case there.\n\nSince the virus is most common in areas where testing and surveillance are less than optimal, we really don't know how many people end up infected by it. Most cases are mild, and would be indistinguishable from ordinary flu.\n\nAlthough viewed as having at least some 'pandemic potential', perhaps more importantly H9N2 appears to play a central role in the evolution of other HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] viruses, including H5N1, H7N9, H5N6, and H10N8, all of which share several important features:\n1. They all first appear to emanate from mainland China\n2. They all appear to have come about through viral reassortment in poultry\n3. While their HA and NA genes differ -- they all carry the internal genes from the avian H9N2 virus\n\nThe avian H9N2 virus -- unlike the H5 and H7 avian viruses -- is not considered a 'reportable' disease by the OIE since it is viewed as a relatively stable LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza), not prone to evolving into a more dangerous HPAI form.\n\n[Byline: Mike Coston]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is thought to be the 1st human case of H9N2 in Egypt.\n\nH9N2 influenza viruses of domestic ducks have become established in the domestic poultry of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of the H9N2 viruses isolated from Hong Kong markets suggest 3 distinct sublineages. Among the chicken H9N2 viruses, 6 of the gene segments were apparently derived from an earlier chicken H9N2 virus isolated in China, whereas the PB1 and PB2 genes are closely related to those of the H5N1 viruses and a quail H9N2 virus A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (Qa/HK/G1/97) suggesting that many of the 1997 chicken H9 isolates in the markets were reassortants.\"\n\nThe majority of viruses that have been sequenced belong to the G1, chicken/Beijing (Y280/G9), or Eurasian clades. Since 1998, when the first human infection was detected, the isolation of A(H9N2) viruses from humans and swine has been reported infrequently. In all human cases the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID/NIH), has issued a task order under an existing contract to Chiron Corporation of Emeryville, California, for the production of an investigational vaccine based on an H9N2 strain of avian

case\n---------------------------------------------------------\nOn 10 Feb 2015, a human case of A (H9N2) influenza was detected by the routine national avian influenza surveillance system in Aswan Governorate. The case was a 3-year-old male. Avian influenza was suspected on 16 Jan 2015. Samples tested at Aswan subnational laboratory and subsequently the reference laboratory (NAMRU3) were positive for H9N2. Investigations revealed that the case had a history of contact with apparently healthy backyard poultry. H9N2 positive poultry have been detected in Egypt since 2011, yet this is the 1st confirmed human case.\n\nAlthough ubiquitous in Asian poultry, and endemic in Egyptian poultry as well, H9N2 has only rarely been reported in humans. It has been reported a handful of times, including in Hong Kong in 1999 (2 cases), 2003 (1 case), and 2007 (1 case), and most recently in December of 2013 (see http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2013/12/hong-kong-isolation-treatment-of-h9n2.html).\n\nSeveral additional human H9N2 virus infections were reported from China in 1998-99, and all known cases were mild [in children aged 9 months to 5 years]. More recently, in 2011 Bangladesh agreed to share the virus H9N2 with the US (CDC) for vaccine production, after detecting a case there.\n\nSince the virus is most common in areas where testing and surveillance are less than optimal, we really don't know how many people end up infected by it. Most cases are mild, and would be indistinguishable from ordinary flu.\n\nAlthough viewed as having at least some 'pandemic potential', perhaps more importantly H9N2 appears to play a central role in the evolution of other HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] viruses, including H5N1, H7N9, H5N6, and H10N8, all of which share several important features:\n1. They all first appear to emanate from mainland China\n2. They all appear to have come about through viral reassortment in poultry\n3. While their HA and NA genes differ -- they all carry the internal genes from the avian H9N2 virus\n\nThe avian H9N2 virus -- unlike the H5 and H7 avian viruses -- is not considered a 'reportable' disease by the OIE since it is viewed as a relatively stable LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza), not prone to evolving into a more dangerous HPAI form.\n\n[Byline: Mike Coston]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is thought to be the 1st human case of H9N2 in Egypt.\n\nH9N2 influenza viruses of domestic ducks have become established in the domestic poultry of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of the H9N2 viruses isolated from Hong Kong markets suggest 3 distinct sublineages. Among the chicken H9N2 viruses, 6 of the gene segments were apparently derived from an earlier chicken H9N2 virus isolated in China, whereas the PB1 and PB2 genes are closely related to those of the H5N1 viruses and a quail H9N2 virus A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (Qa/HK/G1/97) suggesting that many of the 1997 chicken H9 isolates in the markets were reassortants.\"\n\nThe majority of viruses that have been sequenced belong to the G1, chicken/Beijing (Y280/G9), or Eurasian clades. Since 1998, when the first human infection was detected, the isolation of A(H9N2) viruses from humans and swine has been reported infrequently. In all human cases the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

CASE\n***********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 10 Feb 2015\nSource: Avian Flu Diary, Egypt National Authorities report [edited]\nhttp://afludiary.blogspot.com/2015/02/an-h9n2-infection-in-egypt-updated-h5n1.html\n\n\nEgypt (Aswan): avian influenza human H9N2, 1st human case\n---------------------------------------------------------\nOn 10 Feb 2015, a human case of A (H9N2) influenza was detected by the routine national avian influenza surveillance system in Aswan Governorate. The case was a 3-year-old male. Avian influenza was suspected on 16 Jan 2015. Samples tested at Aswan subnational laboratory and subsequently the reference laboratory (NAMRU3) were positive for H9N2. Investigations revealed that the case had a history of contact with apparently healthy backyard poultry. H9N2 positive poultry have been detected in Egypt since 2011, yet this is the 1st confirmed human case.\n\nAlthough ubiquitous in Asian poultry, and endemic in Egyptian poultry as well, H9N2 has only rarely been reported in humans. It has been reported a handful of times, including in Hong Kong in 1999 (2 cases), 2003 (1 case), and 2007 (1 case), and most recently in December of 2013 (see http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2013/12/hong-kong-isolation-treatment-of-h9n2.html).\n\nSeveral additional human H9N2 virus infections were reported from China in 1998-99, and all known cases were mild [in children aged 9 months to 5 years]. More recently, in 2011 Bangladesh agreed to share the virus H9N2 with the US (CDC) for vaccine production, after detecting a case there.\n\nSince the virus is most common in areas where testing and surveillance are less than optimal, we really don't know how many people end up infected by it. Most cases are mild, and would be indistinguishable from ordinary flu.\n\nAlthough viewed as having at least some 'pandemic potential', perhaps more importantly H9N2 appears to play a central role in the evolution of other HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] viruses, including H5N1, H7N9, H5N6, and H10N8, all of which share several important features:\n1. They all first appear to emanate from mainland China\n2. They all appear to have come about through viral reassortment in poultry\n3. While their HA and NA genes differ -- they all carry the internal genes from the avian H9N2 virus\n\nThe avian H9N2 virus -- unlike the H5 and H7 avian viruses -- is not considered a 'reportable' disease by the OIE since it is viewed as a relatively stable LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza), not prone to evolving into a more dangerous HPAI form.\n\n[Byline: Mike Coston]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is thought to be the 1st human case of H9N2 in Egypt.\n\nH9N2 influenza viruses of domestic ducks have become established in the domestic poultry of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of the H9N2 viruses isolated from Hong Kong markets suggest 3 distinct sublineages. Among the chicken H9N2 viruses, 6 of the gene segments were apparently derived from an earlier chicken H9N2 virus isolated in China, whereas the PB1 and PB2 genes are closely related to those of the H5N1 viruses and a quail H9N2 virus A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (Qa/HK/G1/97) suggesting that many of the 1997 chicken H9 isolates in the markets were reassortants.\"\n\nThe majority of viruses that have been sequenced belong to the G1, chicken/Beijing (Y280/G9), or Eurasian clades. Since 1998, when the first human infection was detected, the isolation of A(H9N2) viruses from humans and swine has been reported infrequently. In all human cases the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID/NIH), has issued a task order under an existing contract to Chiron Corporation of Emeryville, California, for the production of an investigational vaccine based on an H9N2 strain of avian influenza virus that has infected humans and has the potential to trigger a modern-day pandemic.\"\n\nSources\n-------\nWikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H9N2\nWorld

(SAR)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nHONG KONG: A 9-month-old girl was infected with\nH9N2 -\ufffd a less virulent strain of avian influenza\n\ufffd- in Hong Kong and was being isolated at a\nhospital, health officials said Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].\nBefore becoming sick on 4 Mar 2007, the baby\nalmost daily visited a food market that sold live\npoultry, said Thomas Tsang Ho-fai of the Center\nfor Health Protection. Officials suspected she\nwas infected by birds at the market, he said.\nH9N2 is a mild strain [of avian influenza A\nvirus], [the H5N1 strain of avian influenza A\nvirus] has caused the deaths of at least 169\npeople worldwide. [The H9N2 virus belongs to a\ndifferent serotype of avian influenza A virus and\nshould not be described as a strain of H5N1\nvirus. These 2 avian influenza A viruses should\nbe regarded as distinct viruses differing in\nvirulence, host range and transmissibility. -\nMod.CP]. \"The baby's case is not that serious,\nand there's no serious indication that there was\nhuman-to-human infection,\" Tsang said.\nHong Kong reported 2 cases of the mild strain in\n1999 and one in 2003, he said. The patients were\nchildren who all recovered, he said. The recent\ncase returned home after spending 5 days in the\nhospital, but the child was put into isolation\nafter her samples tested positive for H9N2, said\nTsang, adding that the case was confirmed Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].\nOfficials were taking more samples from the\nmarket and family members, he said. Hong Kong\naggressively monitors bird flu because an\noutbreak [caaused by a highly pathogenic strain\nof different serotype - Mod CP.] in 1997 jumped\nto humans and killed 6 people. That prompted the\ngovernment to slaughter the entire poultry\npopulation of about 1.5 million birds.\n--\nJoseph P. Dudley, Ph.D\nChief Scientist,\nEAI Corporation\nResearch Associate,\nInstitute of Arctic Biology - University of Alaska Fairbanks\nDepartment of Earth Science - University of Alaska Museum\n<fnjpd@uaf.edu>\n[This case has precedents (e.g. see ProMED-mail\nposting : Influenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human -\nChina (Hong Kong) 19990407.0566 and Influenza A\n(H9N2), bird-to-human - China (Hong Kong)\n19990805.1347). In 1999 an influenza A (H9N2)\nvirus was isolated from 2 patients (aged one and\n4 years old) by the Virus Unit of the Hong Kong\nDepartment of Health. Both girls recovered fully.\nThis was the 1st occasion that an H9N2 virus had\nbeen isolated from humans in Hong Kong, although\ninfluenza A (H9N2) viruses had been isolated from\nducks and chickens for several years previously.\nIn both instances the H9N2 virus was isolated\nfrom mildly ill young children and there was no\nfurther spread of infection. The circumstances\nsurrounding the exposure of these children to infection have not been reported.\nOther avian influenza viruses have been isolated\nfrom human patients, notably the H5N1 virus in\nHong Kong in 1997 and subsequently, and H9N2 (and\nH5N1) in 2003, and the H7N7 virus in the more\nextensive poultry outbreak in the Netherlands\nearlier in 2003. On these occasions only the H5N1\nviruses caused severe disease in humans.

Officials suspected she\nwas infected by birds at the market, he said.\nH9N2 is a mild strain [of avian influenza A\nvirus], [the H5N1 strain of avian influenza A\nvirus] has caused the deaths of at least 169\npeople worldwide. [The H9N2 virus belongs to a\ndifferent serotype of avian influenza A virus and\nshould not be described as a strain of H5N1\nvirus.

The patients were\nchildren who all recovered, he said. The recent\ncase returned home after spending 5 days in the\nhospital, but the child was put into isolation\nafter her samples tested positive for H9N2, said\nTsang, adding that the case was confirmed Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].\nOfficials were taking more samples from the\nmarket and family members, he said. Hong Kong\naggressively monitors bird flu because an\noutbreak [caaused by a highly pathogenic strain\nof different serotype - Mod CP.] in 1997 jumped\nto humans and killed 6 people. That prompted the\ngovernment to slaughter the entire poultry\npopulation of about 1.5 million birds.\n--\nJoseph P.

Officials suspected she\nwas infected by birds at the market, he said.\nH9N2 is a mild strain [of avian influenza A\nvirus], [the H5N1 strain of avian influenza A\nvirus] has caused the deaths of at least 169\npeople worldwide. [The H9N2 virus belongs to a\ndifferent serotype of avian influenza A virus and\nshould not be described as a strain of H5N1\nvirus.

The patients were\nchildren who all recovered, he said. The recent\ncase returned home after spending 5 days in the\nhospital, but the child was put into isolation\nafter her samples tested positive for H9N2, said\nTsang, adding that the case was confirmed Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].\nOfficials were taking more samples from the\nmarket and family members, he said. Hong Kong\naggressively monitors bird flu because an\noutbreak [caaused by a highly pathogenic strain\nof different serotype - Mod CP.] in 1997 jumped\nto humans and killed 6 people. That prompted the\ngovernment to slaughter the entire poultry\npopulation of about 1.5 million birds.\n--\nJoseph P.

Officials suspected she\nwas infected by birds at the market, he said.\nH9N2 is a mild strain [of avian influenza A\nvirus], [the H5N1 strain of avian influenza A\nvirus] has caused the deaths of at least 169\npeople worldwide. [The H9N2 virus belongs to a\ndifferent serotype of avian influenza A virus and\nshould not be described as a strain of H5N1\nvirus. These 2 avian influenza A viruses should\nbe regarded as distinct viruses differing in\nvirulence, host range and transmissibility. -\nMod.CP]. \"The baby's case is not that serious,\nand there's no serious indication that there was\nhuman-to-human infection,\" Tsang said.\nHong Kong reported 2 cases of the mild strain in\n1999 and one in 2003, he said. The patients were\nchildren who all recovered, he said. The recent\ncase returned home after spending 5 days in the\nhospital, but the child was put into isolation\nafter her samples tested positive for H9N2, said\nTsang, adding that the case was confirmed Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].\nOfficials were taking more samples from the\nmarket and family members, he said. Hong Kong\naggressively monitors bird flu because an\noutbreak [caaused by a highly pathogenic strain\nof different serotype - Mod CP.] in 1997 jumped\nto humans and killed 6 people. That prompted the\ngovernment to slaughter the entire poultry\npopulation of about 1.5 million birds.\n--\nJoseph P. Dudley, Ph.D\nChief Scientist,\nEAI Corporation\nResearch Associate,\nInstitute of Arctic Biology - University of Alaska Fairbanks\nDepartment of Earth Science - University of Alaska Museum\n<fnjpd@uaf.edu>\n[This case has precedents (e.g. see ProMED-mail\nposting : Influenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human -\nChina (Hong Kong) 19990407.0566 and Influenza A\n(H9N2), bird-to-human - China (Hong Kong)\n19990805.1347). In 1999 an influenza A (H9N2)\nvirus was isolated from 2 patients (aged one and\n4 years old) by the Virus Unit of the Hong Kong\nDepartment of Health. Both girls recovered fully.\nThis was the 1st occasion that an H9N2 virus had\nbeen isolated from humans in Hong Kong, although\ninfluenza A (H9N2) viruses had been isolated from\nducks and chickens for several years previously.\nIn both instances the H9N2 virus was isolated\nfrom mildly ill young children and there was no\nfurther spread of infection. The circumstances\nsurrounding the exposure of these children to infection have not been reported.\nOther avian influenza viruses have been isolated\nfrom human patients, notably the H5N1 virus in\nHong Kong in 1997 and subsequently, and H9N2 (and\nH5N1) in 2003, and the H7N7 virus in the more\nextensive poultry outbreak in the Netherlands\nearlier in 2003. On these occasions only the H5N1\nviruses caused severe disease in humans. No\nevidence of transmission of H9N2 virus among humans was observed. -Mod.CP]\n[ProMED-mail would also like to thank rapporteurs\nMary Marshall and A-lan Banks for submitting similar articles. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\n2003\n----\nInfluenza A (H9N2), child - China (Hong Kong) (02) 20031210.3028\nInfluenza A (H9N2), child - China (Hong Kong) 20031209.3021\n2002\n----\nAvian influenza, transmission to humans: genetics 20020106.3179\n2001\n----\nAvian influenza - Japan: pet parakeets 20010422.0784\nInfluenza virus: new diagnostic reagents 20010109.0075\n1999\n----\nInfluenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human - China (Hong Kong) 19990805.1347\nInfluenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human - China (Hong Kong) 19990407.0566\nInfluenza virus vaccine (02) 19990531.0916\nInfluenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human - China (HK) (03) 19990415.0622\nInfluenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human - China (Guandong) 19990409.0587\nInfluenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human - China (HK) (02) 19990409.0586\n..................cp/mpp\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
