But he said it was\nnot influenza but another viral upper-respiratory infection which was\nbelieved to be circulating in southern Tasmania.\nThe patients who had died were high-risk patients who already had lung\ndisease before they contracted the infection. Dr Wood-Baker said many of\nthe hospital's staff had also been ill with the infection.\nIt was associated with coughing, a runny nose, sore throat, sneezing and in\nsome cases nausea and vomiting. Dr Wood-Baker said the virus seemed to have\npassed its peak in terms of the numbers infected. While it closely\nresembled influenza, Dr Wood-Baker said flu was more likely to cause\nmuscular aches and pains and high fever.\n\"There have been reports of an outbreak of influenza type A on mainland\nAustralia,\" he said.\nPeople classed as high risk should be vaccinated against influenza, he\nsaid. But they should also be aware that flu vaccination would not protect\nthem against other viral respiratory infections which often closely\nresembled flu.\nThose classed as high risk are adults aged 65 and over, adults with chronic\ndebilitating disease, anyone with suppressed immunity, residents of nursing\nhomes, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait adults aged 50 and over. In\nAustralia 4.2 million people are classed as high risk.\nThe number of people vaccinated yearly is about 2.3 million.\nThe estimated number of flu deaths yearly is 800 to 2700 although this\nfigure is thought to be under-reported.\nThe International Influenza Education Panel says the development of a new\nclass of antiviral treatment using neuraminidase inhibitors is a major\nadvance. These target the influenza virus directly by selectively\ninhibiting the viral enzyme, neuraminidase. If treatment begins in the\nfirst two days after symptoms appear, the drugs significantly cut the\nduration and severity of illness.\n[Byline: Eve Lamb]\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[The claim that the Tasmanian epidemic is not influenza, but something that\n\"closely resemble[s] influenza\", should probably at this point be taken\nwith a grain of salt, since major influenza A Sydney (H3N2) epidemics are\noccurring elsewhere in Australia and in New Zealand and (possibly) Pohnpei.\nInfluenza symptoms and signs vary widely, especially in the very young and\nthe very old, so that it is possible to have many sequential cases without\nseeing a \"classical\" clinical picture.
